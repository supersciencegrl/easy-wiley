         <title>Quantum Sensing and Imaging of Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque&#8208;Driven Spin Dynamics in the Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet Mn3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum imaging of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films is achieved using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also established, highlighting the significant potential of NV centers in diagnosing the local magnetic properties of emergent quantum materials with vanishingly small magnetic moments.








Abstract
Novel non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets with spontaneous time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking, non&#8208;trivial band topology, and unconventional transport properties have received immense research interest over the past decade due to their rich physics and enormous promise in technological applications. One of the central focuses in this emerging field is exploring the relationship between the microscopic magnetic structure and exotic material properties. Here, nanoscale imaging of both spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;induced deterministic magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers are reported. Direct evidence of the off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between the spin dynamics in Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also demonstrated by NV relaxometry measurements. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of NV centers in accessing the local information of the magnetic order and dynamics in these emergent quantum materials and suggest new opportunities for investigating the interplay between topology and magnetism in a broad range of topological magnets.

         <title>Foldable Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Electrolyte Mediation in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolyte by engineering of the molecular channels in lithiated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is presented. In situ electrolyte mediation in the COF increases charge&#8208;carrier concentration, eliminates interfacial defects, and activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner. The COF&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates reliable electrochemical cyclability in pouch cells.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high Li+ conductivity, flexibility, durability, and stability offer an attractive solution to enhance safety and energy density. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses challenges to the existing solid polymeric or ceramic electrolytes. Here, an electrolyte&#8208;mediated single&#8208;Li+&#8208;conductive covalent organic framework (COF) is presented, which represents a new category of quality solid&#8208;state Li+ conductors. In situ solidification of a tailored liquid electrolyte boosts the charge&#8208;carrier concentration in the COF channels, decouples Li+ cations from both COF walls and molecular chains, and eliminates defects by crystal soldering. Such an altered microenvironment activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner, which leads to an increase in Li+ conductivity by 100 times with a transference number of 0.85 achieved at room temperature. Moreover, the electrolyte conversion cements the ultrathin COF membrane with fortified mechanical toughness. With the COF membrane, foldable solid&#8208;state pouch cells are demonstrated.

         <title>Negative Phototransistors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Weak&#8208;Light Detection Based on 1D/2D Molecular Crystal p&#8211;n Heterojunctions and their Application in Light Encoders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive negative phototransistors are developed based on 1D/2D molecular crystal (1D/2DMC) p&#8211;n heterojunctions. This unique structure utilizes photogenerated holes of p&#8208;type 1DMCs to dope electron carriers in n&#8208;type 2DMC channels under UV illumination, achieving complete depletion of the channel current. The negative phototransistor exhibits superior performance parameters, accurately controllable threshold voltage by light, and ultrasensitive detection of weak light.








Abstract
Anomalous negative phototransistors in which the channel current decreases under light illumination hold potential to generate novel and multifunctional optoelectronic applications. Although a variety of design strategies have been developed to construct such devices, NPTs still suffer from far lower device performance compared to well&#8208;developed positive phototransistors (PPTs). In this work, a novel 1D/2D molecular crystal p&#8211;n heterojunction, in which p&#8208;type 1D molecular crystal (1DMC) arrays are embedded into n&#8208;type 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs), is developed to produce ultrasensitive NPTs. The p&#8208;type 1DMC arrays act as light&#8208;absorbing layers to induce p&#8208;doping of n&#8208;type 2DMCs through charge transfer under illumination, resulting in ineffective gate control and significant negative photoresponses. As a result, the NPTs show remarkable performances in photoresponsivity (P) (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;108) and detectivity (D*) (1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones), greatly outperforming previously reported NPTs, which are one of the highest values among all organic phototransistors. Moreover, the device exhibits intriguing characteristics undiscovered in PPTs, including precise control of the threshold voltage by controlling light signals and ultrasensitive detection of weak light. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NTPs are demonstrated as light encoders that can encrypt electrical signals by light. These findings represent a milestone for negative phototransistors, and pave the way for the development of future novel optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Photoexcitation Dynamics and Long&#8208;Lived Excitons in Strain&#8208;Engineered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient absorption in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides grown on fused silica by the laser&#8208;assisted synthesis technique exhibits very unusual decay dynamics that feature long&#8208;lived components progressively increasing with the excitation fluence. The experimental observations are interpreted as resulting from the strain&#8208;induced modification of the electronic bands and concomitant interplay of the intervalley and intravalley excitons&#8217; populations.








Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors has garnered intense research interest in tailoring the optical properties via strain&#8208;induced modifications of the electronic bands in TMDs, while its impact on the exciton dynamics remains less understood. To address this, an extensive study of transient optical absorption (TA) of both W&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based single&#8208;crystalline monolayer TMDs grown by a recently developed laser&#8208;assisted evaporation method is performed. All spectral features of the monolayers as grown on fused silica substrates exhibit appreciable redshifts relating to the existence of strain due to growth conditions. Moreover, these systems exhibit a dramatic slowing down of exciton dynamics (100s of picoseconds to few nanoseconds) with an increase in carrier densities, which strongly contrasts with the monolayers in their freestanding form as well as in comparison with more traditionally grown TMDs. The observations are related to the modifications of the electronic bands as expected from the strain and associated population of the intervalley dark excitons that can now interplay with intravalley excitations. These findings are consistent across both the Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based TMD families, providing key information about the influence of the growth conditions on the nature of optical excitations and fostering emerging optoelectronic applications of monolayer TMDs.

Abstract
Free radical therapy based on 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer PpIX) has been approved by the US FDA for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photo&#8208;inactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), we developed an uninterrupted ROS generator (URG) that converted useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly. The URG was prepared by enwrapping ALA&#8208;loaded polyamide&#8208;amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;structured AS1411. URGs realized &#8220;1O2&#8208;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted generation through &#8220;recycling waste&#8221; in two steps: i) PpIX generated 1O2 under laser irradiation; ii) the photo&#8208;inactive metabolite heme self&#8208;assembled with AS1411 to catalyze H2O2 conversion into &#8226;OH. Interestingly, the specific generation of 1O2 in mitochondria and &#8226;OH in nuclei further augmented the free radical&#8208;induced damage. We demonstrated that URG could continuously produce free radicals for 6 h post&#8208;irradiation, and showed 3.3&#8208;times more than that of non&#8208;assembly group, achieving nearly 80% regression of tumors in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;Free radical therapy based on 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer PpIX) has been approved by the US FDA for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photo-inactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA-PpIX-heme), we developed an uninterrupted ROS generator (URG) that converted useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self-assembly. The URG was prepared by enwrapping ALA-loaded polyamide-amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G-quadruplex-structured AS1411. URGs realized &#8220;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted generation through &#8220;recycling waste&#8221; in two steps: i) PpIX generated &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under laser irradiation; ii) the photo-inactive metabolite heme self-assembled with AS1411 to catalyze H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion into &#8226;OH.

         <title>A Gapped Phase in Semimetallic Td&#8208;WTe2 Induced by Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Weyl semimetal WTe2 has shown several correlated electronic behaviors, such as the quantum spin Hall effect, superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and a possible exciton insulator state, all of which can be tuned by various physical and chemical approaches. Here, we discover a new electronic phase in WTe2 induced by lithium intercalation. The new phase exhibits an increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature and its carrier density is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the carrier density of the semi&#8208;metallic Td phase, probed by in situ Hall measurements as a function of lithium intercalation. Our theoretical calculations predict the new lithiated phase to be a potential charge density wave (CDW) phase with a bandgap of &#8764; 0.14&#160;eV, in good agreement with the in situ transport data. The new phase is structurally distinct from the initial Td phase, characterized by polarization angle&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy, and large lattice distortions close to 6% are predicted in the new phase. Our finding of a new gapped phase in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semi&#8208;metal demonstrates electrochemical intercalation as a powerful tuning knob for modulating electron density and phase stability in 2D materials.

         <title>Engineering DNA&#8208;Guided Hydroxyapatite Bulk Materials with High Stiffness and Outstanding Antimicrobial Ability for Dental Inlay Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Programmable base pair interactions at the nanoscale make DNA an attractive scaffold for forming hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanostructures. However, engineering macroscale HAP mineralization guided by DNA molecules remains challenging. To overcome this issue, we developed a facile strategy for the fabrication of ultra&#8208;stiff DNA&#8211;HAP bulk composites. The electrostatic complexation of DNA and a surfactant with a quaternary ammonium salt group enabled the formation of long&#8208;range ordered scaffolds using electrospinning. The growth of one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional HAP minerals were thus realized by this DNA template at a macroscale. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared DNA&#8211;HAP composites exhibited an ultra&#8208;high Young's modulus of approximately 25&#160;GPa, which is comparable to natural HAP and superior to most artificial mineralized composites. Furthermore, a new type of dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial properties was developed using the stiff DNA&#8211;HAP. The encapsulated quaternary ammonium group within the dense HAP endowed the composite with long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial activity. Therefore, this new type of super&#8208;stiff biomaterial holds great potential for oral prosthetic applications.

         <title>Boosting H2 Production from BiVO4 Photoelectrochemical Biomass Fuel Cell by the Construction of a Bridge for Charge and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Utilizing photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile organic wastes oxidation has been regarded as an effective method to improve the H2 production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels can't be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO4 PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO4, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H2. Remarkably, under AM 1.5 G illumination, the optimal nano&#8208;porous BiVO4 photoanode exhibits the high current density of 13.54&#160;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H2 production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H2 production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly 3&#8208;D Penetrating Nanonetwork for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of wearable technology can significantly benefit from electronic displays fabricated using intrinsically stretchable (is&#8208;) materials. Typically, an improvement in the stretchability of conventional light&#8208;emitting polymers is accompanied by a decrease in charge transportability, thus resulting in a significant decrease in device efficiency. In this study, we developed a self&#8208;assembly 3&#8208;D penetrating nanonetwork to achieve increased stretchability and mobility simultaneously, based on the polymers high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The mobility of L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN increased by 5&#8211;6 times and the stretchability increased from 20% (pristine L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV film) to 100%. We observed a high current efficiency (CE) of 8.13&#160;cd A&#8208;1 in polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated using 40% stretched L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN. Furthermore, using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE) based is&#8208; electron injection layer of Zn&#8208;PEIE&#8208;pBphen&#8208;TR, we realized an is&#8208;PLED with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 6.5&#160;V and a high CE of 2.35&#160;cd A&#8208;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using self&#8208;assembly 3&#8208;D penetrating nanonetwork for the fabrication of is&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>Prediction and Design of Nanozymes Using Explainable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme-like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It was identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme-like activity. Here we demonstrated a data-driven approach that utilized machine learning algorithms to understand particle-property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme-like activity exhibited by nanozymes. High consistency between predicted outputs and the observations was confirmed by accuracy (90.6%) and R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (up to 0.80). Furthermore, sensitive analysis of the models revealed the central roles of transition metals in determining nanozyme activity. As an example, the models were successfully applied to predict or design desirable nanozymes by uncovering the hidden relationship between different periods of transition metals and their enzyme-like performance. This study offers a promising strategy to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity and demonstrates the potential of machine learning within the field of material science.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Ultrafast, Durable, and High&#8208;Loading Polymer Anode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cheap, fast (100 A g&#8722;1), stable (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), and high&#8208;loading (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) polymer anode is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte, surpassing the Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal has shown promise as an anode material for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet is challenged by dendritic growth and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, an ultrafast, stable, and high&#8208;loading polymer anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors (ZIBs and ZICs) is developed by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte. The anode polymer is rationally prepared to have a suitable electronic structure and a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, whereas the electrolyte is manufactured based on the superiority of triflate anions over sulfate anions, as analyzed and confirmed via experiments and simulations. This dual engineering results in an optimal polymer anode with a low discharge potential, near&#8208;theoretical capacity, ultrahigh&#8208;loading capability (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), ultrafast rate (100 A g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (one million cycles). Its mechanism involves reversible Zn2+/proton co&#8208;storage at the carbonyl site. When the polymer anode is coupled with cathodes for both ZIB and ZIC applications, the devices demonstrate ultrahigh power densities and ultralong lifespans, far surpassing those of corresponding Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Local coordination regulation through tuning atomic scale cavities of Pd metallene toward efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates overtakes significant role in rational design of high&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Long serving as a reliable strategy to tune geometric structure of nanomaterials, defect engineering enjoys great ability to adjust the coordination environment of catalytic active sites, which enables dominant regulation of adsorption energy and kinetics of ORR catalysis. However, limited to controllable nanocrystals fabrication, inducing uniformly&#8208;dispersed high&#8208;coordinated defects into ultrathin 2D nanosheets remains challenging. Herein, we first propose atomic scale cavities (ASCs) as a new kind of high&#8208;coordinated active site and succeed in introducing them into suprathin Pd (111)&#8208;exposed metallene. Due to its atomic concave architecture, leading to elevated CN and moderately downshifted d&#8208;band center, the as&#8208;made Pd metallene with ASCs (c&#8208;Pd M) exhibits excellent ORR performances with mass activity of 2.76 A mgPd&#8211;1 at 0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and half&#8208;wave potential as high as 0.947&#160;V, which is 18.9 (2.7) times higher and 104 (46) mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C (Pd metallene without ASCs). Besides, the durability of c&#8208;Pd M exceeds its commercial counterpart with approximately 30% loss after 5000 cycles. This work enlightens new&#8208;style mentality of designing fancy active sites toward efficient ORR electrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates overtakes significant role in rational design of high-efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts.

However, limited to controllable nanocrystals fabrication, inducing uniformly-dispersed high-coordinated defects into ultrathin 2D nanosheets remains challenging. Herein, we first propose atomic scale cavities (ASCs) as a new kind of high-coordinated active site and succeed in introducing them into suprathin Pd (111)-exposed metallene. Due to its atomic concave architecture, leading to elevated CN and moderately downshifted d-band center, the as-made Pd metallene with ASCs (&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-Pd M) exhibits excellent ORR performances with mass activity of 2.76 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and half-wave potential as high as 0.947&#160;V, which is 18.9 (2.7) times higher and 104 (46) mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C (Pd metallene without ASCs).

         <title>Structural Dynamics and Tunability for Colloidal Tin Halide Perovskite Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are highly attractive for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics because they are easy to synthesize and offer great compositional and morphological tunability. However, the replacement of lead by tin for sustainability reasons is hampered by the unstable nature of Sn2+ oxidation state and by an insufficient understanding of the chemical processes involved in the synthesis. Here we demonstrate an optimized synthetic route to obtain stable, tunable, and monodisperse CsSnI3 nanocrystals, exhibiting well defined excitonic peaks. Similar to lead halide perovskites, we prepare these nanocrystals by combining a precursor mixture of SnI2, oleylamine and oleic acid, with a Cs&#8208;oleate precursor. Among the products, nanocrystals with 10&#160;nm lateral size in the &#947;&#8208;orthorhombic phase prove to be the most stable. To achieve such stability, an excess of precursor SnI2 as well as sub&#8208;stoichiometric Sn:ligand ratios are key. Structural, compositional and optical investigations complemented by first&#8208;principle DFT calculations confirm that nanocrystal nucleation and growth follow the formation of (R&#8208;NH3+)2SnI4 nanosheets with R = C18H35. Under specific synthetic conditions, stable mixtures of 3D nanocrystals CsSnI3 and 2D nanosheets (Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (R&#8208;NH3+)2Csn&#8208;1SnnI3n+1 with n&gt;1) are obtained. These results set a path to exploiting the high potential of Sn halide perovskite nanocrystals for opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>In Situ Fabrication of Porous CoxP Hierarchical Nanostructures on Carbon Fiber Cloth with Exceptional Performance for Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;valence strategy and construction of an &#8220;all in one&#8221; electrode is employed to prepare flexible carbon fiber cloth supported porous CoxP hierarchical structures comprising nanoneedles and nanosheets. The as&#8208;prepared CoxP@CFC electrode exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;storage performance with a high reversible capacity (814&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate performance (279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and record ultralong cycling life (almost 100%&#160;capacity retention after 9000&#160;cycles).








Abstract
Superior high&#8208;rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium&#8208;ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record&#8208;high capacity of 279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.

         <title>Automated Laser&#8208;Transfer Synthesis of High&#8208;Density Microarrays for Infectious Disease Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated laser&#8208;based synthesis machine is presented, combining laser&#8208;induced forward transfer and robotics to perform parallel chemistry in the microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. By developing an optimization pipeline, peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences can be synthesized in high yield to study the antibody responses in infectious disease patients.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) is a rapid laser&#8208;patterning technique for high&#8208;throughput combinatorial synthesis directly on glass slides. A lack of automation and precision limits LIFT applications to simple proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept syntheses of fewer than 100 compounds. Here, an automated synthesis instrument is reported that combines laser transfer and robotics for parallel synthesis in a microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. An optimized pipeline for amide bond formation is the basis for preparing complex peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences in high yield with high reproducibility. The resulting peptide arrays are of higher quality than commercial peptide arrays. More than 4800 15&#8208;residue peptides resembling the entire Ebola virus proteome on a microarray are synthesized to study the antibody response of an Ebola virus infection survivor. Known and unknown epitopes that serve now as a basis for Ebola diagnostic development are identified. The versatility and precision of the synthesizer is demonstrated by in situ synthesis of fluorescent molecules via Schiff base reaction and multi&#8208;step patterning of precisely definable amounts of fluorophores. This automated laser transfer synthesis approach opens new avenues for high&#8208;throughput chemical synthesis and biological screening.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Electrochemical Transistors Based on Self&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polyelectrolytes for Reconfigurable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With PCPDTBT&#8208;SO3K (CPE&#8208;K) as the active material, dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors that operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode are demonstrated. Mode switching is done via changing the polarity of the applied voltages, enabled by the dual&#8208;mode absorption capabilities of CPE&#8208;K. These transistors are used to create reconfigurable logic gates, paving the way for the use of organic electrochemical transistors in emerging reconfigurable electronics.








Abstract
Reconfigurable organic logic devices are promising candidates for next generations of efficient computing systems and adaptive electronics. Ideally, such devices would be of simple structure and design, be power efficient, and compatible with high&#8208;throughput microfabrication techniques. This work reports an organic reconfigurable logic gate based on novel dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which employ a self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte as the active material, which then allows the transistors to operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode. Furthermore, mode switching is accomplished by simply altering the polarity of the applied gate and drain voltages, which can be done on the fly. In contrast, achieving similar mode&#8208;switching functionality with other organic transistors typically requires complex molecular design or multi&#8208;device engineering. It in shown that dual&#8208;mode functionality is enabled by the concurrent existence of anion doping and cation dedoping of the films. A device physics model that accurately describes the behavior of these transistors is developed. Finally, the utility of these dual&#8208;mode transistors for implementing reconfigurable logic by fabricating a logic gate that may be switched between logic gates AND to NOR, and OR to NAND on the fly is demonstrated.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Scale Approach for Modeling the Optical Response of Molecular Materials Inside Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical cavities filled with molecular materials are under intense experimental investigation. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging because physics, chemistry, and material science are intertwined together across spatial scales ranging from &#229;ngstr&#246;ms to millimeters. A new methodology uses quantum&#8208;chemistry calculations to predict the optical response of devices such as cavities filled with molecular materials.








Abstract
The recent fabrication advances in nanoscience and molecular materials point toward a new era where material properties are tailored in silico for target applications. To fully realize this potential, accurate and computationally efficient theoretical models are needed for: a) the computer&#8208;aided design and optimization of new materials before their fabrication; and b) the accurate interpretation of experiments. The development of such theoretical models is a challenging multi&#8208;disciplinary problem where physics, chemistry, and material science are intertwined across spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the device level, that is, from &#229;ngstr&#246;ms to millimeters. In photonic applications, molecular materials are often placed inside optical cavities. Together with the sought&#8208;after enhancement of light&#8208;molecule interactions, the cavities bring additional complexity to the modeling of such devices. Here, a multi&#8208;scale approach that, starting from ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations, can compute the electromagnetic response of macroscopic devices such as cavities containing molecular materials is presented. Molecular time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory calculations are combined with the efficient transition matrix based solution of Maxwell's equations. Some of the capabilities of the approach are demonstrated by simulating surface metal&#8208;organic frameworks &#8208;in&#8208;cavity and J&#8208;aggregates&#8208;in&#8208;cavity systems that have been recently investigated experimentally, and providing a refined understanding of the experimental results.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polymer Nanoparticles for Efficient Delivery of Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein With or Without Donor DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). In this work, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles, capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (NHEJ&#8208;NP) or together with donor DNA (HDR&#8208;NP), are developed for gene editing in mouse liver, lung, or skeletal muscle.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9) may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). However, clinical translation of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ&#8208;NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR&#8208;NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm) are reported. Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ&#8208;NP induces efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR&#8208;NP also leads to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ&#8208;NP and HDR&#8208;NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.

         <title>Production of Large&#8208;Area Nucleus&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene&#8208;Mesh Metamaterials with Zigzag Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable production approach of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials with zigzag edges is presented. The isotopic labeling approach and the high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization nucleus etching method are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films on a Cu(111) substrate without chemical contamination and physical contact. The findings of this study provide insights for producing resist&#8208;free high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional metamaterial films.








Abstract
In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices.

&lt;p&gt;A controllable production approach of wafer-scale high-quality single-crystal nucleus-free graphene-mesh metamaterials with zigzag edges is presented. The isotopic labeling approach and the high-voltage localized-space air-ionization nucleus etching method are used to fabricate graphene-mesh metamaterial films on a Cu(111) substrate without chemical contamination and physical contact. The findings of this study provide insights for producing resist-free high-quality low-dimensional metamaterial films.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene-mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene-mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices. Herein, the controlled production of wafer-scale high-quality single-crystal nucleus-free graphene-mesh metamaterial films with zigzag edges is demonstrated. The &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-isotopic labeling graphene-growth approach, large-area Raman mapping techniques, and a uniquely designed high-voltage localized-space air-ionization etching method are utilized to directly remove the graphene nuclei. Subsequently, a hydrogen-assisted anisotropic etching process is employed for transforming irregular edges into zigzag edges within the hexagonal-shaped holes, producing a large-scale single-crystal high-quality graphene-mesh metamaterial film on a Cu(111) substrate. The carrier mobilities of the fabricated field-effect transistors on the as-produced films are measured. The findings of this study enable the large-scale production of high-quality low-dimensional graphene-mesh metamaterials and provide insights for the application of integrated circuits based on graphene and other 2D metamaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Studying Complex Evolution of Hyperelastic Materials Under External Field Stimuli Use Artificial Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Features in Small&#8208;Scale Dataset</title>

Abstract
Deep learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive&#8208;scale experimental data or open&#8208;source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low&#8208;dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high&#8208;precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (CBLSTM) model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability has been designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.

         <title>Engineered Nanoerythrocyte Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microglial polarization is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti&#8208;inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half&#8208;life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, we developed an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 translocation. Moreover, anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforce the anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. In the middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis was achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti&#8208;inflammatory factors, reduced BBB permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocyte as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.

         <title>Modulation of the Crosstalk Between Schwann Cells and Macrophages for Nerve Regeneration: A Therapeutic Strategy Based on Multifunctional Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is currently recognized as one of the most significant public health issues and affects the general well&#8208;being of millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advances in nerve tissue engineering, nerve repair still cannot guarantee complete functional recovery. In the present study, we adopted an innovative approach to establish a multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted MiDs, which could integrate the powerful programmability, permeability, and structural stability of tFNAs, with the nerve regeneration potential of microRNA&#8208;22 to enhance the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages for more effective functional rehabilitation of peripheral nerves. Relevant results demonstrated that MiDs could amplify the ability of SCs to recruit macrophages and facilitate their polarization into the pro&#8208;healing M2 phenotype to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment. Furthermore, MiDs could initiate the adaptive intracellular reprogramming of SCs within a short period to further promote axon regeneration and remyelination. MiDs represent a new possibility for enhancing nerve repair and may have critical clinical applications in the future.

Abstract
Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) has been identified as a key driver for epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI) resistance. Inhibition of YAP expression could be a potential therapeutic option for treating non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, we propose a nano&#8208;cocktail therapeutic strategy by employing an amphiphilic and block dendritic polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted co&#8208;delivery of EGFR&#8208;TKI gefitinib (Gef) and YAP&#8208;siRNA to achieve a targeted drug/gene/photodynamic therapy. The resulting NPs are effectively internalized into Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC cells, successfully escape from late endosomes/lysosomes, and responsively release Gef and YAP&#8208;siRNA in an intracellular reductive environment. They preferentially accumulate at the tumor site after intravenous injection in both cell line&#8208;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models of Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC, resulting in potent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy without distinct toxicity after laser irradiation. Mechanism studies reveal that the cocktail therapy could block the EGFR signaling pathway with Gef, inhibit activation of the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA and induce tumor cell apoptosis through photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, this combination nanomedicine could sensitize PDT and impair glycolysis by down&#8208;regulating HIF&#8208;1&#945;. These results suggest that this stimuli&#8208;responsive dendritic polymer&#8208;based nano&#8208;cocktail therapy may provide a promising approach for the treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI resistant NSCLC.

         <title>Recent Advances in Intelligent Wearable Medical Devices Integrating Biosensing and Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) are intensively investigated for personalized healthcare and smart therapy. Recent advances in wearable biosensing&#8722;delivery integrated therapeutic systems are summarized, with an emphasis on functional materials, responsiveness models, working mechanisms, and practices, to provide deep insights into the design, fabrication, and bioapplication of IWMDs.








Abstract
The primary roles of precision medicine are to perform real&#8208;time examination, administer on&#8208;demand medication, and apply instruments continuously. However, most current therapeutic systems implement these processes separately, leading to treatment interruption and limited recovery in patients. Personalized healthcare and smart medical treatment have greatly promoted research on and development of biosensing and drug&#8208;delivery integrated systems, with intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) as typical systems, which have received increasing attention because of their non&#8208;invasive and customizable nature. Here, the latest progress in research on IWMDs is reviewed, including their mechanisms of integrating biosensing and on&#8208;demand drug delivery. The current challenges and future development directions of IWMDs are also discussed.

Personalized healthcare and smart medical treatment have greatly promoted research on and development of biosensing and drug-delivery integrated systems, with intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) as typical systems, which have received increasing attention because of their non-invasive and customizable nature. Here, the latest progress in research on IWMDs is reviewed, including their mechanisms of integrating biosensing and on-demand drug delivery. The current challenges and future development directions of IWMDs are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Ink Writing: A 3D Printing Technology for Diverse Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comprehensive review comprises recent development in direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) 3D printing technology for the development of 3D structures from various materials such as polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and multimaterials. The work describes the fundamentals and engineering of ink rheology required for DIW. In addition, a multitude of applications, current challenges, and future prospects of the technology are discussed.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to drive technological development as a sustainable, flexible, and customizable manufacturing scheme. Among the various AM techniques, direct ink writing (DIW) has emerged as the most versatile 3D printing technique for the broadest range of materials. DIW allows printing of practically any material, as long as the precursor ink can be engineered to demonstrate appropriate rheological behavior. This technique acts as a unique pathway to introduce design freedom, multifunctionality, and stability simultaneously into its printed structures. Here, a comprehensive review of DIW of complex 3D structures from various materials, including polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and their combinations through multimaterial printing is presented. The review begins with an overview of the fundamentals of ink rheology, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various methods to tailor the ink for DIW of different classes of materials. Then, the diverse applications of DIW ranging from electronics to food to biomedical industries are discussed. Finally, the current challenges and limitations of this technique are highlighted, followed by its prospects as&#160;a&#160;guideline toward possible futuristic innovations.

         <title>Rapidly and Repeatedly Reprogrammable Liquid Crystalline Elastomer via a Shape Memory Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;phase LCE network with a crystalline transition temperature above the liquid crystalline transition temperature is designed. The crystalline phase serves as a built&#8208;in physical &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; via its shape memory function. Consequently, the actuation behaviors of the liquid crystal network can be conveniently and repeatedly programmed/reprogrammed within 10 s.








Abstract
Realization of muscle&#8208;like actuation for a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) requires mesogen alignment, which is typically achieved/fixed chemically during the synthesis. Post&#8208;synthesis regulation of the alignment in a convenient and repeatable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Here, a dual&#8208;phase LCE network is designed and synthesized with a crystalline melting transition above a liquid crystalline transition. The crystalline phase can serve as an &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; to fix any mechanical deformation via a shape memory mechanism, leading to corresponding mesogen alignment in the liquid crystalline phase. The alignment can be erased by melting, which can be the starting point for reprogramming. This strategy that relies on a physical shape memory transition for mesogen alignment permits repeated reprogramming in a timescale of seconds, in stark contrast to typical methods. It further leads to unusual versatility in designing 3D printed LCE with unlimited programmable actuation modes.

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of High&#8208;Yield Red Fluorescent Carbon Dots with Ultra&#8208;Narrow Emission by Controlled O/N Elements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;narrow emission and high yield red fluorescent carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) are prepared using o&#8208;phenylenediamine through hydrothermal method by increasing the degree of dehydration and carbonization and the conversion rate of polymerization, respectively. The emission and synthesis mechanisms are discussed. Furthermore, a logarithmic relationship on the aggregation&#8208;induced emission of r&#8208;CDs and a highly ordered graphite nitrate&#8208;like structure are found.








Abstract
Red fluorescent carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) with narrow dual emissions (600&#160;nm and 658&#8211;683&#160;nm, full width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 20&#160;nm and 30&#160;nm), fluorescence quantum yield of 41.0%, and yield of 83.3% are prepared by hydrothermal method using o&#8208;phenylenediamine as precursor and inorganic oxidant as yield enhancer, and they have graphite nitrate&#8208;like structures. The long&#8208;wavelength side emission is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). A logarithmic relationship between the AIE wavelength (y) and the concentration (x) (y&#160;=&#160;8.853ln(x)&#160;+&#160;688.53, R&#160;=&#160;0.998) is found. This regularity and the high monochromaticity of AIE are related to the existence of highly ordered structures proved by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Its intrinsic emission (FWHM: 20&#160;nm) is the narrowest among the r&#8208;CDs prepared by hydrothermal method. The reason is that the decrease of oxygen content makes the FWHMs become narrow, and the decrease of the pyridine nitrogen content and the increase of pyrrole nitrogen content make them narrower further. The Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra and control experiment prove that oxidative polymerization is a necessary preparation step. The linear relationship between the amount of the oxidant and the CDs yield indicates that the yield can be increased only by increasing the conversion rate of the polymerization process.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy and Stable Subfreezing Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Batteries with Selective and Pseudocapacitive Zn&#8208;Ion Insertion in MnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable cycling of experimentally verified unit level 148 Wh kg&#8722;1 aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries is reported at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This battery utilizes antifreezing aqueous Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte, and has selective Zn&#8208;ion insertion instead of the problematic proton insertion at subfreezing temperatures. The selective Zn&#8208;ion insertion is primarily pseudocapacitive, and delivers outstanding rate performance with 80% capacity retention for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
One major challenge of aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries for practical applications is their unacceptable performance below freezing temperatures. Here the use of simple Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes is described for all&#8208;weather Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries even down to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. The symmetric, bulky ClO4&#8722; anion effectively disrupts hydrogen bonds between water molecules and provides intrinsic ion diffusion even while frozen, and enables &#8776;260 mAh g&#8722;1 on MnO2 cathodes at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C . It is identified that subfreezing cycling shifts the reaction mechanism on the MnO2 cathode from unstable H+ insertion to predominantly pseudocapacitive Zn2+ insertion, which converts MnO2 nanofibers into complicated zincated MnOx that are largely disordered and appeared as crumpled paper sheets. The Zn2+ insertion at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is faster and much more stable than at 20&#160;&#176;C, and delivers &#8776;80% capacity retention for 1000 cycles without Mn2+ additives. In addition, simple Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte also enables a nearly fully reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C with &#8776;98% Coulombic efficiency. Zn&#8211;MnO2 prototypes with an experimentally verified unit energy density of 148 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive ratio of 1.5 and an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio of 2.0 are further demonstrated.

Abstract
Uneven distribution of electric fields at electrolyte&#8208;anode interface and associated Zn dendrite growth is one of the most critical barriers that limit the lifespan of aqueous zinc ion battery (AZIB). Herein, we develop new&#8208;type Zn&#8208;A&#8208;O (A = Si, Ti) interface layers with thin and uniform thickness, porosity, and hydrophilicity properties to realize homogeneous and smooth Zn plating. For ZnSiO3 nanosheet arrays on Zn foil (Zn@ZSO), their formation follows an &#8220;etching&#8208;nucleation&#8208;growth&#8221; mechanism that confirmed by well&#8208;designed Zn island based identical&#8208;location microscopy method, and the geometric area of which is up to 1000 cm2 in one&#8208;pot synthesis based on low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemical method. Guided by the structural advantages of the ZSO layer, Zn2+ flux gets equalized. Besides ultra&#8208;low polarization, the lifespans of symmetric cells and full cells coupled with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading K0.27MnO2&#183;0.54H2O (KMO, 8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathode, have increased by 3&#8211;7 times with Zn@ZSO anode. Moreover, the large&#8208;scale preparation Zn@ZSO foil contributes to 0.5 Ah multi&#8208;layer pouch cell with high performance, further confirming its prospect for practical application.

         <title>CsPbCl3&#8208;cluster&#8208;widened bandgap and inhibited phase segregation in a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite and its application to NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells</title>

Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is an attractive hole&#8208;transport material for efficient and stable p&#8208;i&#8208;n metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, an undesirable redox reaction occurs at the NiOx/perovskite interface, which results in a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), instability, and phase separation of the NiOx&#8208;based wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (Br&gt;20%). In order to simultaneously address the abovementioned phase separation problem and redox chemistry at the perovskite/NiOx interface, we widened the bandgap from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding inorganic CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters (3 mol%) to the Cs22Br15 perovskite precursor solution. Moreover, adding extra 2 mol% CsCl enriched the NiOx/perovskite interface with Cl, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface, while controlling the Br content to within 15% improved the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single&#8208;junction p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSC increased from 17.82% to 19.76%, which led to the fabrication of highly efficient monolithic p&#8208;i&#8208;n type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCEs of up to 27.26% (certified PCE: 27.15%). We also applied the perovskite to an n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell to deliver a VOC of 1.93 V and a final efficiency of 25.5%. These findings provide critical insight into the fabrication of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Electron&#8208;Driving Observations of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction on Co&#8208;doped CeO2/Crystalline Carbon Nitride S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions</title>

Abstract
Photoexcited dynamic modulation, maximizing the effective utilization of photoinduced electron&#8208;hole pairs, dominates the multiple electrons&#8208;involved reduction pathways for terminal CH4 evolution during CO2 photoreduction. Yet, the site&#8208;specific regulation of directional charge transfer by modification of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has seldom been discussed. Herein, we report an atomic&#8208;level tailoring strategy by anchoring single&#8208;atomic Co into CeO2 co&#8208;catalyst rather than carbon nitride supports, which can selectively favor CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction. Through in situ dynamic tracking investigations, we identify that surface Co&#8208;embedded bimetallic CeCo conjunction is the key feature driving a strong interconnection of dynamical charge states through S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. We demonstrate that the Co&#8208;embedded modification into CeO2 co&#8208;catalysts play a critical effect on directional charge control, accelerating electron driving from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, which thereby promotes electronic transferability for electrons&#8208;involved CH4 formation. As a result, an unprecedented CH4 yield (181.7&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1) is obtained with a high turnover number (411.4) through a fully gas&#8208;solid reaction, demonstrating its potential towards targeted CH4 formation without adding any sacrificial agent.

         <title>Submolecular Tuning of Ligand Size and Spacing for Dynamic Macrophage Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell adhesion occurs when integrin recognizes and binds to Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp (RGD) ligands present in fibronectin. Herein, submolecular ligand size and spacing is tuned via the template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles for dynamic macrophage modulation. To tune liganded GNP size and spacing from 3 to 20&#160;nm, in situ localized assembly of gold nanoparticle (GNP) arrays on nano&#8208;magnetite templates are engineered. 3&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands stimulate the binding of integrin that mediates macrophage adhesion&#8208;assisted pro&#8208;regenerative polarization as compared to the 20&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands, which can be dynamically anchored to the substrate for stabilizing integrin binding and facilitating dynamic macrophage adhesion. Increasing the ligand size from 7 to 20&#160;nm only slightly promotes macrophage adhesion, not observed with 13&#160;nm&#8208;sized ligands. Increasing the ligand spacing from 3 to 17&#160;nm significantly hinders macrophage adhesion that induces inflammatory polarization. Submolecular tuning of ligand spacing can dominantly modulate host macrophages.

         <title>Optimally&#8208;Tailored Spinodal Architected Materials for Multiscale Design and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy directly target stiffness and lightweightness in optimal design and indirectly promote biological functions via microscale porosity and randomness. Their functional representation is also exploited for scalable multiscale manufacturing. As an example, a multiscale craniofacial implant is designed to support masticatory forces and microscale porosity is tailored upon manufacturing to promote bone regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. By locally varying the spinodal class, orientation, and porosity during topology optimization, a large portion of the anisotropic material space is exploited such that material is efficiently placed along principal stress trajectories at the microscale. Additionally, the bicontinuous, nonperiodic, unstructured, and stochastic nature of spinodal architected materials promotes mechanical and biological functions not explicitly considered during optimization (e.g., insensitivity to imperfections, fluid transport conduits). Furthermore, in contrast to laminated composites or periodic, structured architected materials (e.g., lattices), the functional representation of spinodal architected materials leads to multiscale, optimized designs with clear physical interpretation that can be manufactured directly, without special treatment at spinodal transitions. Physical models of the optimized, spinodal&#8208;embedded parts are manufactured using a scalable, voxel&#8208;based strategy to communicate with a masked stereolithography (m&#8208;SLA) 3D&#160;printer.

         <title>Crosstalk&#8208;Free, High&#8208;Resolution Pressure Sensor Arrays Enabled by High&#8208;Throughput Laser Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution flexible pressure sensor array with individual sensing pixels and their interconnects is sequentially defined by laser&#8208;induced graphenization and ablation to minimize crosstalk interferences. The new geometry of the interconnects induces a remarkable reduction of the crosstalk coefficient and enables a record high resolution of the sensor array.








Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high spatial resolution and low crosstalk interference has been a fundamental challenge for flexible pressure sensor arrays. Here the authors present a high&#8208;resolution flexible pressure sensor array fabricated through a two&#8208;step laser manufacturing process, where individual sensing pixels and their interconnects are sequentially defined by laser&#8208;induced graphenization and ablation to minimize crosstalk interferences. The geometry of the interconnects is optimized through theoretical modeling and experimental validation. Characterization results show that the new device design induces a remarkable reduction of the crosstalk coefficient, from &#8722;8.21 to &#8722;43.63 dB, of the 0.7 mm&#8208;resolution sensor arrays, and the crosstalk suppression is particularly beneficial for application scenarios involving pressure sensing on soft surfaces (e.g., human skin and organs). Applications of the sensor array in tactile pattern recognition and minimally&#8208;invasive cancer surgery are demonstrated.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a gesture recognition wristband for virtual reality application with excellent prediction accuracy and good wearing experience is manufactured. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;wear wristband can translate and broadcast sign language words in real time with a prediction accuracy over 92.6%. And the gesture recognition wristband can also be designed as a special command input device.








Abstract
Virtual reality is a brand&#8208;new technology that can be applied extensively. To realize virtual reality, certain types of human&#8211;computer interaction equipment are necessary. Existing virtual reality technologies often rely on cameras, data gloves, game pads, and other equipment. These equipment are either bulky, inconvenient to carry and use, or expensive to popularize. Therefore, the development of a convenient and low&#8208;cost high&#8208;precision human&#8211;computer interaction device can contribute positively to the development of virtual reality technology. In this study, a gesture recognition wristband that can realize a full keyboard and multicommand input is developed. The wristband is convenient to wear, low in cost, and does not affect other daily operations of the hand. This wristband is based on physiological anatomy as well as aided by active sensor and machine learning technology; it can achieve a maximum accuracy of 92.6% in recognizing 26 letters. This wristband offers broad application prospects in the fields of gesture command recognition, assistive devices for the disabled, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Exchange Bias in Molecule/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructures via Spinterface Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinterface effects are demonstrated in a hybrid van der Waals heterostructure composed of a CoPc film interfaced with a layered ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The interface interactions introduce an exchange bias field in Fe3GeTe2, which is among the strongest reported for layered magnetic materials. The results demonstrate the potential of molecular functionalization for tailoring the magnetic properties of layered materials.








Abstract
The exfoliation of layered magnetic materials generates atomically thin flakes characterized by an ultrahigh surface sensitivity, which makes their magnetic properties tunable via external stimuli, such as electrostatic gating and proximity effects. Another powerful approach to engineer magnetic materials is molecular functionalization, generating hybrid interfaces with tailored magnetic interactions, called spinterfaces. However, spinterface effects have not yet been explored on layered magnetic materials. Here, the emergence of spinterface effects is demonstrated at the interface between flakes of the prototypical layered magnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 and thin films of Co&#8208;phthalocyanine. Magnetotransport measurements show that the molecular layer induces a magnetic exchange bias in Fe3GeTe2, indicating that the unpaired spins in Co&#8208;phthalocyanine develop antiferromagnetic ordering and pin the magnetization reversal of Fe3GeTe2 via magnetic proximity. The effect is strongest for a Fe3GeTe2 thickness of 20 nm, for which the exchange bias field reaches &#8722;840 Oe at 10 K and is measurable up to &#8776;110 K. This value compares very favorably with previous exchange bias fields reported for Fe3GeTe2 in all&#8208;inorganic van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating the potential of molecular functionalization to tailor the magnetism of van der Waals layered materials.

         <title>An Asymmetric Hygroscopic Structure for Moisture&#8208;Driven Hygro&#8208;Ionic Electricity Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual route for moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) is proposed by an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS), which simultaneously achieves MEG and energy storage. The water&#8208;absorption triggered dual function originates from the permanently maintained wet&#8208;dry asymmetry that is formed across the AHS by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a functionalized&#8208;carbon layer.








Abstract
The interactions between moisture and materials give rise to the possibility of moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG). Current MEG materials and devices only establish this interaction during water sorption in specific configurations, and conversion is eventually ceased by saturated water uptake. This paper reports an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS) that simultaneously achieves energy harvesting and storage from moisture absorption. The AHS is constructed by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a layer of functionalized carbon. Water absorbed from the air creates wet&#8208;dry asymmetry across the AHS and hence an in&#8208;plane electric field. The asymmetry can be perpetually maintained even after saturated water absorption. The absorbed water triggers the spontaneous development of an electrical double layer (EDL) over the carbon surface, which is termed a hygro&#8208;ionic process, accounting for the capacitive properties of the AHS. A peak power density of 70 &#181;W cm&#8208;3&#160;was&#160;realized after geometry optimization. The AHS shows the ability to be recharged either by itself owing to a self&#8208;regeneration effect or via external electrical means, which allows it to serve as an energy storage device. In addition to insights into moisture&#8208;material interaction, AHSs further shows potential for electronics powering in assembled devices.

         <title>Chemical Potential Diagram Guided Rational Tuning of Electrical Properties: A Case Study of CsPbBr3 for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical results indicate that the electrical properties of CsPbBr3 can be tuned from weak n&#8208;type under the Pb&#8208;rich condition to moderate p&#8208;type under the Br&#8208;rich condition. Experimentally, a large Fermi level tunability of 1.0 eV is achieved for the CsPbBr3 films by posterior Br2 treatment. The intrinsic CsPbBr3 films are proven to lead to excellent X&#8208;ray detection performance.








Abstract
Controlling the carrier polarity and concentration underlies most electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, for the intensively studied lead halide perovskites, the doping tunability is inefficient. In this work, taking CsPbBr3 as an example, it is revealed that the coexistence of metallic Pb or CsBr3/Br2, rather than the precursor ratio, can provide Pb&#8208;rich/Br&#8208;poor or Br&#8208;rich/Pb&#8208;poor chemical conditions, enabling the tunability of electrical properties from weak n&#8208;type, intrinsic, to moderate p&#8208;type. Experimentally, under Br2&#8208;exposure treatment, a shift of the Fermi level as large as 1.00 eV is achieved, which is one of the highest value among all kinds of doping methods. The X&#8208;ray detector based on the intrinsic CsPbBr3 exhibits excellent performance, with a negligible dark&#8208;current drift of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8722;4 nA cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1, a low detection limit of 103.6 nGyair s&#8722;1, and a high sensitivity of 9085 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This work provides a critical understanding and guidance for tuning the electrical properties of lead halide perovskites, which establishes good foundations for achieving intrinsic perovskite semiconductors and also constructing potential homojunction devices.

The intrinsic CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films are proven to lead to excellent X-ray detection performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the carrier polarity and concentration underlies most electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, for the intensively studied lead halide perovskites, the doping tunability is inefficient. In this work, taking CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as an example, it is revealed that the coexistence of metallic Pb or CsBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than the precursor ratio, can provide Pb-rich/Br-poor or Br-rich/Pb-poor chemical conditions, enabling the tunability of electrical properties from weak n-type, intrinsic, to moderate p-type. Experimentally, under Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-exposure treatment, a shift of the Fermi level as large as 1.00 eV is achieved, which is one of the highest value among all kinds of doping methods. The X-ray detector based on the intrinsic CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent performance, with a negligible dark-current drift of 7.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; nA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a low detection limit of 103.6 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a high sensitivity of 9085 &#956;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a critical understanding and guidance for tuning the electrical properties of lead halide perovskites, which establishes good foundations for achieving intrinsic perovskite semiconductors and also constructing potential homojunction devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intracellular Mechanical Drugs Induce Cell&#8208;Cycle Altering and Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;based chips, larger than cell mitotic diameter, are established in this work as intracellular mechanical drugs. Once internalized, these tools disrupt the correct development of the cell, inducing mechanical affection of the cell cycle and cell death. The intracellular mechanical drugs allow the study of how intracellular mechanical cues define cell function with relevance to fundamental cell mechanics and nanomedicine.








Abstract
Current advances in materials science have demonstrated that extracellular mechanical cues can define cell function and cell fate. However, a fundamental understanding of the manner in which intracellular mechanical cues affect cell mechanics remains elusive. How intracellular mechanical hindrance, reinforcement, and supports interfere with the cell cycle and promote cell death is described here. Reproducible devices with highly controlled size, shape, and with a broad range of stiffness are internalized in HeLa cells. Once inside, they induce characteristic cell&#8208;cycle deviations and promote cell death. Device shape and stiffness are the dominant determinants of mechanical impairment. Device structural support to the cell membrane and centering during mitosis maximize their effects, preventing spindle centering, and correct chromosome alignment. Nanodevices reveal that the spindle generates forces larger than 114 nN which overcomes intracellular confinement by relocating the device to a less damaging position. By using intracellular mechanical drugs, this work provides a foundation to defining the role of intracellular constraints on cell function and fate, with relevance to fundamental cell mechanics and nanomedicine.

         <title>Boosting Energy Efficiency and Stability of Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries via Synergy between Ru Atom Clusters and Single&#8208;Atom Ru&#8211;N4 sites in the Electrocatalyst Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst comprising ruthenium (Ru) atomic clusters and single&#8208;atom sites (RuAC+SA) is fabricated for boosting the energy efficiency and stability of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. The improved CO2 reduction and evolution reaction kinetics stem from the unique electronic synergy between the adjacent Ru atomic cluster assemblies and Ru&#8211;N4 active sites.








Abstract
The Li&#8211;CO2 battery is a novel strategy for CO2 capture and energy&#8208;storage applications. However, the sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions cause large overpotential and poor cycling performance. Herein, a new catalyst containing well&#8208;defined ruthenium (Ru) atomic clusters (RuAC) and single&#8208;atom Ru&#8211;N4 (RuSA) composite sites on carbon nanobox substrate (RuAC+SA@NCB) (NCB = nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanobox) is fabricated by utilizing the different complexation effects between the Ru cation and the amine group (&#63743;NH2) on carbon quantum dots or nitrogen moieties on NCB. Systematic experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the vital role of electronic synergy between RuAC and Ru&#8211;N4 in improving the electrocatalytic activity toward the CO2 evolution reaction (CO2ER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The electronic properties of the Ru&#8211;N4 sites are essentially modulated by the adjacent RuAC species, which optimizes the interactions with key reaction intermediates thereby reducing the energy barriers in the rate&#8208;determining steps of the CO2RR and CO2ER. Remarkably, the RuAC+SA@NCB&#8208;based cell displays unprecedented overpotentials as low as 1.65&#160;and 1.86&#160;V at ultrahigh rates of 1&#160;and 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and twofold cycling lifespan than the baselines. The findings provide a novel strategy to construct catalysts with composite active sites comprising multiple atom assemblies for high&#8208;performance metal&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Dative Epitaxy of Commensurate Monocrystalline Covalent van der Waals Moir&#233; Supercrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dative epitaxy represents the Goldilocks&#8217; principle of epitaxy: it takes advantage of dative bonding for fixing the atomic registry and crystal orientation, while ensuring the full flexibility of van der Waals epitaxy. The globally commensurate Cr5Te8/WSe2 moir&#233; supercrystal is distinctly different from conventional incommensurate moir&#233; superlattices or local commensurate domains.








Abstract
Realizing van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy in the 1980s represents a breakthrough that circumvents the stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements in conventional covalent heteroepitaxy. However, due to the weak vdW interactions, there is little control over film qualities by the substrate. Typically, discrete domains with a spread of misorientation angles are formed, limiting the applicability of vdW epitaxy. Here, the epitaxial growth of monocrystalline, covalent Cr5Te8 2D crystals on monolayer vdW WSe2 by chemical vapor deposition is reported, driven by interfacial dative bond formation. The lattice of Cr5Te8, with a lateral dimension of a few tens of micrometers, is fully commensurate with that of WSe2 via 3 &#215; 3 (Cr5Te8)/7 &#215; 7 (WSe2) supercell matching, forming a single&#8208;crystalline moir&#233; superlattice. This work establishes a conceptually distinct paradigm of thin&#8208;film epitaxy, termed &#8220;dative epitaxy&#8221;, which takes full advantage of covalent epitaxy with chemical bonding for fixing the atomic registry and crystal orientation, while circumventing its stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements; conversely, it ensures the full flexibility of vdW epitaxy, while avoiding its poor orientation control. Cr5Te8 2D crystals grown by dative epitaxy exhibit square magnetic hysteresis, suggesting minimized interfacial defects that can serve as pinning sites.

         <title>Atomic Short&#8208;Range Order in a Cation&#8208;Deficient Perovskite Anode for Fast&#8208;Charging and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A cation&#8208;deficient perovskite oxide CeNb3O9 is designed as the anode for high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life Li+ storage, delivering excellent rate performance and long&#8208;term cycling performance. Wheras the excellent cycling stability is attributed to the formation of atomic short&#8208;range order, the outstanding rate performance is explained by cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enhanced 3D&#8208;conduction networks.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;type oxides are widely used for energy conversion and storage, but their rate&#8208;inhibiting phase transition and large volume change hinder the applications of most perovskite&#8208;type oxides for high&#8208;rate electrochemical energy storage. Here, it is shown that a cation&#8208;deficient perovskite CeNb3O9 (CNO) can store a sufficient amount of lithium at a high charge/discharge rate, even when the sizes of the synthesized particles are on the order of micrometers. At 60 C (15 A g&#8722;1), corresponding to a 1 min charge, the CNO anode delivers over 52.8% of its capacity. In addition, the CNO anode material exhibits 96.6% capacity retention after 2000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 50 C (12.5 A g&#8722;1), indicating exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability at high rates. The excellent cycling performance is attributed to the formation of atomic short&#8208;range order, which significantly prevents local and long&#8208;range structural rearrangements, stabilizing the host structure and being responsible for the small volume evolution. Moreover, the extremely high rate capacity can be explained by the intrinsically large interstitial sites in multiple directions, intercalation pseudocapacitance, atomic short&#8208;range order, and cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enhanced 3D&#8208;conduction networks for lithium ions. These structural characteristics and mechanisms can be used to design advanced perovskite electrode materials for fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A cation-deficient perovskite oxide CeNb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; is designed as the anode for high-rate and long-life Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage, delivering excellent rate performance and long-term cycling performance. Wheras the excellent cycling stability is attributed to the formation of atomic short-range order, the outstanding rate performance is explained by cation-vacancy-enhanced 3D-conduction networks.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite-type oxides are widely used for energy conversion and storage, but their rate-inhibiting phase transition and large volume change hinder the applications of most perovskite-type oxides for high-rate electrochemical energy storage. Here, it is shown that a cation-deficient perovskite CeNb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; (CNO) can store a sufficient amount of lithium at a high charge/discharge rate, even when the sizes of the synthesized particles are on the order of micrometers. At 60 C (15 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), corresponding to a 1 min charge, the CNO anode delivers over 52.8% of its capacity. In addition, the CNO anode material exhibits 96.6% capacity retention after 2000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 50 C (12.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), indicating exceptional long-term cycling stability at high rates. The excellent cycling performance is attributed to the formation of atomic short-range order, which significantly prevents local and long-range structural rearrangements, stabilizing the host structure and being responsible for the small volume evolution.

         <title>12.42% Monolithic 25.42 cm2 Flexible Organic Solar Cells Enabled by an Amorphous ITO&#8208;Modified Metal Grid Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
12.42% monolithic 25.42 cm2 flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) are reported based on the nanogrid electrodes modified by amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) modification layer. The modification of amorphous ITO also ensures excellent air shelf stability, as well as mechanical properties.








Abstract
Printed metal nanogrid electrode exhibits superior characteristics for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the high surface roughness and inhomogeneity between grid and blank region is adverse for performance improvement. In this work, a thin amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) film (&#945;&#8208;ITO) is introduced to fill the blank and to improve the charge transporting. The introduction of &#945;&#8208;ITO significantly improves the comprehensive properties of metal grid electrode, which exhibits excellent bending resistance and long&#8208;term stability under double 85 condition (under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity) for 200 h. Both experimental and simulation results reveal &#945;&#8208;ITO with a sheet resistance of 20&#8239;000 &#937; &#9633;&#8722;1 is sufficient to improve the charge transporting within the adjacent grids, leading to a remarkable efficiency of 16.54% for 1 cm2 flexible devices. With area increased to 4.00, 9.00, and 25.42 cm2, the devices still display a performance of 16.22%, 14.69%, and 12.42%, respectively, showing less efficiency loss during upscaling. And the 25.42 cm2 monolithic flexible device exhibits a certificated efficiency of 12.03%. Moreover, the device shows significantly improved air stability relative to conventional high&#8208;conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate&#8208;modified device. All these make the &#945;&#8208;ITO&#8208;modified Ag/Cu electrode promise to achieve high&#8208;efficient and long&#8208;term stable large&#8208;area flexible OSCs.

         <title>Blocking Cancer&#8211;Nerve Crosstalk for Treatment of Metastatic Bone Cancer Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In metastatic bone tumors, nerve and cancer cells are interdependent. The crosstalk between them promotes tumor progression, causing severe cancer pain. In this work, Mg/Al layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide nanoshells are constructed with AZ&#8208;23 loaded inside and alendronate decorated outside, which can target into bone tumors to block the nerve&#8208;cancer crosstalk for effective inhibition of tumor growth and pain relief.








Abstract
The tumor microenvironment is a complex milieu where neurons constitute an important non&#8208;neoplastic cell type. From &#8220;cancer neuroscience,&#8221; the crosstalk between tumors and neurons favors the rapid growth of both, making the cancer&#8211;nerve interaction a reciprocally beneficial process. Thus, cancer&#8211;nerve crosstalk may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention against cancer and cancer&#8208;related symptoms. We&#160;proposed a nerve&#8211;cancer crosstalk blocking strategy for metastatic bone cancer pain treatment, achieved by Mg/Al layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide nanoshells (Mg/Al&#8208;LDH) with AZ&#8208;23 loaded inside and alendronate decorated outside. The pain&#8208;causing H+ is rapidly eliminated by the LDH, with neurogenesis inhibited by the antagonist AZ&#8208;23. As positive feedback, the decreased pain reverses the nerve&#8208;to&#8208;cancer Ca2+ crosstalk&#8208;related cell cycle, dramatically inhibiting tumor growth. All experiments confirm the improved pain threshold and enhanced tumor inhibition. The study may inspire multidisciplinary researchers to focus on cancer&#8211;nerve crosstalk for treating cancer and accompanied neuropathic diseases.

         <title>Decoupling and Reprogramming the Wiggling Motion of Midge Larvae Using a Soft Robotic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic soft robotic platform to decouple and reprogram complex wiggling motion adopted by invertebrates is presented. By using magnetic soft robot and programmed magnetic field inputs, it is unveiled that the synchronization of body curling and rotation, and the optimal rotation amplitude greatly enhance motility. The robotic platform offers a new toolbox to develop optimized soft&#8208;bodied swimmers with enhanced motility.








Abstract
The efficient motility of invertebrates helps them survive under evolutionary pressures. Reconstructing the locomotion of invertebrates and decoupling the influence of individual basic motion are crucial for understanding their underlying mechanisms, which, however, generally remain a challenge due to the complexity of locomotion gaits. Herein, a magnetic soft robot to reproduce midge larva's key natural swimming gaits is developed, and the coupling effect between body curling and rotation on motility is investigated. Through the authors&#8217; systematically decoupling studies using programmed magnetic field inputs, the soft robot (named LarvaBot) experiences various coupled gaits, including biomimetic side&#8208;to&#8208;side flexures, and unveils that the optimal rotation amplitude and the synchronization of curling and rotation greatly enhance its motility. The LarvaBot achieves fast locomotion and upstream capability at the moderate Reynolds number regime. The soft robotics&#8208;based platform provides new insight to decouple complex biological locomotion, and design programmed swimming gaits for the fast locomotion of soft&#8208;bodied swimmers.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with Simultaneous Narrowband Emission, High Efficiency, and Large Dissymmetry Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance circularly polarized electroluminescence with a high external quantum efficiency of 33.2%, large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 2.8 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 42&#160;nm, are achieved by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from a newly developed chiral exciplex host to an achiral MR&#8208;TADF emitter.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that can simultaneously achieve narrowband emission, high efficiency, and circularly polarized luminescence remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a simple strategy is developed to address this challenge. A chiral exciplex&#8208;forming co&#8208;host is first designed by employing a chiral donor and an achiral acceptor molecule. The chiral exciplex host enables an achiral green multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter to achieve high&#8208;performance circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) with a high external quantum efficiency of 33.2%, large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 2.8 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 42&#160;nm. This work provides a general approach for realizing CP&#8208;EL using easily available achiral emitters and can significantly extend the scope of circularly polarized OLEDs.

In this study, a simple strategy is developed to address this challenge. A chiral exciplex-forming co-host is first designed by employing a chiral donor and an achiral acceptor molecule. The chiral exciplex host enables an achiral green multiple-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter to achieve high-performance circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP-EL) with a high external quantum efficiency of 33.2%, large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 2.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a small full-width at half-maximum of 42&#160;nm. This work provides a general approach for realizing CP-EL using easily available achiral emitters and can significantly extend the scope of circularly polarized OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alloying Co Species into Ordered and Interconnected Macroporous Carbon Polyhedra for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically ordered porous carbon&#8208;supported Co alloy nanoparticle (Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP) is rationally designed. Owing to the alloying effect, highly exposed active sites, and enhanced mass transfer, the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP exhibits an exceptional catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction in a rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Engineering non&#8208;precious transition metal (TM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts to simultaneously achieve an optimal intrinsic activity, high density of active sites, and rapid mass transfer ability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, a hybrid composite consisting of FexCo alloy nanoparticles uniformly implanted into hierarchically ordered macro&#8208;/meso&#8208;/microporous N&#8208;doped carbon polyhedra (HOMNCP) is rationally designed. The combined results of experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the alloying of Co enables a favorable electronic structure for the formation of the *OH intermediate, while the periodically trimodal&#8208;porous structured carbon matrix structure not only provides highly accessible channels for active site utilization but also dramatically facilitates mass transfer in the catalytic process. As expected, the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP composite catalyst exhibits extraordinary ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.903&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), surpassing most Co&#8208;based catalysts reported to date. More remarkably, the use of the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP catalyst as the air electrode in a zinc&#8211;air battery results in superior open&#8208;circuit voltage and power density compared to a commercial Pt/C + IrO2 catalyst. The results of this study are expected to inspire the development of advanced TM&#8208;based catalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Carbon Defects Induced Reversible Antimony Chemistry for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new antimony (Sb) anode with high areal capacity and long&#8208;lasting at practical levels is designed for advanced aqueous alkaline batteries (AABs). The massive intrinsic defect&#8208;modified carbon skeleton (D&#8208;CS) provides positive charge centers, and its homogeneous surface curvature endows a uniform local electric field, which promotes the ion kinetics behavior, effectively controls nucleation, and optimizes the plating/stripping electrochemistry.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;capacity, dendrite&#8208;free, and stable anode materials for robust aqueous alkaline batteries (AABs) is an ongoing challenge. Antimony (Sb) is predicated as an attractive anode material, but it still suffers from low capacity and poor stability caused by the obstructed kinetic behavior and uncontrollable nucleation for SbO2&#8722;. Herein, designing a new defect&#8208;modified carbon skeleton (D&#8208;CS), a highly reversible Sb anode with ultralong cycling stability is realized at practical levels of capacity and high depth of discharge (DOD). The abundant intrinsic carbon defects can effectively form positive charge centers to weaken electrostatic repulsion between SbO2&#8722; and electrode surface, facilitating the fast ion kinetics and provide generous controllable nucleation sites. In addition, the uniform electric field distribution of the D&#8208;CS induces manageable plating and stripping of the Sb metal, which effectively boosts its electrochemical reversibility and restrains adverse reactions. Accordingly, the Sb/D&#8208;CS electrode achieves a long cycle life of over 500 h with a capacity of 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Even at an ultrahigh capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, it can still work stably up to 40 h. Furthermore, its feasibility as advanced anode in AABs is also confirmed by assembled Ni//Sb/D&#8208;CS full batteries with an ultrahigh capacity of 13.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a considerable stability of 4500 cycles.

         <title>Transferring Liquid Metal to form a Hybrid Solid Electrolyte via a Wettability&#8208;Tuning Technology for Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;derived hybrid solid electrolyte is fabricated by a wettability&#8208;tuning transfer technique. By sandwiching liquid metal between electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conductive LiF and oxides, the resulting composite anodes can realize high cycling stability for &gt;4000 h at 1 mAh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Integrating solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) into Li&#8208;metal anodes has demonstrated great promise to unleash the high energy density of rechargeable Li&#8208;metal batteries. However, fabricating a highly cyclable SSE/Li&#8208;metal anode remains a major challenge because the densification of the SSE is usually incompatible with the reactive Li metal. Here, a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;derived hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) is proposed, and a facile transfer technology to construct an artificial HSE on the Li metal is reported. By tuning the wettability of the transfer substrates, electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;conductive liquid metal is sandwiched between electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conductive LiF and oxides to form the HSE. The transfer technology renders the HSE continuous, dense, and uniform. The HSE, having high ion transport, electron shut&#8208;off, and mechanical strength, makes the composite anode deliver excellent cyclability for over 4000 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell. When pairing with LiFePO4 and sulfur cathodes, the HSE&#8208;coated Li metal dramatically enhances the performance of full cells. Therefore, this work demonstrates that tuning the interfacial wetting properties provides an alternate approach to build a robust solid electrolyte, which enables highly efficient Li&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency ITO&#8208;Free Organic Photovoltaics with Superior Flexibility and Upscalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance&#160;indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide&#8208;free organic photovoltaic (OPV) with superior flexibility and upscaling capacity is demonstrated. The OPV device adopts a top&#8208;illuminated structure optimized by an anode buffer layer and charge collecting grid, and delivers a record efficiency of 15.56%. Moreover, the flexible OPV exhibits no degradation after 100&#160;000 bending cycles with a radius of 4&#160;mm, which represents the best result for flexible OPVs.








Abstract
Developing indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide (ITO)&#8208;free flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with upscaling capacity is of great significance for practical applications of OPVs. Unfortunately, the efficiencies of the corresponding devices lag far behind those of ITO&#8208;based rigid small&#8208;area counterparts. To address this issue, an advanced device configuration is designed and fabricated featuring a top&#8208;illuminated structure with ultrathin Ag as the transparent electrode. First, a conjugated polyelectrolyte layer, i.e., PCP&#8208;Li, is inserted to effectively connect the bottom Ag anode and the hole transport layer, achieving good photon to electron conversion. Second, charge collecting grids are deposited to suppress the increased resistance loss with the upscaling of the device area, realizing almost full retention of device efficiency from 0.06 to 1 cm2. Third, the designed device delivers the best efficiency of 15.56% with the area of 1 cm2 on polyimide substrate, representing as the record among the ITO&#8208;free, large&#8208;area, flexible OPVs. Interestingly, the device exhibits no degradation after 100&#160;000 bending cycles with a radius of 4&#160;mm, which is the best result for flexible OPVs. This work provides insight into device structure design and optimization for OPVs with high efficiency, low cost, superior flexibility, and upscaling capacity, indicating the potential for the future commercialization of OPVs.

         <title>Patterning of Wafer&#8208;Scale MXene Films for High&#8208;Performance Image Sensor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes are promising for future electronics and optoelectronics; however, previously reported patterning methods lack efficiency, resolution, and compatibility with mainstream semiconductor processing. Here, a wafer&#8208;scale combination patterning method with a resolution up to the micrometer scale is developed, resulting in an integrated array of 1024&#8208;pixel Ti3C2Tx/Si photodetectors with a record&#8208;high detectivity of 7.73 &#215; 1014 Jones.








Abstract
As a rapidly growing family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, MXenes are recognized as promising materials for the development of future electronics and optoelectronics. So far, the reported patterning methods for MXene films lack efficiency, resolution, and compatibility, resulting in limited device integration and performance. Here, a high&#8208;performance MXene image sensor array fabricated by a wafer&#8208;scale combination patterning method of an MXene film is reported. This method combines MXene centrifugation, spin&#8208;coating, photolithography, and dry&#8208;etching and is highly compatible with mainstream semiconductor processing, with a resolution up to 2&#160;&#181;m, which is at least 100 times higher than other large&#8208;area patterning methods reported previously. As a result, a high&#8208;density integrated array of 1024&#8208;pixel Ti3C2Tx/Si photodetectors with a detectivity of 7.73 &#215; 1014 Jones and a light&#8211;dark current ratio (Ilight/Idark) of 6.22 &#215; 106, which is the ultrahigh value among all reported MXene&#8208;based photodetectors, is fabricated. This patterning technique paves a way for large&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MXetronics compatible with mainstream semiconductor processes.

         <title>Stretchable, Breathable, and Stable Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite/Polymer Nanofiber Composite for Hybrid Triboelectric and Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable, breathable, and stable nanofiber composite (LPPS&#8208;NFC) through electrospinning of lead&#8208;free perovskite/poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene (SEBS) is reported. The Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskites exhibit great charge trapping capacity and energy level matching with PVDF&#8208;HFP. As a result, the LPPS&#8208;NFC&#8208;based energy harvester displays excellent electrical output (400&#160;V, 2.34 W m&#8722;2), setting a record of the output voltage among halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based nanogenerators.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based mechanical energy harvesters display excellent electrical output due to their unique ferroelectricity and dielectricity. However, their high toxicity and moisture sensitivity impede their practical applications. Herein, a stretchable, breathable, and stable nanofiber composite (LPPS&#8208;NFC) is fabricated through electrospinning of lead&#8208;free perovskite/poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene (SEBS). The Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskites serve as efficient electron acceptors and local nucleating agents for the crystallization of polymer chains, thereby enhancing the electron&#8208;trapping capacity and polar crystalline phase in LPPS&#8208;NFC. The excellent energy level matching between Cs3Bi2Br9 and PVDF&#8208;HFP boosts the electron transfer efficiency and reduces the charge loss, thereby promoting the electron&#8208;trapping process. Consequently, this LPPS&#8208;NFC&#8208;based energy harvester displays an excellent electrical output (400&#160;V, 1.63 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, and 2.34 W m&#8722;2), setting a record of the output voltage among halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based nanogenerators. The LPPS&#8208;NFC also exhibits excellent stretchability, waterproofness, and breathability, enabling the fabrication of robust wearable devices that convert mechanical energy from different biomechanical motions into electrical power to drive common electronic devices. The LPPS&#8208;NFC&#8208;based energy harvesters also endure extreme mechanical deformations (washing, folding, and crumpling) without performance degradation, and maintain stable electrical output up to 5 months, demonstrating their promising potential for use as smart textiles and wearable power sources.

         <title>Twin&#8208;Structured Graphene Metamaterials with Anomalous Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D graphene metamaterial with twin&#8208;structured morphology is constructed by orientated icing growth under manipulation of the temperature gradient, which demonstrates the anomalous physical properties, such as programable Poisson's ratio, superelasticity, and high resilience. Experimental investigation and numerical simulation cooperatively validate the triggering mechanism including oriented evolution of the hierarchical microstructure and elastic buckling of the cell walls.








Abstract
Typically, solid materials exhibit transverse contraction in response to stretching in the orthogonal direction and transverse expansion under compression conditions. However, when flexible graphene nanosheets are assembled into a 3D porous architecture, the orientation&#8208;arrangement&#8208;delivered directional deformation of micro&#8211;nanosheets may induce anomalous mechanical properties. In this study, a 3D hierarchical graphene metamaterial (GTM) with twin&#8208;structured morphologies is assembled by manipulating the temperature gradient for ice growth during in situ freeze&#8208;casting procedures. GTM demonstrates anomalous anisotropic compression performance with programable Poisson's ratios (PRs) and improved mechanical properties (e.g., elasticity, strength, modulus, and fatigue resistance) along different directions. Owing to the designed three&#8208;phase deformation of 2D graphene sheets as basic microelements, the twin&#8208;structure GTM delivers distinctive characteristics of compressive curves with an apparent stress plateau, and follows a strengthening tendency. This multiscale deformation behavior facilitates the enhancement of energy loss coefficient. In addition, a finite element theory based numerical model is established to optimize the structural design, and validate the multiscale tunable PR mechanism and oriented structural evolution. The mechanical and thermal applications of GTM indicate that the rational manipulation&#8208;driven design of meta&#8208;structures paves the way for exploring graphene&#8208;based multifunctional materials with anomalous properties.

         <title>Controlled Crystal Plane Orientations in the ZnO Transport Layer Enable High&#8208;Responsivity, Low&#8208;Dark&#8208;Current Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presently, zinc oxide is the electron&#8208;transport layer of choice in colloidal quantum dot photodetectors; however, ZnO relies on continuous ultraviolet illumination to remove adsorbed oxygen and maintain high performance. This problem is addressed by developing an electroneutral plane composition at the ZnO surface, aided by atomic layer deposition, while maintaining high external quantum efficiency and low dark current.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQD) have emerged as attractive materials for infrared (IR) photodetector (PD) applications because of their tunable bandgaps and facile processing. Presently, zinc oxide is the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) of choice in CQD PDs; however, ZnO relies on continuous ultraviolet (UV) illumination to remove adsorbed oxygen and maintain high external quantum efficiency (EQE), speed, and photocurrent. Here, it is shown that ZnO is dominated by electropositive crystal planes which favor excessive oxygen adsorption, and that this leads to a high density of trap states, an undesired shift in band alignment, and consequent poor performance. Over prolonged operation without UV exposure, oxygen accumulates at the electropositive planes, trapping holes and degrading performance. This problem is addressed by developing an electroneutral plane composition at the ZnO surface, aided by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as the means of materials processing. It is found that ALD ZnO has 10&#215; lower binding energy for oxygen than does conventionally deposited ZnO. IR CQD PDs made with this ETL do not require UV activation to maintain low dark current and high EQE.

         <title>Ambipolar Self&#8208;Host Functionalization Accelerates Blue Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Internal Quantum Efficiency of 100%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ambipolar self&#8208;host multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter is constructed with a structure featuring an MR chromophore functionalized with an ambipolar self&#8208;host segment, which preserves blue emission at 472&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum of 28&#160;nm and achieves accelerated singlet radiation and suppressed singlet and triplet non&#8208;radiations, leading to desired &#8776;100% photoluminescence and internal electroluminescence quantum yields.








Abstract
Emerging multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters can combine 100% exciton harvesting and high color purity for their organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). However, the highly planar configurations of MR molecules lead to intermolecular&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced quenching. A feasible way is integrating host segments into MR molecules, namely a &#8220;self&#8208;host&#8221; strategy, but without involving additional charge transfer and/or vibrational components to excited states. Herein, an ambipolar self&#8208;host featured MR emitter, tCBNDADPO, is demonstrated, whose ambipolar host segment (DADPO) significantly and comprehensively improves the TADF properties, especially greatly accelerated singlet radiative rate constant of 2.11 &#215; 108 s&#8722;1 and exponentially reduced nonradiative rate constants. Consequently, at the same time as preserving narrowband blue emission with an FWHM of &#8776;28&#160;nm at a high doping concentration of 30%, tCBNDADPO reveals state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of 99% and 30%, respectively. The corresponding 100% internal quantum efficiency of tCBNDADPO supported by an ultrasimple trilayer and heavily doped device demonstrates the feasibility of the ambipolar self&#8208;host strategy for constructing practically applicable MR materials.

         <title>Bioinspired, Omnidirectional, and Hypersensitive Flexible Strain Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the ultrasensitive and omnidirectional sensing function of scorpions to weak vibration signals, the biological mechanism is explored and a flexible strain sensor inspired by the slit sensillum embedded on the walking legs of scorpions is fabricated. Results demonstrate that the sensors also have hypersensitive, omnidirectional sensing, and direction discrimination to vibration stimuli, similar to that of scorpions.








Abstract
Sensors are widely used in various fields, among which flexible strain sensors that can sense minuscule mechanical signals and are easy to adapt to many irregular surfaces are attractive for structure health monitoring, early detection, and failure prevention in humans, machines, or buildings. In practical applications, subtle and abnormal vibrations generated from any direction are highly desired to detect and even orientate their directions initially to eliminate potential hazards. However, it is challenging for flexible strain sensors to achieve hypersensitivity and omnidirectionality simultaneously due to the restrictions of many materials with anisotropic mechanical/electrical properties and some micro/nanostructures they employed. Herein, it is revealed that the vision&#8208;degraded scorpion detects subtle vibrations spatially and omnidirectionally using a slit sensillum with fan&#8208;shaped grooves. A bioinspired flexible strain sensor consisting of curved microgrooves arranged around a central circle is devised, exhibiting an unprecedented gauge factor of over 18&#160;000 and stability over 7000 cycles. It can sense and recognize vibrations of diverse input waveforms at different locations, bouncing behaviors of a free&#8208;falling bead, and human wrist pulses regardless of sensor installation angles. The geometric designs can be translated to other material systems for potential applications including human health monitoring and engineering failure detection.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Switch&#8208;Embedded Organic Photodiode for Capturing Images against Strong Backlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded organic photodiode exhibits an autonomous transition of the operation mode between photovoltaic&#8208; and photomultiplication&#8208;type photodiodes, resulting in the extension of the photoresponse linearity to 434 W cm&#8722;2. This mechanism is enabled by the light&#8208;intensity&#8208;adjusted cyclization&#8211;cycloreversion equilibrium of diarylethene&#8208;based molecular switches. Consequently, prototype image sensors with reliable sensitivity against strong backlight are demonstrated.








Abstract
When the intensity of the incident light increases, the photocurrents of organic photodiodes (OPDs) exhibit relatively early saturation, due to which OPDs cannot easily detect objects against strong backlights, such as sunlight. In this study, this problem is addressed by introducing a light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent transition of the operation mode, such that the operation mode of the OPD autonomously changes to overcome early photocurrent saturation as the incident light intensity passes the threshold intensity. The photoactive layer is doped with a strategically designed and synthesized molecular switch, 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanobiphenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;thienyl)tetrafluorobenzene (DAB). The proposed OPD exhibits a typical OPD performance with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &lt;100% and a photomultiplication behavior with an EQE of &gt;100% under low&#8208;intensity and high&#8208;intensity light illuminations, respectively, thereby resulting in an extension of the photoresponse linearity to a light intensity of 434&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This unique and reversible transition of the operation mode can be explained by the unbalanced quantum yield of photocyclization/photocycloreversion of the molecular switch. The details of the operation mechanism are discussed in conjunction with various photophysical analyses. Furthermore, they establish a prototype image sensor with an array of molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded OPD pixels to demonstrate their extremely high sensitivity against strong light illumination.

         <title>A Nanostructured Moisture&#8208;Absorbing Gel for Fast and Large&#8208;Scale Passive Dehumidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured moisture&#8208;absorbing gel is constructed by integrating hygroscopic lithium salt and hydrophilic nanocellulose. The gel maintains a large hygroscopic active area for capturing water from air, and thus exhibits super&#8208;moisture&#8208;absorption ability. Even in a space with a volume over 2 &#215; 104 times its own, the gel demonstrates fast dehumidification without energy input and environment pollution.








Abstract
Dehumidification is significant for environmental sustainability and human health. Traditional dehumidification methods involve significant energy consumption and have negative impact on the environment. The core challenge is to expose hygroscopic surfaces to the air, and appropriately store the captured water and avoid surface inactivation. Here, a nanostructured moisture&#8208;absorbing gel (N&#8208;MAG) for passive dehumidification, which consists of a hydrophilic nanocellulose network functionalized by hygroscopic lithium chloride, is reported. The interconnected nanocellulose can transfer the captured water to the internal space of the bulky N&#8208;MAG, eliminating water accumulation near the surfaces and hence enabling high&#8208;rate moisture absorption. The N&#8208;MAG can reduce the relative humidity from 96.7% to 28.7% in 6 h, even if the space is over 2 &#215; 104 times of its own volume. The condensed water can be completely confined in the N&#8208;MAG, overcoming the problem of environmental pollution. This research brings a new perspective for sustainable humidity management without energy consumption and with positive environmental footprint.

         <title>Crystal Growth Regulation of 2D/3D Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Both High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal growth in 2D/3D perovskite films is regulated by introducing a 2D (NpMA)2PbI4 perovskite or NpMAI into the PbI2 precursor solutions using a two&#8208;step deposition method. The optimized film shows much enlarged grain size and significantly reduced trap density, which enables a champion efficiency of 24.37% for a 0.10 cm&#8722;2 device and 22.26% for a 1.01 cm&#8722;2 device.








Abstract
Reducing the electronic defects in perovskite films has become a substantial challenge to further boost the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. Here, 2D (NpMA)2PbI4 perovskite and 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium iodide (NpMAI) are separately introduced into the PbI2 precursor solutions to regulate the crystal growth in a 2D/3D perovskite film using a two&#8208;step deposition method. The (NpMA)2PbI4 modulated perovskite film shows a significantly improved film quality with enlarged grain size from &#8776;500&#160;nm to over 1000&#160;nm, which greatly reduces the grain&#8208;boundary defects, improves the charge carrier lifetime, and hinders ionic diffusion. As a result, the best&#8208;performing device shows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.37% for a small&#8208;area (0.10 cm&#8722;2) device and a superior PCE of 22.26% for a large&#8208;area (1.01 cm&#8722;2) device. Importantly, the unencapsulated device shows a dramatically improved operational stability with maintains over 98% of its initial efficiency after 1500 h by maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light irradiation.

         <title>Seed&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Cold Sintering Toward Metal Halide Transparent Ceramic Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy, i.e., seed&#8208;crystal&#8208;induced cold sintering process, is pioneered. High oriented transparency can be obtained in large&#8208;area metal halide transparent ceramic scintillators, leading to very high light yield &#8776;78&#8239;000 photons per MeV, energy resolution of 17% for high&#8208;energy &#947;&#8208;rays (662&#160;keV), recorded detection limit 8.8 nanograys per second, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging of (15.7 lp mm&#8722;1) simultaneously.








Abstract
Scintillators with high spatial resolution at a low radiation dose rate are desirable for X&#8208;ray medical imaging. To challenge the state&#8208;of&#8208;art technology, it is necessary to design large&#8208;area wafers with high light yield, oriented light transport, and reduced light scattering. Here, a seed&#8208;crystal&#8208;induced cold sintering is adopted and a &lt;001&gt;&#8208;textured TPP2MnBr4 (TPP: tetraphenylphosphonium) transparent ceramic is fabricated with a large&#8208;area wafer of 5&#160;cm in diameter, exhibiting high optical transparency of above 68% over the 450&#8211;600&#160;nm range. The compelling scintillation performance of the TPP2MnBr4 wafer includes a light yield of &#8776;78&#160;000&#160;&#177; 2000 photons per MeV, a low detection limit 8.8 nanograys per second, about 625 times lower than the requirement of X&#8208;ray diagnostics (5500 nanograys per second), and an energy resolution of 17% for high&#8208;energy &#947;&#8208;rays (662&#160;keV). X&#8208;ray imaging demonstrates a high spatial resolution of 15.7 lp mm&#8722;1. Moreover, the designed material exhibits good retention of the radioluminescence intensity and light yield. This work presents a paradigm for achieving light&#8208;guiding properties with high transparency and large&#8208;area fabrication by grain orientation engineering, and the transparent, textured metal halide ceramic scintillator is expected to provide a route for advancement in the X&#8208;ray imaging of tomorrow.

         <title>Selenopeptide Nanomedicine Activates Natural Killer Cells for Enhanced Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled selenopeptide nanomedicine is developed to strengthen chemoimmunotherapy through combing the programmable delivery of doxorubicin and the synergistic NK cell immunotherapy activated by oxidative seleno&#8208;metabolites. The xperimental results demonstrate the mutual promotion between the doxorubicin&#8208;induced chemotherapy and the selenopeptide&#8208;induced immunotherapy, which synergistically contribute to improved antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy using nanotechnology has shown great potential for cancer therapy in the clinic. However, uncontrolled transportation and synergistic responses remain challenges. Here, a self&#8208;assembled selenopeptide nanoparticle that strengthens tumor chemoimmunotherapy through the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by the oxidative metabolite of the selenopeptide is developed. With the advantages of the enzyme&#8208;induced size&#8208;reduction and the reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;driven deselenization, this selenopeptide is able to deliver therapeutics, e.g., doxorubicin (DOX), to solid tumors and further activate the NK cells in a programmed manner. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo results prove the mutual promotion between the DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy and the selenopeptide&#8208;induced immunotherapy, which synergistically contribute to the improved antitumor efficacy. It is anticipated that the selenopeptide may provide a type of promising stimuli&#8208;responsive immune modulator for versatile biomedical applications.

         <title>Physically Detachable and Operationally Stable Cs2SnI6 Photodetector Arrays Integrated with &#181;&#8208;LEDs for Broadband Flexible Optical Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable Cs2SnI6 (CSI) particles via hydriodic acid precursor optimization are reported. For system&#8208;level demonstration, physically detachable 3 &#215; 3 photodector (PD) arrays, assembled with micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (&#181;&#8208;LEDs) as light sources, are demonstrated to cover the broadband spectrum of UV&#8211;visible&#8211;near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) and hold great promise for future wireless optical interconnection.








Abstract
With the surge in perovskite research, practical features for future applications are desired to be secured, but the reliability of the materials and the use of hazardous Pb are longstanding problems. Here, an air&#8208;stable Cs2SnI6 (CSI) is prepared via diluted hydriodic acid solvent&#8208;based precursor optimization during scalable hydrothermal growth. Materials characterization is performed using various elemental peak analyses and crystallographic identification. The resulting CSI exhibits long&#8208;term operating stability over 6 months, i) at elevated temperatures, ii) in ambient air, and iii) under light illumination from UV to near&#8208;infrared. More importantly, to demonstrate an intriguing class of applications up to system level, physically detachable CSI photodetector arrays (PD&#8208;arrays), integrated with micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (&#956;&#8208;LEDs) arrays, are successfully fabricated. In addition, 3&#160;&#215; 3 flexible CSI PDs are fully operational, even in air, and their spatial uniformity in pixels is quantitatively evaluated. The charge&#8208;transport mechanisms of the CSI PDs under light and elevated temperature are assessed via temperature&#8208;dependent characterization from 148 to 373 K, implying the involvement of 3D variable&#8208;range hopping. Multicycle evaluation of the CSI PD&#8208;arrays confirms their operational stability in AC and DC modes, demonstrating this platform's potential benefit for wireless optical interconnection in advanced Si technology.

This work presents passive ultra&#8208;conductive thermal metamaterials. A wide range of effective thermal conductivity beyond natural conductive materials is achieved, in the absence of extra energy payload. In addition, tunable thermal interfacial effect is unfolded in an &#8220;analog&#8221; fashion. The findings may open long&#8208;ignored possibilities of achieving ultra&#8208;conductive thermal materials and robust thermal management in the context of pure conduction.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;conductive heat transport showcases significant potentials in popular thermal managements with convection, phase change, and heat source. However, it is captivated impossible for passive thermal manipulation, usually bounded by intrinsic thermal conductivities of natural materials, to outperform these active recipes in need of extra energy payload. Here, a robust recipe to create passive ultra&#8208;conductive thermal metamaterials consisting of nothing but bulk natural materials is reported. Thanks to the local thermal resistance regulation by vertical thermal transport channel, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermal metamaterials experimentally demonstrate extreme effective conductivity (1915&#160;W&#160;m&#8211;1&#160;K&#8211;1) solely with naturally occurring materials. The purely conductive modulation without any external energy is comparable to active counterparts, and further reveals its robustness and unexpected convenience. The findings construct a high&#8208;efficient paradigm of passive thermal management with ultra&#8208;conductive heat transport, and further hint potentials in other Laplace fields, e.g., DC and magnetostatics.

         <title>Realization of a Half Metal with a Record&#8208;High Curie Temperature in Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half metals have promising applications in advanced spintronic devices. A new half metal LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 with a record&#8208;high Curie temperature (TC) in perovskite oxides, combining with a wide spin&#8208;up energy gap (Eg) and a large magnetization (MN), is synthesized. The current LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 thus shows the best synthetic performance (TC&#160;&#215; Eg&#160;&#215; MN) among all half&#8208;metallic oxides discovered so far.








Abstract
Half metals, in which one spin channel is conducting while the other is insulating with an energy gap, are theoretically considered to comprise 100% spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, and thus have promising applications in high&#8208;efficiency magnetic sensors, computer memory, magnetic recording, and so on. However, for practical applications, a high Curie temperature combined with a wide spin energy gap and large magnetization is required. Realizing such a high&#8208;performance combination is a key challenge. Herein, a novel A&#8208; and B&#8208;site ordered quadruple perovskite oxide LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 with the charge format of Cu2+/Fe3+/Re4.5+ is reported. The strong Cu2+(&#8593;)Fe3+(&#8593;)Re4.5+(&#8595;) spin interactions lead to a ferrimagnetic Curie temperature as high as 710 K, which is the reported record in perovskite&#8208;type half metals thus far. The saturated magnetic moment determined at 300 K is 7.0 &#956;B f.u.&#8722;1 and further increases to 8.0 &#956;B f.u.&#8722;1 at 2 K. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal a half&#8208;metallic nature with a spin&#8208;down conducting band while a spin&#8208;up insulating band with a large energy gap up to 2.27&#160;eV. The currently unprecedented realization of record Curie temperature coupling with the wide energy gap and large moment in LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 opens a way for potential applications in advanced spintronic devices at/above room temperature.

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Dependent Mechanochromism of Dion&#8211;Jacobson and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible mechanochromism of Dion&#8211;Jacobson and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper layered hybrid perovskites based on 1,4&#8208;phenylenedimethylammonium and benzylammonium spacers is demonstrated in the 0&#8211;0.35 GPa pressure range. X&#8208;ray scattering and density functional theory calculations under pressure reveal that this is related to the structural interplay between the spacer and the inorganic framework, providing critical insights that expand the perspectives for future applications.








Abstract
Layered Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) hybrid perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their modular structure. To fully exploit their functionality, mechanical stimuli can be used to control their properties without changing the composition. However, the responsiveness of these systems to pressure compatible with practical applications (&lt;1&#160;GPa) remains unexploited. Hydrostatic pressure is used to investigate the structure&#8211;property relationships in representative iodide and bromide DJ and RP 2D perovskites based on 1,4&#8208;phenylenedimethylammonium (PDMA) and benzylammonium (BzA) spacers in the 0&#8211;0.35&#160;GPa pressure range. Pressure&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal that lattices of these compositions monotonically shrink and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the structural changes within the organic spacer layer. These structural changes affect the optical properties; the most significant shift in the optical absorption is observed in (BzA)2PbBr4 under 0.35&#160;GPa pressure, which is attributed to an isostructural phase transition. Surprisingly, the RP and DJ perovskites behave similarly under pressure, despite the different binding modes of the spacer molecules. This study provides important insights into how the manipulation of the crystal structure affects the optoelectronic properties of such materials, whereas the reversibility of their response expands the perspectives for future applications.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Temperature Annealing Method for Alloy Nanostructures and Metasurfaces: Unlocking a Novel Degree of Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In principle, alloying metals requires high temperatures. In this work, it is shown that it is possible to fully alloy gold and silver at low temperature to produce nanostructures with controlled, arbitrary, shapes, and stoichiometries. Furthermore, a combination of nanostructures with different stoichiometries on the same substrate enables the realization of optical elements and metasurfaces with useful optical responses.








Abstract
The material and exact shape of a nanostructure determine its optical response, which is especially strong for plasmonic metals. Unfortunately, only a few plasmonic metals are available, which limits the spectral range where these strong optical effects can be utilized. Alloying different plasmonic metals can overcome this limitation, at the expense of using a high&#8208;temperature alloying process, which adversely destroys the nanostructure shape. Here, a low&#8208;temperature alloying process is developed where the sample is heated at only 300&#160;&#176;C for 8 h followed by 30&#160;min at 450&#160;&#176;C and Au&#8211;Ag nanostructures with a broad diversity of shapes, aspect ratios, and stoichiometries are fabricated. Energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirm the homogeneous alloying through the entire sample. Varying the alloy stoichiometry tunes the optical response and controls spectral features, such as Fano resonances. Binary metasurfaces that combine nanostructures with different stoichiometries are fabricated using multiple&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam lithography, and their optical function as a hologram or a Fresnel zone plate is demonstrated at the visible wavelength of &#955;&#160;= 532&#160;nm. This low&#8208;temperature annealing technique provides a versatile and cost&#8208;effective way of fabricating complex Au&#8211;Ag nanostructures with arbitrary stoichiometry.

         <title>Modulating Electron Transfer in Vanadium&#8208;Based Artificial Enzymes for Enhanced ROS&#8208;Catalysis and Disinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new vanadium&#8208;based artificial enzyme (VOx&#8208;AE) for efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;catalysis is synthesized by modulating the d electrons in the active centers via a unique Zn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge structure. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the VOx&#8208;AE exhibits optimal adsorption/dissociation of oxygen&#8208;intermediates, thus showing enhanced ROS catalytic activity and augmented eradication of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and comparable wound&#8208;treatment indexes to antibiotics.








Abstract
Nanomaterials&#8208;based artificial enzymes (AEs) have flourished for more than a decade. However, it is still challenging to further enhance their biocatalytic performances due to the limited strategies to tune the electronic structures of active centers. Here, a new path is reported for the de novo design of the d electrons of active centers by modulating the electron transfer in vanadium&#8208;based AEs (VOx&#8208;AE) via a unique Zn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge for efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;catalysis. Benefiting from the electron transfer from Zn to V, the V site in VOx&#8208;AE exhibits a lower valence state than that in V2O5, which results in charge&#8208;filled V&#8208;dyz orbital near the Fermi level to interfere with the formation of sigma bonds between the V&#8208;dz2 and O&#8208;pz orbitals in H2O2. The VOx&#8208;AE exhibits a twofold Vmax and threefold turnover number than V2O5 when catalyzing H2O2. Meanwhile, the VOx&#8208;AE shows enhanced catalytic eradication of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and achieves comparable wound&#8208;treatment indexes to vancomycin. This modulating charge&#8208;filling of d electrons provides a new direction for the de novo design of nanomaterials&#8208;based AEs and deepens the understanding of ROS&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>A Direct Writing Approach for Organic Semiconductor Single&#8208;Crystal Patterns with Unique Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving purely orientated single&#8208;crystal patterns is significant but challenging for uniform and desirable performance in device integration. A direct writing approach is presented to purify the orientation through delicately manipulating the microscale meniscus. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors, based on the crystal patterns with unique orientation, exhibit remarkable performance, revealing great potential in organic electronics.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor single&#8208;crystal (OSSC) patterns with precisely controlled orientation are of great significance to the integrated fabrication of devices with high and uniform performance. However, it is still challenging to achieve purely oriented OSSC patterns due to the complex nucleation and growth process of OSSCs. Here, a general direct writing approach is presented to readily obtain high&#8208;quality OSSC patterns with unique orientation. In specific, a direct writing method is demonstrated wherein the microscale meniscus is manipulated, which makes it possible to precisely control the nucleation and growth process of the OSSC because of its comparable size to the crystal nuclei. The resulting OSSC patterns are highly crystalline and purely oriented, in which each ribbon crystal shows a deviation angle of 33&#176; to the printing direction. The mechanism of orientation purification is revealed experimentally and theoretically, and the results show that the TCL deformation caused by the difference in wettability and adhesive force, as well as the asymmetry of fluid concentration distribution, are the key factors leading to the selective deposition and unique orientation. Moreover, organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors are prepared based on the OSSC patterns with unique orientation, which exhibit higher device performance compared to the non&#8208;purely oriented crystal&#8208;based OFETs.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of Solid&#8208;State Ultraviolet B Emitting Carbon Dots via Acetic Acid&#8208;Promoted Fractions of sp3 Bonding Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state Ultraviolet B emitting carbon dots (UVB&#8208;CDs) with a high quantum yield and a narrow bandwidth are synthesized hydrothermally by using o&#8208;phenylenediamine and excessive acetic acid (AA). The excess AA promotes the deamination process and fractions of sp3&#8208;C in UVB&#8208;CDs, leading to the blue&#8208;shift of emission. The UVB&#8208;CDs show potential application in plant lighting can increase Vitamin C content in basil.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have received tremendous attention for their excellent photoluminescence (PL) properties. However, it remains a great challenge to obtain CDs with ultraviolet (UV, 200&#8211;400&#160;nm) emission in solid state, which requires strict control of the CDs structure and overcoming the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). Herein, a new sp3 compartmentalization strategy is developed to meet these requirements, by employing acetic acid to promote fractions of sp3 bonding during the synthesis of CDs. It markedly decreases the size of sp2 conjugating units in the CDs, and shifts PL emission to the ultraviolet B (UVB) region (&#955;max&#160;= 308&#160;nm). Moreover, sp2 domains are well spatially compartmentalized by sp3 domains and the ACQ effect is minimized, enabling the high quantum yield in solid state (20.2%, &#955;ex&#160;= 265&#160;nm) with a narrow bandwidth of 24&#160;nm and environmental robustness. The solid&#8208;state UVB emissive CDs are highly desired for application in photonic devices. Hence, a demo of UVB light&#8208;emitting diodes is fabricated for plant lighting, leading to a 29% increase of ascorbic acid content in the basil. Overall, a rational and efficient way to construct solid UVB&#8208;CDs phosphors for wide applications is provided.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions: Roles of Different N Species</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Fe catalysts with different types of nitrogen species are synthesized by controlling the pyrolyzing temperature using a hard&#8208;template strategy. Different roles of the nitrogen species in Fenton&#8208;like reactions are revealed. Graphitic N can adsorb the target molecule, pyrrolic N plays an essential role, and pyridinic N has little role in the reactivity of Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon.








Abstract
Recognizing and controlling the structure&#8211;activity relationships of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is vital for manipulating their catalytic properties for various practical applications. Herein, Fe SACs supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (SA&#8208;Fe/CN) are reported, which show high catalytic reactivity (97% degradation of bisphenol A in only 5&#160;min), high stability (80% of reactivity maintained after five runs), and wide pH suitability (working pH range 3&#8211;11) toward Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The roles of different N species in these reactions are further explored, both experimentally and theoretically. It is discovered that graphitic N is an adsorptive site for the target molecule, pyrrolic N coordinates with Fe(III) and plays a dominant role in the reaction, and pyridinic N, coordinated with Fe(II), is only a minor contributor to the reactivity of SA&#8208;Fe/CN. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that a lower d&#8208;band center location of pyrrolic&#8208;type Fe sites leads to the easy generation of Fe&#8208;oxo intermediates, and thus, excellent catalytic properties.

A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electroluminodynamic therapy (ELDT) strategy is presented based on electroluminescence&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under an electric field, which avoids the utilization of a physical light source, as used in photodynamic therapy, and achieves convenient and effective inhibition of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infection through a hydrogel&#8208;based flexible therapeutic device.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted wide attention in antibacterial applications due to its advantages of spatial&#8208;temporal selectivity, noninvasiveness, and low incidence to develop drug resistance. To make it more convenient, universal, and manipulatable for clinical application, a conceptually antibacterial strategy, namely &#8220;electroluminodynamic therapy&#8221; (ELDT), is presented by nanoassembly of an electroluminescent (EL) material and a photosensitizer, which is capable of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in situ under an electric field, i.e., the fluorescence emitted by the EL molecules excites the photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen (1O2), for the oxidative damage of pathogens. Based on the scheme of ELDT, a flexible therapeutic device is fabricated through a hydrogel loading with ELDT nanoagents, followed by integration with a flexible battery, satisfying the requirements of being light and wearable for wound dressings. The ELDT&#8208;based flexible device presents potent ROS&#8208;induced killing efficacies against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria (&gt;99.9%), so as to effectively inhibit the superficial infection and promote the wound healing. This research reveals a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ELDT strategy as a prospective alternative to PDT, which avoids the utilization of a physical light source, and achieves convenient and effective killing of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria through a hydrogel&#8208;based flexible therapeutic device.

         <title>Ultrahigh Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Efficiency and Selectivity Manipulation by Single&#8208;Tungsten&#8208;Atom Oxide at the Atomic Step of TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single metallic atom oxide at the surface step is a new structural strategy for heterogeneous catalysts to tune selective products. As a proof of concept, a high converage of single tungsten atom oxide on a TiO2 nanoparticle with numerous surface steps can achieve the main product of CH4 with 86.5% selectivity from mainly CO (88.2% selectivity) on bare TiO2 in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction is a sustainable route to the direct conversion of greenhouse gases into chemicals without additional energy consumption. Given the vast amount of greenhouse gas, numerous efforts have been devoted to developing inorganic photocatalysts, e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO2), due to their stability, low cost, and environmentally friendly properties. However, a more efficient TiO2 photocatalyst without noble metals is highly desirable for CO2 reduction, and it is both difficult and urgent to produce selectively valuable compounds. Here, a novel &#8220;single&#8208;atom site at the atomic step&#8221; strategy is developed by anchoring a single tungsten (W) atom site with oxygen&#8208;coordination at the intrinsic steps of classic TiO2 nanoparticles. The composition of active sites for CO2 reduction can be controlled by tuning the additional W5+ to form W5+&#8211;O&#8211;Ti3+ sites, resulting in both significant CO2 reduction efficiency with 60.6 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity for methane (CH4) over carbon monoxide (CO), which exceeds those of pristine TiO2 by more than one order of magnitude. The mechanism relies on the accurate control of the single&#8208;atom sites at step with 22.8% coverage of surface sites and the subsequent excellent electron&#8211;hole separation along with the favorable adsorption&#8211;desorption of intermediates at the sites.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intramolecular Motion&#8208;Induced Photothermy for Tumor Phototheranostics and Tooth Root Canal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused two isoindigo (DIID)&#8208;based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles are designed and synthesized with high near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;harvesting capacity, excellent photothermal conversion property due to the active excited&#8208;state intramolecular twist around the central double bonds in DIID, and amplified photoacoustic signal by enlarging the Gr&#252;neisen parameter. The nanoparticles give effective performances in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy of tumors and tooth root canal therapy.








Abstract
Much effort is devoted to develop agents with superior photoacoustic/photothermal properties for improved disease diagnosis and treatment. Herein, a new fused two isoindigo (DIID)&#8208;based semiconducting conjugated polymer (named PBDT&#8208;DIID) is rationally designed and synthesized with a strong near&#8208;infrared absorption band ranging from 700 to 1000&#160;nm. Water&#8208;dispersing nanoparticles (NPs) of PBDT&#8208;DIID are prepared with good biocompatibility and a rather high photothermal conversion efficiency (70.6%), as the active excited&#8208;state intramolecular twist around the central double bonds in DIID permits most of the absorbed excitation energy flow to heat deactivation pathway through internal conversion. The photoacoustic signal can be further magnified by incorporation of polylactide (PLA) in the NP core to confine the generated heat of PBDT&#8208;DIID within NPs. The resultant doped NPs show excellent performance in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in an orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. It is also found that the photothermal effect of the PBDT&#8208;DIID NPs is safe and quite efficacious to highly improve the root canal treatment outcome by heating the 1% NaClO solution inside the root canal upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation in a human extracted tooth root canal infection model.

Layered Hybrid Perovskites
Mechanical pressure can be a tool for tailoring optoelectronic properties of layered hybrid perovskites without changing their composition. In article number 2108720, Bruno Ehrler, Jovana V. Mili&#263;, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that Dion&#8211;Jacobson and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites based on 1,4&#8208;phenylenedimethylammonium and benzylammonium spacers show reversible mechanochromism in the 0&#8211;0.35 GPa pressure range due to a structural interplay between the organic spacer and the inorganic framework, expanding the perspectives for their future applications.

Dehumidification
Dehumidification is significant for environmental sustainability and human health. In article number 2200865, Wenshuai Chen, Guihua Yu, and co&#8208;workers report the development of a nanostructured moisture&#8208;absorbing gel by integration of hygroscopic lithium salt and hydrophilic nanocellulose networks. The gel maintains a large hygroscopic active area for capturing water from air, and thus exhibits super&#8208;moisture&#8208;absorption ability. Even in a space with a volume over 20 000 times of its own, it demonstrates fast dehumidification without energy input and environment pollution.

Intracellular Mechanical Drugs
Today it is incontestable that cell mechanics is as important as cell biochemistry. However, although there is a plethora of biochemical drugs to study and treat cells, there is a lack of their mechanical counterparts. In article number 2109581, Teresa Su&#225;rez, Jos&#233; A. Plaza, and co&#8208;workers propose silicon chips as intracellular mechanical drugs to study how intracellular mechanical cues define cell function and fate with even future therapeutic potential applications.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells: Progressive Deposition Techniques and Future Prospects on Large&#8208;Area Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The possibilities of different deposition techniques which can bring quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based solar cells to the industrial level are assessed. With perovskite QDs showing dramatic improvements in photovoltaics, the discussions on the challenges particularly for perovskite QD solar cells are given in an attempt to achieve large&#8208;area fabrication solving pivotal energy and environmental issues.








Abstract
Colloidally grown nanosized semiconductors yield extremely high&#8208;quality optoelectronic materials. Many examples have pointed to near perfect photoluminescence quantum yields, allowing for technology&#8208;leading materials such as high purity color centers in display technology. Furthermore, because of high chemical yield, and improved understanding of the surfaces, these materials, particularly colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can also be ideal candidates for other optoelectronic applications. Given the urgent necessity toward carbon neutrality, electricity from solar photovoltaics will play a large role in the power generation sector. QDs are developed and shown dramatic improvements over the past 15 years as photoactive materials in photovoltaics with various innovative deposition properties which can lead to exceptionally low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance devices. Once the key issues related to charge transport in optically thick arrays are addressed, QD&#8208;based photovoltaic technology can become a better candidate for practical application. In this article, the authors show how the possibilities of different deposition techniques can bring QD&#8208;based solar cells to the industrial level and discuss the challenges for perovskite QD solar cells in particular, to achieve large&#8208;area fabrication for further advancing technology to solve pivotal energy and environmental issues.

         <title>Recent Progress in Protective Membranes Fabricated via Electrospinning: Advanced Materials, Biomimetic Structures, and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospinning has been used for several applications over the last 20 years. Multifunctional protective membranes in terms of novel material design, novel structure construction, and various applications via electrospinning are reviewed. Diverse protective membranes are investigated, existing problems are discussed, and solutions for future technology development are proposed. This is of significance for the sustainable development of intelligent protection systems.








Abstract
Electrospinning is a significant micro/nanofiber processing technology and has been rapidly developing in the past 2 decades. It has several applications, including advanced sensing, intelligent manufacturing, and high&#8208;efficiency catalysis. Here, multifunctional protective membranes fabricated via electrospinning in terms of novel material design, construction of novel structures, and various protection requirements in different environments are reviewed. To achieve excellent comprehensive properties, such as, high water vapor transmission, high hydrostatic pressure, optimal mechanical property, and air permeability, combinations of novel materials containing nondegradable/degradable materials and functional structures inspired by nature have been investigated for decades. Currently, research is mainly focused on conventional protective membranes with multifunctional properties, such as, anti&#8208;UV, antibacterial, and electromagnetic&#8208;shielding functions. However, important aspects, such as, the properties of electrospun monofilaments, development of &#8220;green electrospinning solutions&#8221; with high solid content, and approaches for enhancing adhesion between hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers are not considered. Based on this systematic review, the development of electrospinning for protective membranes is discussed, the existing gaps in research are discussed, and solutions for the development of technology are proposed. This review will assist in promoting the diversified development of protective membranes and is of great significance for fabricating advanced materials for intelligent protection.

It has several applications, including advanced sensing, intelligent manufacturing, and high-efficiency catalysis. Here, multifunctional protective membranes fabricated via electrospinning in terms of novel material design, construction of novel structures, and various protection requirements in different environments are reviewed. To achieve excellent comprehensive properties, such as, high water vapor transmission, high hydrostatic pressure, optimal mechanical property, and air permeability, combinations of novel materials containing nondegradable/degradable materials and functional structures inspired by nature have been investigated for decades. Currently, research is mainly focused on conventional protective membranes with multifunctional properties, such as, anti-UV, antibacterial, and electromagnetic-shielding functions. However, important aspects, such as, the properties of electrospun monofilaments, development of &#8220;green electrospinning solutions&#8221; with high solid content, and approaches for enhancing adhesion between hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers are not considered. Based on this systematic review, the development of electrospinning for protective membranes is discussed, the existing gaps in research are discussed, and solutions for the development of technology are proposed. This review will assist in promoting the diversified development of protective membranes and is of great significance for fabricating advanced materials for intelligent protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthetic Strategies to Advanced Optical&#8208;Electrical&#8208;Magnetic Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 17, April 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the synthesis of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities are systematically summarized. The challenging issues and potential opportunities are also proposed for further inspiring their development in structure, synthesis, and functionalities.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of organic crystalline polymers with highly oriented structures and permanent porosity, can adopt 2D or 3D architectures depending on the different topological diagrams of the monomers. Notably, 2D COFs have particularly gained much attention due to the extraordinary merits of their extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and topologically ordered columnar &#960;&#8208;arrays. These properties together with high crystallinity, large surface area, and tunable porosity distinguish 2D COFs as an ideal candidate for the fabrication of functional materials. Herein, this review surveys the recent research advances in 2D COFs with special emphasis on the preparation of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities. Some challenging issues and potential research outlook for 2D COFs are also provided for promoting their development in terms of structure, synthesis, and functionalities.

         <title>Advanced Materials and Sensors for Microphysiological Systems: Focus on Electronic and Electrooptical Interfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
Advanced in vitro cell culture or microphysiological&#160;systems (MPSs) recapitulate features of human tissues&#8239;and are increasingly being used for drug development and disease modeling. Still, they are commonly based on standard polymers with minimal real&#8208;time stimuli and read&#8208;out capacity. This review describes how advanced materials and devices could enable a technology leap in reproducing in vivo&#8208;like functionality and real&#8208;time tissue monitoring.








Abstract
Advanced in vitro cell culture systems or microphysiological systems (MPSs), including microfluidic organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OoC), are breakthrough technologies in biomedicine. These systems recapitulate features of human tissues&#160;outside of the body. They are increasingly being used to study the functionality of different organs for applications such as drug evolutions, disease modeling, and precision medicine. Currently, developers and endpoint users of these in vitro&#160;models promote how they can replace animal models or even be a better ethically neutral and humanized alternative to study pathology, physiology, and pharmacology. Although reported models show a remarkable physiological structure and function compared to the conventional 2D cell culture, they are almost exclusively based on standard passive polymers or glass with none or minimal real&#8208;time stimuli and readout capacity. The next technology leap in reproducing in vivo&#8208;like functionality and real&#8208;time monitoring of tissue function could be realized with advanced functional materials and devices. This review describes the currently reported electronic and optical advanced materials for sensing and stimulation of MPS models. In addition, an overview of multi&#8208;sensing for Body&#8208;on&#8208;Chip platforms is given. Finally, one gives the perspective on how advanced functional materials could be integrated into in vitro systems to precisely mimic human physiology.

         <title>More powerful twistron carbon nanotube yarn mechanical energy harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretching a coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn can provide large, reversible electrochemical capacitance changes, which convert mechanical energy to electricity. Here we show that the performance of these &#8220;twistron&#8221; harvesters can be increased by optimizing the alignment of precursor CNT forests, plastically stretching the precursor twisted yarn, applying much higher tensile loads during pre&#8208;coiling twist than for coiling, using electrothermal pulse annealing under tension, and incorporating reduced graphene oxide nanoplates. The peak output power for a 1&#160;Hz and a 30&#160;Hz sinusoidal deformation were 0.73 and 3.19&#160;kW kg&#8211;1, which are 24 and 13&#8208;fold that of previous twistron harvesters at these respective frequencies. This performance at 30&#160;Hz was over 12&#8208;fold that of other prior&#8208;art mechanical energy harvesters for frequencies between 0.1&#160;Hz and 600&#160;Hz. The maximum energy conversion efficiency was 7.2&#8208;fold that for previous twistrons. Twistron anode and cathode yarn arrays were stretched 180&#176; out&#8208;of&#8208;phase by locating them in the negative and positive compressibility directions of hinged wine&#8208;rack frames, thereby doubling the output voltage and reducing the input mechanical energy.

Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are highly essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding seven years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are firstly addressed to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematical analysis on the published literatures and cutting&#8208;edge performances are then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progresses and the gap towards practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level is respectively discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives towards high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

         <title>Tunable Planar Focusing Based on Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar polariton focusing device based on the natural in&#8208;plane hyperbolic van der Waals material &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is developed, which achieves ultrahigh field compression and wide&#8208;range tunable performance. Moreover, a graphene/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is constructed, which supports hybrid modes consisting of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 phonon polaritons and graphene plasmons to achieve in situ dynamical control of the focal length.








Abstract
Manipulation of the propagation and energy&#8208;transport characteristics of subwavelength infrared (IR) light fields is critical for the application of nanophotonic devices in photocatalysis, biosensing, and thermal management. In this context, metamaterials are useful composite materials, although traditional metal&#8208;based structures are constrained by their weak mid&#8208;IR response, while their associated capabilities for optical propagation and focusing are limited by the size of attainable artificial optical structures and the poor performance of the available active means of control. Herein, a tunable planar focusing device operating in the mid&#8208;IR region is reported by exploiting highly oriented in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3. Specifically, an unprecedented change of effective focal length of polariton waves from 0.7 to 7.4 &#956;m is demonstrated by the following three different means of control: the dimension of the device, the employed light frequency, and engineering of phonon&#8211;plasmon hybridization. The high confinement characteristics of phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 permit the focal length and focal spot size to be reduced to 1/15 and 1/33 of the incident wavelength, respectively. In particular, the anisotropic phonon polaritons supported in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are combined with tunable surface&#8208;plasmon polaritons in graphene to realize in situ and dynamical control of the focusing performance, thus paving the way for phonon&#8208;polariton&#8208;based planar nanophotonic applications.

Moreover, a graphene/&#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure is constructed, which supports hybrid modes consisting of &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phonon polaritons and graphene plasmons to achieve in situ dynamical control of the focal length.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of the propagation and energy-transport characteristics of subwavelength infrared (IR) light fields is critical for the application of nanophotonic devices in photocatalysis, biosensing, and thermal management. In this context, metamaterials are useful composite materials, although traditional metal-based structures are constrained by their weak mid-IR response, while their associated capabilities for optical propagation and focusing are limited by the size of attainable artificial optical structures and the poor performance of the available active means of control. Herein, a tunable planar focusing device operating in the mid-IR region is reported by exploiting highly oriented in-plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Specifically, an unprecedented change of effective focal length of polariton waves from 0.7 to 7.4 &#956;m is demonstrated by the following three different means of control: the dimension of the device, the employed light frequency, and engineering of phonon&#8211;plasmon hybridization. The high confinement characteristics of phonon polaritons in &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; permit the focal length and focal spot size to be reduced to 1/15 and 1/33 of the incident wavelength, respectively. In particular, the anisotropic phonon polaritons supported in &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are combined with tunable surface-plasmon polaritons in graphene to realize in situ and dynamical control of the focusing performance, thus paving the way for phonon-polariton-based planar nanophotonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spanning Network Gels from Nanoparticles and Graph Theoretical Analysis of Their Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels of lead telluride nanoparticles are structurally characterized using graph theory. The morphology of the gels is quantified, identifying the effect of various salt concentrations and compositions on the connectivity of the network structures. Significant influence by divalent cations on gel structure is observed. Relationships between the structural descriptors and viscoelastic and charge transport properties are evaluated.








Abstract
Gels self&#8208;assembled from colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) translate the size&#8208;dependent properties of nanostructures to materials with macroscale volumes. Large spanning networks of NP chains provide high interconnectivity within the material necessary for a wide range of properties from conductivity to viscoelasticity. However, a great challenge for nanoscale engineering of such gels lies in being able to accurately and quantitatively describe their complex non&#8208;crystalline structure that combines order and disorder. The quantitative relationships between the mesoscale structural and material properties of nanostructured gels are currently unknown. Here, it is shown that lead telluride NPs spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into a spanning network hydrogel. By applying graph theory (GT), a method for quantifying the complex structure of the NP gels is established using a topological descriptor of average nodal connectivity that is found to correlate with the gel's mechanical and charge transport properties. GT descriptions make possible the design of non&#8208;crystalline porous materials from a variety of nanoscale components for photonics, catalysis, adsorption, and thermoelectrics.

         <title>Biaxial Strained MoS2 Nanoshells with Controllable Layers Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strain in layered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a type of effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance by activating their inert basal plane. However, compared with the traditional uniaxial strain, the influence of biaxial one and TMDs layer number on local electronic configuration remains unexplored. Herein, via a new in situ self&#8208;vulcanization strategy, we realize biaxial strained MoS2 nanoshells in the form of single&#8208;crystalline Ni3S2@MoS2 core&#8208;shell heterostructure, where the MoS2 layer is precisely controlled between 1 to 5 layers. In particular, the electrode with bilayer MoS2 nanoshells shows a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 78.1&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and negligible activity degradation after durability test. Density Functional Theory calculations reveal the contribution of optimized biaxial strain together with the induced sulfur vacancies and identify the origin of superior catalytic sites in these biaxial&#8208;strained MoS2 nanoshells. This work highlights the importance of the atomic&#8208;scale layer number and multiaxial strain in unlocking the potential of two&#8208;dimensional TMDs electrocatalysts.

         <title>Visualizing ultrafast defect&#8208;controlled interlayer electron&#8208;phonon coupling in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineering ultrafast interlayer coupling provides access to new quantum phenomena and novel device functionalities in atomically thin van der Waals heterostructures. However, due to all the atoms of a monolayer material being exposed at the interfaces, the interlayer coupling is extremely susceptible to defects, resulting in high energy dissipation through heat and low device performance. The study of how defects affect the interlayer coupling at ultrafast and atomic scales remains a challenge. Here, using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy, a new defect&#8208;induced ultrafast interlayer electron&#8208;phonon coupling pathway is identified in a WS2/graphene heterostructure, involving a three&#8208;body collision between electrons in WS2 and both acoustic phonons and defects in graphene. This interaction manifests as the reduced defect&#8208;related Raman resonant activity and the accelerated electron&#8208;phonon scattering time from 7.1&#160;ps to 2.4&#160;ps. Furthermore, we directly image the ultrafast interlayer coupling process. These insights will advance our fundamental knowledge of the heat dissipation in nanoscale devices, and enable new ways to dynamically manipulate electrons and phonons via defects in van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Magnetic Microswarm and Fluoroscopy&#8208;Guided Platform for Biofilm Eradication in Biliary Stents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biofilm eradication from medical implants is of fundamental importance, and the treatment of biofilm&#8208;associated pathogen infections on inaccessible biliary stents remains challenging. Magnetically driven microrobots with controlled motility, accessibility to the tiny lumen, and swarm enhancement effects can physically disrupt the deleterious biostructures while not developing drug resistance. We&#160;design magnetic urchin&#8208;like capsule robots (MUCRs) loaded with magnetic liquid metal droplets (MLMDs, antibacterial agents) using natural sunflower pollen, and explore the therapeutic effect of swarming MUCR@MLMDs for eradicating complex mixtures of bacterial biofilm within biliary stents collected from patients. The external magnetic field triggers the emergence of the microswarm and induces MLMDs to transform their shape into spheroids and rods with sharp edges. The inherent natural microspikes of MUCRs and the obtained sharp edges of MLMDs actively rupture the dense biological matrix and multiple species of embedded bacterial cells by exerting mechanical force, finally achieving synergistic biofilm eradication. The microswarm is precisely and rapidly deployed into the biliary stent via endoscopy in 10 minutes. Notably, fluoroscopy imaging is used to track and navigate the locomotion of microswarm in biliary stents in real&#8208;time. The microswarm has great potential for treating bacterial biofilm infections associated with medical&#160;implants.

         <title>Activated Ni&#8208;OH Bond in Catalyst Facilitates Nucleophile Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is of enormous significance for organic electrosynthesis and coupling for hydrogen generation. However, non&#8208;uniform NOR mechanism limits its development. For NOR involving electrocatalysis and organic chemistry, both the electrochemical step and non&#8208;electrochemical process should be taken into account. The NOR of nickel&#8208;based hydroxides includes the electrogenerated dehydrogenation of Ni2+&#8208;OH bond and spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process; the former determines electrochemical activity, and nucleophile oxidation pathway depends on the latter. Herein, we report the space&#8208;confinement&#8208;induced synthesis of Ni3Fe layered double hydroxide intercalated with single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt nanosheets (Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS). The synergy of interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects activates Ni&#8208;OH bonds, thus exhibiting an excellent NOR performance. The spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps of NOR were revealed, such as proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET; Ni3+&#8208;O + X&#8208;H = Ni2+&#8208;OH + X&#8226;), hydration, and rearrangement. Hence, the reaction pathway of NOR was deciphered, which not only helps to perfect NOR mechanism, but also provides inspiration for organic electrosynthesis.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Built Gating Boost Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221; is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. A catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst of ReS2&#8208;WS2/WS2 hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide the electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with electron&#8208;rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) obtained under the electric field for ReS2&#8208;WS2/WS2 catalyst with dual self&#8208;built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) of pure WS2 catalyst, which exhibits nearly 4 times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>van der Waals Exfoliation Processed Biopiezoelectric Submucosa Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted significant attention due to the potential effect of piezoelectricity on biological tissues and their versatile applications. However, the high cost and complexity of assembling and domain aligning biomolecules at a large scale, and the disordered arrangement of piezoelectric domains as well as the lack of ferroelectricity in natural biological tissues remain a roadblock toward practical applications. Here, utilizing the weak van der Waals interaction in the layered structure of small intestinal submucosa (SIS), we report a van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) process to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of the effective piezoelectric domain. Based on that, we reveal the piezoelectric property of SIS stemming from the collagen fibril, with piezoelectric coefficients up to 4.1 pm V&#8211;1 and in&#8208;plane polarization orientation parallel to the fibril axis. Furthermore, a biosensor based on the vdWE&#8208;processed SIS film with an in&#8208;plane electrode is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of approximately 250&#160;mV under the cantilever vibration condition. The vdWE method shows great potential in facilely fabricating ultrathin films of soft tissues and biosensors.

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Group Spacers in Glycolated Copolymers for High Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconducting polymers with oligoethylene glycol sidechains have attracted strong research interest for organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) applications. However, key molecular design rules for high&#8208;performance OECTs via efficient mixed electronic/ionic charge transport are still unclear. Herein, we&#160;synthesize and characterize new glycolated copolymers (gDPP&#8208;TTT and gDPP&#8208;TTVTT) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and thiophene&#8208;based (TTT or TTVTT) donor units for accumulation mode OECTs, where a long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group (C12) attached to DPP unit acts as a spacer distancing the oligoethylene glycol from the polymer backbone. gDPP&#8208;TTVTT shows the highest OECT transconductance (61.9 S cm&#8211;1) and high operational stability, compared to gDPP&#8208;TTT and their alkylated counterparts. Surprisingly, gDPP&#8208;TTVTT also shows high electronic charge mobility in field&#8208;effect transistor, suggesting efficient ion injection/diffusion without hindering its efficient electronic charge transport. The elongated donor unit (TTVTT) facilitates the hole polaron formation more localized to the donor unit, leading to faster and easier polaron formation with less impact on polymer structure during OECT operation, as opposed to the TTT unit. This is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We&#160;conclude that these simultaneously high electronic and ionic charge transport properties are achieved due to the long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer in amphipathic sidechains, providing an important molecular design rule for glycolated copolymers.

         <title>Studying plasmon dispersion of MXene for enhanced electromagnetic absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising candidates for electromagnetic (EM) shielding, saturable absorption, thermal therapy, and photocatalysis due to their excellent performance in EM absorption. Although the plasmon resonance in MXene can play a role in the EM absorption, such an effect has never been quantitatively analyzed yet due to the lack of knowledge of the plasmon dispersion of MXene, which is challengeable to measure for optical methods. Here, we measure the plasmon dispersions (frequency&#8208;momentum relation) for individual MXene nanoflakes with varied thicknesses by using the high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, which is corroborated by EM theoretical calculation. The plasmon dispersions show that plasmon frequency can be continuously modulated in the ultrabroad band (frequency domain below near&#8208;infrared) by changing the momentum (e.g., via control of the flake size). The increasing plasmon compression effect in flakes with decreasing layer number indicates that increasing the interlayer distance can effectively improve the plasmon compression and thus increase the EM absorption. For example, a 3&#160;nm interlayer distance can nearly double the plasmon&#8208;enhanced EM absorption in MXene nanostructures. Our work provides guidance for the design of advanced ultra&#8208;thin EM absorption materials for wide applications such as EM absorbers, EM shielding devices, photothermal and photocatalysis devices.

         <title>Vertical&#8208;Graphene&#8208;Reinforced Titanium Alloy Bipolar Plates in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directly grown vertical graphene (VG) coating is demonstrated to reinforce Ti alloy bipolar plates in fuel cells. Thus, the interfacial contact resistance of as&#8208;fabricated VG&#8208;coated Ti alloy decreases by &#8776;100 times compared with bare Ti alloy and its corrosion rate reduces by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in simulated proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) operating environments.








Abstract
The bipolar plate (BP) serves as one of the crucial components in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Among BP materials, metallic BPs are widely employed due to their outstanding comprehensive properties. However, the interfacial contact resistance (ICR) between BP and gas diffusion layer together with corrosion of metallic BP under acidic operating conditions degrades the performance and stability of PEMFCs. Herein, an approach is proposed for the surface reinforcement of titanium (Ti) alloy BPs, relying on a directly grown vertical graphene (VG) coating via the plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. Compared with bare Ti alloy, the corrosion rate of VG&#8208;coated Ti alloy reduces by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in the simulated PEMFC operating environments and ICR decreases by &#8776;100 times, while its thermal conductivity improves by &#8776;20% and water contact angle increases by 68.1&#176;. The results can be interpreted that the unique structure of VG enables excellent electrical and thermal conduction in PEMFCs, and the highly hydrophobic VG coating suppresses the penetration of corrosive liquid as well as contributing to water management. This study opens a new opportunity to reinforce metallic surfaces by the robust and versatile VG coating for high&#8208;performance electrodes used in energy and catalyst applications.

         <title>PET&#8208;CT Imaging of Polymeric Nanoparticle Tumor Accumulation in Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the docetaxel&#8208;entrapping polymeric nanoparticle CPC634 is radiolabeled with 89Zr and its potential as clinical tool for patients selection before starting treatment is evaluated. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of seven patients with solid tumors reveals that a low diagnostic dose of 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 accurately reflects on&#8208;treatment tumor accumulation which opens the possibility for patient stratification in cancer nanomedicine with polymeric nanoparticles.








Abstract
Several FDA/EMA&#8208;approved nanomedicines have demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles compared to their conventional chemotherapeutic counterparts. The next step to increase therapeutic efficacy depends on tumor accumulation, which can be highly heterogeneous. A clinical tool for patient stratification is urgently awaited. Therefore, a docetaxel&#8208;entrapping polymeric nanoparticle (89Zr&#8208;CPC634) is radiolabeled, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging is performed in seven patients with solid tumors with two different doses of CPC634: an on&#8208;treatment (containing 60 mg m&#8722;2 docetaxel) and a diagnostic (1&#8211;2 mg docetaxel) dose (NCT03712423). Pharmacokinetic half&#8208;life for 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 is mean 97.0 &#177; 14.4 h on&#8208;treatment, and 62.4 &#177; 12.9 h for the diagnostic dose (p&#160;= 0.003). At these doses accumulation is observed in 46% and 41% of tumor lesions with a median accumulation in positive lesions 96 h post&#8208;injection of 4.94 and 4.45%IA kg&#8722;1 (p&#160;= 0.91), respectively. In conclusion, PET/CT imaging with a diagnostic dose of 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 accurately reflects on&#8208;treatment tumor accumulation and thus opens the possibility for patient stratification in cancer nanomedicine with polymeric nanoparticles.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Black Gold Film with Ultrahigh Porosity for Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile dealloying strategy is proposed to fabricate the self&#8208;supporting black gold film with hierarchically porous structure and ultrahigh porosity. Owing to the unique nanoporous nanowire structure, varying nanogaps between the nanowires and massive microgaps, the nanoporous gold film enables efficient broadband absorption, excellent hydrophilicity and continuous water transport, thus achieving highly efficient solar steam generation.








Abstract
Plasmonic metals demonstrate significant potential for solar steam generation (SSG) because of their localized surface plasmon resonance effect. However, the inherently narrow absorption spectra of plasmonic metals significantly limit their applications. The fabrication of nanostructures is essential to achieve broadband solar absorption for high&#8208;efficiency vapor generation. Herein, a self&#8208;supporting black gold (Au) film with an ultrahigh porosity and a hierarchically porous structure is fabricated by formulating an extremely dilute Cu99Au1 precursor and controlling the dealloying process. In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the dealloying mechanism of Cu99Au1 in a 1 m HNO3 solution as that involving the phase transformation of Cu(Au) &#8594; Au(Cu) &#8594; Au, giant volume shrinkage (&#8776;87%), structural evolution/coarsening of ligaments, and development of ultrahigh porosity (86.2%). The multiscale structure, consisting of ultrafine nanoporous nanowires, aligned nanogaps, and various microgaps, provide efficient broadband absorption over 300&#8211;2500&#160;nm, excellent hydrophilicity, and continuous water transport. In particular, the nanoporous black Au film shows high SSG performance with an evaporation rate of 1.51&#160;kg m&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94.5% under a light intensity of 1&#160;kW m&#8211;2. These findings demonstrate that the nanoporous Au film has great potential for clean water production and seawater desalination.

         <title>Diminishing Interfacial Turbulence by Colloid&#8208;Polymer Electrolyte to Stabilize Zinc Ion Flux for Deep&#8208;Cycling Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a new design of colloid&#8208;polymer electrolyte (CPE) for use in Zn metal batteries is proposed to diminish interfacial disturbance and realize stable Zn2+ environment at deep cycling. The efficacies of the designed CPE are determined with a combination of density functional theory, finite element simulation, in situ Raman measurements, and electrochemical tests for Zn&#8208;based cells.








Abstract
The fluidity of aqueous electrolytes and undesired H2 evolution reaction (HER) can cause severe interfacial turbulence in aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs) at deep cycling with high capacities and current densities, which would further perturb ion flux and aggravate Zn dendrite growth. In this study, a colloid&#8208;polymer electrolyte (CPE) with special colloidal phase and suppressed HER is designed to diminish interfacial turbulence and boost deep Zn electrochemistry. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the quantitative migratory barriers of Zn2+ along the transport pathway in CPE demonstrate much smaller fluctuations compared with normal aqueous electrolyte, indicating that CPE can effectively diminish interfacial disturbance. Benefitting from this, the Zn2+ ion flux can be homogenized and deposited evenly on the electrode, which is confirmed by finite element simulation and in situ Raman measurements. Consequently, CPE enables stable operation of Zn//Cu cells even with high capacity (up to 20 mAh cm&#8722;2) and current density (up to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Zn//Na5V12O32 full&#8208;cell with N/P ratio as low as 1 (i.e., 100%&#160;Zn utilization). It is believed that this strategy opens a brand&#8208;new avenue based on CPE toward boosting deep&#8208;cycling electrochemistry in ZMBs and even other aqueous energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Establishing Thermal Infusion Method for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile thermal infusion approach is used to construct the multilevel electrode structure based on the porous Cu host for Zn metal anodes. The composite anode regulates the Zn deposition and inhibits the side reactions due to the in situ Cu&#8211;Zn solid solution and ZnO layer, thus achieving long&#8208;cycling aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Metallic zinc (Zn) having low cost, high capacity, environmentally friendly features is considered to be an attractive anode material for aqueous energy storage devices. However, dendritic growth and severe side reactions restrict the development of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Numerous 3D hosts are extensively explored to settle these issues, whereas the accessible prestoring of Zn metal into structured electrodes is challenging. Here, a thermal infusion strategy is first reported to create a stable composite Zn&#8208;based anode. Upon this melting&#8211;wetting&#8211;cooling process, the metallic Zn is densely and firmly encapsulated in the 3D skeleton, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Meanwhile, through in/ex situ tests, the formation of ZnO layer on the metallic Zn surface inhibits the hydrogen evolution reactions (1.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation during cycling. Consequently, the electrode enables a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell. The pouch cells pairing this novel anode and LiMn2O4 cathode maintain over 94 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity retention after 300 cycles. This research presents an innovative Zn anode structure and extendable prestoring metallic Zn method for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

A new catalog of zero&#8208;strain electrode material made of ultrasmall Si nanodots within metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF)&#8208;derived nanoreactors (Si NDs&#8834;MDN) is developed through a novel space&#8208;confined single&#8208;atom catalytic strategy. The Si NDs&#8834;MDN anode featuring both low strain and high capacity is completely distinct from the traditional single&#8208;crystal zero&#8208;strain materials, extending the concept of zero&#8208;strain electrode materials from single crystals to composite field.








Abstract
Developing zero&#8208;strain electrode materials with high capacity is crucial for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, a new zero&#8208;strain composite material made of ultrasmall Si nanodots (NDs) within metal organic framework&#8208;derived nanoreactors (Si NDs&#8834;MDN) through a novel space&#8208;confined catalytic strategy is reported. The unique Si NDs&#8834;MDN anode features a low strain (&lt;3%) and a high theoretical lithium storage capacity (1524 mAh g&#8208;1) which far surpasses the traditional single&#8208;crystal counterparts that suffer from a low capacity delivery. The zero&#8208;strain property is evidenced by substantial characterizations including ex/in situ transmission electron microscopy and mechanical simulations. The Si NDs&#8834;MDN exhibits superior cycling stability and high reversible capacity (1327 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles) in half&#8208;cells and high energy density (366&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 after 300 cycles) in a full cell. This study reports a new catalog of zero&#8208;strain electrode material with significantly improved capacity beyond the traditional single&#8208;crystal zero&#8208;strain materials.

Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitates the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;coupling, spin&#8208;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. In this perspective article, we review the progress and analyze the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D&#8208;materials to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and provide our insight to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for The Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on the cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In this review, we focus on introducing the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have the ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, this review will discuss the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions from a clinical perspective.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered non&#8208;van der Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was believed that the exfoliation of such materials was enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intra&#8208;layer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of inter&#8208;layer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of non&#8208;layered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here we examine progress in this unexpected new research area. We review the structure and properties of platelets produced by LPE of non&#8208;layered materials. We find a number of unexplained trends, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials which have been exfoliated to give high aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, we consider the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials.

         <title>Recent Structural Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors Incorporating Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of hydrogen bonds can enhance the planarity and rigidity of polymer semiconductors via noncovalent interactions, improve the charge transport, and offer polymers unique superiority of mechanical flexibility. This review describes the recent structural evolution of polymer semiconductors containing hydrogen bonds and the effect of hydrogen bonds on carrier mobility, self&#8208;healing, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Highly planar, extended &#960;&#8208;electron organic conjugated polymers have been increasingly attractive for achieving high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors. In addition to the conventional strategy to construct rigid backbone by covalent bonds, hydrogen bond has been employed extensively to increase the planarity and rigidity of polymer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. This review provides a general summary of high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers incorporating hydrogen bonds in field&#8208;effect transistors over recent years. The structural engineering of the hydrogen bond&#8208;containing building blocks and the discussion of theoretical simulation, microstructural characterization, and device performance are covered. Additionally, the effects of the introduction of hydrogen bond on self&#8208;healing, stretchability, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties are also discussed. The review aims to help and inspire design of new high&#8208;mobility conjugated polymers with superiority of mechanical flexibility by incorporation of hydrogen bond for the application in flexible electronics.

         <title>High Efficiency of over 25% and Long Device Lifetime of over 500 h at 1000 nit in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Optimized tandem device of the multi&#8208;resonance type blue emitter achieves high external quantum efficiency over 25% and extremely long device lifetime of over 500&#160;h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and 30000&#160;h at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 up to 95% of initial luminance.








Abstract
In this study, a multiple resonance (MR) type blue emitter is synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for highly efficient and stable blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The MR blue fluorescent emitter has a di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl benzene substituent in the MR core structure to minimize quenching mechanisms by intermolecular interaction. The emitter shows a high photoluminescence quantum yield and small full width at half maximum of 22 nm, which realize high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.4% in the single unit OLED and device lifetime up to 95% of the initial luminance (LT95) of 208 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and over 10&#160;000 h at 100 cd m&#8722;2. The optimized tandem device of the new blue emitter achieves high EQE over 25% and extremely long LT95 of over 500&#160;h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and 30&#160;000 h at 100 cd m&#8722;2. The lifetime of this work is one of the best data of blue OLED lifetime reported in the literature.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, a multiple resonance (MR) type blue emitter is synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for highly efficient and stable blue fluorescent organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The MR blue fluorescent emitter has a di-tert-butyl benzene substituent in the MR core structure to minimize quenching mechanisms by intermolecular interaction. The emitter shows a high photoluminescence quantum yield and small full width at half maximum of 22 nm, which realize high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.4% in the single unit OLED and device lifetime up to 95% of the initial luminance (LT&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;) of 208 h at 1000 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and over 10&#160;000 h at 100 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The optimized tandem device of the new blue emitter achieves high EQE over 25% and extremely long LT&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt; of over 500&#160;h at 1000 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 30&#160;000 h at 100 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The lifetime of this work is one of the best data of blue OLED lifetime reported in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Hydrogel for Efficient and Scalable Moisture&#8208;Electric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic hydrogel moisture electric generator (IHMEG) shows high power&#8208;output and stable voltage by virtue of synergistic effect of enhanced moisture&#8208;enabled protons diffusion and long&#8208;maintained water gradient. With easy&#8208;to&#8208;scaleup fabrication, high cost&#8208;efficiency, and wide adaptability to temperature and humidity, the IHMEG device holds great potentials to develop a green, efficient, flexible, and versatile direct&#8208;current power source for Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and wearable electronics.








Abstract
The progress of spontaneous energy generation from ubiquitous moisture is hindered the low output current and intermittent operating voltage of the moisture&#8208;electric generators. Herein a novel and efficient ionic hydrogel moisture&#8208;electric generator (IHMEG) is developed by rational combination of poly(vinyl alcohol), phytic acid, and glycerol&#8208;water binary solvent. Thanks to the synergistic effect of notable moisture&#8208;absorption capability and fast ion transport capability in the ionic hydrogel network, a single IHMEG unit of 0.25 cm2 can continuously generate direct&#8208;current electricity with a constant open&#8208;circuit voltage of &#8776;0.8&#160;V for over 1000 h, a high short&#8208;current density of 0.24 mA cm&#8722;2, and power density of up to 35 &#181;W cm&#8722;2. Of great importance is that large&#8208;scale integration of IHMEG units can be readily accomplished to offer a device with voltage up to 210&#160;V, capable of directly driving numerous commercial electronics, including electronic ink screen, metal electrodeposition setup, and light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode arrays. Such prominent performance is mainly attributed to the enhanced moisture&#8208;liberated proton diffusion proved by experimental observation and theoretical analysis. The ionic hydrogel with high cost&#8208;efficiency, easy&#8208;to&#8208;scaleup fabrication, and high power&#8208;output opens a brand&#8208;new perspective to develop a green, versatile, and efficient power source for Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and wearable electronics.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Buried Additive for Cross&#8208;Layer Modification in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 22%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up infiltration method using HCOONH4 as pre&#8208;buried additive in SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) enables a cross&#8208;layer defect manipulation throughout the SnO2 ETL, perovskite layer, and their interface, along with a significantly reduced residual stress within perovskite film. As a result of the cross&#8208;layer treatment, a record power conversion efficiency of 22.37% (21.90% certified) is achieved on the optimized flexible perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown superior potentials in flexible photovoltaics due to their soft and high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight nature. However, interfacial residual stress and lattice mismatch due to the large deformation of flexible substrates have greatly limited the performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). Here, ammonium formate (HCOONH4) is used as a pre&#8208;buried additive in electron transport layer (ETL) to realize a bottom&#8208;up infiltration process for an in situ, integral modification of ETL, perovskite layer, and their interface. The HCOONH4 treatment leads to an enhanced electron extraction in ETL, relaxed residual strain and micro&#8208;strain in perovskite film, along with reduced defect densities within these layers. As a result, a top power conversion efficiency of 22.37% and a certified 21.9% on F&#8208;PSCs are achieved, representing the highest performance reported so far. This work links the critical connection between multilayer mechanics/defect profiles of ETL&#8208;perovskite structure and device performance, thus providing meaningful scientific direction to further narrowing the efficiency gap between F&#8208;PSCs and rigid&#8208;substrate counterparts.

         <title>Bioinspired Colloidal Photonic Composites: Fabrications and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal photonic composites bioinspired by organic organisms combine ordered photonic structures and functional polymeric matrices, which show both structural color of photonic crystals and functionality and responsiveness of the polymeric matrix. Colloidal photonic composites exhibit a variety of promising applications, from colorful coatings to visual sensors, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence.








Abstract
Organisms in nature have evolved unique structural colors and stimuli&#8208;responsive functions for camouflage, warning, and communication over millions of years, which are essential to their survival in harsh conditions. Inspired by these characteristics, colloidal photonic composites (CPCs) composed of colloidal photonic crystals embedded in the polymeric matrix are artificially prepared and show great promise in applications. This review focuses on the summary of building blocks, i.e., colloidal particles and polymeric matrices, and constructive strategies from the perspective of designing CPCs with robust performance and specific functionality. Furthermore, their state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications are also discussed, including colorful coatings, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence, especially in the field of visualized sensing. Finally, current challenges and potential for future developments in this field are discussed. The purpose of this review is not only to clarify the design principle for artificial CPCs but also to serve as a roadmap for the exploration of next&#8208;generation photonic materials.

         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the advancements of antibody&#8208;incorporated nanomedicines for cancer therapy is offered. Diverse functionalization strategies, antibody formats, and cancer&#8208;associated antigens are introduced and discussed, with an emphasis on their latest applications in antibody&#8208;incorporated nanotherapeutics. The current limitations and future research directions on antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are also proposed.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;based cancer therapy, one of the most significant therapeutic strategies, has achieved considerable success and progress over the past decades. Nevertheless, obstacles including limited tumor penetration, short circulation half&#8208;lives, undesired immunogenicity, and off&#8208;target side effects remain to be overcome for the antibody&#8208;based cancer treatment. Owing to the rapid development of nanotechnology, antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines that have been extensively explored to overcome these obstacles have already demonstrated enhanced anticancer efficacy and clinical translation potential. This review intends to offer an overview of the advancements of antibody&#8208;incorporated nanoparticulate systems in cancer treatment, together with the nontrivial challenges faced by these next&#8208;generation nanomedicines. Diverse strategies of antibody immobilization, formats of antibodies, types of cancer&#8208;associated antigens, and anticancer mechanisms of antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are provided and discussed in this review, with an emphasis on the latest applications. The current limitations and future research directions on antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are also discussed from different perspectives to provide new insights into the construction of anticancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Engineered Living Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of engineering, biology, and materials science is providing unprecedented opportunities to integrate living microbes into hydrogel matrices. This integration constructs engineered living hydrogels with the capability of performing tasks associated with living microbes such as self&#8208;replication, self&#8208;adaption, and environmental responsiveness.








Abstract
Living biological systems, ranging from single cells to whole organisms, can sense, process information, and actuate in response to changing environmental conditions. Inspired by living biological systems, engineered living cells and nonliving matrices are brought together, which gives rise to the technology of engineered living materials. By designing the functionalities of living cells and the structures of nonliving matrices, engineered living materials can be created to detect variability in the surrounding environment and to adjust their functions accordingly, thereby enabling applications in health monitoring, disease treatment, and environmental remediation.

&lt;p&gt;The convergence of engineering, biology, and materials science is providing unprecedented opportunities to integrate living microbes into hydrogel matrices. This integration constructs engineered living hydrogels with the capability of performing tasks associated with living microbes such as self-replication, self-adaption, and environmental responsiveness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living biological systems, ranging from single cells to whole organisms, can sense, process information, and actuate in response to changing environmental conditions. Inspired by living biological systems, engineered living cells and nonliving matrices are brought together, which gives rise to the technology of engineered living materials. By designing the functionalities of living cells and the structures of nonliving matrices, engineered living materials can be created to detect variability in the surrounding environment and to adjust their functions accordingly, thereby enabling applications in health monitoring, disease treatment, and environmental remediation. Hydrogels, a class of soft, wet, and biocompatible materials, have been widely used as matrices for engineered living cells, leading to the nascent field of engineered living hydrogels.

         <title>Advances in SnO2 for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances of SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the related interface optimization strategies and applications. The fundamental properties of SnO2 are discussed, with a focus on the defect chemistry, and various preparation methods for improving SnO2 and SnO2/perovskite interface. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for further development of SnO2&#8208;based PSCs are provided.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the regular n&#8211;i&#8211;p device architecture have reached above 25% certified efficiency with continuously reported improvements in recent years. A key common factor for these recent breakthroughs is the development of SnO2 as an effective electron transport layer in these devices. In this article, the key advances in SnO2 development are reviewed, including various deposition approaches and surface treatment strategies, to enhance the bulk and interface properties of SnO2 for highly efficient and stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs. In addition, the general materials chemistry associated with SnO2 along with the corresponding materials challenges and improvement strategies are discussed, focusing on defects, intrinsic properties, and impact on device characteristics. Finally, some SnO2 implementations related to scalable processes and flexible devices are highlighted, and perspectives on the future development of efficient and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules are also provided.

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Depleting Organic Metal Adjuvants for Effective NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic metal adjuvants, assembled from charge&#8208;transfer complexes and characterized by broad substrate scope, high accessibility, and flexibly&#8208;tuned optical properties, demonstrate strong second near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic and photothermal properties as well as high adjuvant abilities by perturbing redox homeostasis to potentiate immunogenicity and immune responsiveness.








Abstract
Although photothermal immunotherapy (PTI) is a compelling strategy for tumor therapy, the development of promising photothermal agents to overcome the insufficient immunogenicity of tumor cells and the poor immune response encountered in PTI is still challenging. Herein, commercial small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based organic metal adjuvants (OMAs) are presented, with second near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic and photothermal properties as well as the ability to perturb redox homeostasis to potentiate immunogenicity and immune responsiveness. OMAs, assembled from charge&#8208;transfer complexes and characterized by a broad substrate scope, high accessibility, and flexibly tuned optical properties, demonstrate strong phototherapeutic and adjuvant abilities via the depletion of glutathione and cysteine, and subsequently elicit systemic immunity by evoking immunogenic cell death, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and increasing T cell infiltration. Furthermore, programmed cell death protein 1 antibody can be employed to synergize with OMAs to suppress tumor immune evasion and ultimately improve the treatment outcomes. This study unlocks new paradigms to provide a versatile OMA&#8208;based scaffold for future practical applications.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline Water/Seawater Hydrogen Evolution by a Nanorod&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Structured Ni&#8208;MoN Catalyst with Fast Water&#8208;Dissociation Kinetics</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanorod&#8211;nanoparticle&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;MoN is prepared as an efficient HER catalyst for alkaline water and seawater electrolysis. Benefiting from the high and stable catalytic performance, this Ni&#8208;MoN can be combined with stainless&#8208;steel mat for overall water/seawater electrolysis. This assembled electrolyzer can be driven by a thermoelectric module to generate hydrogen.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and durable nonprecious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for scaling up alkaline water/seawater electrolysis is desirable but remains a significant challenge. Here, a heterogeneous Ni&#8208;MoN catalyst consisting of Ni and MoN nanoparticles on amorphous MoN nanorods that can sustain large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER with outstanding performance is demonstrated. The hierarchical nanorod&#8211;nanoparticle structure, along with a large surface area and multidimensional boundaries/defects endows the catalyst with abundant active sites. The hydrophilic surface helps to achieve accelerated gas&#8208;release capabilities and is effective in preventing catalyst degradation during water electrolysis. Theoretical calculations further prove that the combination of Ni and MoN effectively modulates the electron redistribution at their interface and promotes the sluggish water&#8208;dissociation kinetics at the Mo sites. Consequently, this Ni&#8208;MoN catalyst requires low overpotentials of 61 and 136&#160;mV to drive current densities of 100 and 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in 1 m KOH and remains stable during operation for 200 h at a constant current density of 100 or 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This good HER catalyst also works well in alkaline seawater electrolyte and shows outstanding performance toward overall seawater electrolysis with ultralow cell voltages.

         <title>Plasmonic Fluorescence Enhancement in Diagnostics for Clinical Tests at Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care: A Review of Recent Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid development of plasmonics leads to the evolvement of metal nanostructures capable of dramatic enhancement of fluorophore emission. For fluorescence&#8208;based biosensors, plasmonic nanomaterials may enable improved detection sensitivity or use of low&#8208;cost detectors for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. This review provides a summary of existing biosensing technologies using different plasmonic nanostructures such as planar substrates, nanoparticles, and nanogap cavities and their future perspective.








Abstract
Fluorescence&#8208;based biosensors have widely been used in the life&#8208;sciences and biomedical applications due to their low limit of detection and a diverse selection of fluorophores that enable simultaneous measurements of multiple biomarkers. Recent research effort has been made to implement fluorescent biosensors into the exploding field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), which uses cost&#8208;effective strategies for rapid and affordable diagnostic testing. However, fluorescence&#8208;based assays often suffer from their feeble signal at low analyte concentrations, which often requires sophisticated, costly, and bulky instrumentation to maintain high detection sensitivity. Metal&#8208; and metal oxide&#8208;based nanostructures offer a simple solution to increase the output signal from fluorescent biosensors due to the generation of high field enhancements close to a metal or metal oxide surface, which has been shown to improve the excitation rate, quantum yield, photostability, and radiation pattern of fluorophores. This article provides an overview of existing biosensors that employ various strategies for fluorescence enhancement via nanostructures and have demonstrated the potential for use as POCT. Biosensors using nanostructures such as planar substrates, freestanding nanoparticles, and metal&#8211;dielectric&#8211;metal nanocavities are discussed with an emphasis placed on technologies that have shown promise towards POCT applications without the need for centralized laboratories.

Atomically dispersed Ru and Co dual&#8208;sites anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C) is developed as an efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal water splitting.








Abstract
The development of bifunctional water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysts that are efficient and stable over a wide range of pH is of great significance but challenging. Here, an atomically dispersed Ru/Co dual&#8208;sites catalyst is reported anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C) for outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst requires the overpotential of only 13 and 23&#160;mV for HER, 232 and 247&#160;mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 1 m KOH, respectively, outperforming benchmark catalysts Pt/C and RuO2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Co&#8211;N4 sites into Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C efficiently modify the electronic structure of Ru by enlarging Ru&#8211;O covalency and increasing Ru electron density, which in turn optimize the bonding strength between oxygen/hydrogen intermediate species with Ru sites, thereby enhancing OER and HER performance. Furthermore, the incorporation of Co&#8211;N4 sites induces electron redistribution around Ru&#8211;N4, thus enhancing corrosion&#8211;resistance of Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C during acid and alkaline electrolysis. The Ru/Co&#8211;N&#8211;C has been applied in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer and steady operation is demonstrated at a high current density of 450&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 for 330 h.

         <title>Two&#8208;Pronged Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Antigen and Adjuvant for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A cancer nanovaccine is constructed by encapsulating ovalbumin257&#8208;264 peptide (OVAp) and cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine (CpG) DNA co&#8208;conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles with dendritic cells (DC)&#8208;targeting lipid films for co&#8208;delivering OVAp and CpG into cytosol and lysosomes of DCs to maximize their synergistic effects. The nanovaccine accumulated in the DCs of draining lymph nodes effectively increases the antigen&#8208;specific T cell response against tumor.








Abstract
Nanovaccines have emerged as promising alternatives or complements to conventional cancer treatments. Despite the progresses, specific co&#8208;delivery of antigen and adjuvant to their corresponding intracellular destinations for maximizing the activation of antitumor immune responses remains a challenge. Herein, a lipid&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticle is delivered as nanovaccine (IONP&#8208;C/O@LP) that can co&#8208;deliver peptide antigen and adjuvant (CpG DNA) into cytosol and lysosomes of dendritic cells (DCs) through both membrane fusion and endosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Such two&#8208;pronged cellular uptake pattern enables IONP&#8208;C/O@LP to synergistically activate immature DCs. Iron oxide nanoparticle also exhibits adjuvant effects by generating intracellular reactive oxygen species, which further promotes DC maturation. IONP&#8208;C/O@LP accumulated in the DCs of draining lymph nodes effectively increases the antigen&#8208;specific T cells in both tumor and spleen, inhibits tumor growth, and improves animal survival. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this nanovaccine is a general platform of delivering clinically relevant peptide antigens derived from human papilloma virus 16 to trigger antigen&#8208;specific immune responses in vivo.

         <title>Thermoplasmonics in Solar Energy Conversion: Materials, Nanostructured Designs, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent developments of thermoplasmonics in the solar energy field. The physics fundamentals behind thermoplasmonics are elaborated, basic strategies of material and nanostructured designs toward more efficient photothermal conversion are summarized. Then, recent advances are reviewed for targeted applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaics. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.








Abstract
The indispensable requirement for sustainable development of human society has forced almost all countries to seek highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective ways to harvest and convert solar energy. Though continuous progress has advanced, it remains a daunting challenge to achieve full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption and maximize the conversion efficiency of sunlight. Recently, thermoplasmonics has emerged as a promising solution, which involves several beneficial effects including enhanced light absorption and scattering, generation and relaxation of hot carriers, as well as localized/collective heating, offering tremendous opportunities for optimized energy conversion. Besides, all these functionalities can be tailored via elaborated designs of materials and nanostructures. Here, first the fundamental physics governing thermoplasmonics is presented and then the strategies for both material selection and nanostructured designs toward more efficient energy conversion are summarized. Based on this, recent progress in thermoplasmonic applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaic is reviewed. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Obstructed surface states as the descriptor for predicting catalytic active sites in inorganic crystalline materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient and sustainable is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes[3]. This requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins, which remains a challenge[5].&#160;Here we describe a novel method to identify the position of active sites based on searching for crystalline symmetry&#8208;protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states[9]. The obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic obstructed surface states (OSSs)[10]. We proposed and confirmed that the OSSs are the catalytic activity origins for crystalline materials. We verified our theory on 2H&#8208;MoTe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2, and NiPS3 bulk single crystals, whose active sites are consistent with our calculations. Most importantly, we successfully identified several high&#8208;efficiency catalysts just by considering the number of OWCCs and the symmetry. Using the real space invariant theory applied to a database of 34013 topologically trivial insulators, we have identified 1788 unique OAIs[10], of which 465 are potential high&#8208;performance catalysts. Our new methodology will facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions.

         <title>Boosting Electrochemical Styrene Transformation via Tandem Water Oxidation over Single&#8208;Atom Cr1/CoSe2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organics using water as the oxygen source is a prospective but challenging method to produce high value&#8208;added chemicals, especially the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its efficiency. Herein, we present a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single&#8208;atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at CoSe2 support (Cr1/CoSe2). Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under the potential of 1.6 VAg/AgCl, it achieves excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent. Isotopic tracing, isotope&#8208;labeled in&#8208;situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from Co to Cr sites serves as the bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co&#8208;oxidation of multi&#8208;species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Simultaneous electrochemical exfoliation and covalent functionalization of MoS2 membrane for ion sieving</title>

Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) membranes exhibit good anti&#8208;swelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, we report a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication, which was accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium ion intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 was optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets was improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes were tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;&#160;90% and &gt;&#160;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes were attributed to the suitable channel widths that were tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions were also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the MoS2&#8208;amide layers while a double layer between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

         <title>Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off forming a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, the in&#8208;service formed defects will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, we present a dynamic healing interface (DHI) by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts a PCE to 12.05% for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for CsPbI2Br cell as well as 23.37% for FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Healing charge-selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state-of-the-art strategies are often static by one-off forming a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, the in-service formed defects will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, we present a dynamic healing interface (DHI) by incorporating a low-melting-point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Structural Reconstruction of Catalysts in Electroreduction Reaction: Identifying, Understanding, and Manipulating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electroreduction transformation of small molecules (CO2, N2 and H2O) into chemical feedstocks offers a promising approach to eliminate carbon emissions and harness renewable energy. Most cathodic catalysts often undergo structural transformation under operating electroreduction condition. These structural reconstructions are reflected in the changes of their catalytic activity. In&#8208;depth understanding of the change of active sites and influence parameters of reconstructed behaviors are an essential precondition for the design of highly efficient catalysts. Despite the previous achievements, a comprehensive insight of the structural evolution mechanism in cathodic catalysts compared to anode ones under the reaction conditions are still lacking. Herein, we provide an overview of structural reconstruction for cathodic catalysts in terms of fundamental mechanisms, reconstruction process, advanced characterizations, and influence parameters. On this basis, the typical strategies for manipulating the structural reconfiguration of catalysts are also explicitly discussed from the catalyst structure and working environment. By delivering the mechanism, strategies, insights, and techniques, this review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural reconstruction of cathodic catalysts in electroreduction reaction and future guidelines for their rational development.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mid&#8208;infrared Biosensing in Aqueous Solutions with Graphene Plasmon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Identifying nanoscale biomolecules in aqueous solutions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides an in&#8208;situ and non&#8208;invasive method for exploring the structure, reactions, and transport of biologically active molecules. However, this remains a challenge due to the strong and broad infrared (IR) absorption of water which overwhelms the respective vibrational fingerprints of the biomolecules. In this work, we exploit a tunable IR transparent microfluidic system with graphene plasmon to identify &#8764;2&#160;nm thick protein molecules in physiological conditions. The acquired in&#8208;situ tunability make it possible to eliminate the IR absorption of water outside the graphene plasmonic hotspots by background subtraction. Most importantly, the ultrahigh confinement of graphene plasmons (confined to &#8764;15&#160;nm) permits the implementation of nanoscale sensitivity. Then, the deuterium effects on monolayer proteins are characterized within an aqueous solution. The tunable graphene plasmon&#8208;enhanced FTIR technology provides a novel platform for studying biological processes in an aqueous solution at the nanoscale.

         <title>Reinforced layered double hydroxide oxygen evolution electrocatalysts: polyoxometallic acid wet&#8208;etching approach and synergistic mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDH) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis (OER). However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance&#8208;influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, we report a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including three dimensional morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe and O vacancies and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. Our experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance&#8208;influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanism dominantly contribute to the step&#8208;like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH&#8208;PMo12(+) &#8214; Ni@NiFe LDH(&#8208;) for alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;electrode&#8208;stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure&#8208;activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Powered Janus Cell Robots Loaded with Oncolytic Adenovirus for Active and Targeted Virotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A unique robotic medical platform is designed by utilizing cell robots as the active &#8220;trojan horse&#8221; of oncolytic adenovirus (OA), capable of tumor&#8208;selective binding and killing. The OA&#8208;loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA&#8208;infected 293T cells with cyclic&#8208;RGD peptide (cRGD) to specific bind with bladder cancer cells, followed with asymmetric immobilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release virus progeny to surrounding tumor site for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell&#8208;based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.

The OA-loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA-infected 293T cells with cyclic-RGD peptide (cRGD) to specific bind with bladder cancer cells, followed with asymmetric immobilization of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release virus progeny to surrounding tumor site for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the three-dimensional (3D) cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell-based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Owing to the rapid developments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both experimental and computational investigative methodologies, the massive amounts of data generated have led the field of materials science into the fourth paradigm of data&#8208;driven scientific research. This transition requires the development of authoritative and up&#8208;to&#8208;date frameworks for data&#8208;driven approaches for material innovation. This review presents a critical discussion on the current advances in the data&#8208;driven discovery of materials with a focus on frameworks, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, material&#8208;specific databases, descriptors, and targeted applications in the field of inorganic materials. Frameworks for rationalizing data&#8208;driven material innovation are described, and a critical review of essential sub&#8208;disciplines is presented, including (i) advanced data&#8208;intensive strategies and machine&#8208;learning algorithms; (ii) material databases and related tools and platforms for data generation and management; (iii) commonly used molecular descriptors used in data&#8208;driven processes. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth discussion on the broad applications of material innovation, such as energy conversion and storage, environmental decontamination, flexible electronics, optoelectronics, superconductors, metallic glasses, and magnetic materials, is provided. Finally, how these sub&#8208;disciplines (with insights into the synergy of materials science, computational tools, and mathematics) support data&#8208;driven paradigms is outlined, and the opportunities and challenges in data&#8208;driven material innovation are highlighted.

         <title>Untangling the mechanisms of lattice distortions in biogenic crystals across scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Biomineralized structures are complex functional hierarchical assemblies composed of biomineral building blocks joined together by an organic phase. The formation of individual mineral units is governed by the cellular tissue component that orchestrates the process of biomineral nucleation, growth and morphogenesis. These processes are imprinted in the structural, compositional and crystallographic properties of the emerging biominerals on all scales. Measurement of these properties can provide crucial information on the mechanisms that are employed by the organism to form these complex three&#8208;dimensional architectures and to unravel principles of their functionality. Nevertheless, so far, this was only possible at the macroscopic scale, by averaging the properties of the entire composite assembly, or at the mesoscale, by looking at extremely small parts of the entire picture. In this study we employ the newly developed synchrotron&#8208;based Dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray Microscopy method to study the link between three&#8208;dimensional crystallographic properties of relatively large calcitic prisms in the shell of the mollusc Pinna nobilis and their local lattice properties with extremely high angular resolution down to 0.001&#176;. We unravel mechanistic links between variations in local lattice parameters and spacing, crystal orientation, chemical composition and the deposition process of the entire mineral unit.

         <title>Rational Development of a Polysaccharide&#8211;Protein&#8208;Conjugated Nanoparticle Vaccine Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants and Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bivalent nanoparticle vaccine is rationally developed by conjugating capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 with the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. Immunization with this vaccine induces potent protective immune responses against both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and S. pneumoniae. This universal polysaccharide&#8211;protein&#8208;conjugated vaccine platform provides a new tool to fight against cocirculating viral and bacterial pathogens.








Abstract
The ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has led to millions of deaths worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) remains a major cause of mortality in underdeveloped countries. A vaccine that prevents both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and S. pneumoniae infection represents a long&#8208;sought &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;. Herein, a nanoparticle vaccine, termed SCTV01B, is rationally developed by using the capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 (PPS14) as the backbone to conjugate with the recombinant receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. The final formulation of conjugated nanoparticles in the network structure exhibits high thermal stability. Immunization with SCTV01B induces potent humoral and Type 1/Type 2 T helper cell (Th1/Th2) cellular immune responses in mice, rats, and rhesus macaques. In particular, SCTV01B&#8208;immunized serum not only broadly cross&#8208;neutralizes all SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern (VOCs), including the most recent Omicron variant, but also shows high opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against S. pneumoniae serotype 14. Finally, SCTV01B vaccination confers protection against challenges with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mouse&#8208;adapted strain and the original strain in established murine models. Collectively, these promising preclinical results support further clinical evaluation of SCTV01B, highlighting the potency of polysaccharide&#8208;RBD&#8208;conjugated nanoparticle vaccine platforms for the development of vaccines for COVID&#8208;19 and other infectious diseases.

         <title>In Situ Inorganic Ligand Replenishment Enables Bandgap Stability in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bandgap&#8208;stable and efficient CsPbBrxI3&#8722;x perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are demonstrated by adopting an in situ inorganic ligand exchange. This strategy enables bandgap&#8208;stable mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with nanocrystal colloidal stability exceeding 1&#160;year at ambient conditions. The PLEDs exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.4% and sixfold&#8208;enhanced operating stability relative to the most stable prior red perovskite LEDs having EQEs &gt;20%.








Abstract
Instability in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs) is a key issue limiting perovskite solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). One form of instability arises during the processing of MHP quantum dots using an antisolvent to precipitate and purify the dots forming surface traps that lead to decreased luminescence, compromised colloidal stability, and emission broadening. Here, the introduction of inorganic ligands in the antisolvents used in dot purification is reported in order to overcome this problem. MHPs that are colloidally stable for over 1&#160;year at 25&#160;&#176;C&#160;and 40% humidity are demonstrated and films that are stable under 100&#160;W cm&#8722;2 photoirradiation, 4&#215; longer than the best previously reported MHPs, are reported. In LEDs, the materials enable an EQE of 24.4% (average 22.5&#160;&#177; 1.3%) and narrow emission (full&#8208;width at half maximum of 30&#160;nm). Sixfold&#8208;enhanced operating stability relative to the most stable prior red perovskite LEDs having external quantum efficiency &gt;20% is reported.

Semiconducting two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers feature synthetically tailored porosity and thus show both efficient electronic and ion transport. It is shown that two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) can be patterned on the micrometer scale, and can be used as the active material for organic electrochemical transistors.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are devices with broad potential in bioelectronic sensing, circuits, and neuromorphic hardware. Their unique properties arise from the use of organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs) as the active channel. Typical OMIECs are linear polymers, where defined and controlled microstructure/morphology, and reliable characterization of transport and charging can be elusive. Semiconducting two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) present a new avenue in OMIEC materials development, enabling electronic transport along with precise control of well&#8208;defined channels ideal for ion transport/intercalation. To this end, a recently reported 2DP, TIIP, is synthesized and patterned at 10&#160;&#181;m resolution as the channel of a transistor. The TIIP films demonstrate textured microstructure and show semiconducting properties with accessible oxidation states. Operating in an aqueous electrolyte, the 2DP&#8208;OECT exhibits a device&#8208;scale hole mobility of 0.05 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and a &#181;C* figure of merit of 1.75 F cm&#8211;1 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. 2DP OMIECs thus offer new synthetic degrees of freedom to control OECT performance and may enable additional opportunities such as ion selectivity or improved stability through reduced morphological modulation during device operation.

         <title>Sr&#8208;Doped Superionic Hydrogen Glass: Synthesis and Properties of SrH22</title>

Abstract
Recently, several research groups announced reaching the point of metallization of hydrogen above 400&#160;GPa. Despite a notable progress, detecting superconductivity in compressed hydrogen remains an unsolved problem. Following the mainstream of extensive investigations of compressed metal polyhydrides, here we demonstrate that small doping by strontium leads to a dramatic reduction in the metallization pressure of molecular hydrogen to about 200&#160;GPa. Studying the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of the Sr&#8211;H system, we observed the formation of several new phases: C2/mSr3H13, pseudocubic SrH6, SrH9 with cubic F43m Sr sublattice, and pseudo tetragonal superionic P1SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content (96 at. %) discovered so far. High diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in the latter phase DH = 0.2&#8208;2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;9 m2/s indicate an amorphous state of the H&#8208;sublattice, whereas the strontium sublattice remains solid. Unlike Ca and Y, strontium forms molecular semiconducting polyhydrides, whereas calcium and yttrium polyhydrides are high&#8208;TC superconductors with an atomic H sublattice. Discovered SrH22, a kind of hydrogen sponge, opens a new class of materials with ultra&#8208;high content of hydrogen.

         <title>Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst in&#8208;situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium Metal &#8211; Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
This is the first report of a molybdenum carbide&#8208;based electrocatalyst for sulfur&#8208;based sodium metal batteries (SMBs/NMBs). MoC/Mo2C is in&#8208;situ grown on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50wt.%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8208;S. Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in&#8208;situ time&#8208;resolved Raman, XPS and optical analysis demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8208;S cathodes delivered among the most promising rate performance characteristics in literature, achieving 987 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, 818 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and 621 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64wt.%&#160;S,&#160;12.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) also show cycling stability, with anode degradation due to deep plating/stripping driving capacity decay. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that formation energy of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x &#8804; 4) on surface of MoC/Mo2C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x &#8804; 4) on MoC/Mo2C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides&#8217; surface.

         <title>Programming Cellular Alignment in Engineered Cardiac Tissue via Bioprinting Anisotropic Organ Building Blocks</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability to replicate the three&#8208;dimensional myocardial architecture found in human hearts is a grand challenge. Here, we report the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs). We first generated a bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs and printed aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features. Next, we printed aligned cardiac macrofilaments, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increased over time and exceeded the performance of spheroid&#8208;based cardiac tissues. Finally, we highlighted the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment. Our research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellularly alignment.

         <title>Preparation of Amorphous SnO2&#8208;Encapsulated Multi&#8208;Phased Crystalline Cu Heterostructures for Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>

Abstract
Controlling the architectures and crystal phases of metal@semiconductor heterostructures is very important for modulating their physicochemical properties and enhancing their application performances. Here, we report a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize three types of amorphous SnO2&#8208;encapsulated crystalline Cu heterostructures, i.e., hemicapsule, yolk&#8208;shell and core&#8208;shell nanostructures, in which unconventional crystal phases (e.g., 2H, 4H, and 6H) and defects (e.g., stacking faults and twin boundaries), have been observed in the crystalline Cu cores. The hemicapsule Cu@SnO2 heterostructures, with voids that not only expose the Cu core with unconventional phases but also retain the interface between Cu and SnO2, show an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity towards the production of CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% in a wide potential window from &#8208;1.05 to &#8208;1.55&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the highest FE of CO2RR (95.3%) has been obtained at &#8208;1.45&#160;V (versus RHE). This work opens up a new way for the synthesis of new heterostructured nanomaterials with promising catalytic application.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Control with Curie Temperature above 400 K in a van der Waals Ferromagnet for Spintronic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The technological appeal of van der Waals ferromagnetic materials is the ability to control magnetism under external fields with desired thickness towards novel spintronic applications. For practically useful devices, ferromagnetism above room temperature or tunable magnetic anisotropy is highly demanded but remains challenging. To date, only a few layered materials exhibit unambiguous ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature via gating techniques or interface engineering. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy control and dramatic modulation of Curie temperature (Tc) up to 400 K are realized in layered Fe5GeTe2 via the high&#8208;pressure diamond&#8208;anvil&#8208;cell technique. Magnetic phases manifesting with in&#8208;plane anisotropic, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropic and nearly&#8208;isotropic magnetic states can be tuned in a controllable way, depicted by the phase diagram with a maximum Tc up to 360 K. Remarkably, the Tc can be gradually enhanced to above 400 K owing to the Fermi surface evolution during a pressure loading&#8208;deloading process. Such an observation sheds light on the understanding and control of emergent magnetic states in practical spintronic applications.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Cloning, Moir&#233; Flat Bands and Magic Lattice Constants in Epitaxial Monolayer Graphene</title>

Abstract
Tuning interactions between Dirac states in graphene has attracted enormous interest because it can modify the electronic spectrum of the two&#8208;dimensional material, enhance electron correlations, and give rise to novel condensed&#8208;matter phases such as superconductors, Mott insulators, Wigner crystals and quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Previous works predominantly focus on the flat band dispersion of coupled Dirac states from different twisted graphene layers. In this work, we&#160;propose a new route to realizing flat band physics in monolayer graphene under a periodic modulation from substrates. We&#160;take graphene/SiC heterostructure as a prototypical example and demonstrate experimentally that the substrate modulation leads to Dirac fermion cloning and consequently, the proximity of the two Dirac cones of monolayer graphene in momentum space. Our&#160;theoretical modeling captures the cloning mechanism of Dirac states and indicates that Moir&#233; flat bands can emerge at certain magic lattice constants of the substrate, specifically when the period of modulation becomes nearly commensurate with the (3&#215;3)R30&#8728;$(\sqrt {3}\times \sqrt {3})R30^{\circ }$ supercell of graphene. The results show that epitaxial single monolayer graphene on suitable substrates is a promising platform for exploring exotic many&#8208;body quantum phases arising from interactions between Dirac&#160;electrons.

         <title>Biomimetic and Biologically Compliant Soft Architectures via 3D and 4D Assembly Methods: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in soft material chemistry as it relates to direct ink writing and directed assembly through compressive buckling is discussed in relation to advances in 4D fabrication. The discussion focuses on the chemistry of important classes of soft materials, such as gels and elastomers, specifically in ways that allow new possibilities for biomimetic and biologically compliant forms of design.








Abstract
Recent progress in soft material chemistry and enabling methods of 3D and 4D fabrication&#8212;emerging programmable material designs and associated assembly methods for the construction of complex functional structures&#8212;is highlighted. The underlying advances in this science allow the creation of soft material architectures with properties and shapes that programmably vary with time. The ability to control composition from the molecular to the macroscale is highlighted&#8212;most notably through examples that focus on biomimetic and biologically compliant soft materials. Such advances, when coupled with the ability to program material structure and properties across multiple scales via microfabrication, 3D printing, or other assembly techniques, give rise to responsive (4D) architectures. The challenges and prospects for progress in this emerging field in terms of its capacities for integrating chemistry, form, and function are described in the context of exemplary soft material systems demonstrating important but heretofore difficult&#8208;to&#8208;realize biomimetic and biologically compliant behaviors.

         <title>Gradient Doping in Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites by Barium Ions for Efficient Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium ions are reported to effectively n&#8208;dope perovskites. Distribution of the barium ions and related n&#8208;doping effect is in a gradient across the perovskite film, resulting in a homojunction, which facilitates the separation and transport of the photogenerated carriers. Carrier diffusion length &gt;2&#160;&#181;m and boosted efficiencies of 21.2% for single&#8208;junction cell and 25.3% for all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell are achieved.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskites generally have a high density of unintentional p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping, which reduces the charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes, diffusion lengths, and device efficiencies. Here, a&#160;p&#8211;n&#160;homojunction across the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite is demonstrated, which results from a gradient doping by barium ions (Ba2+). It is reported that 0.1&#160;mol% Ba2+ can effectively compensate the p&#8208;doping of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites or even turns it to n&#8208;type without changing its bandgap. Ba2+ cations are found to stay at the interstitial sites and work as shallow electron donor. In addition, Ba2+ cations show a unique heterogeneous distribution in perovskite film. Most of the barium ions stay in the top 600&#160;nm region of the perovskite films and turn it into weakly n&#8208;type, while the bottom portion of the film remains as p&#8208;type. The gradient doping forms a homojunction from top to bottom of the perovskite films with a built&#8208;in field that facilitates extraction of photogenerated carriers, resulting in an increased carrier extraction length. This strategy enhances the efficiency of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite single&#8208;junction solar cells to over 21.0% and boosts the efficiencies of monolithic perovskite&#8211;perovskite tandem solar cells to 25.3% and 24.1%, for active areas of 5.9&#160;mm2&#160;and 0.94&#160;cm2, respectively.

         <title>Fabrication of Flexible Mesoporous Black Nb2O5 Nanofiber Films for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction into CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible mesoporous black Nb2O5&#8722;x nanofibers that contain abundant oxygen&#8208;vacancies are fabricated with an electrospinning technique followed by a room&#8208;temperature defect control strategy. The Nb2O5&#8722;x catalyst has a low bandgap width of 2.25 eV that broadens the&#160;light&#8208;absorption range from the ultraviolet to visible&#8208;light, and shows a unique reaction router for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 with a selectivity of 64.8%.








Abstract
Achieving high selectivity and conversion efficiency simultaneously is a challenge for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction into CH4. Here, a facile nanofiber synthesis method and a new defect control strategy at room&#8208;temperature are reported for the fabrication of flexible mesoporous black Nb2O5 nanofiber catalysts that contain abundant oxygen&#8208;vacancies and unsaturated Nb dual&#8208;sites, which are efficient towards photocatalytic production of CH4. The oxygen&#8208;vacancy decreases the bandgap width of Nb2O5 from 3.01&#8211;2.25&#160;eV, which broadens the&#160;light&#8208;absorption range from ultraviolet to visible&#8208;light, and the dual sites in the mesopores can easily adsorb CO2, so that the intermediate product of CO* can be spontaneously changed into *CHO. The formation of a highly stable Nb&#63743;CHO* intermediate at the dual sites is proposed to be the key feature determining selectivity. The preliminary results show that without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers, the nanofiber catalyst achieves 64.8% selectivity for CH4 production with a high evolution rate of 19.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light. Furthermore, the flexible catalyst film can be directly used in devices, showing appealing and broadly commercial applications.

&lt;/sub&gt; nanofibers that contain abundant oxygen-vacancies are fabricated with an electrospinning technique followed by a room-temperature defect control strategy. The Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst has a low bandgap width of 2.25 eV that broadens the&#160;light-absorption range from the ultraviolet to visible-light, and shows a unique reaction router for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a selectivity of 64.8%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving high selectivity and conversion efficiency simultaneously is a challenge for visible-light-driven photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, a facile nanofiber synthesis method and a new defect control strategy at room-temperature are reported for the fabrication of flexible mesoporous black Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanofiber catalysts that contain abundant oxygen-vacancies and unsaturated Nb dual-sites, which are efficient towards photocatalytic production of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The oxygen-vacancy decreases the bandgap width of Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; from 3.01&#8211;2.25&#160;eV, which broadens the&#160;light-absorption range from ultraviolet to visible-light, and the dual sites in the mesopores can easily adsorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so that the intermediate product of CO* can be spontaneously changed into *CHO. The formation of a highly stable Nb&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;CHO* intermediate at the dual sites is proposed to be the key feature determining selectivity. The preliminary results show that without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers, the nanofiber catalyst achieves 64.8% selectivity for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production with a high evolution rate of 19.5 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible-light. Furthermore, the flexible catalyst film can be directly used in devices, showing appealing and broadly commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terahertz Chiral Metamaterials Enabled by Textile Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the polarization state of terahertz (THz) waves provides the basis for numerous THz applications but is challenging to realize. Leveraging a two&#8208;step textile manufacturing approach, a textile&#8208;based large&#8208;area and inexpensive chiral metamaterial is demonstrated for strong chiroptical responses at THz frequencies.








Abstract
Easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate, large&#8208;area, and inexpensive microstructures that realize control of the polarization of terahertz (THz) radiation are of fundamental importance to the development of the field of THz wave photonics. However, due to the lack of natural materials that can facilitate strong THz radiation&#8211;matter interactions, THz polarization components remain an undeveloped technology. Strong resonance&#8208;based responses offered by THz metamaterials have led to the recent development of THz metadevices, whereas, for polarization control devices, micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication techniques including aligned photolithography are generally required to create multilayer microstructures. In this work, leveraging a two&#8208;step textile manufacturing approach, a chiral metamaterial capable of exhibiting strong chiroptical responses at THz frequencies is demonstrated. Chiral&#8208;selective transmission and pronounced optical activity are experimentally observed. In sharp contrast to smart&#8208;clothing&#8208;related devices (e.g., textile antennas), the investigated chiral metamaterials gain their THz properties directly from the yarn&#8208;twisting enabled microhelical strings. It is envisioned that the interplay between meta&#8208;atom designs and textile manufacturing technology will lead to a new family of metadevices for complete control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of THz radiation.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Encoded Supramolecular Photothermal Nanomedicine for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acid encoding can be a facile and potent means to design and construct supramolecular photothermal nanoagents with controlled therapeutic activities, offering an unprecedented opportunity for customized nanomedicine toward precision cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photothermal nanomedicine based on self&#8208;assembly of biological components, with excellent biosafety and customized performance, is vital significance for precision cancer therapy. However, the programmable design of photothermal nanomedicine remains extremely challenging due to the vulnerability and variability of noncovalent interactions governing supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Herein, it is reported that amino acid encoding is a facile and potent means to design and construct supramolecular photothermal nanodrugs with controlled therapeutic activities. It is found that the amount and type of amino acid dominates the assembled nanostructures, structural stability, energy&#8208;conversion pathway, and therapeutic mechanism of the resulting nanodrugs. Two optimized nanodrugs are endowed with robust structural integrity against disassembly along with high photothermal conversion efficiency, efficient cellular internalization, and enhanced tumor accumulation, which result in more efficient tumor ablation. This work demonstrates that design based on amino acid encoding offers an unprecedented opportunity for the construction of remarkable photoactive nanomedicines toward cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>Mucus Penetrating and Cell&#8208;Binding Polyzwitterionic Micelles as Potent Oral Nanomedicine for Cancer Drug Delivery</title>

Mucus penetrating and cell&#8208;binding polyzwitterionic micelles are developed as potent oral nanomedicine for cancer drug delivery.








Abstract
Orally administrable anticancer nanomedicines are highly desirable due to their easy and repeatable administration, but are not yet feasible because the current nanomedicine cannot simultaneously overcome the strong mucus and villi barriers and thus have very low bioavailability (BA). Herein, this work presents the first polymeric micelle capable of fast mucus permeation and villi absorption and delivering paclitaxel (PTX) efficiently to tumors with therapeutic efficacy even better than intravenously administered polyethylene glycol based counterpart or free PTX. Poly[2&#8208;(N&#8208;oxide&#8208;N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDEA), a water&#8208;soluble polyzwitterion, is highly nonfouling to proteins and other biomacromolecules such as mucin but can weakly bind to phospholipids. Therefore, the micelle of its block copolymer with poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (OPDEA&#8208;PCL) can efficiently permeate through the viscous mucus and bind to villi, which triggers transcytosis&#8208;mediated transepithelial transport into blood circulation for tumor accumulation. The orally administered micelles deliver PTX to tumors, efficiently inhibiting the growth of HepG2 and patient&#8208;derived hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts and triple&#8208;negative breast tumors. These results demonstrate that OPDEA&#8208;based micelles may serve as an efficient oral nanomedicine for delivering other small molecules or even large molecules.

         <title>Heterointerface Created on Au&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Loaded Unilamellar Hydroxide Electrocatalysts as a Highly Active Site for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material design for interface active sites to allow a novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is proposed. The Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded unilamellar layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide nanosheet electrocatalysts create interfacial active sites that exhibit interfacial direct O&#63743;O coupling and excellent OER performance.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical element for all sorts of reactions that use water as a hydrogen source, such as hydrogen evolution and electrochemical CO2 reduction, and novel design principles that provide highly active sites on OER electrocatalysts push the limits of their practical applications. Herein, Au&#8208;cluster loading on unilamellar exfoliated layered double hydroxide (ULDH) electrocatalysts for the OER is demonstrated to fabricate a heterointerface between Au clusters and ULDHs as an active site, which is accompanied by the oxidation state modulation of the active site and interfacial direct O&#63743;O coupling (&#8220;interfacial DOOC&#8221;). The Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded ULDHs exhibit excellent activities for the OER with an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that charge transfer from the Au clusters to ULDHs modifies the oxidation states of trivalent metal ions, which can be active sites on the ULDHs. The present study, supported by highly sensitive spectroscopy combining reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and modulation&#8208;excitation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, indicates that active sites at the interface between the Au clusters and ULDHs promote a novel OER mechanism through interfacial DOOC, thereby achieving outstanding catalytic performance.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production by Seawater Electrolysis Coupling Sulfion Degradation</title>

Seawater electrolysis coupling sulfion degradation enables energy&#8208;saving and chlorine&#8208;free hydrogen production at low electricity expense while rapidly degrading sulfion pollutants to value&#8208;added sulfur for better sustainability.








Abstract
Electrolysis of costless and infinite seawater is a promising way toward grid&#8208;scale hydrogen production without causing freshwater stress. Practical potential of this technology, however, is hindered by low energy efficiency and anode corrosion by the detrimental chlorine chemistry in seawater in addition to unaffordable electricity expense. Herein, energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production is reported by chlorine&#8208;free seawater splitting coupling sulfion oxidation. It yields hydrogen at a low cell voltage of 0.97&#160;V, cutting the electricity consumption to 2.32&#160;kWh per m3 H2 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Compared to alkaline water electrolysis, the energy expense is primarily saved by 60% with 50% lower energy equivalent input. Benefiting from the ultralow cell voltage, the hazardous chlorine chemistry is fully avoided without anode corrosion regardless of Cl&#8722; crossover. Meanwhile, it also allows fast degradation of S2&#8722; pollutant from the water body to value&#8208;added sulfur with 80% efficiency, for further reducing hydrogen cost and protection of the ecosystem. Connecting such a hybrid seawater electrolyzer to a commercial solar cell can harvest the hydrogen from seawater with better sustainability. This work may offer new opportunities for low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from the unlimited ocean resources with environmental protection.

         <title>Distinct Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Dependent Behaviors for Single&#8208;Atom Palladium&#8208;On&#8208;Ceria Catalysts: Enhanced Stabilization and Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct behaviors of single Pd atoms dispersed on different crystal facets of CeO2 is investigated. In situ characterizations reveal that the oxygen defects on the different facets of CeO2 can affect the formation and stability of single atoms. Pd atoms dispersed on CeO2(100) exhibit higher sinter&#8208;resistant performance than those on CeO2(111), and a different selectivity in the N&#8208;alkylation reaction.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance, fully atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation industrial catalysts. However, it remains a great challenge to avoid the aggregation of isolated atoms into nanoparticles during the preparation and application of SACs. Here, the evolution of Pd species is investigated on different crystal facets of CeO2, and vastly different behaviors on the single&#8208;atomic dispersion of surface Pd atoms are surprisingly discovered. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;XPS (NAP&#8208;XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that, in a reducing atmosphere, more oxygen vacancies are generated on the (100) facet of CeO2, and Pd atoms can be trapped and thus feature atomic dispersion; by contrast, on the CeO2 (111) facet, Pd atoms will readily aggregate into clusters (Pdn). Furthermore, Pd1/CeO2(100) gives a high selectivity of 90.3% for the catalytic N&#8208;alkylation reaction, which is 2.8 times higher than that for Pdn/CeO2(111). This direct evidence demonstrates the crucial role of crystal&#8208;facet effects in the preparation of metal&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide SACs. This work thus opens an avenue for the rational design and targeted synthesis of ultrastable and sinter&#8208;resistant SACs.

         <title>The Molecular Ordering and Double&#8208;Channel Carrier Generation of Nonfullerene Photovoltaics within Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double carrier&#8208;generation channels are observed: one is the direct photogeneration in the nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) crystal region and the other is the traditional charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state channel in the mixing region. The channel from the NFA crystal provides a new avenue of zero energy loss carrier formation. The NFA molecular packing and geometry is key in influencing the photophysics of NFA solar cells.








Abstract
The success of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) solar cells lies in their unique physical properties beyond the extended absorption and suitable energy levels. The current study investigates the morphology and photophysical behavior of PBDB&#8208;T donor blending with ITIC, 4TIC, and 6TIC acceptors. Single&#8208;crystal study shows that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and side&#8208;chain interaction dictate molecular assembly, which can be carried to blended films, forming a multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology. Spontaneous carrier generation is seen in ITIC, 4TIC, and 6TIC neat films and their blended thin films using the PBDB&#8208;T donor, providing a new avenue of zero&#8208;energy&#8208;loss carrier formation. The molecular packing associated with specific contacts and geometry is key in influencing the photophysics, as demonstrated by the charge transfer and carrier lifetime results. The 2D layer of 6TIC facilitates the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;polaron conversion, and the largest photogenerated polaron yield is obtained. The new mechanism, together with the highly efficient blending region carrier generation, has the prospect of the fundamental advantage for NFA solar cells, from molecular assembly to thin&#8208;film morphology.

         <title>Piezoelectric Dynamics of Arterial Pulse for Wearable Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric dynamics of arterial pulse first elucidate the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and blood pressure waves. It is feasible to achieve wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring without motion artifacts, using a single piezoelectric sensor. This strategy may provide new insights on the development for wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectric arterial pulse wave dynamics are traditionally considered to be similar to those of typical blood pressure waves. However, achieving accurate continuous blood pressure wave monitoring based on arterial pulse waves remains challenging, because the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and their related blood pressure waves is unclear. To address this, the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and blood pressure waves is first elucidated via theoretical, simulation, and experimental analysis of these dynamics. Based on this correlation, the authors develop a wireless wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring system, with better portability than conventional systems that are based on the pulse wave velocity between multiple sensors. They explore the feasibility of achieving wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring without motion artifacts, using a single piezoelectric sensor. These findings eliminate the controversy over the arterial pulse wave piezoelectric response, and can potentially be used to develop a portable wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring device for the early prevention and daily control of hypertension.

         <title>Data Mining for Terahertz Generation Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work combines data, mined from a structural database of known materials,&#160;with first&#8208;principles calculations of molecular properties to predict high&#8208;performing organic nonlinear optical materials useful for the generation of terahertz frequency light. Four new terahertz generation crystals are discovered, synthesized, and tested, all of which show favorable terahertz generation properties.








Abstract
A data mining approach to discover and develop new organic nonlinear optical crystals that produce intense pulses of terahertz radiation is demonstrated. The Cambridge Structural Database is mined for non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials and these structural data are used in tandem with density functional theory calculations to predict new materials that efficiently generate terahertz radiation. This enables us to (in a relatively short time) discover, synthesize, and grow large, high&#8208;quality crystals of four promising materials and characterize them for intense terahertz generation. In a direct comparison to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic terahertz generation crystals, these new materials excel. The discovery and characterization of these novel terahertz generators validate the approach of combining data mining with density functional theory calculations to predict properties of high&#8208;performance organic materials, potentially for a host of exciting applications.

Four new terahertz generation crystals are discovered, synthesized, and tested, all of which show favorable terahertz generation properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A data mining approach to discover and develop new organic nonlinear optical crystals that produce intense pulses of terahertz radiation is demonstrated. The Cambridge Structural Database is mined for non-centrosymmetric materials and these structural data are used in tandem with density functional theory calculations to predict new materials that efficiently generate terahertz radiation. This enables us to (in a relatively short time) discover, synthesize, and grow large, high-quality crystals of four promising materials and characterize them for intense terahertz generation. In a direct comparison to the current state-of-the-art organic terahertz generation crystals, these new materials excel. The discovery and characterization of these novel terahertz generators validate the approach of combining data mining with density functional theory calculations to predict properties of high-performance organic materials, potentially for a host of exciting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>WET&#8208;Induced Layered Organohydrogel as Bioinspired &#8220;Sticky&#8722;Slippy Skin&#8221; for Robust Underwater Oil&#8208;Repellency</title>

A moss&#8208;inspired &#8220;sticky&#8722;slippy skin&#8221; composed of layered organohydrogel is reported, demonstrating an intriguing example of an easy&#8208;pasting anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling material through a one&#8208;step wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) process. Anti&#8208;swelling/anti&#8208;bending, acid/alkali resistance, environmental friendliness, adhesion simplicity, and substrate universality are integrated in one anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling material. The design strategy with integrated functions provides an important route for the development of multifunctional interfacial materials.








Abstract
Underwater superoleophobic surfaces featuring anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling properties are of great significance in widespread fields. However, their complicated engineering process and weak interfacial adhesion strength with underlying substrates severely hamper these ideal surfaces toward practical applications. Here, a moss&#8208;inspired sticky&#8722;slippy skin composed of layered organohydrogel is reported through a one&#8208;step wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy, which unprecedentedly integrates robust inherent adhesion with durable anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling properties. The sticky organogel layer can be simply attached to various substrates, from metals and plastics to glass, independent of any surface pretreatment. The slippy hydrogel layer enables stable underwater superoleophobicity and ultralow oil adhesion for diverse kinds of oils. The sticky&#8722;slippy skin features outstanding comprehensive properties including easy&#8208;pasting, anti&#8208;swelling/anti&#8208;bending, compatibility with commercial adhesives, acid/alkali resistance, environmental friendliness, and substrate universality. The design strategy with integrated functions provides a clue to accelerate the development of bioinspired multifunctional interfacial materials toward real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Anionic Lipid Nanoparticles Preferentially Deliver mRNA to the Hepatic Reticuloendothelial System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) capable of delivering therapeutic RNA to specific cells in the body are required if the immense potential of these plug&#8208;and&#8208;play technologies is to be realized. Using embryonic zebrafish as a predictive in vivo model and with a thorough understanding of the nano&#8211;biointeractions involved, LNPs capable of preferential messenger RNA delivery to hepatic reticuloendothelial system cells are rationally designed.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP&#8208;based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP&#8208;based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP&#8211;mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES&#8208;targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver&#8208;specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano&#8211;biointeractions involved.

         <title>Universal Solution Synthesis of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes Using Alkahest for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal solution synthesis of sulfide solid electrolytes is first demonstrated. The alkahest solvent, 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine&#8211;1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol, fully dissolves not only Li2S (or Na2S), P2S5, and LiCl, but also metal sulfides (e.g., GeS2 and SnS2), forming homogeneous solid electrolyte solutions. Solution&#8208;synthesized Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12 exhibit high ionic conductivities, and their applicability to all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
The wet&#8208;chemical processability of sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) provides intriguing opportunities for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Thus far, sulfide SEs are wet&#8208;prepared either from solid precursors suspended in solvents (suspension synthesis) or from homogeneous solutions using SEs (solution process) with restricted composition spaces. Here, a universal solution synthesis method for preparing sulfide SEs from precursors, not only Li2S, P2S5, LiCl, and Na2S, but also metal sulfides (e.g., GeS2 and SnS2), fully dissolved in an alkahest: a mixture solvent of 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol (EDT) (or ethanethiol). Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional dissolving power of EDA&#8211;EDT toward GeS2 is due to the nucleophilicity of the thiolate anions that is strong enough to dissociate the Ge&#63743;S bonds. Solution&#8208;synthesized Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12 exhibit high ionic conductivities (0.74, 1.3, and 0.10 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C, respectively), and their application for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Full&#8208;Dimensional Grain Boundary Stress Release for Flexible Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain boundary stress release strategy is proposed for high&#8208;stability flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics by the grain boundary penetration with borax 3D stretchable molecules. The full&#8208;dimensional grain boundary stress release enables the flexible perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination and an indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics are strong potential candidates to drive low&#8208;power off&#8208;grid electronics for indoor applications. Compared with rigid devices, flexible perovskite devices can provide a more suitable surface for indoor small electronic devices, enabling them have a broader indoor application prospect. However, the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite photovoltaics is an urgent issue solved. Herein, a kind of 3D crosslinking agent named borax is selected to carry out grain boundary penetration treatment on perovskite film to realize full&#8208;dimensional stress release. This strategy improves the mechanical and phase stabilities of perovskite films subjected to external forces or large temperature changes. The fabricated perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination, which is the highest one to date. The merit of low trap states under weak light makes the devices present a superior indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux (LED, 2956 K), which is currently the best flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaic device. This work provides a full&#8208;dimensional grain boundary stress release strategy for highly stable flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics.

Herein, a kind of 3D crosslinking agent named borax is selected to carry out grain boundary penetration treatment on perovskite film to realize full-dimensional stress release. This strategy improves the mechanical and phase stabilities of perovskite films subjected to external forces or large temperature changes. The fabricated perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination, which is the highest one to date. The merit of low trap states under weak light makes the devices present a superior indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux (LED, 2956 K), which is currently the best flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaic device. This work provides a full-dimensional grain boundary stress release strategy for highly stable flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Transformable Amphiphilic and Block Polymer&#8722;Dendron Conjugate for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Retention with Cellular Homeostasis Perturbation via Membrane Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky transformation of a polymer&#8722;dendron conjugate can both meliorate its tumor tissue distribution and perturb cancer cellular homeostasis via the membrane flow process. This work presents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.








Abstract
Efficient penetration and retention of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues can be realized through rational design of drug delivery systems. Herein, a polymer&#8722;dendron conjugate, POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;p(GFLG&#8208;Dendron&#8208;Ppa) (GFLG&#8208;DP), is presented, which allows a cathepsin&#8208;B&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky structural transformation. The compositions and ratios are optimized through dissipative particle dynamics simulations. GFLG&#8208;DP displays tumor&#8208;specific transformation and the consequently released dendron&#8208;Ppa is found to effectively accumulate on the tumor cell membrane. The interaction between the dendron&#8208;Ppa and the tumor cell membrane results in intracellular and intercellular transport via membrane flow, thus achieving efficient deep penetration and prolonged retention of therapeutic agents in the solid tumor tissues. Meanwhile, the interaction of dendron&#8208;Ppa with the endoplasmic reticulum disrupts cell homeostasis, making tumor cells more vulnerable and susceptible to photodynamic therapy. This platform represents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.

         <title>In Situ Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Organoids and Extracellular Matrix Interactions via Phototransfer by Allyl Sulfide Exchange&#8208;Expansion Microscopy (PhASE&#8208;ExM)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for expansion microscopy is devised and applied to visualize organoids cultured in Matrigel and synthetic hydrogels. Several existing limitations associated with imaging of organoids are overcome, enabling super&#8208;resolution image acquisition, eliminating signal attenuation for whole organoid imaging, and facilitating capture and quantification of cell&#8211;matrix interactions of organoids.








Abstract
3D organoid models have recently seen a boom in popularity, as they can better recapitulate the complexity of multicellular organs compared to other in vitro culture systems. However, organoids are difficult to image because of the limited penetration depth of high&#8208;resolution microscopes and depth&#8208;dependent light attenuation, which can limit the understanding of signal transduction pathways and characterization of intimate cell&#8208;extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. To overcome these challenges, phototransfer by allyl sulfide exchange&#8208;expansion microscopy (PhASE&#8208;ExM) is developed, enabling optical clearance and super&#8208;resolution imaging of organoids and their ECM in 3D. PhASE&#8208;ExM uses hydrogels prepared via photoinitiated polymerization, which is advantageous as it decouples monomer diffusion into thick organoid cultures from the hydrogel fabrication. Apart from compatibility with organoids cultured in Matrigel, PhASE&#8208;ExM enables 3.25&#215; expansion and super&#8208;resolution imaging of organoids cultured in synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels crosslinked via allyl&#8208;sulfide groups (PEG&#8208;AlS) through simultaneous photopolymerization and radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;transfer reactions that complete in &lt;70 s. Further, PEG&#8208;AlS hydrogels can be in situ softened to promote organoid crypt formation, providing a super&#8208;resolution imaging platform both for pre&#8208; and post&#8208;differentiated organoids. Overall, PhASE&#8208;ExM is a useful tool to decipher organoid behavior by enabling sub&#8208;micrometer scale, 3D visualization of proteins and signal transduction pathways.

         <title>2D Functional Minerals as Sustainable Materials for Magneto&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of 2D natural minerals as sustainable materials for advanced optics is reported. The materials, possessing large size&#8208;to&#8208;thickness aspect ratio, sensitive magnetic response, and large optical bandgap, are massively produced by a green method in a recyclable fashion. These features allow fabrication of see&#8208;through color&#8208;tunable magneto&#8208;optical devices using a 2D mineral as the functional unit.








Abstract
Liquid crystal devices using organic molecules are nowadays widely used to modulate transmitted light, but this technology still suffers from relatively weak response, high cost, toxicity and environmental concerns, and cannot fully meet the demand of future sustainable society. Here, an alternative approach to color&#8208;tunable optical devices, which is based on sustainable inorganic liquid crystals derived from 2D mineral materials abundant in nature, is described. The prototypical 2D mineral of vermiculite is massively produced by a green method, possessing size&#8208;to&#8208;thickness aspect ratios of &gt;103,&#160;in&#8208;plane magnetization of &gt;10&#160;emu g&#8722;1, and an optical bandgap of &gt;3&#160;eV.&#160;These characteristics endow 2D vermiculite with sensitive magneto&#8208;birefringence response, been several orders of magnitude larger than organic counterparts, as well as capability of broad&#8208;spectrum modulation. The finding consequently permits the fabrication of various magnetochromic or mechanochromic devices with low or even zero&#8208;energy consumption during operation. This work creates opportunities for the application of sustainable materials in advanced optics.

         <title>The Development of Chiral Nanoparticles to Target NK Cells and CD8+ T Cells for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanoparticles (NPs) are developed as tumor immunoadjuvants for the treatment and prevention of cancer by stimulating both the innate and acquired immune responses. It is revealed that chiral NPs stimulate the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in natural killer (NK) cells, while the CD8+ T cells are activated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen cross presentation.








Abstract
The chirality of nanomaterials (nanoparticles, NPs) can influence their interaction with cells and biological systems. However, how chirality can exert impact on the immune response has yet to be investigated. Here, the immunological effect of chiral nanomaterials is investigated as a therapeutic and preventive option against tumors. Compared with achiral nanoparticles, chiral NPs with a g&#8208;factor of 0.44 are shown to enhance both innate and acquired immunity against tumor growth. It is also found that chiral NPs enhance the activation of CD8+ T and natural killer cells (CD69+ NK cells) by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, L&#8208;type NPs induce a 1.65&#8208;fold higher proportion of CD8+ T and CD69+ NK cells than D&#8208;type NPs. Next, the therapeutic and preventative effects of chiral NPs against tumors in a EG7.OVA tumor model are investigated. It is found that L&#8208;type NPs have a significant greater ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and prolong the survival time of model mice than D&#8208;type NPs. Mice treated with L&#8208;type NPs induce the activation of 84.98&#160;&#177; 6.63% CD8+ T cells and 33.62&#160;&#177; 3.41% of NK cells in tumor tissues; these are 1.62&#8208;fold and 1.39&#8208;fold higher than that seen in the mice treated with D&#8208;type NPs. Mechanistic studies reveal that chiral NPs exert mechanical force on bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and stimulate the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in NK cells. Synergistically, the CD8+ T cells are stimulated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen cross presentation. The force of interaction between L&#8208;type NPs and cells is higher than that for D&#8208;NPs, thus further promoting the activation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells and their infiltration into tumor tissue. These findings open up a new avenue for chiral nanomaterials to act as immunoadjuvants for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

The force of interaction between &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-type NPs and cells is higher than that for &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-NPs, thus further promoting the activation of NK cells and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and their infiltration into tumor tissue. These findings open up a new avenue for chiral nanomaterials to act as immunoadjuvants for the prevention and treatment of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogel Transformed from Nanoparticles for Prevention of Tissue Injury and Treatment of Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel&#8208;transformable nanoparticles responsive to physiologically/pathologically acidic microenvironments are engineered by self&#8208;assembly of a pH&#8208;sensitive multivalent host material and a multivalent guest polymer. Driven by protons, the pH&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest nanoparticles can transform into hydrogel. The transformable nanoparticles protect mice from induced gastric injury by in situ forming a hydrogel barrier. These nanoparticles can serve as transformable nanovehicles for treating inflammatory diseases.








Abstract
Functional hydrogels responsive to physiological and pathological signals have extensive biomedical applications owing to their multiple advanced attributes. Herein, engineering of functional hydrogels is reported via transformable nanoparticles in response to the physiologically and pathologically acidic microenvironment. These nanoparticles are assembled by a multivalent hydrophobic, pH&#8208;responsive cyclodextrin host material and a multivalent hydrophilic guest macromolecule. Driven by protons, the pH&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest nanoparticles can be transformed into hydrogel, resulting from proton&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of the host material, generation of a hydrophilic multivalent host compound, and simultaneously enhanced inclusion interactions between host and guest molecules. By in situ forming a hydrogel barrier, the orally delivered transformable nanoparticles protect mice from ethanol&#8208; or drug&#8208;induced gastric injury. In addition, this type of nanoparticles can serve as responsive and transformable nanovehicles for therapeutic agents to achieve triggerable and sustained drug delivery, thereby effectively treating typical inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis and arthritis in rats. With combined advantages of nanoparticles and hydrogels, together with their good in vivo safety, the engineered transformable nanoparticles hold great promise in tissue injury protection and site&#8208;specific/local delivery of molecular and cellular therapeutic agents.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched Nickel Phosphide for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic vacancy strategy is proposed for designing nickel&#8208;phosphide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR). The fabricated Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in 0.1&#160;m KOH and high Faradaic efficiency in all pH solutions.&#160;Computational analysis and operando characterizations suggest that the oxygen adsorption on Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi prefers to via an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; configuration, which facilitates the formation of the *OOH intermediate during the 2e ORR process.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR) pathway is becoming increasingly important due to the green production process. Here, cationic vacancies on nickel phosphide, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to regulate the catalyst's physicochemical properties, are introduced for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis. The as&#8208;fabricated Ni cationic vacancies (VNi)&#8208;enriched Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable 2e ORR performance with H2O2 molar fraction of &gt;95% and Faradaic efficiencies of &gt;90% in all pH conditions under a wide range of applied potentials. Impressively, the as&#8208;created VNi possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 50 h, suppassing all the recently reported catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (SR&#8208;FTIR) combining theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the VNi&#8208;induced geometric and electronic structural optimization, thus promoting oxygen adsorption to the 2e ORR favored &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; configuration. It is believed that the demonstrated cation vacancy engineering is an effective strategy toward creating active heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision.

         <title>A Van der Waals Interface Hosting Two Groups of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple groups of magnetic skyrmions add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion&#8208;based ultrahigh&#8208;density memory devices. Vertical imprinting of magnetic skyrmions in 2D layered magnetic heterostructures are reported. Two sets of topological Hall effects are observed at low temperatures and these two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy.








Abstract
Multiple magnetic skyrmion phases add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion&#8208;based ultrahigh&#8208;density spin memory devices. Extending the field to 2D van der Waals magnets is a rewarding challenge, where the realizable degree of freedoms (e.g., thickness, twist angle, and electrical gating) and high skyrmion density result in intriguing new properties and enhanced functionality. In this work, a van der Waals interface, formed by two 2D ferromagnets Cr2Ge2Te6 and Fe3GeTe2 with a Curie temperature of &#8776;65 and &#8776;205 K, respectively, hosting two groups of magnetic skyrmions, is reported. Two sets of topological Hall effect signals are observed below 6s0 K when Cr2Ge2Te6 is magnetically ordered. These two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy, and supported by micromagnetic simulations. Interestingly, the magnetic skyrmions persist in the heterostructure with zero applied magnetic field. The results are promising for the realization of skyrmionic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures hosting multiple skyrmion&#160;phases.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Functionality&#8208;Multiplexing Capability in Metasurface Design Based on Statistical Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning models are embedded in both gradient&#8208;based and nongradient optimization loops to automatically design multifunctional metasurfaces and push the design capacity even when the ideal optical response is not achievable by certain meta&#8208;atoms. Metasurface focusing lenses and holograms are experimentally demonstrated, with up to eight controllable responses subjected to different combinations of incident frequencies and polarizations.








Abstract
As 2D metamaterials, metasurfaces provide an unprecedented means to manipulate light with the ability to multiplex different functionalities in a single planar device. Currently, most pursuits of multifunctional metasurfaces resort to empirically accommodating more functionalities at the cost of increasing structural complexity, with little effort to investigate the intrinsic restrictions of given meta&#8208;atoms and thus the ultimate limits in the design. In this work, it is proposed to embed machine&#8208;learning models in both gradient&#8208;based and nongradient optimization loops for the automatic implementation of multifunctional metasurfaces. Fundamentally different from the traditional two&#8208;step approach that separates phase retrieval and meta&#8208;atom structural design, the proposed end&#8208;to&#8208;end framework facilitates full exploitation of the prescribed design space and pushes the multifunctional design capacity to its physical limit. With a single&#8208;layer structure that can be readily fabricated, metasurface focusing lenses and holograms are experimentally demonstrated in the near&#8208;infrared region. They show up to eight controllable responses subjected to different combinations of working frequencies and linear polarization states, which are unachievable by the conventional physics&#8208;guided approaches. These results manifest the superior capability of the data&#8208;driven scheme for photonic design, and will accelerate the development of complex devices and systems for optical display, communication, and computing.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Microsized Si Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Insights into the Polymer Configuration Conversion Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(hexaazatrinaphthalene) (PHATN) coating is constructed at the surface of a Si/C anode to design a high&#8208;performance microsized Si composite anode for Li&#8208;ion batteries. The Li&#8208;rich PHATN coating can form during the initial lithiation, promote interfacial diffusion kinetics for Li&#8208;ions, generate free space to accommodate the volume expansion of microsized Si, and mitigate possible side reactions.








Abstract
Microsized silicon particles are desirable Si anodes because of their low price and abundant sources. However, it is challenging to achieve stable electrochemical performances using a traditional microsized silicon anode due to the poor electrical conductivity, serious volume expansion, and unstable solid electrolyte interface. Herein, a composite microsized Si anode is designed and synthesized by constructing a unique polymer, poly(hexaazatrinaphthalene) (PHATN), at a Si/C surface (PCSi). The Li+ transport mechanism of the PCSi is elucidated by using in situ characterization and theoretical simulation. During the lithiation of the PCSi anode, &#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743; groups with high electron density in the PHATN first coordinate Li+ to form &#63743;C&#63743;N&#63743;Li bonds on both sides of the PHATN molecule plane. Consequently, the original benzene rings in the PHATN become active centers to accept lithium and form stable Li&#8208;rich PHATN coatings. PHATN molecules expand due to the change of molecular configuration during the consecutive lithiation process, which provides controllable space for the volume expansion of the Si particles. The PCSi composite anode exhibits a specific capacity of 1129.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, and exhibits compelling rate performance, maintaining 417.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 16.5 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>A Fibrin Site&#8208;Specific Nanoprobe for Imaging Fibrin&#8208;Rich Thrombi and Preventing Thrombus Formation in Venous Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoprobe loaded with Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Glu&#8722;Lys&#8722;Ala, Fe3O4, NIR fluorochrome, and Ketotifen fumarate is prepared, which can target fibrin&#8208;rich venous thrombi and assemble in it to help with the detection of fibrin&#8208;rich venous thromboembolism precisely through imaging. In addition, by inhabiting mast cell degranulation, this can prevent thrombosis without the risk of excessive bleeding.








Abstract
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a prevalent public health issue worldwide. Before treatment, spatiotemporally accurate thrombus detection is essential. However, with the currently available imaging technologies, this is challenging. Herein, the development of a novel fibrin&#8208;specific nanoprobe (NP) based on the conjugation of poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with the pentapeptide Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Glu&#8722;Lys&#8722;Ala (CREKA) for selective and semiquantitative imaging in vivo is presented. By integrating Fe3O4 and NIR fluorochrome (IR780), the NP can function as a highly sensitive sensor for the direct analysis of thrombi in vivo. The fibrin&#8208;specific NP distinguishes fibrin&#8208;rich thrombi from collagen&#8208;rich or erythrocyte&#8208;rich thrombi, which can be beneficial for future individually tailored therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, loading NPs with the ketotifen fumarate results in mast cell degranulation inhibition, and hence, NPs can prevent thrombosis without the risk of excessive bleeding. Thus, the use of fibrin&#8208;specific NPs may serve as a safe alternative approach for the detection and prevention of VTEs in susceptible populations in the future.

         <title>A Wearable All&#8208;Gel Multimodal Cutaneous Sensor Enabling Simultaneous Single&#8208;Site Monitoring of Cardiac&#8208;Related Biophysical Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acquisition of biophysical signals is demonstrated at one point on the body using a wearable all&#8208;gel&#8208;integrated multimodal sensor. The wearable all&#8208;gel multimodal sensor is easily attached to the wrist and simultaneously gathers blood pressure, electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and mechanomyogram signals related to cardiac and muscle health.








Abstract
The human cutaneous sensory organ is a highly evolved biosensor that is efficient, sensitive, selective, and adaptable. Recently, with the development of various materials and structures inspired by sensory organs, artificial cutaneous sensors have been widely studied. In this study, the acquisition of biophysical signals is demonstrated at one point on the body using a wearable all&#8208;gel&#8208;integrated multimodal sensor composed of four element sensors, inspired by the slow/rapid adapting functions of the skin sensory receptors. The gel&#8208;type sensors ensure flexibility, compactness, portability, adherence, and integrity. The wearable all&#8208;gel multimodal sensor is easily attached to the wrist and simultaneously gathers blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), and mechanomyogram (MMG) signals related to cardiac and muscle health. Human activity causes muscle contraction, which affects blood flow; therefore, the relationship between the muscle and heart is crucial for screening and predicting heart health. Cardiac health is monitored by obtaining the two types of phase time differences (i.e., &#916;tbe: BP and ECG, &#916;tem: ECG and MMG) generated during muscle movement. The suggested multimodal sensor has potential applicability in monitoring biophysical conditions and diagnosing cardiac&#8208;related health problems.

         <title>Soft Actuators Made of Discrete Grains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change actuators have been shown to achieve useful volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular systems are able to flow, jam, and exhibit unique bulk properties. In this work, granular actuators are introduced, where each grain is a phase&#8208;change actuator. Grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, in agglomerates for macro&#8208;actuation, can flow for freeform actuator printability, and exhibit compatibility with various granular assembly designs.








Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated the potential of actuators consisting of bulk elastomers with phase&#8208;changing inclusions for generating high forces and large volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular assemblies have been shown to enable tunable properties via different packings, dynamic moduli via jamming, and compatibility with various printing methods via suspension in carrier fluids. Herein, granular actuators are introduced, which represent a new class of soft actuators made of discrete grains. The soft grains consist of a hyperelastic shell and multiple solvent cores. Upon heating, the encapsulated solvent cores undergo liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase change, inducing rapid and strong volumetric expansion of the hyperelastic shell up to 700%. The grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, or in granular agglomerates for meso&#8208; and macroscale actuation, demonstrating the scalability of the granular actuators. Furthermore, the active grains can be suspended in a carrier resin or solvent to enable printable soft actuators via established granular material processing techniques. By combining the advantages of phase&#8208;change soft actuation and granularity, this work presents the opportunity to realize soft actuators with tunable bulk properties, compatibility with self&#8208;assembly techniques, and on&#8208;demand reconfigurability.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Stretchable and Fast Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Hydrogel in Cryogenic Environments for Artificial Nerve Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors propose an ionic hydrogel with outstanding self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and conductivity in cryogenic environments. The artificial nerve fiber (SSANF) is fabricated based on the ionic hydrogel through bionic structural design. The SSANF enables stable information and energy transmission when connected to the biomimetic intelligent robot, even under big deformation and &#8722;78.5&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials behave with irreplaceable advantages in biomimetic intelligent robots (BIR) for avoiding or reducing safety hazards and economic losses from accidental damage during service. However, the self&#8208;healing ability is unreservedly lost and even becomes rigid and fragile in the cryogenic environment where BIR are precisely needed. Here, the authors report a versatile ionic hydrogel with fast self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and stable conductivity, even at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. The hydrogel is systematically optimized to improve a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network nanostructure, coordinated achieving a quick self&#8208;healing ability within 10&#160;min, large deformation tolerance of over 7000%, superior conductivity of 11.76 S cm&#8722;1 and anti&#8208;freezing ability, which is difficult to obtain simultaneously. Such a hydrogel provides new opportunities for artificial electronic devices in harsh environments. As a prospective application, they fabricate an artificial nerve fiber by mimicking the structure and functions of the myelinated axon, exhibiting the property of fast and potential&#8208;gated signal transmission. This artificial nerve fiber is integrated into a robot for demonstrating a real&#8208;time high fidelity and high throughput information interaction under big deformation and cryogenic temperature. The hydrogel and bionic device will bring pioneering functions for robots and open a broad application scenario in extreme conditions.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area and Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Blade&#8208;Coating</title>

Blade&#8208;coating supersaturated CsPb(Br1&#8722;xClx)3 perovskite precursor leads to uniform films with small grains and strong photoluminescence emission. After incorporating the films as an emissive layer in the device, efficient sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with a peak external quantum efficiency reaching 10.3% can be a acheived, along with large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue LEDs up to 28 cm2 with uniform emission.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area fabrication of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) through mass&#8208;production techniques has attracted growing attention due to their potential applications in lighting. Several breakthroughs are made for red/infrared and green emissions. Nevertheless, large&#8208;area blue/sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs, a requisite color for lighting, have not yet been reported. Here, efficient and large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs are fabricated through blade&#8208;coating supersaturated precursors. The volume ratio of dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethylformamide is tuned to obtain a supersaturated CsPb(Br0.84Cl0.16)3 solution. Blade&#8208;coating this supersaturated precursor results in nucleation in the solution phase with much higher nucleation sites, and a faster crystallization rate. The uniform films formed by this approach exhibit smaller grain size, lower trap density, and higher radiative recombination rate. The peak external quantum efficiency of the blade&#8208;coated PeLEDs reaches 10.3% with sky&#8208;blue emission (489&#160;nm). Benefitting from the robustness of this blade&#8208;coating technique, large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs with a device area of 28 cm2 are also achieved with uniform emission. This work represents a significant step forward toward flat&#8208;panel lighting and full&#8208;color display for the PeLEDs.

         <title>Manipulating Crystallization Kinetics in High&#8208;Performance Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Cells via Cosolvent&#8208;Assisted Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ethyl alcohol cosolvent strategy is applied for room&#8208;temperature blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells and minimodules. This approach delicately manipulates the balance between nucleation and crystal growth rate to guarantee high&#8208;quality perovskite films, thus achieving remarkable device performance both in small&#8208;area cells and minimodules with excellent VOC deficit and suppressed nonradiative recombination loss.








Abstract
Manipulating the perovskite solidification process, including nucleation and crystal growth, plays a critical role in controlling film morphology and thus affects the resultant device performance. In this work, a facile and effective ethyl alcohol (EtOH) cosolvent strategy is demonstrated with the incorporation of EtOH into perovskite ink for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules. Systematic real&#8208;time perovskite crystallization studies uncover the delicate perovskite structural evolutions and phase&#8208;transition pathway. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations both demonstrate that EtOH in the mixed&#8208;solvent system significantly promotes the formation of an FA&#8208;based precursor solvate (FA2PbBr4&#183;DMSO) during the trace&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted transition process, which finely regulates the balance between nucleation and crystal growth to guarantee high&#8208;quality perovskite films. This strategy efficiently suppresses nonradiative recombination and improves efficiencies in both 1.54 (23.19%) and 1.60&#160;eV (22.51%) perovskite systems, which represents one of the highest records for blade&#8208;coated PSCs in both small&#8208;area devices and minimodules. An excellent VOC deficit as low as 335&#160;mV in the 1.54&#160;eV perovskite system, coincident with the measured nonradiative recombination loss of only 77&#160;mV, is achieved. More importantly, significantly enhanced device stability is another signature of this approach.

         <title>Mulberry&#8208;Leaves&#8208;Derived Red&#8208;Emissive Carbon Dots for Feeding Silkworms to Produce Brightly Fluorescent Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots made from mulberry leaves have a strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence with an absolute quantum yield of 73% and a full width at half maximum of 20 nm, and they exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biosafety for feeding silkworms. These silkworms grow healthily, cocoon, become moths, mate, lay eggs, and reproduce normally. Both the silkworms and the cocoons show bright red fluorescence.








Abstract
Fluorescent silk has promising applications in dazzling textiles, biological engineering, and medical products, but the natural Bombyx mori silk has almost no fluorescence. Here carbon dots (CDs) made from mulberry leaves are reported, which have a strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence with absolute quantum yield of 73% and a full width at half maximum of 20&#160;nm. After feeding with such CDs, silkworms exhibit bright red fluorescence, grow healthily, cocoon normally, and turn to moths finally. The cocoons are pink in daylight and show bright red fluorescence under ultraviolet light. After breaking out of such cocoons, the red&#8208;emissive moths can mate and lay fluorescent eggs which would hatch normally. The growth cycle of the second generation of the test silkworm is the same as that of the control group, which means such CDs have excellent biocompatiblility. Dissection and analyses on both the test silkworms and cocoons disclose the metabolic route of the CDs, that is, the fluorescent CDs are absorbed by silkworms from alimentary canals, then transferred to silk glands, and finally to cocoons, while those unabsorbed CDs are excreted with the feces. All experimental results confirm the excellent biocompatibility and fluorescence stability of such CDs.

         <title>A Library of ROS&#8208;Catalytic Metalloenzyme Mimics with Atomic Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;catalytic metalloenzyme mimics with 20 different types of atomic metal centers is synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and ROS products.

Metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated centers supported by carbonaceous substrates have emerged as promising artificial metalloenzymes (AMEs) to mimic the biocatalytic effects of their natural counterparts. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined AMEs that contain different atomic metal&#63743;N centers but present similar physicochemical and coordination structures remains a substantial challenge. Here, 20 different types of AMEs with similar geometries and well&#8208;defined atomic metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated centers are synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products. Their oxidase (OXD)&#8208;, peroxidase (POD)&#8208;, and halogen peroxidase (HPO)&#8208;mimetic catalytic behaviors are systematically explored. The Fe&#8208;AME shows the highest OXD&#8208; and HPO&#8208;mimetic activities compared to the other AMEs due to its high vmax (0.927&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;6 m s&#8722;1) and low Km (1.070&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m), while the Cu&#8208;AME displays the best POD&#8208;like performance. Furthermore, theoretical calculation reveals that the ROS&#8208;catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of the metal centers. Benefiting from its facile adsorption of H2O2 molecule and lower energy barrier to generating &#8226;O2&#8722;, the Fe&#8208;AME displays higher ROS&#8208;catalytic performances than the Mn&#8208;AME. The engineered AMEs show not only remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also provide new guidance toward developing metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated biocatalysts for broad application fields.

         <title>Synergy between Palladium Single Atoms and Nanoparticles via Hydrogen Spillover for Enhancing CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Pd1 and PdNPs form a functional catalyst for enhancing photocatalytic CO2 methanation. Pd1 activate CO2, while PdNPs boost H2O dissociation. The H* produced by PdNPs migrates to Pd1 via hydrogen spillover to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer processes. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs stabilize intermediates, such as *CHO. Therefore, efficient photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 is highly favored.








Abstract
Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon&#8208;neutral fuels such as methane (CH4) is extremely desirable but remains a challenge since sluggish multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer and various C1 intermediates are involved. Herein, a synergistic function between single Pd atoms (Pd1) and Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) for photocatalytic CO2 methanation is presented. The catalyst achieves a high selectivity of 97.8% for CH4 production with a yield of 20.3&#160;&#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. Mechanistic studies revealed that Pd1 sites activated CO2, while PdNPs sites boosted water (H2O) dissociation for increased H* coverage. The H* produced by PdNPs migrate to the Pd1 sites to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer via hydrogen spillover. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs effectively stabilized intermediates such as *CHO, thereby favoring the pathway for CH4 production. This work provides a new perspective into the development of selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion through the artful design of synergistic catalytic sites.

         <title>An Engineered Protein&#8722;Au Bioplaster for Efficient Skin Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of engineered protein&#8722;Au bioplaster with outstanding photothermal effect is developed. In this system, the adhesion performance can be enhanced significantly as prolonging irradiation time to achieve stable adhesion on skin surface. This further promotes the heat penetration into the skin tumor site for non&#8208;invasive thermal eradication of melanoma.








Abstract
Melanoma is the most lethal malignancy in skin cancer and may occur at any site and express melanocytes. Due to malignant melanoma's invasion and migration nature, conventional therapies make it challenging to remove the whole tumor tissue while undertaking the high risks of tumor recurrence. Regarding the emerging targeted therapies and immunotherapy, drug resistance and low immunotherapeutic activity remain significant challenges. It is thus becoming urgently important to develop alternative strategies for melanoma therapy. Herein, a novel bifunctional protein&#8208;based photothermal bioplaster (PPTB) is developed for non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy and skin tissue regeneration. The complexation of adhesive protein and gold nanorods (GNRs) endow the obtained PPTB with good biocompatibility, controllable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated adhesion performance, and high photothermal performance. Therefore, the PPTB bioagent facilitates skin adhesion and effectively transfers heat from skin to tumor. This behavior endows PPTB capability to eradicate skin tumors conveniently. Thus, the assembly strategy enables this hybrid bioplaster to hold great potential for skin&#8208;related tumor treatment.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D Electronic Transport in a 2D Magnetic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a 2D semiconductor of interest for its magnetic properties. Temperature&#8208; and gate&#8208;dependent transport exhibit an extreme anisotropy (ca. 102 to 105)&#8212;stronger than in any other 2D semiconductor&#8212;and the photocurrent shows clear signatures of 1D behavior. This work shows that CrSBr is a quasi&#8208;1D electronic system, a unique characteristic in the panorama of known 2D semiconductors.








Abstract
Electronic transport through exfoliated multilayers of CrSBr, a 2D semiconductor of interest because of its magnetic properties, is investigated. An extremely pronounced anisotropy manifesting itself in qualitative and quantitative differences of all quantities measured along the in&#8208;plane a and b crystallographic directions is found. In particular, a qualitatively different dependence of the conductivities &#963;a and &#963;b on temperature and gate voltage, accompanied by orders of magnitude differences in their values (&#963;b/&#963;a&#160;&#8776; 3 &#215; 102&#160;to 105 at low temperature and negative gate voltage) are observed, together with a different behavior of the longitudinal magnetoresistance in the two directions and the complete absence of the Hall effect in transverse resistance measurements. These observations appear not to be compatible with a description in terms of conventional band transport of a 2D doped semiconductor. The observed phenomenology&#8212;and unambiguous signatures of a 1D van Hove singularity detected in energy&#8208;resolved photocurrent measurements&#8212;indicate that electronic transport through CrSBr multilayers is better interpreted by considering the system as formed by weakly and incoherently coupled 1D wires, than by conventional 2D band transport. It is concluded that CrSBr is the first 2D semiconductor to show distinctly quasi&#8208;1D electronic transport properties.

Sustainable Optics
Ores are everywhere on our earth and other planets, and many of them possess layered structures. In article 2110464, Baofu Ding, Bilu Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop a seawater&#8208;assisted green method to produce 2D minerals in large quantities from bulky ores. These 2D minerals are used as inorganic liquid crystals for color optics. This work creates novel opportunities of using abundant naturally minerals for advanced technological applications.

Artificial Nerve Fibers
Artificial nerve fibers with self&#8208;healing ability and stretchability in a cryogenic environment help construct fast and complex information interaction networks for bionic intelligent robots, as described by Zhou Li and co&#8208;workers in article number 2105416. Once accidental mechanical damage to the robot occurs, the artificial nerve fibers can autonomously recover their function and appearance in a short time. This is essential for robots to complete tasks in dynamic extreme environments.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction
In article number 2110552, Aleksandar Staykov, Miho Yamauchi, and co&#8208;workers report that Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded unillamellar hydroxide catalysts drastically enhance the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electronic sates of a catalytic site can be finely tuned by the formation of a Au&#8208;cluster&#8211;hydroxide interface for the OER. Theoretical and advanced spectroscopic study advocates the cooperative mechanism of charge transfer and direct O&#8211;O coupling evoked at the interface.

         <title>2D Materials for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces current progress of 2D materials (2DM) application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) to deal with the limitation of ASSLBs. 2DMs are applied in the different composition of the ASSLBs to enhance its performance. By summarizing the properties, synthesis, application, and characterization, this review points out the future development direction of 2DMs application in ASSLBs.








Abstract
Although one of the most mature battery technologies, lithium&#8208;ion batteries still have many aspects that have not reached the desired requirements, such as energy density, current density, safety, environmental compatibility, and price. To solve these problems, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) based on lithium metal anodes with high energy density and safety have been proposed and become a research hotpot in recent years. Due to the advanced electrochemical properties of 2D materials (2DM), they have been applied to mitigate some of the current problems of ASSLBs, such as high interface impedance and low electrolyte ionic conductivity. In this work, the background and fabrication method of 2DMs are reviewed initially. The improvement strategies of 2DMs are categorized based on their application in the three main components of ASSLBs: The anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Finally, to elucidate the mechanisms of 2DMs in ASSLBs, the role of in situ characterization, synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, and other advanced characterization are discussed.

To solve these problems, all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLB) based on lithium metal anodes with high energy density and safety have been proposed and become a research hotpot in recent years. Due to the advanced electrochemical properties of 2D materials (2DM), they have been applied to mitigate some of the current problems of ASSLBs, such as high interface impedance and low electrolyte ionic conductivity. In this work, the background and fabrication method of 2DMs are reviewed initially. The improvement strategies of 2DMs are categorized based on their application in the three main components of ASSLBs: The anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Finally, to elucidate the mechanisms of 2DMs in ASSLBs, the role of in situ characterization, synchrotron X-ray techniques, and other advanced characterization are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Electronics and Devices as Human&#8211;Machine Interfaces for Medical Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electronics and devices could potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics. Herein, the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces used in prosthetic and rehabilitation robots are summarized in five primary areas: sensing, recording, communication, actuation, and stimulation. The current challenges and outlook of these technologies in medical robotics are discussed.








Abstract
Medical robots are invaluable players in non&#8208;pharmaceutical treatment of disabilities. Particularly, using prosthetic and rehabilitation devices with human&#8211;machine interfaces can greatly improve the quality of life for impaired patients. In recent years, flexible electronic interfaces and soft robotics have attracted tremendous attention in this field due to their high biocompatibility, functionality, conformability, and low&#8208;cost. Flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces on soft robotics will make a promising alternative to conventional rigid devices, which can potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics in terms of rehabilitation feedback and user experience. In this review, the fundamental components of the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8208;machine interfaces are summarized by recent and renowned applications in five primary areas: physical and chemical sensing, physiological recording, information processing and communication, soft robotic actuation, and feedback stimulation. This review further concludes by discussing the outlook and current challenges of these technologies as a human&#8211;machine interface in medical robotics.

         <title>Future&#8208;Oriented Advanced Diarylethene Photoswitches: From Molecular Design to Spontaneous Assembly Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diarylethenes are a new type of photochromic molecules with attractive photofatigue resistance and reversibility. The result of a lot of effort has led to the rapid development of photoresponsive diarylethylenes for smart material applications. The recent advances in the design and assembly of diarylethylene as a multifunctional photoresponsive trigger unit are reviewed.








Abstract
Diarylethene (DAE) photoswitch is a new and promising family of photochromic molecules and has shown superior performance as a smart trigger in stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. During the past few decades, the DAE family has achieved a leap from simple molecules to functional molecules and developed toward validity as a universal switching building block. In recent years, the introduction of DAE into an assembly system has been an attractive strategy that enables the photochromic behavior of the building blocks to be manifested at the level of the entire system, beyond the DAE unit itself. This assembly&#8208;based strategy will bring many unexpected results that promote the design and manufacture of a new generation of advanced materials. Here, recent advances in the design and fabrication of diarylethene as a trigger in materials science, chemistry, and biomedicine are reviewed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Design of Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve global mission of carbon neutrality, green hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting technology has attracted much attention. Developing efficient electrocatalysts working under industrially required current densities is essential for wide implementation of this technology. This review summarizes progress in design of high&#8208;current&#8208;density catalysts, key aspects determining high&#8208;current&#8208;density performance, multiscale catalyst design strategy, and future directions in this emerging field.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting technology for producing &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is important for the global mission of carbon neutrality. Electrocatalysts with decent performance at high current densities play a central role in the industrial implementation of this technology. This field has advanced immensely in recent years, as witnessed by many types of catalysts designed and synthesized toward industriallyrelevant current densities (&gt;200&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). By discussing recent advances in this field, several key aspects are summarized that affect the catalytic performance for high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysis, including dimensionality of catalysts, surface chemistry, electron transport path, morphology, and catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interplay. The multiscale design strategy that considers these aspects comprehensively for developing high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysts are highlighted. The perspectives on the future directions in this emerging field are also put forward.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride on Graphene with Giant Bandgap Renormalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable synthesis of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has remained a daunting challenge. An hBN/graphene&#8208;interface&#8208;mediated growth concept to enable scalable epitaxy of unidirectional high&#8208;quality monolayer hBN on graphene substrates is proposed and demonstrated. A uniform moir&#233; superlattice and robust deep&#8208;ultraviolet excitonic emission (around 6.12 eV) are achieved in such a monolayer hBN/graphene van der Waals heterostructure.








Abstract
Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been widely considered a fundamental building block for 2D heterostructures and devices. However, the controlled and scalable synthesis of hBN and its 2D heterostructures has remained a daunting challenge. Here, an hBN/graphene (hBN/G) interface&#8208;mediated growth process for the controlled synthesis of high&#8208;quality monolayer hBN is proposed and further demonstrated. It is discovered that the in&#8208;plane hBN/G interface can be precisely controlled, enabling the scalable epitaxy of unidirectional monolayer hBN on graphene, which exhibits a uniform moir&#233; superlattice consistent with single&#8208;domain hBN, aligned to the underlying graphene lattice. Furthermore, it is identified that the deep&#8208;ultraviolet emission at 6.12&#160;eV stems from the 1s&#8208;exciton state of monolayer hBN with a giant renormalized direct bandgap on graphene. This work provides a viable path for the controlled synthesis of ultraclean, wafer&#8208;scale, atomically ordered 2D quantum materials, as well as the fabrication of 2D quantum electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Stretchable Redox&#8208;active Semiconducting Polymers for High&#8208;performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is an emerging device platform for next&#8208;generation bioelectronics owing to its uniquely high amplification and sensitivity to biological signals. For achieving seamless tissue&#8208;electronics interfaces for accurate signal acquisition, skin&#8208;like softness and stretchability are essential requirements, which have not yet been imparted onto high&#8208;performance OECTs, largely due to the lack of stretchable redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymers. Here, we report a stretchable semiconductor for OECT devices, namely poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5)yl thiophene) (p(g2T&#8208;T)), which gives exceptional stretchability over 200% strain and 5000 repeated stretching cycles, together with the OECT performance on par with the state of the art. Validated by the systematic characterizations and the comparisons of different polymers, the key design features of this polymer that enable the combination of high stretchability and high OECT performance are non&#8208;linear backbone architecture, moderate side&#8208;chain density, and sufficiently high molecular weight. Using this highly stretchable polymer semiconductor, we fabricated an intrinsically stretchable OECT with the high normalized transconductance (&#8764;223 S cm&#8722;1) and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram (ECG) recording that combines built&#8208;in amplification and unprecedented skin conformability.

&lt;p&gt;Organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is an emerging device platform for next-generation bioelectronics owing to its uniquely high amplification and sensitivity to biological signals. For achieving seamless tissue-electronics interfaces for accurate signal acquisition, skin-like softness and stretchability are essential requirements, which have not yet been imparted onto high-performance OECTs, largely due to the lack of stretchable redox-active semiconducting polymers. Here, we report a stretchable semiconductor for OECT devices, namely poly(2-(3,3&#8242;-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)-[2,2&#8242;-bithiophen]-5)yl thiophene) (p(g2T-T)), which gives exceptional stretchability over 200% strain and 5000 repeated stretching cycles, together with the OECT performance on par with the state of the art. Validated by the systematic characterizations and the comparisons of different polymers, the key design features of this polymer that enable the combination of high stretchability and high OECT performance are non-linear backbone architecture, moderate side-chain density, and sufficiently high molecular weight. Using this highly stretchable polymer semiconductor, we fabricated an intrinsically stretchable OECT with the high normalized transconductance (&#8764;223 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate on-skin electrocardiogram (ECG) recording that combines built-in amplification and unprecedented skin conformability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Real&#8208;space crystal structure analysis by low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series TEM imaging of organic materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution</title>

Abstract
Structural analysis of beam&#8208;sensitive materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represents a significant challenge, as high resolution TEM (HRTEM) requires high electron doses that limits its applicability to stable inorganic materials. Beam sensitive materials, such as organic crystals (of key importance in pharmaceuticals, organic electronics, and biology) must be imaged under low dose conditions, leading to problematic contrast interpretation and the loss of fine structural details. Here, we describe HRTEM imaging of organic crystalline materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution of up to 1.6 &#197; that enabled the real&#8208;space study of crystal structures, as well as observation of co&#8208;existing polymorphs, crystal defects, and atoms. This is made possible by a low&#8208;dose focal series reconstruction (LD&#8208;FSR) methodology developed by us, which provides HRTEM images where contrast reflects true object structure and can be performed on contemporary cryo&#8208;EM instruments available to many research institutions. We imaged copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), perchlorinated analogue of CuPc, and indigo crystalline films. In the case of indigo crystals, we were able to observe co&#8208;existing polymorphs and individual atoms (carbonyl oxygen). In the case of CuPc, we observed several polymorphs, including a new one, for which we elucidated the crystal structure based on direct in&#8208;focus imaging, accomplishing real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation. Direct structural analysis of beam sensitive materials with high resolution that enables the real&#8208;space study of crystals can be transformative for structural science of organic materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Active Sensing based on Triboelectric Generator</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
The demand of portable and wearable chemical or biosensors and their expeditious development in the recent years has created a scientific challenge in terms of their continuous powering. As a result, the mechanical energy harvesters such as piezoelectric and triboelectric generator (TEG) have been explored recently either as sensors or harvesters to store charge in small, but long&#8208;life, energy storage devices to power the sensors. The use of energy harvesters as sensor is particularly interesting as with such multifunctional operations it is possible to reduce the number devices needed in a system, which also helps overcome the integration complexities. In this regard, TEGs are promising, particularly for energy autonomous chemical and biological sensors, as they can be developed with wide variety of materials and their mechanical energy to electricity conversion can be modulated by various analytes. This review focusses on this interesting dimension of TEGs and presents various self&#8208;powered active chemical and biological sensors. A brief discussion about the development of TEG based physical, magnetic and optical sensors is also included. The influence of environmental factors, various figures of merit, and significance of TEG design are explained in context with the active sensing. Finally, the key applications, challenges and future perspective of chemical and biological detection via TEG are discussed with a view to drive further advances in the field of self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Tasking Flexible Sensor via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural disasters have been reported globally, and one source of severe damage to cities is flooding caused by locally heavy rain. Sharing of local weather information can save lives. However, it is difficult to collect local weather information in real&#8208;time because such data collection requires bulky, expensive sensors. For local, real&#8208;time monitoring of heavy rain and wind, a sensor system should be simple and low&#8208;cost so that it can be attached to a variety of surfaces, including roofs, vehicles, and umbrellas. To develop simple, low&#8208;cost multi&#8208;tasking sensors located on non&#8208;planar surfaces, we have devised a flexible rain sensor to monitor waterdrop volume and wind velocity. To monitor both simultaneously, a laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based superhydrophobic conductive film is introduced. Using the superhydrophobic surface, water dynamics are measured when waterdrops collide with the sensor surface, and obtained time series data are processed using &#8220;reservoir computing&#8221;, to extract volume and velocity from a single sensor as multi&#8208;tasking electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we show that the sensor measures continuous, long&#8208;term volume and wind change dynamics. The results demonstrate feasibility of multi&#8208;tasking electronics with reservoir computing to reduce sensor integration complexity with low power consumption for both sensor and signal processing.

         <title>Effective Passivation with Self&#8208;Organized Molecules for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% over the past decade and effective passivation for the interface with high trap density plays a significant role in this process. Here, we study two organic molecules as passivators and demonstrate that an advantageous molecular geometry and intermolecular ordering, aside from the functional moieties, are of great significance for effective and extensive passivation. Besides, the passivation molecules spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adjacent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which greatly reduce defect&#8208;assisted recombination throughout the whole perovskite/SnO2 interface. The champion device yields an in&#8208;lab PCE of 25.05% (certified 24.39%). Our investigation provides a more comprehensive understanding of passivation and a new avenue to achieve effective bottom&#8208;interface engineering for perovskite photovoltaic.

         <title>A New Polystyrene&#8208;Polyvinyl Pyridinium Ionic Copolymer Dopant for N&#8208;Type All&#8208;Polymer Thermoelectrics with High Stable Conductivity Relative to Seebeck Coefficient Giving High Power Factor</title>

Abstract
A novel n&#8208;type copolymer dopant polystyrene&#8208;polyvinyl hexylpyridinium fluoride (PSpF) with fluoride anion is designed and synthesized by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. To our knowledge, it is the first polymeric fluoride dopant. Electrical conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1 and high power factor of 67 &#956;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved for PSpF doped polymer films, with a corresponding decrease in thermal conductivity as the PSpF concentration is increased, giving the highest ZT of 0.1. An especially high electrical conductivity of 58 S cm&#8211;1 at 88 &#176;C and outstanding thermal stability were recorded. Further, organic transistors of PSpF&#8208;doped thin films exhibit high electron mobility and Hall mobility of 0.86 and 1.70 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, respectively. The results suggest that polystyrene&#8208;polyvinyl pyridinium salt copolymers with fluoride anion are promising for high performance n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics. This work provides a new way to realize organic thermoelectrics with high conductivity relative to Seebeck coefficient, high power factor, thermal stability and broad processing window.

         <title>Highly Effective Stroke Therapy Enabled by Genetically Engineered Viral Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RGD&#8208;displaying phage (R&#8208;phage) is used to decorate silk fibroin protein microparticles. The resultant hybrid materials can not only promote adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of neural stem cells (NSCs), but also induce NSCs to differentiate preferentially into neurons. After being implanted into the stroke&#8208;induced cavities, they can induce both angiogenesis and neurogenesis to promote the brain&#8208;tissue regeneration for repairing the cavities.








Abstract
Stroke results in the formation of a cavity in the infarcted brain tissue. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis are poor in the cavity, preventing brain&#8208;tissue regeneration for stroke therapy. To regenerate brain tissue in the cavity, filamentous phages, the human&#8208;safe nanofiber&#8208;like bacteria&#8208;specific viruses, are genetically engineered to display many copies of RGD peptide on the sidewalls. The viral nanofibers, electrostatically coated on biocompatible injectable silk protein microparticles, not only promote adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of neural stem cells (NSCs), but also induce NSCs to differentiate preferentially into neurons in basal medium within 3 d. After the NSC&#8208;loaded microparticles are injected into the stroke cavity of rat models, the phage nanofibers on the microparticles stimulate angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the stroke sites within two weeks for brain regeneration, leading to functional recovery of limb motor control of rats within 12 weeks. The viral nanofibers also brought about the desired outcomes for stroke therapy, such as reducing inflammatory response, decreasing thickness of astrocytes scars, and increasing neuroblasts response in the subventricular zone. As virtually any functional peptide can be displayed on the phage by genetic means, the phage nanofibers hold promise as a unique and effective injectable biomaterial for stroke therapy.

Abstract
Proton conduction underlies many important electrochemical technologies. We report a family of new proton electrolytes: acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte (AiCE) prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, which can be made into thin&#8208;film (tens of microns) fluid&#8208;impervious membranes. The chosen example systems (sepiolite&#8208;phosphoric acid) rank top among the solid proton conductors in terms of proton conductivities (15 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#176;C, 0.023 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;82&#176;C), electrochemical stability window (3.35&#160;V), and reduced chemical activity. A proton battery was assembled using AiCE as the solid electrolyte membrane. Benefitting from the wider electrochemical stability window, reduced corrosivity, and excellent ionic selectivity of AiCE, the two main problems (gassing and cyclability) of proton batteries have been successfully solved. This work draws attention to the element cross&#8208;over problem in proton batteries and the generic &#8220;acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay&#8221; solid electrolyte approach with superfast proton transport, outstanding selectivity, and improved stability for room&#8208; to cryogenic&#8208;temperature protonic applications.

         <title>Steric Engineering Enables Efficient and Photostable wide&#8208;bandgap Perovskites for all&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (&#8764;1.8&#160;eV) perovskite is an crucial component to pair with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite in low&#8208;cost monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the stability and efficiency of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells are constrained by the light&#8208;induced halide segregation and by the large photovoltage deficit. Here we report a steric engineering to obtain high&#8208;quality and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites (&#8764;1.8&#160;eV) suitable for all&#8208;perovskite tandems. By alloying dimethylammonium and chloride into the mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, wide bandgaps are obtained with much lower bromide contents while the lattice strain and trap densities are simultaneously minimized. The wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells exhibit considerably improved performance and photostability, retaining &gt;90%&#160;of their initial efficiencies after 1000 hours of operation at maximum power point. With the triple&#8208;cation/triple&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites enabled by steric engineering, we further obtain a stabilized PCE of 26.0% in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Our strategy provides an avenue to fabricate efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap subcells for multi&#8208;junction photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Multimode Electron Tomography sheds light on synthesis, structure, and properties of complex metal&#8208;based nanoparticles</title>

Abstract
Electron tomography has become a cornerstone technique for the visualization of nanoparticle morphology in three dimensions. However, to obtain in&#8208;depth information about a nanoparticle beyond surface faceting and morphology, different electron microscopy signals must be combined. The most notable examples of these combined signals include annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) with different collection angles and the combination of ADF&#8208;STEM with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray or electron energy loss spectroscopies. This review summarizes the experimental and computational development of various multimode tomography techniques in connection to fundamental materials science challenges that multimode tomography has been instrumental to overcoming. Although the techniques can be applied to a wide variety of compositions, we restrict ourselves to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the sake of simplicity. Current challenges and future directions of multimode tomography are additionally discussed.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Solar Cells with 19.17% Efficiency Enabled by Introducing One Asymmetric Guest Acceptor</title>

Abstract
The ternary strategy has been widely identified as an effective approach to obtaining high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the non&#8208;radiative voltage loss lies between those of the two binary devices, which limits further efficiency improvements. Herein, we designed an asymmetric guest acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl and incorporated it into the PM1:L8&#8208;BO host blend. Compared with the L8&#8208;BO neat film, the L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;2F2Cl blend film shows higher photoluminescence quantum yield and larger exciton diffusion length. Introducing BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the host blend extends its absorption spectra, improves the molecular packing of host materials, and suppresses the non&#8208;radiative charge recombination of the ternary OSCs. Consequently, the PCE is improved up to 19.17% (certified value 18.7%), which represents the highest efficiency value reported for single&#8208;junction OSCs so far. The results show that improving the exciton behaviors is a promising approach to reducing the non&#8208;radiative voltage loss and realizing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Double&#8208;Lattice Packing of Pentagonal Gold Bipyramids in Supercrystals with Triclinic Symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentagonal gold bipyramids are self&#8208;assembled into extended superlattices. Multimodal analysis indicate the formation of supercrystals with a low&#8208;symmetry triclinic structure and with a two&#8208;particle unit cell. Computer simulations confirm that the structure corresponds to the densest possible packing. The supercrystals display a facet&#8208;dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications, and for fundamental studies of self&#8208;assembly processes.








Abstract
Pentagonal packing is a long&#8208;standing issue and a rich mathematical topic, brought to the fore by recent progress in nanoparticle design. Gold pentagonal bipyramids combine fivefold symmetry and anisotropy and their section varies along the length. In this work, colloidal supercrystals of pentagonal gold bipyramids are obtained in a compact arrangement that generalizes the optimal packing of regular pentagons in the plane.

     alt="Double-Lattice Packing of Pentagonal Gold Bipyramids in Supercrystals with Triclinic Symmetry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentagonal gold bipyramids are self-assembled into extended superlattices. Multimodal analysis indicate the formation of supercrystals with a low-symmetry triclinic structure and with a two-particle unit cell. Computer simulations confirm that the structure corresponds to the densest possible packing. The supercrystals display a facet-dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications, and for fundamental studies of self-assembly processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentagonal packing is a long-standing issue and a rich mathematical topic, brought to the fore by recent progress in nanoparticle design. Gold pentagonal bipyramids combine fivefold symmetry and anisotropy and their section varies along the length. In this work, colloidal supercrystals of pentagonal gold bipyramids are obtained in a compact arrangement that generalizes the optimal packing of regular pentagons in the plane. Multimodal investigations reveal a two-particle unit cell with triclinic symmetry, a lower symmetry than that of the building blocks. Monte Carlo computer simulations show that this lattice achieves the densest possible packing. Going beyond pentagons, further simulations show an odd&#8211;even effect of the number of sides on the packing: odd-sided bipyramids are non-centrosymmetric and require the double-lattice arrangement to recover inversion symmetry. The supercrystals display a facet-dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications, and for fundamental studies of self-assembly processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Salt&#8208;assisted 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; Phase Transformation of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) has demonstrated great potentials in the fields of catalysis, electronics, energy storage and conversion, and condensed matter physics. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with unconventional metastable phases (e.g., 1T and 1T&#8242;) has attracted increasing research interest due to their unique and appealing physicochemical properties. However, there is still a lack of simple, universal, and controlled method for the preparation of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase TMD crystals, restricting their further fundamental study and practical applications. Here, we report a facile, one&#8208;step salt&#8208;assisted general strategy for the controlled phase transformation of commercially available TMDs with conventional 2H phase, yielding a large amount of metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;phase TMDs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2. It is found that the easily accessible metal salts, such as K2C2O4&#183;H2O, K2CO3, Na2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, KHCO3, NaHCO3 and NaC2O4, can be used to assist the 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; phase transformation, greatly simplifying the synthetic process for producing metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs. Importantly, this method can also be used to prepare 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMD alloys, such as 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2xSe2(1&#8208;x). This newly developed strategy is robust and highly effective, which could also be used for the phase engineering of other materials with various polymorphs.

         <title>Renal Clearable Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Early Detection of Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major complication in many clinical settings, it remains a diagnostic dilemma due to its reliance on insensitive assays or invasive biopsy. We herein report the development of an activatable polymeric nanoprobe (APNSO) for real&#8208;time in vivo near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and urinalysis of hepatic IRI. APNSO has the backbone comprising renal&#8208;clearable fluorophore fragments and the self&#8208;immolative structure units. In the presence of oxidative stress biomarker (superoxide anion, O2&#8226;&#8211;) during hepatic IRI, APNSO can be fluorescently activated for in vivo NIRF imaging and depolymerized to release renal&#8208;clearable fluorophore for urinalysis. By virtue of its high hepatic accumulation, sensitive response towards O2&#8226;&#8211;, and effective release of renal&#8208;clearable fluorophores, APNSO&#8208;based imaging and urinalysis detect hepatic IRI at least 7 h earlier than the typical clinical assays in mouse model. This study not only provides new opportunities for non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of hepatic IRI, but also reveals guidelines for development of optical nanosensors for early urinalysis.

         <title>Identification the Stable Pt Single Sites in the Environment of Ions: From Mechanism to Design Principle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For single atom (SA) based catalysis, it is urgent to understand the nature and dynamic evolution of SA active sites during the reactions. Herein, an example of Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS) displays interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via the synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy and theory calculations, results show that there exist two kinds of Pt sites: PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Ptads&#8208;S2 (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na2S, the S2&#8211; can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites, but left more stable PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40&#160;mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1). While in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Ptads&#8208;S2 sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity. Moreover, a Pt SA&#8208;ZCS&#8208;Sulfur composite is designed mainly covered by PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites accordingly (max: 79.09&#160;mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, 5% drop after 6 h and QE: 14.0% at 420&#160;nm), showing a beneficial strategy &#8220;from mechanism to design principle&#8221;.

         <title>Formation of Pixelated Elastic Films via Capillary Suction of Curable Elastomers in Templated Hele&#8208;Shaw Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural materials are highly organized into intricate and sophisticated hierarchical structures from which superior properties emerge. In the wake of biomimicry, there is a growing interest in designing architected materials in the laboratory as such structures could enable myriad functionalities in engineering. Yet, their fabrication remains challenging despite recent progress in additive manufacturing. In particular, soft materials are typically poorly suited to form the requisite structures consisting of regular geometries. Here we&#160;report a new frugal methodology to fabricate pixelated soft materials. Our&#160;approach is conceptually analogous to the watershed transform used in image analysis and allows the passive assembly of complex geometries through the capillary&#8208;mediated flow of curable elastomers in confined geometries. Emerging from sources distributed across a Hele&#8208;Shaw cell consisting of two parallel flat plates separated by an infinitesimally small gap, these flows eventually meet at the &#8220;dividing lines&#8221; thereby forming Voronoi tesselations. After curing is complete, these structures turn into composite elastic sheets. Rationalizing the fluid mechanics at play allows us to tailor the structural geometry of the newly formed sheets and thereby tune their local materials&#160;properties.

Abstract
Current exosome engineering methods usually leads to the damage of exosome morphology and membrane, which cannot meet the complex needs of disease treatment. Herein, a concept of &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; is proposed to construct an engineered exosome nano&#8208;therapy platform including independent artificial module and natural module. Artificial module with movement/chemotaxis function is first synthesized, and then it is controllably combined with natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode through &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method. The whole process can not only maintain the activity of the natural exosome module, but also endow it with motion ability, so as to realize the purpose of &#8220;cascading function&#8221; in the process of disease treatment. The above engineered exosomes are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the multi&#8208;step targeting strategy of &#8220;disease microenvironment&#8208;damaged cells&#8208;diseased mitochondria&#8221; and the multi&#8208;stage intervention concept of &#8220;inhibiting deterioration and promoting repair&#8221; are proposed, so as to break through the bottleneck of the existing treatment of PD.

         <title>Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Long&#8208;Term Tumor Tracking with Incremental NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) is designed and synthesized for long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor progression in mice, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for noninvasive in vivo cell tracking. In contrast to current exogenous probes, the COE emission intensity increases with tumor growth, thereby harnessing advantages of both direct&#8208;labeling and indirect&#8208;labeling methods.








Abstract
The design and synthesis of the near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;II emissive conjugated oligoelectrolyte COE&#8208;BBT are reported. COE&#8208;BBT has a solubility in aqueous media greater than 50&#160;mg mL&#8722;1, low toxicity, and a propensity to intercalate lipid bilayers, wherein it exhibits a higher emission quantum yield relative to aqueous media. Addition of COE&#8208;BBT to cells provides two emission channels, at &#8776;500 and &#8776;1020&#160;nm, depending on the excitation wavelength, which facilitates in vitro confocal microscopy and in vivo animal imaging. The NIR&#8208;II emission of COE&#8208;BBT is used to track intracranial and subcutaneous tumor progression in mice. Of relevance is that the total NIR&#8208;II intensity increases over time. This phenomenon is attributed to a progressive attenuation of a COE&#8208;BBT self&#8208;quenching effect within the cells due to the expected dye dilution per cell as the tumor proliferates.

         <title>Semiconductor Contact&#8208;Electrification&#8208;Dominated Tribovoltaic Effect for Ultrahigh Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first semiconductor direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC&#8208;TENG) using gallium nitride and bismuth telluride is designed for ultrahigh power generation (40&#160;V, 2.56 A&#8201;m&#8722;2, 11.85 W&#8201;m&#8722;2). Compared to traditional polymer TENGs and previous centimeter&#8208;level SDC&#8208;TENGs, this work sets the normalized power density record for TENGs, which demonstrates the great potential of the tribovoltaic effect for energy harvesting and sensing.








Abstract
The semiconductor direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC&#8208;TENG) based on the tribovoltaic effect is promising for developing a new semiconductor energy technology with high power density. Here, the first SDC&#8208;TENG built using gallium nitride (GaN) and bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) for ultrahigh&#8208;power generation is reported. During the friction process, an additional interfacial electric field is formed by continuous contact electrification (CE), and abundant electron&#8211;hole pairs are excited and move directionally to form a junction current that is always internally from Bi2Te3 to GaN, regardless of the semiconductor type. The peak open&#8208;circuit voltage can reach up to 40&#160;V and the power density is 11.85 W m&#8722;2 (average value is 9.23 W m&#8722;2), which is approximately 200 times higher than that of previous centimeter&#8208;level SDC&#8208;TENGs. Moreover, compared to traditional polymer TENGs under the same conditions, the average power density is remarkably improved by over 40 times. This study provides the first evidence of CE on the tribovoltaic effect and sets the normalized power density record for TENGs, which demonstrates a great potential of the tribovoltaic effect for energy harvesting and sensing.

         <title>Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conduction, a Multifunctional Property in Organic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and dynamic tuning of organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors influence a myriad of functional properties: energy levels, conductivity, color, modulus, and volume for a diverse range of real&#8208;world applications. Several chemical and structural design approaches to modify OMIECs&#8217; properties are highlighted, and how various stimuli such as electrical, chemical, and optical inputs fundamentally change OMIECs&#8217; properties dynamically, along with how these changes can be utilized in device applications, is discussed.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) have gained recent interest and rapid development due to their versatility in diverse applications ranging from sensing, actuation and computation to energy harvesting/storage, and information transfer. Their multifunctional properties arise from their ability to simultaneously participate in redox reactions as well as modulation of ionic and electronic charge density throughout the bulk of the material. Most importantly, the ability to access charge states with deep modulation through a large extent of its density of states and physical volume of the material enables OMIEC&#8208;based devices to display exciting new characteristics and opens up new degrees of freedom in device design. Leveraging the infinite possibilities of the organic synthetic toolbox, this perspective highlights several chemical and structural design approaches to modify OMIECs&#8217; properties important in device applications such as electronic and ionic conductivity, color, modulus, etc. Additionally, the ability for OMIECs to respond to external stimuli and transduce signals to myriad types of outputs has accelerated their development in smart systems. This perspective further illustrates how various stimuli such as electrical, chemical, and optical inputs fundamentally change OMIECs&#8217; properties dynamically and how these changes can be utilized in device applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Performance for Three&#8208;Way Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique dual&#8208;site catalyst composed of Pt and Pd atoms located in neighboring positions on the surface of CeO2 is fabricated, which possesses outstanding TWC performance, especially for NO elimination. The enhancement can be attributed to the strong interactions between the Pt and Pd atoms by formation of Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Pd fine structures.








Abstract
In response to growing levels of air pollution and emission regulations, novel three&#8208;way catalysts (TWCs) with high efficiency are highly coveted. Herein, a multi&#8208;step heating strategy to fabricate a unique dual&#8208;site catalyst composed of strongly coupled Pt and Pd atoms located in neighboring positions on the surface of CeO2 is demonstrated. Outstanding three&#8208;way catalytic performance is demonstrated, especially for NO elimination. Based on comprehensive investigations, the enhancement is attributed to the strong interactions between the neighboring Pt and Pd atoms, which can separately serve as active sites for CO and NO adsorption, efficiently reducing the energy barrier and accelerating the reaction rate. These findings not only contribute to designing and constructing next&#8208;generation catalysts, but also provide a promising opportunity to improve fuel efficiency and control emissions.

         <title>16.52% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with High Tolerance of the Photoactive Layer Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 16.52% efficiency all&#8208;polymer solar cell is achieved by morphology control of the photoactive layer through adding a low&#8208;cost polymer donor, PTQ10, into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend. Meanwhile, ternary devices exhibit a high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness, with high power conversion efficiencies of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thicknesses of &#8776;205 and &#8776;306&#160;nm, respectively.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have drawn growing attention and achieved tremendous progress recently, but their power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based PSCs due to the relative difficulty on morphology control of polymer photoactive blends. Here, low&#8208;cost PTQ10 is introduced as a second polymer donor (a third component) into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend to finely tune the energy&#8208;level matching and microscopic morphology of the polymer blend photoactive layer. The addition of PTQ10 decreases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, and increases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking coherence length and the ordered face&#8208;on molecular packing orientation, which improves the charge separation and transport in the photoactive layer. Moreover, the deeper highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of the PTQ10 polymer donor than PM6 leads to higher open&#8208;circuit voltage of the ternary all&#8208;PSCs. As a result, a PCE of 16.52% is achieved for ternary all&#8208;PSCs, which is one of the highest PCEs for all&#8208;PSCs. In addition, the ternary devices exhibit a high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness with high PCEs of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thickness of &#8776;205 and &#8776;306&#160;nm, respectively, which are the highest PCEs so far for all&#8208;PSCs with a thick photoactive layer.

         <title>A Tumor Microenvironments&#8208;Adapted Polypeptide Hydrogel/Nanogel Composite Boosts Antitumor Molecularly Targeted Inhibition and Immunoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironments&#8208;adapted composite consisting of a thermosensitive hydrogel and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel achieves sequential release of molecularly targeted drug and TGF&#8208;&#946; inhibitor in the tumor cells, blocks the proliferation of tumor cells, reverses the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition caused by elevated TGF&#8208;&#946;, and regulates the tumor immune microenvironments, thereby effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastases.








Abstract
Various macro/microscopic biomaterials have been developed for controlled drug delivery in the combination therapy of malignancies. However, uncertain loading ratio, release sequence, and spatiotemporal distribution of drugs hinder their synergistic therapeutic effects and clinical applications. In this work, a tumor microenvironments&#8208;adapted composite consisting of a thermosensitive hydrogel and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel is developed for precisely sequential drug release to enhance molecularly targeted therapy and amplify immune activation. LY3200882 (LY), a selective transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor, is encapsulated in the ROS&#8208;responsive nanogel and dispersed uniformly with regorafenib (REG) in a thermosensitive hydrogel (Gel/(REG+NG/LY)). After in situ administration, REG is preferentially released from the hydrogel to inhibit tumor growth and promote ROS generation, which triggers the subsequent on&#8208;demand release of LY from the nanogel. LY contributes to preventing the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition and immune escape of tumor cells induced by elevated TGF&#8208;&#946;. In subcutaneous and orthotopic colorectal tumor bearing mouse models, Gel/(REG+NG/LY) effectively inhibits tumor growth and liver metastases by increasing the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, reducing the recruitment of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and promoting the polarization of macrophages from M2 to M1 type, indicating the significant potential in improving the prognosis of advanced cancer patients.

         <title>Highly Stable Halide&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8211;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent thermodynamic mechanism of the lithiation/delithiation process of the Se cathode is revealed in the halide electrolyte system, benefiting from its wide electrochemical stability window and excellent stability toward Se. The highly mixed conductive character of the Se&#8211;Li3HoCl6 cathode ensures fast charge transfer and good performance of an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se cell.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;Se batteries are promising devices that can address the safety and electrochemical stability issues that arise from liquid&#8208;based systems. However, solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se/S batteries usually present poor cycling stability due to the high resistance interfaces and decomposition of solid electrolytes caused by their narrow electrochemical stability windows. Here, an integrated solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se battery based on a halide Li3HoCl6 solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity is presented. The intrinsic wide electrochemical stability window of the Li3HoCl6 and its stability toward Se and the lithiated species effectively inhibit degeneration of the electrolyte and the Se cathode by suppressing side reactions. The inherent thermodynamic mechanism of the lithiation/delithiation process of the Se cathode in solid is also revealed and confirmed by theoretical calculations. The battery achieves a reversible capacity of 402 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 750 cycles. The electrochemical performance, thermodynamic lithiation/delithiation mechanism, and stability of metal&#8208;halide&#8208;based Li&#8211;Se batteries confer theoretical study and practical applicability that extends to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Programming of Liquid Metal&#8208;Composite Microstructures through Direct Ink Write 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D printing strategy to program liquid metal&#8211;composite microstructures on demand throughout a part is introduced. Elastomer composites are created with unique liquid metal (LM) microdroplet architectures including smooth to discrete transitions from spherical to needle&#8208;like microstructures, curvilinear microstructures, connected LM networks, and geometrically complex patterns. This approach can enable applications in soft electronics, robotics, and reconfigurable structures.








Abstract
Soft, elastically deformable composites with liquid metal (LM) droplets can enable new generations of soft electronics, robotics, and reconfigurable structures. However, techniques to control local composite microstructure, which ultimately governs material properties and performance, is lacking. Here a direct ink writing technique is developed to program the LM&#160;microstructure (i.e., shape, orientation, and connectivity) on demand throughout elastomer composites. In contrast to inks with rigid particles that have fixed shape and size, it is shown that emulsion inks with LM&#160;fillers enable in situ control of microstructure. This enables filaments, films, and 3D structures with unique LM microstructures that are generated on demand and locked in during printing. This includes smooth and discrete transitions from spherical to needle&#8208;like droplets, curvilinear microstructures, geometrically complex embedded inclusion patterns, and connected LM networks. The printed materials are soft (modulus &lt; 200 kPa), highly deformable (&gt;600 % strain), and can be made locally insulating or electrically conductive using a single ink by controlling the process conditions. These capabilities are demonstrated by embedding elongated LM droplets in a&#160;soft heat sink, which rapidly dissipates heat from high&#8208;power LEDs. These&#160;programmable microstructures can enable new composite paradigms for emerging technologies that demand mechanical compliance with multifunctional response.

         <title>Nanoscale Faceting and Ligand Shell Structure Dominate the Self&#8208;Assembly of Nonpolar Nanoparticles into Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superlattice formation by self&#8208;assembly in liquid is a nanoengineering technique with broad technological applications. Liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy reveals that faceted nanoparticles assemble differently on SiN surfaces with altered electrostatic and long&#8208;range attraction, demonstrating that the nanoscale morphology of the nanoparticles and the substrate's surface control the self&#8208;assembled superlattices.

Self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale structures at liquid&#8211;solid interfaces occurs in a broad range of industrial processes and is found in various phenomena in nature. Conventional theory assumes spherical particles and homogeneous surfaces, but that model is oversimplified, and nanoscale in situ observations are needed for a more complete understanding. Liquid&#8208;phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;STEM) is used to examine the interactions that direct the self&#8208;assembly of superlattices formed by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in nonpolar liquids. Varying the molecular coating of the substrate modulates short&#8208;range attraction and leads to switching between a range of different geometric structures, including hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), simple hexagonal (sh), dodecahedral quasi&#8208;crystal (dqc), and body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) lattices, as well as random distributions. Langevin dynamics simulations explain the experimental results in terms of the interplay between nanoparticle faceting, ligand shell structure, and substrate&#8211;NP interactions.

         <title>Modularizable Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Based Open Surfaces Enable Programmable Chemical Transport and Feeding using Liquid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;infused porous surface is created as an open surface platform for droplet reactors, where the LC phase transition triggers the chemical reaction by releasing reactants from the surface. The LC surfaces also exhibit desirable levels of automation, responsiveness, controllability, and modularizability, which find potential use in a realm of droplet reactors, materials synthesis, and regenerative cell therapy.








Abstract
Droplet&#8208;based miniature reactors have attracted interest in both fundamental studies, for the unique reaction kinetics they enable, and applications in bio&#8208;diagnosis and material synthesis. However, the precise and automatic feeding of chemicals, important for the delicate reactions in these miniaturized chemical reactors, either requires complex, high&#8208;cost microfluidic devices or lacks the capability to maintain a pinning&#8208;free droplet movement. Here, the design and synthesis of a new class of liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based open surfaces, which enable a controlled chemical release via a programmable LC phase transition without sacrificing the free transport of the droplets, are reported. It is demonstrated that their intrinsic slipperiness and self&#8208;healing properties enable a modularizable assembly of LC surfaces that can be loaded with different chemicals to achieve a wide range of chemical reactions carried out within the droplets, including sequential and parallel chemical reactions, crystal growth, and polymer synthesis. Finally, an LC&#8208;based chemical feeding device is developed that can automatically control the release of chemicals to direct the simultaneous differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into endothelial progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes. Overall, these LC surfaces exhibit desirable levels of automation, responsiveness, and controllability for use in miniature droplet carriers and reactors.

         <title>Adaptive Biosensing and Neuromorphic Classification Based on an Ambipolar Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive neuromorphic sensor system can locally process and classify biosignals based on a single high&#8208;performance material. This material is an organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor (OMIEC) based on a conjugated polymer P&#8208;3O, exhibiting exceptional ambipolar transistor properties and high stability. This versatile material enables straightforward fabrication and integration of electronic components, including transistors, ambipolar inverters, memory devices, and dopamine sensors.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are central to bioelectronic applications such as biosensors, health&#8208;monitoring devices, and neural interfaces, and have facilitated efficient next&#8208;generation brain&#8208;inspired computing and biohybrid systems. Despite these examples, smart and adaptive circuits that can locally process and optimize biosignals have not yet been realized. Here, a tunable sensing circuit is shown that can locally modulate biologically relevant signals like electromyograms (EMGs) and electrocardiograms (ECGs), that is based on a complementary logic inverter combined with a neuromorphic memory element, and that is constructed from a single polymer mixed conductor. It is demonstrated that a small neuromorphic array based on this material effects high classification accuracy in heartbeat anomaly detection. This high&#8208;performance material allows for straightforward monolithic integration, which reduces fabrication complexity while also achieving high on/off ratios with excellent ambient p&#8208; and n&#8208;type stability in transistor performance. This material opens a route toward simple and straightforward fabrication and integration of more sophisticated adaptive circuits for future smart bioelectronics.

         <title>Volumetric Bioprinting of Organoids and Optically Tuned Hydrogels to Build Liver&#8208;Like Metabolic Biofactories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven volumetric bioprinting enables the layerless fabrication of constructs embedding human liver organoids. Bioresins with tunable refractive index allow printing of centimeter&#8208;scale tissue analogs at high cell density in below 20 s. Organoids mature into hepatocytic structures with native&#8208;like polarization. Bioprinted mathematically defined architectures modulate liver functions such as ammonia detoxification in a geometry&#8208;dependent manner, opening new possibilities for liver biofabrication.








Abstract
Organ&#8208; and tissue&#8208;level biological functions are intimately linked to microscale cell&#8211;cell interactions and to the overarching tissue architecture. Together, biofabrication and organoid technologies offer the unique potential to engineer multi&#8208;scale living constructs, with cellular microenvironments formed by stem cell self&#8208;assembled structures embedded in customizable bioprinted geometries. This study introduces the volumetric bioprinting of complex organoid&#8208;laden constructs, which capture key functions of the human liver. Volumetric bioprinting via optical tomography shapes organoid&#8208;laden gelatin hydrogels into complex centimeter&#8208;scale 3D structures in under 20 s. Optically tuned bioresins enable refractive index matching of specific intracellular structures, countering the disruptive impact of cell&#8208;mediated light scattering on printing resolution. This layerless, nozzle&#8208;free technique poses no harmful mechanical stresses on organoids, resulting in superior viability and morphology preservation post&#8208;printing. Bioprinted organoids undergo hepatocytic differentiation showing albumin synthesis, liver&#8208;specific enzyme activity, and remarkably acquired native&#8208;like polarization. Organoids embedded within low stiffness gelatins (&lt;2&#160;kPa) are bioprinted into mathematically defined lattices with varying degrees of pore network tortuosity, and cultured under perfusion. These structures act as metabolic biofactories in which liver&#8208;specific ammonia detoxification can be enhanced by the architectural profile of the constructs. This technology opens up new possibilities for regenerative medicine and personalized drug testing.

         <title>Topological Antiferromagnetic Van der Waals Phase in Topological Insulator/Ferromagnet Heterostructures Synthesized by a CMOS&#8208;Compatible Sputtering Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Study of topological magnetic phases formed in topological insulators coupled with a ferromagnet is performed on a high&#8208;quality c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented Bi2Te3 thin film grown using a magnetron sputtering process. A topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 is revealed in the interface of Bi2Te3 coupled with the ferromagnet, Ni80Fe20. The Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is found to contain Ni&#8722;Te bonds and shows evidence of the formation of the topological AFM compound NiBi2Te4.








Abstract
Breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry by introducing magnetic order, thereby opening a gap in the topological surface state bands, is essential for realizing useful topological properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. In this work, a novel topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is created at the interface of a sputtered, c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented, topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructure&#8212;Bi2Te3/Ni80Fe20 because of diffusion of Ni in Bi2Te3 (Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3). The AFM property of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interfacial layer is established by observation of spontaneous exchange bias in the magnetic hysteresis loop and compensated moments in the depth profile of the magnetization using polarized neutron reflectometry. Analysis of the structural and chemical properties of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is carried out using selected&#8208;area electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies, in parallel with first&#8208;principles calculations, indicate a solid&#8208;state chemical reaction that leads to the formation of Ni&#8722;Te bonds and the presence of topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) compound NiBi2Te4 in the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interface layer. The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is &#8776;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway toward industrial complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;process&#8208;compatible sputtered&#8208;MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.

In this work, a novel topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is created at the interface of a sputtered, &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis-oriented, topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructure&#8212;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; because of diffusion of Ni in Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The AFM property of the Ni-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interfacial layer is established by observation of spontaneous exchange bias in the magnetic hysteresis loop and compensated moments in the depth profile of the magnetization using polarized neutron reflectometry. Analysis of the structural and chemical properties of the Ni-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer is carried out using selected-area electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies, in parallel with first-principles calculations, indicate a solid-state chemical reaction that leads to the formation of Ni&#8722;Te bonds and the presence of topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) compound NiBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the Ni-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface layer. The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer is &#8776;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway toward industrial complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS)-process-compatible sputtered-MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change&#8208;Enabled, Rapid, High&#8208;Resolution Direct Ink Writing of Soft Silicone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel direct ink writing (DIW) method for 3D printing high&#8208;resolution soft silicones, enabled by the fast control of phase&#8208;change ink's flow behavior is presented. Printed filaments with a diameter of 50 &#181;m set a new benchmark in DIW of soft silicone. This technology exhibits excellent performances in the fabrication of flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape&#8208;memory bionic devices.








Abstract
Soft silicone is an ideal flexible material for application, e.g., in soft robotics, flexible electronics, bionics, or implantable biomedical devices. However, gravity&#8208;driven sagging, filament stretching, and deformation can cause inevitable defects during rapid manufacturing, making it hard to obtain complex, high&#8208;resolution 3D silicone structures with direct ink writing (DIW) technology. Here, rapid DIW of soft silicone enabled by a phase&#8208;change&#8208;induced, reversible change of the ink's hierarchical microstructure is presented. During printing, the silicone&#8208;based ink, containing silica nanoparticles and wax microparticles, is extruded from a heated nozzle into a cold environment under controlled stress. The wax phase change (solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid) during printing rapidly destroys and rebuilds the particle networks, realizing fast control of the ink flow behavior and printability. This high&#8208;operating&#8208;temperature DIW method is fast (maximum speed &#8776;3100&#160;mm min&#8722;1) and extends the DIW scale range of soft silicone. The extruded filaments have small diameters (50&#160;&#177; 5&#160;&#181;m), and allow for large spans (&#8776;13&#8208;fold filament diameter) and high aspect ratios (&#8776;1), setting a new benchmark in the DIW of soft silicone. Printed silicone structures exhibit excellent performance as flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape&#8208;memory bionic devices, illustrating the potential of the new 3D printing strategy.

         <title>Supported Lipid Bilayers Coupled to Organic Neuromorphic Devices Modulate Short&#8208;Term Plasticity in Biomimetic Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomembrane&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is fabricated and the short&#8208;term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such devices pave the way to synapse&#8208;resembling platforms to investigate neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.








Abstract
Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental process for neuronal communication and is involved in neurodegeneration. This process has been recently exploited to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation bioelectronic platforms. Neuromorphic devices have emerged as ideal candidates in mimicking brain functionalities, thanks to their ionic&#8208;to&#8208;electronic signal transduction, biocompatibility, and their ability to display short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory as biological synapses. However, these devices still fail in bridging the gap between electronics and biological systems due to the lack of biomimetic features. Here, a biomembrane&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is implemented and the supported&#8208;lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;mediated short&#8208;term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such biomimetic neuromorphic devices pave the way toward the implementation of synapses&#8208;resembling in vitro platforms to investigate and characterize neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Reconfiguration&#8208;Induced NiS/NiFe2O4 Composite for Performance&#8208;Enhanced Zinc&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase&#8208;reconfiguration process is fulfilled by a facile vacancy fabrication and a rapid aggregation of NiS on NiFe2O4. At the dense interface of the substrate and the in situ reconfigurable phase, the activated Ni atom shared by two phases in the interface can adsorb OH more easily and therefore affords a Zn&#8722;air battery (ZAB) with outstanding performance.








Abstract
Constructing composite structures is an essential approach for obtaining multiple functionalities in a single entity. Available synthesis methods of the composites need to be urgently exploited; especially in situ construction. Here, a NiS/NiFe2O4 composite through a local metal&#8722;S coordination at the interface is reported, which is derived from phase reconstruction in the highly defective matrix. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure confirms that long&#8208;range order is broken via the local metal&#8722;S coordination and, by using electron energy loss spectroscopy, the introduction of NiS/NiFe2O4 interfaces during the irradiation of plasma energy is identified. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that in situ phase reconfiguration is crucial for synergistically reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics toward catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result; it leads to an overpotential of 230&#160;mV @10 mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81 V&#160;for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); as well as an excellent zinc&#8722;air battery (ZAB) performance with a power density of 148.5 mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new compositing strategy in terms of fast phase reconstruction of bifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Uniform 1&#8208;nm&#8208;Level Amorphous Carbon Layers from 3D Conformal Polymer Brushes. A &#8220;Next&#8208;Generation&#8221; Cu Diffusion Barrier?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uniform 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level of amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer as a diffusion barrier for Cu interconnects is obtained by the &#8220;self&#8208;limited&#8221; grafting of a polystyrene brush on oxide dielectric followed by UV crosslinking then carbonization. This approach for generating large area, ultra&#8208;uniform, and ultrathin polymer coatings shows promise for many new research directions and for a broad array of applications.








Abstract
A reliable method for preparing a conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer with a thickness of 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level, is tested as a possible Cu diffusion barrier layer for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density semiconductor device miniaturization. A polystyrene brush of uniform thickness is grafted onto 4&#8208;inch SiO2/Si wafer substrates with &#8220;self&#8208;limiting&#8221; chemistry favoring such a uniform layer. UV crosslinking and subsequent carbonization transforms this polymer film into an ultrathin a&#8208;C layer without pinholes or hillocks. The uniform coating of nonplanar regions or surfaces is also possible. The Cu diffusion &#8220;blocking ability&#8221; is evaluated by time&#8208;dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests using a metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure. A 0.82&#160;nm&#8208;thick a&#8208;C barrier gives TDDB lifetimes 3.3&#215; longer than that obtained using the conventional 1.0&#160;nm&#8208;thick TaNx diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a&#8208;C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom&#8208;scale thickness, and, when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a-C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom-scale thickness, and, when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peritoneum&#8208;Inspired Janus Porous Hydrogel with Anti&#8208;Deformation, Anti&#8208;Adhesion, and Pro&#8208;Healing Characteristics for Abdominal Wall Defect Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peritoneum&#8208;inspired Janus porous poly(vinyl alchohol) (PVA) hydrogel patch with unique asymmetric cell&#8208;adhesion behaviors and excellent anti&#8208;swelling characteristics demonstrates anti&#8208;adhesion, pro&#8208;healing, and anti&#8208;deformation properties simultaneously, leading to superior repair effect of abdominal wall defects.








Abstract
Implantable meshes used in tension&#8208;free repair operations facilitate treatment of internal soft&#8208;tissue defects. However, clinical meshes fail to achieve anti&#8208;deformation, anti&#8208;adhesion, and pro&#8208;healing properties simultaneously, leading to undesirable surgery outcomes. Herein, inspired by the peritoneum, a novel biocompatible Janus porous poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel (JPVA hydrogel) is developed to achieve efficient repair of internal soft&#8208;tissue defects by a facile yet efficient strategy based on top&#8208;down solvent exchange. The densely porous and smooth bottom&#8208;surface of JPVA hydrogel minimizes adhesion of fibroblasts and does not trigger any visceral adhesion, and its loose extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like porous and rough top&#8208;surface can significantly improve fibroblast adhesion and tissue growth, leading to superior abdominal wall defect treatment to commercially available PP and PCO meshes. With unique anti&#8208;swelling property (maximum swelling ratio: 6.4%), JPVA hydrogel has long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;deformation performance and maintains high mechanical strength after immersion in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) for 14 days, enabling tolerance to the maximum abdominal pressure in an internal wet environment. By integrating visceral anti&#8208;adhesion and defect pro&#8208;healing with anti&#8208;deformation, the JPVA hydrogel patch shows great prospects for efficient internal soft&#8208;tissue defect repair.

         <title>A Bioinspired Five&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozyme for Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A melamine&#8208;mediated pyrolysis activation strategy is reported for the fabrication of a single&#8208;atom iron nanozyme containing a five&#8208;coordinated structure (FeN5). The catalytic efficiency of FeN5 with optimized coordination structure is significantly higher than traditional four&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom iron nanozyme (FeN4) and Fe3O4 nanozyme. As a proof of concept, FeN5 SAzyme achieves effective killing of tumor cells, and significantly prolongs the survival of mice in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) represent a new research frontier in the biomedical fields. The rational design and controllable synthesis of SAzymes with well&#8208;defined electronic and geometric structures are essential for maximizing their enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity and therapeutic efficacy but remain challenging. Here, a melamine&#8208;mediated pyrolysis activation strategy is reported for the controllable fabrication of iron&#8208;based SAzyme containing five&#8208;coordinated structure (FeN5), identified by transmission electron microscopy imaging and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses. The FeN5 SAzyme exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity owing to the optimized coordination structure, and the corresponding catalytic efficiency of Fe&#8208;species in the FeN5 SAzyme is 7.64 and 3.45 &#215; 105 times higher than those in traditional FeN4 SAzyme and Fe3O4 nanozyme, respectively, demonstrated by steady&#8208;state kinetic assay. In addition, the catalytic mechanism is jointly disclosed by experimental results and density functional theory studies. The as&#8208;synthesized FeN5 SAzyme demonstrates significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo due to the excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity under tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Stepwise Energy Transfer: Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence from Doped Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process with an intermediate dye is presented, which provides a universal strategy for tuning the luminescence peak by a large margin. Therefore, bright NIR luminescence with a lifetime up to 0.2 s at 810 nm is achieved based on a new triphenylene&#8208;dye&#8208;doped polymer (TP@PVA) with a blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s.








Abstract
Organic near infrared (NIR) persistent&#8208;luminescence systems with bright and long&#8208;lived emission are highly valuable for applications in communication, imaging, and sensors. However, realizing these materials (especially lifetime over 0.1 s) is a challenge, mainly because of non&#8208;radiative quenching of their long&#8208;lived excitons. Herein, a universal strategy of stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for a bright NIR system with remarkable persistent luminescence (up to 0.2 s at 810&#160;nm) is presented, based on a new triphenylene&#8208;dye&#8208;doped polymer (triphenylene&#8208;2&#8208;ylboronic acid@poly(vinyl alcohol) (TP@PVA)) with a persistent blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s. This persistent NIR luminescence is demonstrated for application not only in NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting but also NIR bioimaging with penetrating a piece of skin as thick as 2.0&#160;mm. By co&#8208;doping a red dye (such as Nile red) and an NIR dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) into this doped PVA film, the shortage of spectral overlap between TP emission and Cy7 absorbance is successfully solved, through a stepwise FRET process involving triplet to singlet (TS)&#8208;FRET from TP to the intermediate red dye and then singlet to singlet (SS)&#8208;FRET to Cy7. It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS&#8208;FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS&#8208;FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.

         <title>Bioinspired Electron Polarization of Nanozymes with a Human Self&#8208;Generated Electric Field for Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A human self&#8208;generated electric&#8208;field&#8208;promoted system for improving cancer catalytic therapy is designed. The human self&#8208;generated electric field increases the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the covalent organic framework nanozyme by about fourfold to produce hydroxyl radicals for efficient cancer therapy.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production efficiencies of the nanocatalysts are highly desired for cancer therapy, but currently the ROS generation efficiency is still far from defecting the tumors. Therefore, improving their ROS generation ability is highly desirable for cancer therapy. Herein, inspired by the electrostatic preorganization effect during the catalysis of natural protein enzymes, a human self&#8208;driven catalysis&#8208;promoting system, TENG&#8208;CatSystem is developed, to improve catalytic cancer therapy. The TENG&#8208;CatSystem is mainly composed of three elements: a human self&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as the electric field stimulator to provide electric pulses with high biosafety, a nanozyme comprising a 1D ferriporphyrin covalent organic framework coated on a carbon nanotube (COF&#8208;CNT) to generate ROS, and a COF&#8208;CNT&#8208;embedded conductive hydrogel that can be injected into the tumor tissues to increase local accumulation of COF&#8208;CNT and decrease the electrical impedances of tissues. Under the human self&#8208;generated electric field provided by the wearable TENG, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the COF&#8208;CNT is fourfold higher than that without an electric field. Highly malignant 4T1 breast carcinoma in mice is significantly suppressed using the TENG&#8208;CatSystem. The human self&#8208;driven TENG&#8208;CatSystem not only demonstrates high catalytic ROS generation efficiency for improved cancer therapy, but also offers a new therapeutic mode for self&#8208;driven at&#8208;home therapy.

         <title>Thermalization of Fluorescent Protein Exciton&#8211;Polaritons at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong exciton&#8211;photon coupling is demonstrated using a red fluorescent protein &#8220;mScarlet&#8221; integrated with a microcavity. The strongly coupled exciton&#8211;polariton system demonstrates nonlinear response along with thermalization and cooling at room temperature. The effective temperature, Teff&#160;&#8776; 350 K close to the lattice temperature indicates strongly thermalized exciton&#8211;polaritons.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have recently emerged as a serious contender for realizing ultralow threshold room temperature exciton&#8211;polariton condensation and lasing. This contribution investigates the thermalization of FP microcavity exciton&#8211;polaritons upon optical pumping under ambient conditions. Polariton cooling is realized using a new FP molecule, called mScarlet, coupled strongly to the optical modes in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. Interestingly, at the threshold excitation energy (fluence) of &#8776;9 nJ per pulse (15.6 mJ cm&#8722;2), an effective temperature is observed, Teff&#160;&#8776; 350 &#177; 35 K close to the lattice temperature indicative of strongly thermalized exciton&#8211;polaritons at equilibrium. This efficient thermalization results from the interplay of radiative pumping facilitated by the energetics of the lower polariton branch and the cavity Q&#8208;factor. Direct evidence for dramatic switching from an equilibrium state into a metastable state is observed for the organic cavity polariton device at room temperature via deviation from the Maxwell&#8211;Boltzmann statistics at k&#8214;&#160;= 0 above the threshold. Thermalized polariton gases in organic systems at equilibrium hold substantial promise for designing room temperature polaritonic circuits, switches, and lattices for analog simulation.

         <title>Ultrafast Sub&#8208;100 fs All&#8208;Optical Modulation and Efficient Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Weyl Semimetal Niobium Phosphide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weyl semimetals are topological materials with promising electronic and optical properties. This work thoroughly characterizes the nonlinear optical properties of the Weyl semimetal niobium phosphide by using third&#8208;harmonic generation and nondegenerate pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy. A measured third&#8208;harmonic generation efficiency of 10&#8722;4% and an ultrafast change in reflectivity of close to 1% paves the way for the coming Weyl&#8208;semimetal&#8208;based nanophotonics.








Abstract
Since their experimental discovery in 2015, Weyl semimetals have generated a large amount of attention due their intriguing physical properties that arise from their linear electron dispersion relation and topological surface states. In particular, in the field of nonlinear (NL) optics and light harvesting, Weyl semimetals have shown outstanding performances and achieved record NL conversion coefficients. In this context, the first steps toward Weyl semimetal nanophotonics are performed here by thoroughly characterizing the linear and NL optical behavior of epitaxially grown niobium phosphide (NbP) thin films, covering the visible to the near&#8208;infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite the measured high linear absorption, third&#8208;harmonic generation studies demonstrate high conversion efficiencies up to 10&#8722;4% that can be attributed to the topological electron states at the surface of the material. Furthermore, nondegenerate pump&#8211;probe measurements with sub&#8208;10 fs pulses reveal a maximum modulation depth of &#8776;1%, completely decaying within 100 fs and therefore suggesting the possibility of developing all&#8208;optical switching devices based on NbP. Altogether, this work reveals the promising NL optical properties of Weyl semimetal thin films, which outperform bulk crystals of the same material, laying the grounds for nanoscale applications, enabled by top&#8208;down nanostructuring, such as light&#8208;harvesting, on&#8208;chip frequency conversion, and all&#8208;optical processing.

         <title>A Quadri&#8208;Dimensional Manipulable Laser with an Intrinsic Chiral Photoswitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser emission with optically dynamic controllable wavelength, wavefront, spin, and orbital angular momentum is achieved, enabled by an intrinsic chiral photoswitch with excellent thermal stability and fatigue&#8208;resistance, thereby exploiting a new way toward information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.








Abstract
Dynamic and multi&#8208;dimensional manipulation of laser emission with light allows for optical coding, computing, and imaging photonic chips. However, the coupling balance between photonic resonance and transmission is a formidable challenge due to the uncontrollable chiral microcavity with photo&#8208;reversibility, which is limited to the multi&#8208;freedom of the laser with sustainable and repeatable output beams. Herein, a helical superstructure system with a unique intrinsic chiral photoswitch is developed for resolving the always pendent problems on organized defects in the microcavity. The unique intrinsic chirality based on the photoswitchable system allows laser emission with a sharp and narrow band&#8208;width, with both remarkable thermodynamic stability and robust fatigue&#8208;resistance. A quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser, featuring wavelength&#8208;tunability, wavefront&#8208;shaping, spin angular momentum (SAM), and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is successfully established with the assistance of the photoresponsive intrinsic chiral superstructure with photoreversibility. This technology marks an important milestone, and sketches a future framework for the realms of nanophotonic information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.

         <title>Nanoengineered Neutrophils as a Cellular Sonosensitizer for Visual Sonodynamic Therapy of Malignant Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineered neutrophil sonosensitizers are developed for visual sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of solid malignant tumors. Acouscyte/O2 not only has an enhanced multilevel active targeting but also provides oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, maintain the appearance, and real&#8208;time multimode imaging, which provides a promising theranostic strategy for solid malignant tumors.








Abstract
The rapid evolution of cell&#8208;based theranostics has attracted extensive attention due to their unique advantages in biomedical applications. However, the inherent functions of cells alone cannot meet the needs of malignant tumor treatment. Thus endowing original cells with new characteristics to generate multifunctional living cells may hold a tremendous promise. Here, the nanoengineering method is used to combine customized liposomes with neutrophils, generating oxygen&#8208;carrying sonosensitizer cells with acoustic functions, which are called Acouscyte/O2, for the visual diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Specifically, oxygen&#8208;carried perfluorocarbon and temoporfin are encapsulated into cRGD peptide modified multilayer liposomes (C&#8208;ML/HPT/O2), which are then loaded into live neutrophils to obtain Acouscyte/O2. Acouscyte/O2 can not only carry a large amount of oxygen but also exhibits the ability of long circulation, inflammation&#8208;triggered recruitment, and decomposition. Importantly, Acouscyte/O2 can be selectively accumulated in tumors, effectively enhancing tumor oxygen levels, and triggering anticancer sonodynamics in response to ultrasound stimulation, leading to complete obliteration of tumors and efficient extension of the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with minimal systemic adverse effects. Meanwhile, the tumors can be monitored in real time by temoporfin&#8208;mediated fluorescence imaging and perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;microbubble&#8208;enhanced ultrasound imaging. Therefore, the nanoengineered neutrophils, i.e., Acouscyte/O2, are a new type of multifunctional cellular drug, which provides a new platform for the diagnosis and sonodynamic therapy of solid malignant tumors.

         <title>Electrostatically Driven Polarization Flop and Strain&#8208;Induced Curvature in Free&#8208;Standing Ferroelectric Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic and elastic interactions between the constituent layers in free&#8208;standing ferroelectric superlattices can lead to new polarization arrangements and macroscopic curvature of the sample. In this work, the complex domain structure of ferroelectric microtubes and its response to mechanical deformation is studied using a variety of techniques, paving the way for a combined strain and electrostatic approach to engineering highly responsive materials.








Abstract
The combination of strain and electrostatic engineering in epitaxial heterostructures of ferroelectric oxides offers many possibilities for inducing new phases, complex polar topologies, and enhanced electrical properties. However, the dominant effect of substrate clamping can also limit the electromechanical response and often leaves electrostatics to play a secondary role. Releasing the mechanical constraint imposed by the substrate can not only dramatically alter the balance between elastic and electrostatic forces, enabling them to compete on par with each other, but also activates new mechanical degrees of freedom, such as the macroscopic curvature of the heterostructure. In this work, an electrostatically driven transition from a predominantly out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized to an in&#8208;plane polarized state is observed when a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice with a SrRuO3 bottom electrode is released from its substrate. In turn, this polarization rotation modifies the lattice parameter mismatch between the superlattice and the thin SrRuO3 layer, causing the heterostructure to curl up into microtubes. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based scanning X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, Raman scattering, piezoresponse force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the crystalline structure and domain patterns of the curved superlattices are investigated, revealing a strong anisotropy in the domain structure and a complex mechanism for strain accommodation.

         <title>Folding and Fracture of Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene Grown on a Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented and long graphene folds are spontaneously formed in chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal graphene film on a Cu(111) foil surface, and this is triggered by the formation of highly ordered bunched Cu steps under the graphene. Such folds are fractured into &#8220;back&#8208;and&#8208;forth&#8221; subfold patterns at bunched Cu step edge regions, with cracks propagating along zigzag or armchair directions.








Abstract
A single&#8208;crystal graphene film grown on a Cu(111) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has ribbon&#8208;like fold structures. These graphene folds are highly oriented and essentially parallel to each other. Cu surface steps underneath the graphene are along the &lt;110&gt;&#160;and &lt;211&gt;&#160;directions, leading to the formation of the arrays of folds. The folds in the single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into alternating patterns. A &#8220;joint&#8221; (an AB&#8208;stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few&#8208;layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal SLG film is simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.

         <title>Highly Conducting and Stretchable Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel for Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue&#8208;like soft bioelectronics requires electrodes with muscle&#8208;like mechanical properties together with high electrical conductivity. However, existing hydrogels cannot well balance the two sides. In this work, an in situ aggregation and densification method is used to make hydrogels with both high electrical conductivity and high stretchability, and the hydrogel is verified to be effective for subcutaneous electromyographic signal recording and nerve stimulation.








Abstract
Conducting polymer hydrogels are promising materials in soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties and the capability of electrical interaction with tissues. However, it is challenging to balance electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability: pure conducting polymer hydrogels are highly conductive, but they are brittle; while incorporating the conducting network with a soft network to form a double network can improve the stretchability, its electrical conductivity significantly decreases. Here, the problem is addressed by concentrating a poorly crosslinked precursor hydrogel with a high content ratio of the conducting polymer to achieve a densified double&#8208;network hydrogel (5.5&#160;wt% conducting polymer), exhibiting both high electrical conductivity (&#8776;10 S cm&#8211;1) and a large fracture strain (&#8776;150%), in addition to high biocompatibility, tissue&#8208;like softness, low swelling ratio, and desired electrochemical properties for bioelectronics. A surface grafting method is further used to form an adhesive layer on the conducting hydrogel, enabling robust and rapid bonding on the tissues. Furthermore, the proposed hydrogel is applied to show high&#8208;quality physiological signal recording and reliable, low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation based on an in vivo rat model. This method provides an ideal strategy for rapid and reliable tissue&#8208;device integration with high&#8208;quality electrical communications.

         <title>Magnetic Soft Millirobots 3D Printed by Circulating Vat Photopolymerization to Manipulate Droplets Containing Hazardous Agents for In Vitro Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulating vat photopolymerization (CVP) platform is developed to print magnetic soft millirobots (MSMRs) with high magnetic loading and high uniformity. CVP is able to 3D print MSMRs with true initial 3D geometry and the capability of reversible 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transformation for locomotion and object manipulation. The CVP&#8208;printed MSMRs are used for automated in vitro diagnostics of carbapenemase&#8208;producing Enterobacteriaceae.








Abstract
3D printing via vat photopolymerization (VP) is a highly promising approach for fabricating magnetic soft millirobots (MSMRs) with accurate miniature 3D structures; however, magnetic filler materials added to resin either strongly interfere with the photon energy source or sediment too fast, resulting in the nonuniformity of the filler distribution or failed prints, which limits the application of VP. To this end, a circulating vat photopolymerization (CVP) platform that can print MSMRs with high uniformity, high particle loading, and strong magnetic response is presented. After extensive characterization of materials and 3D printed parts, it is found that SrFe12O19 is an ideal magnetic filler for CVP and can be printed with 30% particle loading and high uniformity. By using CVP, various tethered and untethered MSMRs are 3D printed monolithically and demonstrate the capability of reversible 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transformation and liquid droplet manipulation in 3D, an important task for in vitro diagnostics that are not shown with conventional MSMRs. A fully automated liquid droplet handling platform that manipulates droplets with MSMR is presented for detecting carbapenem antibiotic resistance in hazardous biosamples as a proof of concept, and the results agree with the benchmark.

         <title>Constructing Structurally Ordered High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles on Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Mesoporous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally ordered high&#8208;entropy alloy (OHEA) nanoparticles (NPs) are constructed on a 2D nitrogen&#8208;rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA&#8208;mNC) through ligand&#8208;assisted interfacial assembly with NH3 annealing. The atom&#8208;resolved chemical identification confirms the ordered structure of HEA NPs with an L12 phase. The OHEA&#8208;mNC catalyst affords a greatly enhanced oxygen reduction performance compared with disordered HEA and Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
Recent efforts have observed nanoscaled chemical short&#8208;range order in bulk high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Simultaneously inspired with the nanostructuring technology, HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with complete chemical order may be achieved. Herein, structurally ordered HEA (OHEA) NPs are constructed on a novel 2D nitrogen&#8208;rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA&#8208;mNC) by combining a ligand&#8208;assisted interfacial assembly with NH3 annealing. Characterization results show that the resultant materials possess an ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure with large mesopores (&#8776;10&#160;nm), where structurally ordered HEA NPs with an L12 phase are homogeneously dispersed. The atom&#8208;resolved chemical analyses explicitly determine the location of each atomic site. When being evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction, the OHEA&#8208;mNC NPs afford a greatly enhanced catalytic performance, including a large half&#8208;wave potential (0.90&#160;eV) and a high durability (0.01&#160;V decay after 10 000 cycles) compared with the disordered HEA and commercial Pt/C catalysts.

     alt="Constructing Structurally Ordered High-Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles on Nitrogen-Rich Mesoporous Carbon Nanosheets for High-Performance Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structurally ordered high-entropy alloy (OHEA) nanoparticles (NPs) are constructed on a 2D nitrogen-rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA-mNC) through ligand-assisted interfacial assembly with NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; annealing. The atom-resolved chemical identification confirms the ordered structure of HEA NPs with an L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase. The OHEA-mNC catalyst affords a greatly enhanced oxygen reduction performance compared with disordered HEA and Pt/C catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent efforts have observed nanoscaled chemical short-range order in bulk high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Simultaneously inspired with the nanostructuring technology, HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with complete chemical order may be achieved. Herein, structurally ordered HEA (OHEA) NPs are constructed on a novel 2D nitrogen-rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA-mNC) by combining a ligand-assisted interfacial assembly with NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; annealing. Characterization results show that the resultant materials possess an ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure with large mesopores (&#8776;10&#160;nm), where structurally ordered HEA NPs with an L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase are homogeneously dispersed. The atom-resolved chemical analyses explicitly determine the location of each atomic site. When being evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction, the OHEA-mNC NPs afford a greatly enhanced catalytic performance, including a large half-wave potential (0.90&#160;eV) and a high durability (0.01&#160;V decay after 10 000 cycles) compared with the disordered HEA and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The excellent performance is attributed to the enhanced mass transfer rate, improved electron conductivity, and the presence of the stable chemically ordered HEA phase, as revealed by both the experimental results and theoretical calculation. This study suggests a highly feasible process to achieve structurally ordered HEA NPs with advanced mesoporous function in the electrochemical field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable and Solution&#8208;Processable Cumulenic sp&#8208;Carbon Wires: A New Paradigm for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cumulenic sp&#8208;carbon wires are employed in large&#8208;area electronics. Transistors based on solution&#8208;processed polycrystalline thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene show ideal p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect behavior, a reliable hole mobility exceeding 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and promising stability in dark conditions, paving the way to a vast library of sp&#8208;hybridized molecular semiconductors.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed, large&#8208;area, and flexible electronics largely relies on the excellent electronic properties of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon molecules, either in the form of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and polymers or graphene and carbon nanotubes. Carbon with sp&#8208;hybridization, the foundation of the elusive allotrope carbyne, offers vast opportunities for functionalized molecules in the form of linear carbon atomic wires (CAWs), with intriguing and even superior predicted electronic properties. While CAWs represent a vibrant field of research, to date, they have only been applied sparingly to molecular devices. The recent observation of the field&#8208;effect in microcrystalline cumulenes suggests their potential applications in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors but concerns surrounding the stability and electronic performance have precluded developments in this direction. In the present study, ideal field&#8208;effect characteristics are demonstrated for solution&#8208;processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene, the shortest semiconducting CAW. Films are deposited through a scalable, large&#8208;area, meniscus&#8208;coating technique, providing transistors with hole mobilities in excess of 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, as well as promising operational stability under dark conditions. These results offer a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast class of molecular semiconductors for organic electronics based on sp&#8208;hybridized carbon systems and create a previously unexplored paradigm.

         <title>Microfluidic Oxidation of Graphite in Two Minutes with Capability of Real&#8208;Time Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow preparation of graphite oxide and the following post&#8208;treatment are achieved in microchannels, allowing the completion of the oxidization in &#8776;2 min and the capability of on&#8208;line monitoring of the oxidation process with Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Graphite oxide and its exfoliated counterpart, graphene oxide, are important precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of graphene&#8208;based materials and many relevant applications. The current batch&#8208;style preparation of graphite oxide suffers from safety concern, long reaction time, and nonuniform product quality, due to the large volume of reactors and slow energy exchange. Reaction in microchannels can largely enhance the oxidization efficiency of graphite due to the enhanced mass transfer and extremely quick energy exchange, by which the controllable oxidization of graphite is achieved in &#8776;2 min. Comprehensive characterizations show that the graphene oxide obtained through the microfluidic strategy has features like those prepared in laboratory beakers and industrial reactors, yet with the higher oxidization degree and more epoxy groups. More importantly, the microfluidic preparation allows for on&#8208;line monitoring of the oxidization by Raman spectroscopy, ready for the dynamical control of reaction condition and product quality. The capability of continuous preparation is also demonstrated by showing the assembly of fibers and reduction of graphene oxide in microfluidic channels, and the applicability of graphene oxide prepared from the microfluidic strategy for thermally and electrically conductive films.

         <title>A Flexible Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Microbattery with Unprecedented Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine microbattery with &gt;1500&#160;mWh cm&#8722;3 volumetric energy density and &gt;2000 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 areal energy density is developed by a simple and effective strategy where an iodine cathode is generated in situ during charging. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power&#8208;source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.








Abstract
Currently, reported aqueous microbatteries (MBs) only show unsatisfactory electrochemical performance (&#8804;120 mWh cm&#8722;3 volumetric energy density and &lt;1000&#160;&#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 areal energy density) and it remains challenging to develop durable aqueous MBs that can simultaneously offer both high volumetric and areal energy density. Herein, an in situ electrodeposition strategy is adopted to construct a flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine MB (ZIDMB). Notably, the fabrication process well avoids the use of common additives (such as binders, conductive agents, and toxic solvent) and also bypasses subsequent time&#8208;consuming procedures such as grinding, coating, drying, etc., thus greatly simplifying the manufacture of the ZIDMB. Meanwhile, owing to the suppression of the shuttle effect of triiodide ions and the high ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte, the ZIDMB can simultaneously deliver record&#8208;high volumetric and areal energy densities of 1647.3 mWh cm&#8722;3 and 2339.1 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2, thus achieving values at least 13.5&#8208; and 2.3&#8208;fold better than those of best available aqueous MBs, respectively. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power&#8208;source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.

         <title>Jammed Micro&#8208;Flake Hydrogel for Four&#8208;Dimensional Living Cell Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;component jammed micro&#8208;flake hydrogels (MFHs)&#160;are developed as cell&#8208;laden bioinks for 4D bioprinting. Cytocompatible&#160;MFH&#160;bioinks without the need of additional fillers are rheologically favorable for bioprinting via smooth direct ink writing. A controllable cross&#8208;linking gradient in the 3D printed bioconstructs is achieved, enabling predefined shape transformations. 4D tissue engineering is demonstrated in a 4D cartilage&#8208;like tissue regeneration study.








Abstract
4D bioprinting is promising to build cell&#8208;laden constructs (bioconstructs) with complex geometries and functions for tissue/organ regeneration applications. The development of hydrogel&#8208;based 4D bioinks, especially those allowing living cell printing, with easy preparation, defined composition, and controlled physical properties is critically important for 4D bioprinting. Here, a single&#8208;component jammed micro&#8208;flake hydrogel (MFH) system with heterogeneous size distribution, which differs from the conventional granular microgel, has been developed as a new cell&#8208;laden bioink for 4D&#160;bioprinting. This jammed cytocompatible MFH features scalable production and straightforward composition with shear&#8208;thinning, shear&#8208;yielding, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. As such, it can be smoothly printed into stable 3D&#160;bioconstructs, which can be further cross&#8208;linked to form a gradient in cross&#8208;linking density when a photoinitiator and a UV absorber are incorporated. After being subject to shape morphing, a variety of complex bioconstructs with well&#8208;defined configurations and high cell viability are obtained. Based on this system, 4D&#160;cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation is demonstrated as a&#160;proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The establishment of this versatile new 4D bioink system may open up a&#160;number of applications in tissue engineering.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4D bioprinting is promising to build cell-laden constructs (bioconstructs) with complex geometries and functions for tissue/organ regeneration applications. The development of hydrogel-based 4D bioinks, especially those allowing living cell printing, with easy preparation, defined composition, and controlled physical properties is critically important for 4D bioprinting. Here, a single-component jammed micro-flake hydrogel (MFH) system with heterogeneous size distribution, which differs from the conventional granular microgel, has been developed as a new cell-laden bioink for 4D&#160;bioprinting. This jammed cytocompatible MFH features scalable production and straightforward composition with shear-thinning, shear-yielding, and rapid self-healing properties. As such, it can be smoothly printed into stable 3D&#160;bioconstructs, which can be further cross-linked to form a gradient in cross-linking density when a photoinitiator and a UV absorber are incorporated. After being subject to shape morphing, a variety of complex bioconstructs with well-defined configurations and high cell viability are obtained. Based on this system, 4D&#160;cartilage-like tissue formation is demonstrated as a&#160;proof-of-concept. The establishment of this versatile new 4D bioink system may open up a&#160;number of applications in tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Open&#8208;Shell Nanosensitizers for Glutathione Responsive Cancer Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;based nanosensitizer (Cu(II)NS) is synthesized for sonodynamic therapy. Cu(II)NS has an unpaired electron (open shell) with a doublet ground state and little sonosensitivity. Overexpressed glutathione in tumors can reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), leading to a singlet ground state and recuperative sonosensitivity. Through regulating the valence states of Cu, tumor therapy with enhanced therapeutic index is achieved.








Abstract
Deleterious effects to normal tissues and short biological half&#8208;life of sonosensitizers limit the applications of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, a new sonosensitizer (Cu(II)NS) is synthesized that consists of porphyrins, chelated Cu2+, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to overcome the challenges of SDT. As Cu2+ contains 27&#160;electrons, Cu(II)NS has an unpaired electron (open shell), resulting in a doublet ground state and little sonosensitivity. Overexpressed glutathione in the tumor can reduce Cu2+ to generate Cu(I)NS, leading to a singlet ground state and recuperative sonosensitivity. Additionally, PEG endows Cu(II)NS with increased blood biological half&#8208;life and enhanced tumor accumulation, further increasing the effect of SDT. Through regulating the valence state of Cu, cancer SDT with enhanced therapeutic index is achieved.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metaphosphate&#8208;Like Terminals Enable High&#8208;Capacity MXene Anodes for Ultrafast Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>

Redox&#8208;active metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals for Nb4C3 MXene, which double the specific capacity of Nb4C3 MXene for ultrafast Na+ storage, are constructed. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities to alleviate the energy&#8722;power trade&#8208;off often faced by energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, so&#8208;called MXenes, are noted as ideal fast&#8208;charging cation&#8208;intercalation electrode materials, which nevertheless suffer from limited specific capacities. Herein, it is reported that constructing redox&#8208;active phosphorus&#8722;oxygen terminals can be an attractive strategy for Nb4C3 MXenes to remarkably boost their specific capacities for ultrafast Na+ storage. As revealed, redox&#8208;active terminals with a stoichiometric formula of PO2&#8208; display a metaphosphate&#8208;like configuration with each P atom sustaining three P&#63743;O bonds and one P&#63742;O dangling bond. Compared with conventional O&#8208;terminals, metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals empower Nb4C3 (denoted PO2&#8208;Nb4C3) with considerably enriched carrier density (fourfold), improved conductivity (12.3&#8208;fold at 300 K), additional redox&#8208;active sites, boosted Nb redox depth, nondeclined Na+&#8208;diffusion capability, and buffered internal stress during Na+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Consequently, compared with O&#8208;terminated Nb4C3, PO2&#8208;Nb4C3 exhibits a doubled Na+&#8208;storage capacity (221.0 mAh g&#8208;1), well&#8208;retained fast&#8208;charging capability (4.9&#160;min at 80% capacity retention), significantly promoted cycle life (nondegraded capacity over 2000 cycles), and justified feasibility for assembling energy&#8722;power&#8208;balanced Na&#8208;ion capacitors. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities for developing simultaneously high&#8208;capacity and fast&#8208;charging electrodes, alleviating the energy&#8722;power tradeoff typical for energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Engineering Macrophage Exosome Disguised Biodegradable Nanoplatform for Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biodegradable glioblastoma&#8208;tumor&#8208;targeted delivery system CSI@Ex&#8208;A is successfully fabricated for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. The AS1411 engineered macrophage exosome endows CSI@Ex&#8208;A with efficient BBB penetration and good cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting capability. The GSH depletion and O2&#8208;self&#8208;supplying enhanced sonodynamic therapy is achieved.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) exhibits high tissue penetration and negligible radiation damage to normal tissues, and thus emerges as a promising cancer therapeutic modality for glioblastoma (GBM). However, the blood&#8722;brain barrier (BBB) and hypoxic microenvironment greatly limit the SDT efficiency. In this work, a biodegradable nanoplatform (termed as CSI) is fabricated by encapsulating catalase (CAT) into silica nanoparticles (CAT@SiO2) for tumor hypoxia relief, and then loaded with the sonosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG). Inspired by the ability of macrophages to cross the BBB, CSI is further coated with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified macrophage exosomes to form CSI@Ex&#8208;A, which possesses efficient BBB penetration and good cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting capability. After tumor cell endocytosis, highly expressed glutathione (GSH) triggeres biodegradation of the nanoplatform and the released CAT catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. The GSH depletion and O2 self&#8208;supplying effectively enhances the SDT efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the resulting CSI@Ex&#8208;A exhibits good biocompatibility and long circulation time. These findings demonstrate that CSI@Ex&#8208;A may serve as a competent nanoplatform for GBM therapy, with potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Observation of Near&#8208;Intrinsic Exciton Linewidth in Monolayer WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic exciton linewidth in monolayer WS2 is achieved at room temperature by coupling it with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. The dielectric nanosphere is designed to boost the dynamic competition between WS2 exciton and trion decay channels and rebuild the excitonic relaxation processes with suppressed exciton nonradiative recombination. A tunable exciton linewidth is also demonstrated.








Abstract
The homogeneous exciton linewidth, which captures the coherent quantum dynamics of an excitonic state, is a vital parameter in exploring light&#8211;matter interactions in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). An efficient control of the exciton linewidth is of great significance, and in particular of its intrinsic linewidth, which determines the minimum timescale for the coherent manipulation of excitons. However, such a control is rarely achieved in TMDs at room temperature (RT). While the intrinsic A exciton linewidth is down to 7 meV in monolayer WS2, the reported RT linewidth is typically a few tens of meV due to inevitable homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening effects. Here, it is shown that a 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic linewidth can be observed at RT when monolayer WS2 is coupled with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. By boosting the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels in WS2 through the nanosphere&#8208;supported Mie resonances, the coherent linewidth can be tuned from 35 down to 7.18 meV. Such modulation of exciton linewidth and its associated mechanism are robust even in presence of defects, easing the sample quality requirement and providing new opportunities for TMD&#8208;based nanophotonics and optoelectronics.

Here, it is shown that a 7.18 meV near-intrinsic linewidth can be observed at RT when monolayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is coupled with a moderate-refractive-index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. By boosting the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels in WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the nanosphere-supported Mie resonances, the coherent linewidth can be tuned from 35 down to 7.18 meV. Such modulation of exciton linewidth and its associated mechanism are robust even in presence of defects, easing the sample quality requirement and providing new opportunities for TMD-based nanophotonics and optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An MXene&#8208;Based Metal Anode with Stepped Sodiophilic Gradient Structure Enables a Large Current Density for Rechargeable Na&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deposition&#8208;regulation strategy for Na scaffold is reported to induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of anode. The sodiophilic gradient structure of the new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based scaffold significantly improves the affordability for high current density and areal capacity during the charging/discharging process of a Na&#8722;O2 battery.








Abstract
The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium&#8208;metal batteries such as Na&#8211;O2 batteries. Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (&gt;10 mA cm&#8722;2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h&#8208;Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80&#8722;250&#160;&#181;m). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h&#8208;Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na&#8208;based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm&#8722;2) and a high cut&#8208;off capacity (40 mAh cm&#8722;2). Moreover, a Na&#8211;O2 battery with an h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137&#160;V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8722;1 and 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. This deposition&#8208;regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffolds for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Prussian Blue Nanozyme as a Pyroptosis Inhibitor Alleviates Neurodegeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent intrinsic reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging properties, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) reduces the production of mitochondrial ROS induced by 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), inhibits the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and downstream pyroptosis of microglia, and further rescues the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP&#8208;induced cell and mouse models of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current pharmacological interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unsatisfactory in clinical settings. Inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis represents a potential therapeutic target for the alleviation of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis agonists or antagonists may transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the identification of specific compounds that inhibit pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) is revealed as a pyroptosis inhibitor to alleviate the neurodegeneration in mouse and cell models of PD. PBzyme protects the microglia and neurons against 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). PBzyme alleviates motor deficits, attenuates the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential, and rescues dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of PBzyme reduces dopaminergic degeneration and inhibits neuroinflammation in an MPTP&#8208;induced PD mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that PBzyme reduces the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes and caspase&#8208;1 by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby downregulating gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage as well as inflammatory factor production, and eventually leading to the inhibition of microglia pyroptosis. Overall, this work highlights the neuroprotective effects of PBzyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor and provides valuable mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.

         <title>Unblocked Electron Channels Enable Efficient Contact Prelithiation for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of electron channels leads to a low Li source utilization for contact prelithiation, and the resultant &#8220;dead Li&#8221; greatly degrades battery performance. Creating more electron channels at the Li source/anode interface not only dissipates the local current density to stabilize the electron channels, but also promotes the reaction kinetics, thus supporting an improved Li utilization for contact prelithiation.








Abstract
Contact prelithiation is strongly considered for compensating the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, exhibiting great potential for ultralong cycle life of working batteries and the application of large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems. However, the utilization of the sacrificial Li source for contact prelithiation is low (&lt;65%). Herein the fundamental mechanism of contact prelithiation is described from the perspective of the Li source/anode interfaces by regulating the initial contact state, and a clear illustration of the pathogeny for capacity attenuation is successfully delivered. Specifically, creating plentiful electron channels is an access to making contact prelithiation with a higher Li utilization, as the mitigated local current density that reduces the etching of Li dissolution and SEI extension on electron channels. A vacuum thermal evaporation for depositing the Li film enables the contact interface to possess an adequate electron channel construction, rendering a Li utilization of 91.0%, and the dead Li yield is significantly reduced in a working battery.

         <title>Micrometer&#8208;Sized SiMgyOx with Stable Internal Structure Evolution for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ element doping approach developed in this research provides not only a promising material (SiMgyOx) as high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion battery anodes with superior properties and low industrialization cost for commercial applications, but also insights on the reasonable structural design of micrometer&#8208;sized alloying anode materials for restraining internal cracks and improving electrochemical performance.








Abstract
In recent years, micrometer&#8208;sized Si&#8208;based anode materials have attracted intensive attention in the pursuit of energy&#8208;storage systems with high energy and low cost. However, the significant volume variation during repeated electrochemical (de)alloying processes will seriously damage the bulk structure of SiOx microparticles, resulting in rapid performance fade. This work proposes to address the challenge by preparing in situ magnesium&#8208;doped SiOx (SiMgyOx) microparticles with stable structural evolution against Li uptake/release. The homogeneous distribution of magnesium silicate in SiMgyOx contributes to building a bonding network inside the particle so that it raises the modulus of lithiated state and restrains the internal cracks due to electrochemical agglomeration of nano&#8208;Si. The prepared micrometer&#8208;sized SiMgyOx anode shows high reversible capacities, stable cycling performance, and low electrode expansion at high areal mass loading. A 21700 cylindrical&#8208;type cell based on the SiMgyOx&#8208;graphite anode and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode demonstrates a 1000&#8208;cycle operation life using industry&#8208;recognized electrochemical test procedures, which meets the practical storage requirements for consumer electronics and electric vehicles. This work provides insights on the reasonable structural design of micrometer&#8208;sized alloying anode materials toward realization of high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Plasma&#8208;Assisted Doping Engineering to Stabilize Metallic Phase MoSe2 for Fast and Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting a novel plasma&#8208;assisted doping&#8208;triggered phase&#8208;transition engineering, stabilized P&#8208;doped metallic phase selenide molybdenum (MoSe2) nanoflower composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs) with expanded interlayer spacing, metallic electronic conductivity, facilitated Na+ adsorption, and reduced Na+ diffusion barrier are fabricated for high&#8208;performance sodium storage. The underlying mechanism analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
Metallic&#8208;phase selenide molybdenum (1T&#8208;MoSe2) has become a rising star for sodium storage in comparison with its semiconductor phase (2H&#8208;MoSe2) owing to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity and unimpeded Na+ diffusion structure. However, the thermodynamically unstable nature of 1T phase renders it an unprecedented challenge to realize its phase control and stabilization. Herein, a plasma&#8208;assisted P&#8208;doping&#8208;triggered phase&#8208;transition engineering is proposed to synthesize stabilized P&#8208;doped 1T phase MoSe2 nanoflower composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs). Mechanism analysis reveals significantly decreased phase&#8208;transition energy barriers of the plasma&#8208;induced Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich MoSe2 from 2H to 1T owing to its low crystallinity and reduced structure stability. The vacancy&#8208;rich structure promotes highly concentrated P doping, which manipulates the electronic structure of the MoSe2 and urges its phase transition, acquiring a high transition efficiency of 91% accompanied with ultrahigh phase stability. As a result, the P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs deliver an exceptional high reversible capacity of 510.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with no capacity fading over 1000 cycles at 5000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for sodium storage. The underlying mechanism of this phase&#8208;transition engineering verified by profound analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Reunderstanding the Reaction Mechanism of Aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn Batteries with Sulfate Electrolytes: Role of the Zinc Sulfate Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;new Zn4SO4&#183;(OH)6&#183;xH2O (ZSH)&#8208;assisted deposition and dissolution reaction model is proposed and validated for aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn batteries in mild sulfate electrolytes. It is shown that MnO2 is not a compulsory cathode; and various metal oxides, including ZSH, ZnO, MgO, and CaO, can be used as the cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn batteries have garnered extensive attention for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, the charge&#8208;storage chemistry of Zn&#8211;Mn batteries remains controversial. Prevailing mechanisms include conversion reaction and cation (de)intercalation in mild acid or neutral electrolytes, and a MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8722;deposition reaction in strong acidic electrolytes. Herein, a Zn4SO4&#183;(OH)6&#183;xH2O (ZSH)&#8208;assisted deposition&#8722;dissolution model is proposed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and capacity origin in Zn&#8211;Mn batteries based on mild acidic sulfate electrolytes. In this new model, the reversible capacity originates from a reversible conversion reaction between ZSH and ZnxMnO(OH)2 nanosheets in which the MnO2 initiates the formation of ZSH but contributes negligibly to the apparent capacity. The role of ZSH in this new model is confirmed by a series of operando characterizations and by constructing Zn batteries using other cathode materials (including ZSH, ZnO, MgO, and CaO). This research may refresh the understanding of the most promising Zn&#8211;Mn batteries and guide the design of high&#8208;capacity aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Reconfigurable Quasi&#8208;Nonvolatile Memory/Subthermionic FET Functions in Ferroelectric&#8211;2D Semiconductor vdW Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new principle for ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor (FeFET) functional reconfiguration by controlling the behaviors of interfacial oxygen vacancies in a prototype 2D van der Waals FeFET is proposed and proved. FeFET with large counterclockwise hysteresis and negative capacitance FET free of hysteresis are realized for memory (neural computing) and low&#8208;power computing, respectively. It paves a new path toward both in&#8208;memory computing and transistor&#8208;memory monolithic integration.








Abstract
The functional reconfiguration of transistors and memory in homogenous ferroelectric devices offers significant opportunities for implementing the concepts of in&#8208;memory computing and logic&#8208;memory monolithic integration. Thus far, reconfiguration is realized through programmable doping profiles in the semiconductor channel using multiple&#8208;gate operation. This complex device architecture limits further scaling to match the overall chip requirements. Here, reconfigurable memory/transistor functionalities in a ferroelectric&#8208;gated van der Waals transistor by controlling the behavior of ferroelectric oxygen vacancies at the interface are demonstrated. Short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory functions are demonstrated by modulating the border oxygen vacancy distribution and the associated charge dynamics. The quasi&#8208;nonvolatile long&#8208;term memory exhibits data retention of over 105 s and endurance of up to 5 &#215; 105 cycles, verifying its applicability as a potential device platform for neuromorphic networks. More importantly, by modulating the ferroelectricity of the interfacial domains with the interactions of oxygen vacancies, a hysteresis&#8208;free logic transistor is realized with a subthermionic subthreshold swing down to 46&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, which resembles a negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistor. The new concept of achieving functional reconfiguration with prior device performance in a single&#8208;gate ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is of great advantage in future integrated circuit applications.

         <title>Intelligent Gold Nanoparticles with Oncogenic MicroRNA&#8208;Dependent Activities to Manipulate Tumorigenic Environments for Synergistic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional spherical nucleic acids are developed to utilize and manipulate the tumorigenic genetic environment, and are able to perform tumor&#8208;specific chain activities including oncogenic miRNAs (miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155) inhibition, miR&#8208;21&#8208;dependent photothermal therapy, and miR&#8208;155&#8208;triggered chemotherapy for effective, accurate, and sustained tumor treatment.








Abstract
Tumorigenic environments, especially aberrantly overexpressed oncogenic microRNAs, play a critical role in various activities of tumor progression. However, developing strategies to effectively utilize and manipulate these oncogenic microRNAs for tumor therapy is still a challenge. To address this challenge, spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consisting of gold nanoparticles in the core and antisense oligonucleotides as the shell are fabricated. Hybridized to the oligonucleotide shell is a DNA sequence to which doxorubicin is conjugated (DNA&#8208;DOX). The oligonucleotides shell is designed to capture overexpressed miR&#8208;21/miR&#8208;155 and inhibit the expression of these oncogenic miRNAs in tumor cells after tumor accumulation to manipulate genetic environment for accurate gene therapy. This process further induces the aggregation of these SNAs, which not only generates photothermal agents to achieve on&#8208;demand photothermal therapy in situ, but also enlarges the size of SNAs to enhance the retention time in the tumor for sustained therapy. The capture of the relevant miRNAs simultaneously triggers the intracellular release of the DNA&#8208;DOX from the SNAs to deliver tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro results indicate that this combination strategy has excellent tumor inhibition properties with high survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice, and can thus be a promising candidate for effective tumor treatment.

To address this challenge, spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consisting of gold nanoparticles in the core and antisense oligonucleotides as the shell are fabricated. Hybridized to the oligonucleotide shell is a DNA sequence to which doxorubicin is conjugated (DNA-DOX). The oligonucleotides shell is designed to capture overexpressed miR-21/miR-155 and inhibit the expression of these oncogenic miRNAs in tumor cells after tumor accumulation to manipulate genetic environment for accurate gene therapy. This process further induces the aggregation of these SNAs, which not only generates photothermal agents to achieve on-demand photothermal therapy in situ, but also enlarges the size of SNAs to enhance the retention time in the tumor for sustained therapy. The capture of the relevant miRNAs simultaneously triggers the intracellular release of the DNA-DOX from the SNAs to deliver tumor-specific chemotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro results indicate that this combination strategy has excellent tumor inhibition properties with high survival rate of tumor-bearing mice, and can thus be a promising candidate for effective tumor treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates: A Promising Perspective on a Dual&#8208;Gate Antiambipolar Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable logic circuits are achieved using a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor. Suitable top&#8208; and bottom&#8208;gate voltages demonstrate five logic gate operations: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR. Additionally, by varying the drain voltage, it is possible to electrically switch two logic gates. Thus, the proposed device concept provides a way of realizing multifunctional logic circuits using a simple circuit design.








Abstract
Electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits are promising candidates for realizing new computation architectures, such as artificial intelligence and neuromorphic devices. In this study, multiple logic gate operations are attained based on a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG&#8208;OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;&#8208;shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom&#8208;gate, top&#8208;gate, and drain voltages. This distinctive feature enables multiple logic gate operations with &#8220;only a single DG&#8208;OAAT,&#8221; which are not obtainable in conventional transistors. Five logic gate operations, which correspond to AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR, are demonstrated by adjusting the bottom&#8208;gate and top&#8208;gate voltages. Moreover, varying the drain voltage makes it possible to reversibly switch two logic gates, e.g., NAND/NOR and OR/XOR. In addition, the DG&#8208;OAATs show a high degree of stability and reliability. The logic gate operations are observed even months later. The hysteresis in the transfer curves is also negligible. Thus, the device concept is promising for realizing multifunctional logic circuits with a simple transistor configuration. Hence, these findings are expected to surpass the current limitations in complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor devices.

&lt;p&gt;Electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits are promising candidates for realizing new computation architectures, such as artificial intelligence and neuromorphic devices. In this study, multiple logic gate operations are attained based on a dual-gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG-OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;-shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom-gate, top-gate, and drain voltages. This distinctive feature enables multiple logic gate operations with &#8220;only a single DG-OAAT,&#8221; which are not obtainable in conventional transistors. Five logic gate operations, which correspond to AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR, are demonstrated by adjusting the bottom-gate and top-gate voltages.

Conformal Amorphous Carbon
Ultrathin Cu diffusion barriers with high conformality have gained great attention for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density semiconductor device miniaturization. In article number 2110454, Sun Hwa Lee, Rodney S. Ruoff, Ki&#8208;Bum Kim, Sang Ouk Kim, and co&#8208;workers introduce a handy and reliable method for the preparation of conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) barrier layers with nanometer&#8208;level thickness. A polystyrene brush layer is grafted onto a 3D copper structure with self&#8208;limiting chemistry, and subsequent carbonization yields large&#8208;area uniform 1 nm&#8208;level a&#8208;C layers with excellent Cu blocking performance.

Exciton Linewidth
Due to strong multiparticle interactions in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides at room temperature, their homogeneous exciton linewidths are significantly broadened, degrading the quality of their excitonic mode and emission. In article number 2108721, Yuebing Zheng and co&#8208;workers achieve near&#8208;intrinsic exciton linewidth in monolayer WS2 at room temperature, approaching the theoretical limit at 0 K. A dielectric nanosphere is designed to boost the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels, rebuilding the excitonic relaxation processes with suppressed exciton nonradiative recombination.

Volumetric Bioprinting
Volumetric bioprinting shapes organoid&#8208;laden constructs into centimeter&#8208;scale assemblies that mimic native liver function. In article number 2110054, Riccardo Levato and co&#8208;workers report the development of a hydrogel&#8208;based bioresin with tunable optical properties to minimize scattering in light&#8208;based printing and ensure high resolution.

&lt;p&gt;Volumetric bioprinting shapes organoid-laden constructs into centimeter-scale assemblies that mimic native liver function. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202110054"&gt;2110054&lt;/a&gt;, Riccardo Levato and co-workers report the development of a hydrogel-based bioresin with tunable optical properties to minimize scattering in light-based printing and ensure high resolution. Organoid viability and maturation is preserved by the shear-stress-free printing, and salient liver functions mature in response to the 3D bioprinted architecture.

4D Bioprinting
For bioprinting of 4D living tissues, in article number 2109394, Eben Alsberg and co&#8208;workers devise a cell&#8208;laden bioink featuring high&#8208;resolution printing, physiological&#8208;trigger&#8208;enabled shape morphing, and long&#8208;term cell viability and function. With this system, they demonstrate that the printed cell&#8208;rich bioconstructs can exert multidirectional reshaping in a controlled manner and transform and develop into tissues with sophisticated structures. The system is anticipated to advance bioprinting to a horizon that enables 4D biomimetic tissue engineering.

Multifunctional Logic Circuits
In article number 2109491, Yutaka Wakayama and co&#8208;workers demonstrate electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits using a dual&#8208;gate anti&#8208;ambipolar transistor. The transistor shows a negative differential transconductance even at room temperature. This unique feature achieves five two&#8208;input logic gate operations with &#8220;only a transistor&#8221;. Such logic operations are not obtainable in conventional transistors. The device concept will provide a way of realizing multifunctional organic logic circuits using a simple circuit design.

         <title>3D Continuously Porous Graphene for Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D continuously porous graphene formed by folding a single&#8208;sheet graphene into a 3D porous architecture has well&#8208;retained 2D properties of graphene and novel functionalities from 3D structure, representing a distinct class of graphene materials with numerous unique and extraordinary properties. A comprehensive review of 3D continuously porous graphene and their applications in energy conversion and storage is provided.








Abstract
Constructing bulk graphene materials with well&#8208;reserved 2D properties is essential for device and engineering applications of atomically thick graphene. In this article, the recent progress in the fabrications and applications of sterically continuous porous graphene with designable microstructures, chemistries, and properties for energy storage and conversion are reviewed. Both template&#8208;based and template&#8208;free methods have been developed to synthesize the 3D continuously porous graphene, which typically has the microstructure reminiscent of pseudo&#8208;periodic minimal surfaces. The 3D graphene can well preserve the properties of 2D graphene of being highly conductive, surface abundant, and mechanically robust, together with unique 2D electronic behaviors. Additionally, the bicontinuous porosity and large curvature offer new functionalities, such as rapid mass transport, ample open space, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electric/thermal conductivity. Particularly, the 3D curvature provides a new degree of freedom for tailoring the catalysis and transport properties of graphene. The 3D graphene with those extraordinary properties has shown great promises for a wide range of applications, especially for energy conversion and storage. This article overviews the recent advances made in addressing the challenges of developing 3D continuously porous graphene, the benefits and opportunities of the new materials for energy&#8208;related applications, and the remaining challenges that warrant future study.

         <title>Fermi Level Pinning Dependent 2D Semiconductor Devices: Challenges and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New and in&#8208;depth insight into the fundamental mechanism of Fermi level pinning in 2D semiconductor devices is presented in this review. The related device characteristics and contact strategies utilizing both the Fermi level pinning and depinning are introduced.








Abstract
Motivated by the high expectation for efficient electrostatic modulation of charge transport at very low voltages, atomically thin 2D materials with a range of bandgaps are investigated extensively for use in future semiconductor devices. However, researchers face formidable challenges in 2D device processing mainly originated from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) structure of ultrathin 2D materials. As major challenges, untunable Schottky barrier height and the corresponding strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) at metal interfaces are observed unexpectedly with 2D vdW materials, giving rise to unmodulated semiconductor polarity, high contact resistance, and lowered device mobility. Here, FLP observed from recently developed 2D semiconductor devices is addressed differently from those observed from conventional semiconductor devices. It is understood that the observed FLP is attributed to inefficient doping into 2D materials, vdW gap present at the metal interface, and hybridized compounds formed under contacting metals. To provide readers with practical guidelines for the design of 2D devices, the impact of FLP occurring in 2D semiconductor devices is further reviewed by exploring various origins responsible for the FLP, effects of FLP on 2D device performances, and methods for improving metallic contact to 2D materials.

         <title>Critical Review on Low&#8208;Temperature Li&#8208;Ion/Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>

A timely and critical review on fundamental mechanisms, recent advances, and design strategies of electrolytes, electrodes, and battery structures for low&#8208;temperature Li batteries is provided.








Abstract
With the highest energy density ever among all sorts of commercialized rechargeable batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have stimulated an upsurge utilization in 3C devices, electric vehicles, and stationary energy&#8208;storage systems. However, a high performance of commercial LIBs based on ethylene carbonate electrolytes and graphite anodes can only be achieved at above &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, which restricts their applications in harsh environments. Here, a comprehensive research progress and in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors leading to the poor low&#8208;temperature performance of LIBs is provided; the distinctive challenges on the anodes, electrolytes, cathodes, and electrolyte&#8211;electrodes interphases are sorted out, with a special focus on Li&#8208;ion transport mechanism therein. Finally, promising strategies and solutions for improving low&#8208;temperature performance are highlighted to maximize the working&#8208;temperature range of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries.

         <dc:description>
This review aims to first provide an overview of the history and parameters of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) materials and analyze the fundamental principles toward rational design of PBAs, and then evaluate the prospects and challenges for PBAs for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hoping to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial reality.








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted wide attention for their application in the energy storage and conversion field due to their low cost, facile synthesis, and appreciable electrochemical performance. At the present stage, most research on PBAs is focused on their material&#8208;level optimization, whereas their properties in practical battery systems are seldom considered. This review aims to first provide an overview of the history and parameters of PBA materials and analyze the fundamental principles toward rational design of PBAs, and then evaluate the prospects and challenges for PBAs for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hoping to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial reality.

         <title>Direct Observation of Strong Anomalous Hall Effect and Proximity&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetic State in SrIrO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic state&#8212;rarely observed in 5d&#8208;based transition metal oxides due to the generally weak electron&#8211;electron correlation&#8212;is induced in SrIrO3 by proximity to ferromagnetic insulating LaCoO3. Electrical transport allows the ferromagnetism of SrIrO3 to be probed selectively, revealing a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy and enabling the direct observation of a strong, intrinsic, and positive anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
The 5d iridium&#8208;based transition metal oxides have gained broad interest because of their strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, which favors new or exotic quantum electronic states. On the other hand, they rarely exhibit more mainstream orders like ferromagnetism due to generally weak electron&#8211;electron correlation strength. Here, a proximity&#8208;induced ferromagnetic (FM) state with TC&#160;&#8776; 100 K and strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy is shown in a SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure via interfacial charge transfer by using a ferromagnetic insulator in contact with SIO. Electrical transport allows to selectively probe the FM state of the SIO layer and the direct observation of a strong, intrinsic, and positive anomalous Hall effect (AHE). For T&#160;&#8804; 20 K, the AHE displays unusually large coercive and saturation field, a fingerprint of a strong pseudospin&#8211;lattice coupling. A Hall angle, &#963;xyAHE/&#963;xx, larger by an order of magnitude than in typical 3d metals and an FM net moment of about 0.1 &#956;B/Ir, is reported. This emphasizes how efficiently the nontrivial topological band properties of SIO can be manipulated by structural modifications and the exchange interaction with 3d TMOs.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrocatalytic conversion and adsorption of polysulfides are realized by combining a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived porous carbon structure and introducing a conductive catalyst Mo2C. The synergistic effect of physical confinement and electrocatalysis improves the utilization rate and stability of S. It shows the excellent rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycle life (503 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles).








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries, as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na&#8208;S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfide shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro&#8208; and&#160;mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and&#160;accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transformation of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Urine&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Initiated Composite Hydrogel Patch Reconfiguration Propels Scarless Memory Repair and Reinvigoration of the Urethra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urine&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch featuring robust antiswelling is engineered, which can respond to Ca2+ in urine to trigger structure reconfiguration and antiswelling for enhancing mechanical stiffness and realizing scarless memory repair via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation, and accelerating angiogenesis especially when combining with moderate photo&#8208;provoked reactive oxygen species birth.








Abstract
The harsh urine microenvironment (UME), as an inherent hurdle, endangers and renders urethral repair unreachable. Innovatively, the unfavorable UME is utilized as the design source to construct a UME&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch for realizing scarless memory repair, wherein laser&#8208;excited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mechanical strength elevation using chemically crosslinked silicon quantum dots are accessible. Intriguingly, the proposed composite scaffolds can respond to Ca2+ in urine, cause structure reconfiguration, and repress swelling to further enhance scaffold stiffness. Systematic experiments validate that ROS birth and unexpected stiffness elevation in such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds can realize scarless memory repair of the urethra in vivo. Comprehensive mechanism explorations uncover that the activations of cell proliferation and collagen&#8208;related genes (e.g., MMP&#8208;1 and COL3A1) and the dampening of fibrosis&#8208;related (e.g., TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) and mechanosensitive genes (e.g., YAP/TAZ) are responsible for the scarless memory repair of such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, decreasing fibrosis and inflammation, and accelerating angiogenesis. The design rationales (e.g., UME&#8208;initiated structure reconfiguration and antiswelling) can serve as an instructive and general approach for urethra repair.

The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of small molecule acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based organic solar cells have already exceeded 18%. However, the development of polymer acceptors still lags far behind their SMA counterparts mainly due to the lack of efficient polymer acceptors. Herein, a series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X (with X being the branched alkyl chain) are&#160;designed and synthesized by employing the same central core with the SMA L8&#8208;BO but with different branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. It is found that the molecular packing of SMA&#8208;HD featuring 2&#8208;hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY&#8208;HD is similar to L8&#8208;BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high&#8208;order molecular assembly in SMA&#8208;HD molecules. When combined with PM6, PY&#8208;HD&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) exhibits a high PCE of 16.41%, representing the highest efficiency for the binary all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, the side&#8208;chain modification on the pyrrole site position further improves the performance of the all&#8208;PSCs, and the PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device delivers a new record high efficiency of 16.76% (certified as 16.3%). The work provides new insights for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship of polymer acceptors and paves a feasible avenue to develop efficient conjugated polymer acceptors.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Artificial Hybrid Nanocells for Boosted Vascular Regeneration in Ischemic Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of stem cell&#8208;based therapeutics faces some bottleneck problem in the progression of cellular approaches. This study introduces a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery system that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions, providing superior effects on targeting ischemic tissues and spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration in ischemic tissues.








Abstract
Restoration of sufficient blood supply for the treatment of ischemia remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Here, a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery technology is introduced that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions for the spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration. Specifically, a copper&#8208;containing protein is successfully prepared using a recombinant protein scaffold based on a de novo design strategy, which facilitates the timely release of nitric oxide and improved accumulation of particles within ischemic tissues. Through closely mimicking physiological cues, the authors demonstrate the benefits of bioactive factors secreted from hypoxic stem cells on promoting angiogenesis. Following this cell&#8208;mimicking manner, artificial hybrid nanosized cells (Hynocell) are constructed by integrating the hypoxic stem cell secretome into nanoparticles with surface coatings of cell membranes fused with copper&#8208;containing protein. The Hynocell, hybridized with different cell&#8208;derived components, provides synergistic effects on targeting ischemic tissues and promoting vascular regeneration in acute hindlimb ischemia and acute myocardial infarction models. This study offers new insights into the utilization of nanotechnology to potentiate the development of cell&#8208;free therapeutics.

         <title>A 3D Hierarchical Host with Enhanced Sodiophilicity Enabling Anode&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous carbon particles with open channels allow rapid Na&#8208;ion flux, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles on the carbon surface induce uniform Na deposition owing to the enhanced Na binding energy. The hierarchical host enables superior cycling performance as Na&#8208;metal anodes under extremely high current conditions as well as demonstration of anode&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as a compliment to lithium&#8208;metal batteries for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium (Na). Herein, a 3D nanostructured porous carbon particle containing carbon&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (PC&#8208;CFe) is employed as a highly reversible Na&#8208;metal host. PC&#8208;CFe has a unique 3D hierarchy based on sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized carbon particles, ordered open channels, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (CFe) on the surface. PC&#8208;CFe achieves high reversibility of Na plating/stripping processes over 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 with 10 mAh cm&#8211;2 in Na//Cu asymmetric cells, as well as over 14&#160;400 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in Na//Na symmetric cells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior cycling performance of PC&#8208;CFe stems from the stronger adsorption of Na on the surface of the CFe, providing initial nucleation sites more favorable to Na deposition. Moreover, the full cell with a PC&#8208;CFe host without Na metal and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) maintains a high capacity of 103 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 even after 100 cycles, demonstrating the operation of anode&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Inhaled mRNA Nanoformulation with Biogenic Ribosomal Protein Reverses Established Pulmonary Fibrosis in a Bleomycin&#8208;Induced Murine Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reverse established pulmonary fibrosis, an inhaled nanoformulation is developed with biogenic ribosomal protein for co&#8208;delivering the mRNA of matrix metalloproteinase 13 and keratinocyte growth factor. The nanoformulation&#8208;mediated treatment accelerates the clearance of overwhelming collagen and the alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization in fibrotic foci, which synergistically restores alveolar integrity and improves pulmonary function of the bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model.








Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a lethal respiratory disease with few treatment options, occurs due to repetitive microinjuries to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and progresses with an overwhelming deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), ultimately resulting in fibrotic scars and destroyed the alveolar architecture. Here, an inhaled ribosomal protein&#8208;based mRNA nanoformulation is reported for clearing the intrapulmonary ECM and re&#8208;epithelializing the disrupted alveolar epithelium, thereby reversing established fibrotic foci in IPF. The nanoformulation is sequentially assembled by a ribosomal protein&#8208;condensed mRNA core, a bifunctional peptide&#8208;modified corona and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) with a PEGylated shielding shell. When inhaled via a nebulizer, the nanoformulations carried by microdrops are deposited in the alveoli, and penetrate into fibrotic foci, where the outer KGFs are detached after matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) triggering. The RGD motif&#8208;grafted cores then expose and specifically target the integrin&#8208;elevated cells for the intracellular delivery of mRNA. Notably, repeated inhalation of the nanoformulations accelerates the clearance of locoregional collagen by boosting the intralesional expression of MMP13 and alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization mediated by KGFs, which synergistically ameliorates the lung function of a bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model. Therefore, this work provides an alternative mRNA&#8208;inhalation delivery strategy, which shows great potential for the treatment of IPF.

         <title>Meniscus&#8208;Assisted Coating with Optimized Active&#8208;Layer Morphology toward Highly Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solution&#8208;printing strategy based on meniscus&#8208;assisted coating for all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) is presented. The champion device based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.53%, which is attributable to the enhanced crystallinity and nanofiber network morphology. It is worth mentioning that 15.53% is the highest PCE reported for solution&#8208;printing&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Morphology control is the key to engineering highly efficient solution&#8208;processed solar cells. Focusing on the most promising application&#8208;oriented photovoltaic all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), herein a facile and effective meniscus&#8208;assisted&#8208;coating (MAC) strategy is reported for preparing high&#8208;quality blend films with enhanced crystallinity and an interpenetrating nanofiber network morphology. The all&#8208;PSCs based on MAC exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties with efficiencies exceeding 15%, which is the best performance of solution&#8208;printing&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, as well as better stability.

&lt;p&gt;A novel solution-printing strategy based on meniscus-assisted coating for all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) is presented. The champion device based on PM6:PY-IT shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.53%, which is attributable to the enhanced crystallinity and nanofiber network morphology. It is worth mentioning that 15.53% is the highest PCE reported for solution-printing-based all-PSCs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Cellular Acoustic Absorber of Graphene Ultrathin Drums</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient acoustic absorber is realized by integrating ultrathin graphene membranes into commercial polymer sponges, to fulfill the outstanding resonance properties of 2D graphene sheets in acoustic absorption and satisfy the urgent demands in acoustic absorption from noise protection, instruments to building design, and acoustic devices.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D graphene sheets exhibit unparalleled in&#8208;plane stiffness and large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elasticity, thereby providing strong mechanical resonance for nanomechanical devices. The exceptional resonance behavior of ultrathin graphene, which promises the fabrication of superior acoustic absorption materials, however, remains unfulfilled for the lack of applicable form and assembly methods. Here, a highly efficient acoustic absorber is presented, wherein cellular networks of ultrathin graphene membranes are constructed into polymer foams. The ultrathin graphene drums exhibit strong resonances and efficiently dissipate sound waves in a broad frequency range. A record specific noise reduction coefficient (51.3 at 30&#160;mm) is achieved in the graphene&#8208;based acoustic absorber, fully realizing the superior resonance properties of graphene sheets. The scalable method facilely transforms commercial polymer foams to superior acoustic absorbers with a &#8776;320% enhancement in average absorption coefficient across wide frequencies from 200 to 6000&#160;Hz. The graphene acoustic absorber offers a convenient method to exploit the extraordinary resonance properties of 2D sheets, opening extensive new applications in noise protection, building design, instruments and acoustic devices.

         <title>An Advanced High&#8208;Entropy Fluorophosphate Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy effect is delicately introduced into fluorophosphate cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries by in situ partial substitution of active V central atom, preparing a high&#8208;entropy carbon&#8208;free Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 cathode, suppressing the occurrence of detrimental phase transition process in the low&#8208;voltage region, and further lifting up the mean working voltage of pristine Na3V2(PO4)2F3, enhancing sodium storage behavior, rate capability, and cycle performance.








Abstract
Impossible voltage plateau regulation for the cathode materials with fixed active elemental center is a pressing issue hindering the development of Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy substitution strategy, to alter the detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing the central active V atom, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. The as&#8208;prepared carbon&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE&#8208;NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81&#160;V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is attributed by the diverse transition&#8208;metal elemental substitution in high&#8208;entropy crystalline. More importantly, high&#8208;entropy introduction can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low&#8208;voltage region, further lifting up the mean working voltage to realize a full Na&#8208;ion storage at the high voltage plateau. Coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HE&#8208;NVPF//HC SIB full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 5 C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg&#8722;1. This route means the unlikely potential regulation in NASICON&#8208;type crystal with unchangeable active center becomes possible, inspiring new ideas on elevating the mean working voltage for SIB cathodes.

         <title>High&#8208;Polarizability Organic Ferroelectric Materials Doping for Enhancing the Built&#8208;In Electric Field of Perovskite Solar Cells Realizing Efficiency over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride):dabcoHReO4 as a perovskite dopant can be partially polarized by the built&#8208;in electric field of perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) itself, which produces an additional electric field, thus promoting the charge&#8208;carrier transportation. A promising 24.23% power conversion efficiency (PCE) (certified PCE of 23.45%) and robust operational stability are obtained.








Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) intensity of silicon heterojunction solar cells can be easily enhanced by selective doping to obtain high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), while it is challenging for perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Herein, an effective method is reported to enhance the BEF of FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite by doping an organic ferroelectric material, poly(vinylidene fluoride):dabcoHReO4 (PVDF:DH) with high polarizability, that can be driven even by the BEF of the device itself. The polarization of PVDF:DH produces an additional electric field, which is maintained permanently, in a direction consistent with that of the BEF of the pero&#8208;SC. The BEF superposition&#160;can more sufficiently drive the charge&#8208;carrier transport and extraction, thus suppressing the nonradiative recombination occurring in the pero&#8208;SCs. Moreover, the PVDF:DH dopant benefits the formation of a mesoporous PbI2 film, via a typical two&#8208;step processing method, thereby promoting perovskite growth with high crystallinity and a few defects. The resulting pero&#8208;SC shows a promising PCE of 24.23% for a 0.062 cm2 device (certified PCE of 23.45%), and a remarkable PCE of 22.69% for a 1 cm2 device, along with significantly improved moisture resistances and operational stabilities.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Infused Porous Surfaces for Manipulation of Underwater Gas Bubble Transport and Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of thermotropic liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;infused porous surfaces capable of on&#8208;demand immobilization, transport, and release of gas bubbles via a LC phase transition is reported. Their use in the design of cyanobacteria&#8208;inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen level in biomimetic cell cultures is demonstrated.








Abstract

         <title>Plasmonic Active &#8220;Hot Spots&#8221;&#8208;Confined Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity for CH4 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalytic CO2 reduction is proposed and realized in the well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; can not only generate high&#8208;energy hot electrons, but also adsorb intermediate products of CO and protons, thereby resulting in high photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CH4 production.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures have tremendous potential to be applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, since their localized surface plasmon resonance can collect low&#8208;energy&#8208;photons to derive energetic &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; for reducing the CO2 activation&#8208;barrier. However, the hot electron&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is usually limited by poor efficiency and low selectivity for producing kinetically unfavorable hydrocarbons. Here, a new idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalysis is proposed to overcome this drawback. W18O49 nanowires on the outer surface of Au nanoparticles&#8208;embedded TiO2 electrospun nanofibers are assembled to obtain lots of Au/TiO2/W18O49 sandwich&#8208;like substructures in the formed plasmonic heterostructure. The short distance (&lt; 10&#160;nm) between Au and adjacent W18O49 can induce an intense plasmon&#8208;coupling to form the active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the substructures. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; are capable of not only gathering the incident light to enhance &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; generation and migration, but also capturing protons and CO through the dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;active&#8208;sites (Au&#8208;O&#8208;Ti and W&#8208;O&#8208;Ti) at the Au/TiO2/W18O49 interface, as evidenced by systematic experiments and simulation analyses. Thus, during photocatalytic CO2 reduction at 43&#177; 2&#8197;&#176;C,&#160;these active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; enriched in the well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure can synergistically confine the hot&#8208;electron, proton, and CO intermediates for resulting in the CH4 and CO production&#8208;rates at &#8776;35.55 and &#8776;2.57&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, and the CH4&#8208;product selectivity at &#8776;93.3%.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;Derivative Decorated Hierarchical Porous Host Enabling Ultrahigh Rates and Superior Long&#8208;Term Cycling of Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elaborate design is reported to fabricate novel 3D host for Zn metal anodes by assembling carbon nanotubes and graphene into a hierarchical porous structure, followed by decorating with Zn&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework derivatives, which enables a significant boost on both charging/discharging rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance for Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their high intrinsic capacity, high safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, uncontrollable dendrite growth and adverse side reactions of Zn anodes seriously hinder their further application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous graphene&#8208;carbon nanotubes scaffold decorated with metal&#8211;organic framework derived ZnO/C nanoparticles (3D&#8208;ZGC) is fabricated as the host for dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal composite anodes. The zincophilic ZnO/C nanoparticles act as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to induce homogeneous Zn deposition. The mechanically robust 3D scaffold with high conductivity not only suppresses the formation of dendritic Zn by reducing the local current density and homogenizing Zn2+ ion flux, but also inhibits volume changes during the long&#8208;term plating/stripping process. As a result, the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anodes afford unprecedented Zn plating&#8208;stripping stability at an ultrahigh current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 for 1500 cycles with low overpotential (&lt;65&#160;mV) when used in a symmetric cell. When coupled with MnO2 cathodes, the assembled Zn@3D&#8208;ZGC//MnO2 full batteries deliver an enhanced cycling stability for up to 6000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8208;1, demonstrating the potential of the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anode for advanced Zn metal batteries.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Metasurface&#8208;Enabled Multiple Vortex Emissions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining an orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing metalens array and semiconductor microlasers, the simultaneous generation of a vortex emission array with versatile topological charges is experimentally demonstrated, paving an essential step toward on&#8208;chip integrated OAM sources.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integrated micro&#8208; and nanoscale vortex lasers are key elements for addressing the exponentially growing demand for information capacity. Although tunable vortex microlasers have been reported, each laser pulse still possesses one particular topological charge and requires additional multiplexing. In this study, the simultaneous generation of coherent laser arrays with different topological charges by combining metalenses with semiconductor microlasers is demonstrated. A TiO2 vortex metalens converts two orbital angular momentum beams into the same diffraction&#8208;limit spot with opposite circular polarizations through spin&#8208;to&#8208;orbital conversion. Consequently, the microlaser emission at the focal spot, which can be decomposed into two circularly polarized beams, is collimated into vortex microlaser beams with two different topological charges through a time&#8208;reversal process. This concept is extended to a 2 &#215; 2 metalens array by introducing off&#8208;axis terms, and eight topological charges are produced simultaneously. This research is a significant step toward the on&#8208;chip integration of micro&#8208; and nanolasers.

Abstract
Automatic control systems are the most efficient technology for reducing labor cost while improving work efficiency. Vector motion monitoring is indispensable for the normal operation of automatic control systems.

&lt;p&gt;Automatic control systems are the most efficient technology for reducing labor cost while improving work efficiency. Vector motion monitoring is indispensable for the normal operation of automatic control systems.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Organic Photocatalyst Discovered for Highly Efficient Additive&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Grafting of Polymers from Proteins at Ambient and Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) is reported, which enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven additive&#8208;free &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. A variety of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates are prepared under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation. It is believed that this PC will be widely employed for photocatalysis in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Since the pioneering discovery of a protein bound to poly(ethylene glycol), the utility of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates (PPCs) is rapidly expanding to currently emerging applications. Photoinduced energy/electron&#8208;transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization is a very promising method to prepare structurally well&#8208;defined PPCs, as it eliminates high&#8208;cost and time&#8208;consuming deoxygenation processes due to its oxygen tolerance. However, the oxygen&#8208;tolerance behavior of PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization is not well&#8208;investigated in aqueous environments, and thereby the preparation of PPCs using PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization needs a substantial amount of sacrificial reducing agents or inert&#8208;gas purging processes. Herein a novel water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) is reported, which enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven additive&#8208;free &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. Interestingly, the developed PC shows unconventional &#8220;oxygen&#8208;acceleration&#8221; behavior for a variety of acrylic and acrylamide monomers in aqueous conditions without any additives, which are apparently distinct from previously reported systems. With such a PC, &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations are successfully performed from protein in ambient buffer conditions under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation, which result in various PPCs that have neutral, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic polyacrylates, and polyacrylamides. It is believed that this PC will be widely employed for a variety of photocatalysis processes in aqueous environments, including the living cell system.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Integration of Silicon Nanomembranes with 2D Materials for Bioresorbable, Wireless Neurochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, wireless, and bioresorbable neurochemical system designed to determine various concentrations of neurotransmitters as well as to monitor peripheral physiologies (temperature, pH, electrical activity) in a simultaneous manner is presented. An extensive range of studies covers modifications of nanoscale materials and system&#8208;level electronics, enabling the production of exceptional performance.








Abstract
Although neurotransmitters are key substances closely related to evaluating degenerative brain diseases as well as regulating essential functions in the body, many research efforts have not been focused on direct observation of such biochemical messengers, rather on monitoring relatively associated physical, mechanical, and electrophysiological parameters. Here, a bioresorbable silicon&#8208;based neurochemical analyzer incorporated with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is introduced as a completely implantable brain&#8208;integrated system that can wirelessly monitor time&#8208;dynamic behaviors of dopamine and relevant parameters in a simultaneous mode. An extensive range of examinations of molybdenum/tungsten disulfide (MoS2/WS2) nanosheets and catalytic iron nanoparticles (Fe NPs) highlights the underlying mechanisms of strong chemical and target&#8208;specific responses to the neurotransmitters, along with theoretical modeling tools. Systematic characterizations demonstrate reversible, stable, and long&#8208;term operational performances of the degradable bioelectronics with excellent sensitivity and selectivity over those of non&#8208;dissolvable counterparts. A complete set of in vivo experiments with comparative analysis using carbon&#8208;fiber electrodes illustrates the capability for potential use as a clinically accessible tool to associated neurodegenerative diseases.

Hygroscopic chemistry enables fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is a common safety risk that is extremely serious in energy storage devices. Here, a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor achieved by the self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte is reported, in which hygroscopic solute spontaneously absorbs water from the air as the solvent to recover the disenabled supercapacitor even after burning.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is an extremely serious safety risk in energy storage devices; which can be avoided by replacing their components with nonflammable materials. However; these devices are still destroyed by the high&#8208;temperature decomposition; lacking reliability. Here, a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor is further demonstrated that recovers after burning with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. Using fire&#8208;tolerant electrodes and separator with a semiopen device configuration; hygroscopic CaCl2 in the air (&#8220;CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221;) is designed as a self&#8208;healable electrolyte; which loses its water solvent at high temperatures but spontaneously absorbs water from the air to recover by itself at low temperatures. The supercapacitor is disenabled at 500 &#176;C; while it recovers after cooling in the air. Especially; it even recovers after burning at around 647 &#176;C with enhanced performance. The study offers a self&#8208;healing strategy to design high&#8208;safety; high&#8208;reliability; and fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors; which inspires a promising way to deal with general fire&#8208;related risks.

         <title>2D FeOCl: A Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor Synthesized via Temperature&#8208;Oscillation Chemical Vapor Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale antiferromagnetic semiconductor FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized by developing a temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport method. The semiconducting characteristics, strong in&#8208;plane anisotropies, and spin&#8722;phonon coupling effect of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. This study provides a high&#8208;quality low&#8208;symmetry van der Waals magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronic devices.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) transition&#8208;metal oxyhalides with low symmetry, novel magnetism, and good stability provide a versatile platform for conducting fundamental research and developing spintronics. Antiferromagnetic FeOCl has attracted significant interest owing to its unique semiconductor properties and relatively high N&#233;el temperature. Herein, good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized using the universal temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport (TO&#8208;CVT) method. The crystal structure, bandgap, and anisotropic behavior of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. The absorption spectrum and electrical measurements reveal that 2D FeOCl is a semiconductor with an optical bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV and a resistivity of &#8776;10&#8722;1&#160;&#937; m at 295 K, and the bandgap increases with decreasing thickness. Strong in&#8208;plane optical and electrical anisotropies are observed in 2D FeOCl flakes, and the maximum resistance anisotropic ratio reaches 2.66 at 295 K. Additionally, the lattice vibration modes are studied through temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectra and first&#8208;principles density functional calculations. A significant decrease in the Raman frequencies below the N&#233;el temperature is observed, which results from the strong spin&#8722;phonon coupling effect in 2D FeOCl.

&lt;p&gt;Good-quality centimeter-scale antiferromagnetic semiconductor FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized by developing a temperature-oscillation chemical vapor transport method. The semiconducting characteristics, strong in-plane anisotropies, and spin&#8722;phonon coupling effect of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. This study provides a high-quality low-symmetry van der Waals magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D van der Waals (vdW) transition-metal oxyhalides with low symmetry, novel magnetism, and good stability provide a versatile platform for conducting fundamental research and developing spintronics. Antiferromagnetic FeOCl has attracted significant interest owing to its unique semiconductor properties and relatively high N&#233;el temperature. Herein, good-quality centimeter-scale FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized using the universal temperature-oscillation chemical vapor transport (TO-CVT) method. The crystal structure, bandgap, and anisotropic behavior of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. The absorption spectrum and electrical measurements reveal that 2D FeOCl is a semiconductor with an optical bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV and a resistivity of &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&#937; m at 295 K, and the bandgap increases with decreasing thickness. Strong in-plane optical and electrical anisotropies are observed in 2D FeOCl flakes, and the maximum resistance anisotropic ratio reaches 2.66 at 295 K. Additionally, the lattice vibration modes are studied through temperature-dependent Raman spectra and first-principles density functional calculations. A significant decrease in the Raman frequencies below the N&#233;el temperature is observed, which results from the strong spin&#8722;phonon coupling effect in 2D FeOCl. This study provides a high-quality low-symmetry vdW magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From p&#8208; to n&#8208;Type Mixed Conduction in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Polymers through Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecular design criteria for isoindigo&#8208;based semiconducting polymers is presented and their versatility is showcased for the development of mixed conductors relevant to organic bioelectronic applications. Through rational choice of the isoindigoid motif and an appropriate comonomer, efficient hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transport materials are developed and strategies for further optimization are identified, including the development of ambipolar mixed conductors.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic and electronic conductors are of significant interest for bioelectronic applications. Here, three different isoindigoid building blocks are used to obtain polymeric mixed conductors with vastly different structural and electronic properties which can be further fine&#8208;tuned through the choice of comonomer unit. This work shows how careful design of the isoindigoid scaffold can afford highly planar polymer structures with high degrees of electronic delocalization, while subtle structural modifications can control the dominant charge carrier (hole or electron) when probed in organic electrochemical transistors. A combination of experimental and computational techniques is employed to probe electrochemical, structural, and mixed ionic and electronic properties of the polymer series which in turn allows the derivation of important structure&#8211;property relations for this promising class of materials in the context of organic bioelectronics. Ultimately, these findings are used to outline robust molecular&#8208;design strategies for isoindigo&#8208;based mixed conductors that can support efficient p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type, and ambipolar transistor operation in an aqueous environment.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Auxetic Hierarchical Mechanical Metamaterials for Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents novel 2D and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior that can be fully controlled through design parameters. The proposed hierarchical systems can also form composites capable of shape morphing where the initial structures can assume arbitrary predefined shapes.








Abstract
Shape morphing and the possibility of having control over mechanical properties via designed deformations have attracted a lot of attention in the materials community and led to a variety of applications with an emphasis on the space industry. However, current materials normally do not allow to have a full control over the deformation pattern and often fail to replicate such behavior at low scales which is essential in flexible electronics. Thus, in this paper, novel 2D&#160;and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials using mutually&#8208;competing substructures within the system that are capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior are proposed. Using experiments (3D microprinted polymers) supported by computer simulations, it is shown that such ability can be controlled through geometric design parameters. Finally it is demonstrated that the considered structure can form a composite capable of shape morphing allowing it to deform to a predefined shape.

         <title>Design Rules of a Sulfur Redox Electrocatalyst for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection are proposed as two rules for the rational design of sulfur redox electrocatalysts. The former promotes the tight anchoring of polysulfides onto the SmMn2O5 catalyst, while the latter reduces the overpotential of the sulfur redox reaction, fundamentally accelerating the conversion of liquid&#8208;phase polysulfides to solid&#8208;phase discharge product and thus suppressing the shuttling.








Abstract
Seeking an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides to insoluble products is crucial to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries and thus increase their practical energy density. Mn&#8208;based mullite (SmMn2O5) is used as a model catalyst for the sulfur redox reaction to show how the design rules involving lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection improve catalyst performance. Theoretical simulation shows that the positions of Mn and O active sites on the (001) surface are a good match with those of Li and S atoms in polysulfides, resulting in their tight anchoring to each other. Fundamentally, dz2 and dx2&#8722;y2 around the Fermi level are found to be crucial for strongly coupling with the p&#8208;orbitals of the polysulfides and thus decreasing the redox overpotential. Following the theoretical calculation, SmMn2O5 catalyst is synthesized and used as an interlayer in a Li&#8211;S battery. The resulted battery has a high cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 0.5 C and more promisingly a high areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved with a sulfur loading of &#8776;5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 under the condition of a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) value &#8776;4.6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1.

The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane camouflage hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption (Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ) to form TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, notably reduces in vivo reticuloendothelial system uptake, enhances tumor accumulation, inhibits tumor growth, induces tumor&#8208;associated macrophage polarization, facilitates cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration, and alleviates hypoxia microenvironment for improved cancer immunotherapy efficacy.








Abstract
Both tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and hypoxia condition severely restrict the antitumor potency during cancer immunotherapy. It is essential to overcome the two issues for improving therapeutic efficacy. In this study, a hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption is built, to form Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ. It can facilitate cellular internalization via mannose&#8208;receptor mediated endocytosis and induce TAM polarization via iron ion/HCQ release with HMPB degradation. The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane is camouflaged on the Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ surface, denoted as TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, to reduce in vivo reticuloendothelial system uptake, enhance tumor accumulation, and mitigate hypoxia. The in vivo results indicate that TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ notably inhibits tumor growth, induces TAM polarization, facilitates cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration, and alleviates hypoxia microenvironment. The rational design may provide a new pathway to modulate the tumor microenvironment for promoting cancer immunotherapy effects.

         <title>Heterojunction Annealing Enabling Record Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage in Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterojunction post&#8208;annealing treatment is utilized to suppress the nonradiative recombination for a highly competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 520&#160;mV in Sb2Se3 thin&#8208;film solar cells. The VOC deficit of the device is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cells.








Abstract
Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) thin&#8208;film solar cells have undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit still remains as the biggest bottleneck, as even the world&#8208;record device suffers from a large VOC deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) is subjected to a post&#8208;annealing treatment using a rapid thermal process. It is found that nonradiative recombination near the Sb2Se3/CdS HTJ, including interface recombination and space charge region recombination, is greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb2Se3/CdS thin&#8208;film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record VOC of 0.52&#160;V is successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated VOC deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.

         <title>Antifreezing Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ternary Hydrogen Bonding for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible and antifreezing polysaccharide hydrogel is realized in situ with Zn(ClO4)2 salts through the Hofmeister effect. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions can form weak hydrogen bonds with both water and polymer chains to decrease the electrolyte freezing point and endow the hydrogel with good mechanical flexibility, thus enabling the zinc&#8208;ion batteries with high performance ranging from &#8722;30 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The new&#8208;generation flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries require enhanced mechanical properties and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications. This fundamentally means that it is desired that the hydrogel electrolyte possesses antifreezing merits to resist flexibility loss and performance decrease at subzero temperatures. Herein, a highly flexible polysaccharide hydrogel is realized in situ and is regulated in zinc&#8208;ion batteries through the Hofmeister effect with low&#8208;concentration Zn(ClO4)2 salts to satisfy the abovementioned requirements. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions, water, and polymer chains can form ternary and weak hydrogen bonding (HB), which enables the polymer chains to have improved mechanical properties, breaks the HB of water to remarkably decrease the electrolyte freezing point, and reduces the amounts of free water for effective side reactions and dendrite inhibition. Consequently, even at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, the Zn(ClO4)2 in situ optimized hydrogel electrolyte features a high ionic conductivity of 7.8 mS cm&#8722;1 and excellent flexibility, which enables a Zn/polyaniline (PANI) battery with a reversible capacity of 70&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 under 5 A g&#8722;1 for 2500 cycles, and renderd the flexible full battery with excellent cycling performances under different bending angles. This work provides a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance antifreezing flexible batteries via the Hofmeister effect.

         <title>Selective Center Charge Density Enables Conductive 2D Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks with Exceptionally High Pseudocapacitance and Energy Density for Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with prototypical of 2D Co&#8208;catecholate is proposed. The lower electron cloud density of the metal&#8208;ion center in the Z&#8208;axis provides the ability to attract a group of electron donors, leading to exceptionally high pseudocapacitance and energy density.








Abstract
Conductive 2D conjugated metal&#8722;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) are attractive electrode materials due to their high intrinsic electrical conductivities, large specific surface area, and abundant unsaturated bonds/functional groups. However, the 2D c&#8208;MOFs reported so far have limited charge storage capacity during electrochemical charging and discharging, and the energy density is still unsatisfactory. In this work, a strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with the prototypical of 2D Co&#8208;catecholate (Co&#8208;CAT) is proposed. Electrochemical mechanism studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that dual redox sites are achieved with the quinone groups (CAT) and metal&#8208;ion linkages (Co&#8722;O) serving as the active sites of pseudocapacitive cation (Na+) and redox electrolyte species (SO32&#8722;). The resultant electrode delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 1160 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and a special self&#8208;discharge rate (86.8% after 48&#160;h). Moreover, the packaged asymmetric device exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy density of 158 W h kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 2000 W kg&#8722;1 and an excellent self&#8208;discharge rate of 80.6% after 48 h. This success will provide a new perspective for the performance enhancement for the 2D&#8208;MOF&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>A Redox Couple Strategy Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes by Suppressing Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen release is the main reason for capacity decay of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. A novel redox couple strategy is proposed here to fundamentally solve this problem. As a proof of concept, the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple can significantly suppress oxygen release by chemically reducing surface O22&#8722; back into immobile O2&#8722;, thereby achieving the long&#8208;term cycling stability of Li&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The poor cycling stability and fast voltage fading resulting from oxygen release during charging, however, severely hinders their practical application. Herein, a strategy of introducing an additional redox couple is proposed to eliminate the persistent problem of oxygen release. As a proof of concept, the cycling stability of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, which is a typical LMRO cathode, is substantially enhanced with the help of the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple, and the capacity shows no decay with a retention of 100% after 700 cycles at 1C, far superior to the bare counterpart (61.7%). The surface peroxide ions (O22&#8722;) are readily chemically reduced back to immobile O2&#8722; by S2&#8722; during charging, accompanied by the formation of SO32&#8722;, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the oxygen lattice and eventually inhibiting the release of oxygen. More importantly, the S2&#8722; ions are regenerated during the following discharging process and participate in the chemical redox reaction again. The findings shed light on a potential direction to tackle the poor cycling stability of high&#8208;energy anion&#8208;redox cathode materials for rechargeable metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism in Perylene Diimide Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductors with negligible spin&#8211;orbital couplings are potential materials for spintronics. Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is revealed in perylene diimide (PDI) semiconductor with high mobility. PDI ferromagnets show Curie temperature of more than 400 K and saturation magnetization above 1 emu g&#8722;1. This work paves a new way to realize room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.








Abstract
The development of pure organic magnets with high Curie temperatures remains a challenging task in material science. Introducing high&#8208;density free radicals to strongly interacting organic molecules may be an effective method to this end. In this study, a solvothermal approach with excess hydrazine hydrate is used to concurrently reduce and dissolve rigid&#8208;backbone perylene diimide (PDI) crystallites into the soluble dianion species with a remarkably high reduction potential. The as&#8208;prepared PDI powders comprising radical anion aggregates are fabricated by a subsequent self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous oxidation process. The results of magnetic measurements show that the PDI powders exhibit room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and a Curie temperature higher than 400 K, with a vast saturation magnetization that reaches &#8776;1.2 emu g&#8722;1. Elemental analysis along with the diamagnetic signal of the ablated residue are used to rule out the possibility that the magnetism is due to metal contamination. The findings suggest that the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering can survive at room&#8208;temperature in organic semiconductors, and offers a new optional way to create room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.

         <title>Unconventional Doping Effect Leads to Ultrahigh Average Thermoelectric Power Factor in Cu3SbSe4&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the advantage of unconventional doping, high carrier mobility is maintained in Cu3SbSe4&#8722;xCuAlSe2&#160;composites, which is much higher than that of other Cu3SbSe4&#8208;based thermoelectrics doped by conventional methods. Consequently, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19&#160;&#956;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;is obtained in the temperature range of 300&#8211;723&#160;K among Cu&#8208;based diamond&#8208;like thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials are typically highly degenerate semiconductors, which require high carrier concentration. However, the efficiency of conventional doping by replacing host atoms with alien ones is restricted by solubility limit, and, more unfavorably, such a doping method is likely to cause strong charge&#8208;carrier scattering at ambient temperature, leading to deteriorated electrical performance. Here, an unconventional doping strategy is proposed, where a small trace of alien atoms is used to stabilize cation vacancies in Cu3SbSe4&#160;by compositing with CuAlSe2, in which the cation vacancies rather than the alien atoms provide a high density of holes. Consequently, the hole concentration enlarges by six&#160;times but the carrier mobility is well maintained. As a result, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;in the temperature range of 300&#8211;723&#160;K is attained. Finally, with further reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a peak zT value of 1.4&#160;and a record&#8208;high average zT value of 0.72&#160;are achieved within the diamond&#8208;like compounds. This new doping strategy not only can be applied for boosting the average power factor for thermoelectrics, but more generally can be used to maintain carrier mobility for a variety of semiconductors that need high carrier concentration.

         <title>Interpretation of Rubidium&#8208;Based Perovskite Recipes toward Electronic Passivation and Ion&#8208;Diffusion Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rb+&#8208;based perovskite recipes are widely adopted in a large amount of significant advancements regarding perovskite solar cells with several performance records. Combining seminal theoretical calculations with cutting&#8208;edge experimental characterizations, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in doping concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is thoroughly investigated.








Abstract
Rubidium cation (Rb+) addition is witnessed to play a pivotal role in boosting the comprehensive performance of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, the origin of such success derived from irreplaceable superiorities brought by Rb+ remains ambiguous. Herein, grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;including atomic models are adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb+ distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution, covering both the grain interiors and boundaries, is thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron&#8208;based grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior are expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb+ addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability is elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb+ concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high&#8208;efficiency cascade&#8208;incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.

         <title>Diverging Expressions of Anharmonicity in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy is used to compare the anharmonic expressions in the structural dynamics of two halide perovskites. In Cs2AgBiBr6, clear normal modes are observed in all measured temperatures. Contrary to this, the Raman spectrum of CsPbBr3 exhibits a breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture above 200 K. Implications of these diverging behaviors on the electronic properties of the crystals is discussed.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;based halide perovskite crystals are shown to have strongly anharmonic structural dynamics. This behavior is important because it may be the origin of their exceptional photovoltaic properties. The double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6, has been recently studied as a lead&#8208;free alternative for optoelectronic applications. However, it does not exhibit the excellent photovoltaic activity of the lead&#8208;based halide perovskites. Therefore, to explore the correlation between the anharmonic structural dynamics and optoelectronic properties in lead&#8208;based halide perovskites, the structural dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6 are investigated and are compared to its lead&#8208;based analog, CsPbBr3. Using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman measurements, it is found that both materials are indeed strongly anharmonic. Nonetheless, the expression of their anharmonic behavior is markedly different. Cs2AgBiBr6 has well&#8208;defined normal modes throughout the measured temperature range, while CsPbBr3 exhibits a complete breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture above 200&#160;K. It is suggested that the breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture implies that the average crystal structure may not be a proper starting point to understand the electronic properties of the crystal. In addition to our&#160;main findings, an unreported phase of Cs2AgBiBr6 is also discovered below&#160;&#8776;37&#160;K.

         <title>Synergistic Energy Absorption Mechanisms of Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of architected materials based on liquid crystal elastomers is reported. The synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship and with a number of layers for multilayered structures. The study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.








Abstract
A unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#8208;based architected materials is reported. The architected materials consist of repeating unit cells of bistable tilted LCE beams sandwiched between stiff supports. The viscoelastic behavior of the LCE causes the energy absorption to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship, which can be modulated by changing the degree of mesogen alignment and the loading direction relative to the director. For a strain rate of 600 s&#8722;1, the unit cell exhibits up to a 5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 energy absorption density, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the same structure fabricated from poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer and is comparable to the dissipation from irreversible plastic deformation exhibited by denser metals. For a multilayered structure of unit cells, nonuniform buckling of the different layers produces additional viscoelastic dissipation. This synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with the number of layers. The sequence of cell collapse can be controlled by grading the beam thickness to further promote viscous dissipation and enhance the energy absorption density. It is envisioned that the study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.

         <title>Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Actuators and Waveguides that Operate at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant approach is described for conversion of elastic molecular crystals into flexible actuators that operate in low&#8208;temperature environments. These materials are tested in micromechanical actuation operations such as soft gripping of delicate objects, autonomous motion over flat surfaces, and measurement of temperature.








Abstract
Applications in extreme conditions, such as those encountered in space exploration, require lightweight materials that can retain their elasticity in extremely cold environments. However, cryogenic treatment of most soft polymeric and elastomeric materials results in complete loss of their ability for elastic flow, whereby such materials that are normally ductile become stiff, brittle, and prone to cracking. Here, a facile method for preparation of hybrid organic crystalline materials that are not only cryogenically robust but are also capable of large, recoverable, and reversible deformation at low temperatures is reported. To that end, flexible organic crystals are first mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating and combined with a thermally responsive polymer. The resulting hybrid materials respond linearly and reversibly to temperatures from &#8722;15 to &#8722;120 &#176;C without fatigue in air as well as in cold vacuum. The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that are inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost&#8208;effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low&#8208;temperature environmental settings.

         <title>Catalytic Kinetics Regulation for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrogen Oxidation by Ru&#8208;Nanoclusters&#8208;Coupled Mn3O4 Catalysts Decorated with Atomically Dispersed Ru Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms are designed as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with excellent FE and remarkable NO3&#8722; yields. The coexistence of Ru clusters and singe&#8208;atom Ru are considered to regulate catalytic kinetics among reaction&#8208;available N2, *OH accessibility, and transfer of electrons for optimized performance.








Abstract
Electrochemical N2 oxidation reaction (NOR), using water and N2 in the atmosphere, represents a sustainable approach for nitric production to replace the conventional industrial synthesis with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Meanwhile, owing to chemical inertness of N2 and sluggish kinetics for 10&#8208;electron transfer, emerging electrocatalysts remain largely underexplored. Herein, Ru&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms (Ru&#8211;Mn3O4) are designed and explored as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with an excellent Faraday efficiency (28.87%) and a remarkable NO3&#8208; yield (35.34&#160;&#181;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat.), respectively. Experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the outstanding activity is ascribed to the coexistence of Ru clusters and single&#8208;atom Ru. The synergistic effect between the Ru clusters and Mn3O4 can effectively activate the chemically inert N2, lowering the kinetic barrier for the vital breakage of N&#8801;N. The intensive *OH supply and enhanced conductivity are used to regulate the catalytic kinetics for optimized performance. This work provides brand&#8208;new ideas for the rational design of electrocatalysts in complicated electrocatalytic reactions with multiple dynamics&#8208;different steps.

         <title>Bioinspired Lipoproteins of Furoxans&#8211;Oxaliplatin Remodel Physical Barriers in Tumor to Potentiate T&#8208;Cell Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abnormal tumor vasculature and dense tumor stroma constitute a formidable physical barrier that strikingly limits the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Herein, a stromal&#8208;cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system loading a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is designed, which profoundly paves the way for CTL infiltration in tumors and synergizes immune&#8208;checkpoint&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;mediated anticancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anticancer immunotherapy. Herein, a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is synthesized and a stroma&#8208;cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S&#8208;LFO) is designed, aiming to facilitate CTL infiltration in tumors for anticancer immunotherapy. S&#8208;LFO treatment significantly promotes tumor vessel normalization and eliminates multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96&#8208;fold, 5.02&#8208;fold, and 8.65&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells, their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and granzyme B&#8208;expressing subtypes when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S&#8208;LFO with an antiprogrammed death ligand&#8208;1 produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extends survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTL infiltration for anticancer immunotherapy.

Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
In article number 2109330, Zhenyi Zhang and co&#8208;workers report plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalytic CO2 reduction over a well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure. The active &#8220;hot spot&#8221; can synergistically confine hot electrons, CO, and protons, thereby leading to high photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CH4 production.

Nanomedicine
In article number 2107506, Xinyi Jiang and co&#8208;workers introduce an inhaled nanoformulation that is developed with biogenic ribosomal protein for mRNA delivery. The variety of isoelectric points of ribosomal proteins endows them with flexible positive charge properties, by which negatively charged mRNA is efficiently condensed to form a nanocomplex in a biomimetic fashion.

Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries
In article number 2110047, Hongpeng Li, Lichao Tan, Zhongwei Chen and co&#8208;workers report a novel 3D host for Zn&#8208;metal anodes fabricated by assembling carbon nanotubes and graphene into a hierarchical porous structure, followed by decorating with Zn metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) derivatives. The mechanically robust 3D host with high zincophilicity and conductivity could address the issues of dendrite growth, thereby enabling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Zn&#8208;metal batteries.

In article number 2110108, Xing&#8208;Long Wu and co&#8208;workers present a high&#8208;entropy Na3V2(PO4)2F3&#8208;based cathode for advanced SIBs. The high&#8208;entropy effect endows this cathode material with a lowered Na+ migration barrier and enhanced electronic conductivity, which jointly promote charge transport and sodium&#8208;storage ability in the phosphate cathode, thereby enhancing the average operating voltage and energy density of the SIB.

Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries
In article number 2109767, Byung&#8208;Hyun Kim, Bumjoon J. Kim, Seung Woo Lee, and co&#8208;workers report anode&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal batteries. The cover image depicts two batteries: the left shows typical sodium&#8208;metal batteries, where the continuous dendrite growth in the sodium&#8208;metal anodes causes a short&#8208;circuit, resulting in battery failure. Contrarily, the right shows highly reversible porous carbon hosts with carbon&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles for the sodium&#8208;metal anode, allowing superior cycling performance and improving the energy density of the batteries.

         <title>Graphitic Aza&#8208;Fused &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Networks: Construction, Engineering, and Task&#8208;Specific Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the construction and application of graphitic aza&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks is summarized. The correlation between compositional and structural engineering and optimization of the performance is highlighted for covalent triazine frameworks, covalent quinazoline networks, and hexaazatriphenylene networks in the fields of gas adsorption, membrane&#8208;based separation, thermo&#8208;/electro&#8208;/photocatalysis, and energy storage.








Abstract
2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks linked by aza&#8208;fused units represent a pivotal category of graphitic materials with stacked nanosheet architectures. Extensive efforts have been directed at their fabrication and application since the discovery of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). Besides the triazine cores, tricycloquinazoline and hexaazatriphenylene linkages are further introduced to tailor the structures and properties. Diverse related materials have been developed rapidly, and a thorough outlook is necessitated to unveil the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships across multiple subcategories, which is pivotal to guide the design and fabrication toward enhanced task&#8208;specific performance. Herein, the structure types and development of related materials including CTFs, covalent quinazoline networks, and hexaazatriphenylene networks, are introduced. Advanced synthetic strategies coupled with characterization techniques provide powerful tools to engineer the properties and tune the associated behaviors in corresponding applications. Case studies in the areas of gas adsorption, membrane&#8208;based separation, thermo&#8208;/electro&#8208;/photocatalysis, and energy storage are then addressed, focusing on the correlation between structure/property engineering and optimization of the corresponding performance, particularly the preferred features and strategies in each specific field. In the last section, the underlying challenges and opportunities in construction and application of this emerging and promising material category are discussed.

         <title>Designing Next Generation of Persistent Luminescence: Recent Advances in Uniform Persistent Luminescence Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) possess long&#8208;lasting afterglow after the excitation ceases, demonstrating merits for various applications. The recent rapid progress of uniform PLNPs boosts their biomedical applications. This review highlights milestones of uniform PLNPs syntheses, analyzes key strategies for enhancing their optical properties, and envisions the challenges and potential future directions of uniform PLNPs for novel applications.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence is a unique optical process where long&#8208;lasting afterglow persists after the cessation of excitation. Nanoscale persistent luminescent materials are getting increased research interest from various fields due to their unique optical property. In recent years, inspiring achievements have been made to produce uniform persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) in a controllable manner, unleashing their fascinating potential, surpassing other types of luminescent materials in a wide variety of application such as high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detection. In this review, the evolution of uniform PLNPs, from their bulk phosphor counterparts, to the &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; preparation of nanoscale persistent luminescent materials, to the recent &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthesis of uniform PLNPs is first summarized. The respective milestones of uniform PLNPs prepared by templated synthesis, aqueous synthesis, and colloidal synthesis are highlighted. The key optical properties that can be enhanced in uniform PLNPs, including increasing the persistent luminescence intensity, tuning the excitation irradiance, as well as the emission wavelengths are then analyzed. Detailed strategies to enhance each optical property are also discussed in various sections. Finally, future challenges are highlighted with respect to the perspectives on the development of next&#8208;generation PLNPs with novel applications.

         <title>Growth of 2D Materials at the Wafer Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces various 2D van der Waals layered materials and summarizes their wafer&#8208;scale growth processes, including strategies for mono&#8208;orientated film growth. Applications of these materials in integrated devices and new epitaxial technologies are discussed, as well as the required future research directions in this very important field.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth has become a critical bottleneck for scaling up applications of van der Waal (vdW) layered 2D materials in high&#8208;end electronics and optoelectronics. Most vdW 2D materials are initially obtained through top&#8208;down synthesis methods, such as exfoliation, which can only prepare small flakes on a micrometer scale. Bottom&#8208;up growth can enable 2D flake growth over a large area. However, seamless merging of these flakes to form large&#8208;area continuous films with well&#8208;controlled layer thickness and lattice orientation is still a significant challenge. This review briefly introduces several vdW layered 2D materials covering their lattice structures, representative physical properties, and potential roles in large&#8208;scale applications. Then, several methods used to grow vdW layered 2D materials at the wafer scale are reviewed in depth. In particular, three strategies are summarized that enable 2D film growth with a single&#8208;crystalline structure over the whole wafer: growth of an isolated domain, growth of unidirectional domains, and conversion of oriented precursors. After that, the progress in using wafer&#8208;scale 2D materials in integrated devices and advanced epitaxy is reviewed. Finally, future directions in the growth and scaling of vdW layered 2D materials are discussed.

The mechanical performance of glassy materials presents a major challenge in modern glass science and technology. With a focus on visually transparent, inorganic and hybrid glasses, a perspective on the most recent developments in the field is provided herein, emphasizing the importance of translating fundamental insight from glass physics into future applications.








Abstract
Glasses are materials that lack a crystalline microstructure and long&#8208;range atomic order. Instead, they feature heterogeneity and disorder on superstructural scales, which have profound consequences for their elastic response, material strength, fracture toughness, and the characteristics of dynamic fracture. These structure&#8211;property relations present a rich field of study in fundamental glass physics and are also becoming increasingly important in the design of modern materials with improved mechanical performance. A first step in this direction involves glass&#8208;like materials that retain optical transparency and the haptics of classical glass products, while overcoming the limitations of brittleness. Among these, novel types of oxide glasses, hybrid glasses, phase&#8208;separated glasses, and bioinspired glass&#8211;polymer composites hold significant promise. Such materials are designed from the bottom&#8208;up, building on structure&#8211;property relations, modeling of stresses and strains at relevant length scales, and machine learning predictions. Their fabrication requires a more scientifically driven approach to materials design and processing, building on the physics of structural disorder and its consequences for structural rearrangements, defect initiation, and dynamic fracture in response to mechanical load. In this article, a perspective is provided on this highly interdisciplinary field of research in terms of its most recent challenges and opportunities.

         <title>A Facile &#8220;Double&#8208;Catalysts&#8221; Approach to Directionally Fabricate Pyridinic N&#63743;B&#8208;Pair&#8208;Doped Crystal Graphene Nanoribbons/Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The dominantly pyridinic N&#63743;B pair is rationally fabricated on hierarchically structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons/amorphous carbon by a &#8220;double&#8208;catalysts&#8221; strategy. As experiments and density functional theory demonstrated, the pyridinic N&#63743;B plays a key role for the highly catalytic performance (half&#8208;wave potential, 0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, electron transfer number, &#8776;3.94), comparable to commercial Pt/C and superior to most of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. 








Abstract
Carbon material is a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Doping of heteroatoms, the most widely used modulating strategy, has attracted many efforts in the past decade. Despite all this, the catalytic activity of heteroatoms&#8208;modulated carbon is hard to compare to that of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, a &#8220;double&#8208;catalysts&#8221; (Fe salt, H3BO3) strategy is presented to directionally fabricate porous structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons (GNs)/amorphous carbon doped by pyridinic N&#63743;B pairs. The porous structure and GNs accelerate ion/mass and electron transport, respectively. The N percentage in pyridinic N&#63743;B pairs accounts for &#8776;80% of all N species. The pyridinic N&#63743;B pair drives the ORR via an almost 4e&#8722; transfer pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and onset potential (0.876 V vs RHE) in the alkaline solution. The ORR catalytic performance of the as&#8208;prepared carbon catalysts approximates commercial Pt/C and outperforms most prior carbon&#8208;based catalysts. The assembled Zn&#8211;air battery exhibits a high peak power density of 94 mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory simulation reveals that the pyridinic N&#63743;B pair possesses the highest catalytic activity among all the potential configurations, due to the highest charge density at C active sites neighboring B, which enhances the interaction strength with the intermediates in the p&#8208;band center.

         <title>Engineering Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking Covalent Organic Frameworks as Pyroptosis Inducers for Boosting Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is constructed by dispersing active sites into the COF backbone. In contrast to their corresponding bulk species, these enzyme&#8208;mimicking COFs can serve as H2O2 homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, thus exhibiting excellent chemodynamic therapy and pyroptosis efficacy, favorable for boosting cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The engineering of a series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs), COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Fe, and COF&#8208;909&#8208;Ni, as pyroptosis inducers, remodeling the tumor microenvironment to boost cancer immunotherapy, is reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that these COFs can serve as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, and they not only exhibit excellent superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;mimicking activity and convert superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) to H2O2 to facilitate H2O2 generation, but also possess outstanding glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;mimicking activity and deplete glutathione (GSH) to alleviate the scavenging of H2O2. Meanwhile, the outstanding photothermal therapy properties of these COFs can accelerate the Fenton&#8208;like ionization process to facilitate their chemodynamic therapy efficiency. One member, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, can robustly induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;dependent pyroptosis and remodel the tumor microenvironment to trigger durable antitumor immunity, thus promoting the response rate of &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint blockade and successfully restraining tumor metastasis and recurrence.

The 3D nanocomposite structure of the plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside LiMetal is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
The 3D nanocomposite structure of plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside amorphous Li matrix, is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. With ether&#8208;based DOLDME&#8208;LiTFSI electrolyte, LiF and Li2O nanocrystals are formed and embedded in a thin but tough amorphous polymer in the SEI exoskeleton. The fast Li&#8208;stripping directions are along [1&#175;10] or [121&#175;], which produces eight exposed {111} planes at halfway charging. Full Li stripping produces completely sagging, empty SEI husks that can sustain large bending and buckling, with the smallest bending radius of curvature observed approaching tens of nanometers without apparent damage. In the 2nd round of Li plating, a thin LiBCC sheet first nucleates at the current collector, extends to the top end of the deflated SEI husk, and then expands its thickness. The apparent zero wetting angle between LiBCC and the SEI interior means that the heterogeneous nucleation energy barrier is zero. Due to its complete&#8208;wetting property and chemo&#8208;mechanical stability, the SEI largely prevents further reactions between the Li metal and the electrolyte, which explains the superior performance of Li&#8208;metal batteries with ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, uneven refilling of the SEI husks results in dendrite protrusions and some new SEI formation during the 2nd plating. A strategy to form bigger SEI capsules during the initial cycle with higher energy density than the following cycles enables further enhanced Coulombic efficiency to above 99%.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Lipid Nanotherapeutic Boost for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase III clinical trials of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Here, dual&#8208;targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer. T&#8208;iLNTB boosts chemotherapeutic effect in cancer cells, increases an immunogenic cell death and reprograms tumor myeloid cells, consequently, recruits T cells and boosts responsiveness to immunotherapeutics. T&#8208;iLNTB can become a novel therapeutic modality in cancer.








Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO1) is shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1&#8208;targeted therapeutics can become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1&#8208;inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell&#8208; and cancer cell&#8208;dual targeted HO1&#8208;inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed using RNAi&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles. T&#8208;iLNTB&#8208;mediated HO1&#8208;inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T&#8208;iLNTB induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold&#8208;to&#8208;Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy. Finally, ex vivo study proves that HO1&#8208;inhibition directly affects tumor macrophage differentiation. This study demonstrates the potential of T&#8208;iLNTB as a novel therapeutic modality for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Field Simulations of Tunable Polar Topologies in Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric/Paraelectric Multilayers with Ultrahigh Energy&#8208;Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free ferroelectric/paraelectric trilayers with tunable polar topologies are designed. Relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208;, and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors are achievable by tailoring the topology with diverse dynamics. Ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage density above 170 J cm&#8211;1 and efficiency of 95% are exhibited in polar vortices. This strategy exemplifies a new paradigm to enhance energy storage via topology engineering.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are emerging energy&#8208;storage components that require both high energy&#8208;storage density and high efficiency. The conventional approach to energy&#8208;storage enhancement is polar nanodomain engineering via chemical modification. Here, a new approach of domain engineering is proposed by exploiting the tunable polar topologies that have been observed recently in ferroelectric/paraelectric multilayer films. Using phase&#8208;field simulations, it is demonstrated that vortex, spiral, and in&#8208;plane polar structures can be stabilized in BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (BFO/STO) multilayers by tailoring the strain state and layer thickness. Various switching dynamics are realized in these polar topologies, resulting in relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208;, and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors, respectively. Ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage densities above 170 J cm&#8722;3 and efficiencies above 95% are achievable in STO/BFO/STO trilayers. This strategy should be generally implementable in other multilayer dielectrics and offers a new avenue to enhancing energy storage by tuning the polar topology and thus the polarization characteristics.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Deposited and Patternable Conductive Polymer Thin&#8208;Film Electrodes for Microbial Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive polymer&#8208;based thin&#8208;film coating that significantly enhances biotic current densities in microbial bioelectronic devices is reported. The coating is comprehensively characterized, and low&#8208;cost processing and patterning of the coating and the deposition of different microbial strains on a single substrate are demonstrated. This coating can help advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.








Abstract
Microbial bioelectronic devices integrate naturally occurring or synthetically engineered electroactive microbes with microelectronics. These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic&#8211;abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics is reported. The coating is based on a blend of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) crosslinked with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current&#8208;producing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, this material produces a 178&#8208;fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin&#8208;film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. The chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings are characterized and the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor based microbial sensors are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Crystalline Layers for Printable Direct Conversion X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thick crystalline quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers can be fabricated by a &#8220;hot&#8208;casting&#8221; method yielding an exceptional uniformity. As a result, high performance photodiodes using the quasi&#8208;2D layers are developed on both rigid and flexible substrates that respond sensitively to X&#8208;ray photons. This study paves the path toward printable direct conversion X&#8208;ray imager development.








Abstract
Polycrystalline perovskite film&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector is an appealing technology for assembling large scale imager by printing methods. However, thick crystalline layer without trap and solvent residual is challenging to fabricate. Here, the authors report a solution method to produce high quality quasi&#8208;2D perovskite crystalline layers and detectors that are suitable for X&#8208;ray imaging. By introducing n&#8208;butylamine iodide into methylammonium lead iodide precursor and coating at elevated temperatures, compact and crystalline layers with exceptional uniformity are obtained on both rigid and flexible substrates. Photodiodes built with the quasi&#8208;2D layers exhibit a low dark current and stable operation under constant electrical field over 96 h in dark, and over 15 h under X&#8208;ray irradiation. The detector responds sensitively under X&#8208;ray, delivering a high sensitivity of 1214&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a sensitivity gain is observed when operated under higher fields. Finally, high resolution images are demonstrated using a single pixel device that can resolve 80&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m features. This work paves the path for printable direct conversion X&#8208;ray imager development.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Storing DNA&#8208;Based Nanocomplex for Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanocomplex incorporating persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles is prepared, which realizes tumor&#8208;site glutathione&#8208;activating photodynamic therapy (PDT) of breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. Laser&#8208;free PDT is specifically initiated in the glutathione&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells and completes in a way of self&#8208;supplying O2 and self&#8208;irradiating.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic strategy that is dependent on external light irradiation that faces a major challenge in cancer treatment due to the poor tissue&#8208;penetration depths of light irradiation. Herein, a DNA nanocomplex that integrates persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) is developed, which realizes tumor&#8208;site glutathione&#8208;activated PDT for breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. The scaffold of the nanocomplex is AS1411&#8208;aptamer&#8208;encoded ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA chain with two functions: i) providing sufficient intercalation sites for the photosensitizer, and ii) recognizing nucleolin that specifically overexpresses on the surface of cancer cells. The PLNPs in the nanocomplex are energy&#8208;charged to act as a self&#8208;illuminant and coated with a shell of MnO2 for blocking energy degradation. In response to the overexpressed glutathione in cancer cells, the MnO2 shell decomposes to provide Mn2+ to catalytically produce O2, which is essential to PDT. Meanwhile, PLNPs are released and act as a self&#8208;illuminant to activate the photosensitizer to convert O2 into cytotoxic 1O2. Significant tumor inhibition effects are demonstrated in breast tumor xenograft models without exogenous laser excitation. It is envisioned that a laser&#8208;excitation&#8208;free PDT strategy enabled by the PLNP&#8211;DNA nanocomplex promotes the development of PDT and provides a new local therapeutic approach.

&lt;p&gt;A DNA nanocomplex incorporating persistent-luminescence nanoparticles is prepared, which realizes tumor-site glutathione-activating photodynamic therapy (PDT) of breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. Laser-free PDT is specifically initiated in the glutathione-overexpressed tumor cells and completes in a way of self-supplying O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and self-irradiating.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ternary Perovskite&#8211;Organic Solar Cells</title>

Ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells based on 2D:3D perovskites incorporated with n&#8208;type low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap conjugated organic molecules exhibit power conversion efficiency over 23%, and dramatically enhanced stability and diminished photocurrent hysteresis are demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells in which 2D perovskites are incorporated within a 3D perovskite network exhibit improved stability with respect to purely 3D systems, but lower record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Here, a breakthrough is reported in achieving enhanced PCEs, increased stability, and suppressed photocurrent hysteresis by incorporating n&#8208;type, low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap conjugated organic molecules into 2D:3D mixed perovskite composites. The resulting ternary perovskite&#8211;organic composites display extended absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region, improved film morphology, enlarged crystallinity, balanced charge transport, efficient photoinduced charge transfer, and suppressed counter&#8208;ion movement. As a result, the ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells exhibit PCEs over 23%, which are among the best PCEs for perovskite solar cells with p&#8211;i&#8211;n device structure. Moreover, the ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells possess dramatically enhanced stability and diminished photocurrent hysteresis. All these results demonstrate that the strategy of exploiting ternary perovskite&#8211;organic composite thin films provides a facile way to realize high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A Tissue Adhesion&#8208;Controllable and Biocompatible Small&#8208;Scale Hydrogel Adhesive Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible small&#8208;scale adhesive robot is developed by using hydrogels of different Young's moduli with octopus&#8208;inspired micropatterns. The robot can continuously and efficiently conduct biomedical functions in underwater environment due to controllable wet tissue adhesion.








Abstract
Recently, the realization of minimally invasive medical interventions on targeted tissues using wireless small&#8208;scale medical robots has received an increasing attention. For effective implementation, such robots should have a strong adhesion capability to biological tissues and at the same time easy controlled detachment should be possible, which has been challenging. To address such issue, a small&#8208;scale soft robot with octopus&#8208;inspired hydrogel adhesive (OHA) is proposed. Hydrogels of different Young's moduli are adapted to achieve a biocompatible adhesive with strong wet adhesion by preventing the collapse of the octopus&#8208;inspired patterns during preloading. Introduction of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel for dome&#8208;like protuberance structure inside the sucker wall of polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogel provides a strong tissue attachment in underwater and at the same time enables easy detachment by temperature changes due to its temperature&#8208;dependent volume change property. It is finally demonstrated that the small&#8208;scale soft OHA robot can efficiently implement biomedical functions owing to strong adhesion and controllable detachment on biological tissues while operating inside the body. Such robots with repeatable tissue attachment and detachment possibility pave the way for future wireless soft miniature robots with minimally invasive medical interventions.

         <title>In Situ Carbon Corrosion and Cu Leaching as a Strategy for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Multimetal Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in multimetal electrocatalysts can effectively boost catalytic activity with a low overpotential. More importantly, by placing a single particle on a nanoelectrode, structural changes during electrocatalysis can be directly evaluated, providing in&#8208;depth understanding for the catalyst's excellent OER performance.








Abstract
The number of active sites and their intrinsic activity are key factors in designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesis, properties, and in&#8208;depth characterization of a homogeneous CoNiFeCu catalyst are reported, demonstrating that multimetal synergistic effects improve the OER kinetics and the intrinsic activity. In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the OER lead to an enhanced electrochemically active surface area, providing favorable conditions for improved electronic interaction between the constituent metals. After activation, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity with a low overpotential of 291.5&#160;&#177; 0.5&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 43.9 mV dec&#8722;1. It shows superior stability compared to RuO2 in 1 m KOH, which is even preserved for 120 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 in 7 m KOH at 50&#160;&#176;C. Single particles of this CoNiFeCu after their placement on nanoelectrodes combined with identical location transmission electron microscopy before and after applying cyclic voltammetry are investigated. The improved catalytic performance is due to surface carbon corrosion and Cu leaching. The proposed catalyst design strategy combined with the unique single&#8208;nanoparticle technique contributes to the development and characterization of high&#8208;performance catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.

         <title>Bistability, Remanence, Read/Write&#8208;Memory, and Logic Gate Function via a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hysteresis of a thermally responsive polymer is shown to lead to bistability and remanence. This is used to write information on thin&#8208;layer displays using lasers or simple pens. The states can additionally be switched by pH, enabling an AND logic gate function. An unusual memory state allows encoded information to be hidden.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials change their state in response to external triggers. Switching between different states enables information to be written, stored, and read, if the transition between the states exhibits hysteresis. Thermally responsive polymers exhibit an intrinsic hysteresis for the volume phase transition between the swollen and de&#8208;swollen solution state. Here, it is shown that this hysteresis can be used to realize bistability, remanence, and reversible write/read information storage. This is demonstrated for the simplest and most widely used thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), as well as for PNIPAM block copolymers, which widens the hysteresis window. The hysteresis is shown to be related to cluster domain assembly/disassembly during the phase transition. Information can be written thermally using a laser, or using heated or cooled pen tips on a thin&#8208;film backscattering display. The bistable state can additionally be switched by pH, enabling an AND logic gate function. Furthermore, an unusual memory state is discovered, where information is visible in the hysteresis window and invisible at higher temperatures, allowing encoded information to be hidden. Since hysteresis is a very common intrinsic phenomenon for responsive materials, this principle to encode and store information is potentially applicable to a broad range of responsive materials.

         <title>Transforming the Chemical Structure and Bio&#8208;Nano Activity of Doxorubicin by Ultrasound for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasonic transformation of doxorubicin into a tumor selective nanodrug is presented. The nanodrug maintains the antiproliferative activity against several cancer cell lines without being toxic to healthy cells as verified in 2D/3D coculture. The nanodrug associates with lipid rafts on mitochondria membranes to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. In vivo study reveals accumulation of the nanodrug in the lung.








Abstract
Reconfiguring the structure and selectivity of existing chemotherapeutics represents an opportunity for developing novel tumor&#8208;selective drugs. Here, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the use of high&#8208;frequency sound waves is demonstrated to transform the nonselective anthracycline doxorubicin into a tumor selective drug molecule. The transformed drug self&#8208;aggregates in water to form &#8776;200&#160;nm nanodrugs without requiring organic solvents, chemical agents, or surfactants. The nanodrugs preferentially interact with lipid rafts in the mitochondria of cancer cells. The mitochondrial localization of the nanodrugs plays a key role in inducing reactive oxygen species mediated selective death of breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and drug&#8208;resistant cell lines. Only marginal cytotoxicity (80&#8211;100% cell viability) toward fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes is observed, even after administration of high doses of the nanodrug (25&#8211;40&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1). Penetration, cytotoxicity, and selectivity of the nanodrugs in tumor&#8208;mimicking tissues are validated by using a 3D coculture of cancer and healthy cells and 3D cell&#8208;collagen constructs in a perfusion bioreactor. The nanodrugs exhibit tropism for lung and limited accumulation in the liver and spleen, as suggested by in vivo biodistribution studies. The results highlight the potential of this approach to transform the structure and bioactivity of anticancer drugs and antibiotics bearing sono&#8208;active moieties.

         <title>High&#8208;Z&#8208;Sensitized Radiotherapy Synergizes with the Intervention of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway for In Situ Tumor Vaccination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radiosensitizer (physcion&#8208;encapsulated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified layered gadolinium hydroxide (Phy@PLGdH) nanosheets) is developed to amplify radiation&#8208;therapy (RT)&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage for potent immunogenic tumor cell death. The results show that Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT yields great in situ tumor vaccination and obviously primes CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity.








Abstract
In situ tumor vaccination is preliminarily pursued to strengthen antitumor immune response. Immunogenic tumor cell death spontaneously releases abundant antigens and adjuvants for activation of dendritic cells, providing a paragon opportunity for establishing efficient in situ vaccination. Herein, Phy@PLGdH nanosheets are constructed by integrating physcion (Phy, an inhibitor of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) with layered gadolinium hydroxide (PLGdH) nanosheets to boost radiation&#8208;therapy (RT)&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for potent in situ tumor vaccination. It is first observed that sheet&#8208;like PLGdH can present superior X&#8208;ray deposition and tumor penetrability, exhibiting improved radiosensitization in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the destruction of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and nucleotide homeostasis by Phy&#8208;mediated PPP intervention can further amplify PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage, which correspondingly results in effective ICD and enhance the immunogenicity of irradiated tumor cells. Consequently, Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT successfully primes robust CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity to potentiate checkpoint blockade immunotherapies against primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Epitaxial Ferroelectric Oxide Nanospring with Super&#8208;Scalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxial oxide nanosprings are fabricated by etching sacrificial layer. La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 nanosprings can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometry limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain switching associated with highly coupled strain and polarization provides the tolerance for shape deformation and the energy for recovery.








Abstract
Oxide nanosprings have attracted many research interests because of their anticorrosion, high&#8208;temperature tolerance, oxidation resistance, and enhanced&#8208;mechanic&#8208;response from unique helix structures, enabling various applications like nanomanipulators, nanomotors, nanoswitches, sensors, and energy harvesters. However, preparing oxide nanosprings is a challenge for their intrinsic lack of elasticity. Here, an approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled, epitaxial, ferroelectric nanosprings with built&#8208;in strain due to the lattice mismatch in freestanding La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 (LSMO/BTO) bilayer heterostructures is developed. It is found that these LSMO/BTO nanosprings can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometrical limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under co&#8208;existing axial and shear strains. In addition, the oxide heterostructural springs exhibit strong resilience due to the limited plastic deformation nature and the built&#8208;in strain between the bilayers. This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nanosprings that can be applied to various technologies.

         <title>Scalable Growth of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films via an Orientation Filter Funnel for High&#8208;Performance Transistors with Excellent Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new orientation filter funnel method is developed for scalable growth of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) with singly orientated crystals. This approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic axis and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of OSCFs. The obtained OSCFs show 4.5&#8208;fold enhanced mobility and excellent uniformity with mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%.








Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. However, crystallization of organic films is normally governed by stochastic nucleation and incoherent growth, posing a formidable challenge to grow large&#8208;sized OSCFs. Here, an &#8220;orientation filter funnel&#8221; concept is presented for the scalable growth of OSCFs with well&#8208;aligned, singly orientated crystals. By rationally designing solvent wetting/dewetting patterns on the substrate, this approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic orientation and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of large&#8208;area OSCFs. As a result, this unique concept for crystal growth not only enhances the average mobility of organic film by 4.5&#8208;fold but also improves its uniformity of electrical properties, with a low mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%, the new lowest record among organic devices. The method offers a general and scalable route to produce OSCFs toward real&#8208;word electronic applications.

         <title>Achieving Remarkable Charge Density via Self&#8208;Polarization of Polar High&#8208;k Material in a Charge&#8208;Excitation Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization effect is found under charge excitation, which significantly improves the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). This work provides a new strategy to enhance the dielectric properties of polar dielectric materials, and the realization of high charge density provides a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;output TENGs toward various applications.








Abstract
Boosting output charge density is top priority for achieving high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The charge&#8208;excitation strategy is demonstrated to be a superior approach to acquire high output charge density. Meanwhile, the molecular charge behaviors in the dielectric under a strong electric field from high charge density bring new physics that are worth exploring. Here, a rapid self&#8208;polarization effect of a polar dielectric material by the superhigh electric field in a charge&#8208;excitation TENG is reported, by which the permittivity of the polar dielectric material realizes self&#8208;increase to a saturation, and thus enhances the output charge density. Consequently, an ultrahigh charge density of 3.53 mC m&#8722;2 is obtained with 7&#160;&#181;m homemade lead zirconate titanate&#8722;poly(vinylidene fluoride) composite film in the atmosphere with 5% relative humidity, which is the highest charge density for TENGs with high durability currently. This work provides new guidance for dielectric material optimization under charge excitation to boost the output performance of TENGs toward practical applications.

         <title>Alternate Storage of Opposite Charges in Multisites for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Al&#8211;MOF Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges in multisite is demonstrated in a 2D Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) cathode to achieve a high energy density for Al&#8211;MOF batteries. The MOF can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which doubles the capacity compared with the storage of the same charge in one active site.








Abstract
The limited active sites of cathode materials in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries restrict the storage of more large&#8208;sized Al&#8208;complex ions, leading to a low celling of theoretical capacity. To make the utmost of active sites, an alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges (AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations) in multisites is proposed herein to achieve an ultrahigh capacity in Al&#8211;metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) battery. The bipolar ligands (oxidized from 18&#960; to 16&#960; electrons and reduced from 18&#960; to 20&#960; electrons in a planar cyclic conjugated system) can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which can double the capacity of unipolar ligands. Moreover, the high&#8208;density active Cu sites (Cu nodes) in the 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF can also store AlCl2+ cations for a higher capacity. The rigid and extended MOF structure can address the problems of high solubility and poor stability of small organic molecules. As a result, three&#8208;step redox reactions with two&#8208;electron transfer in each step are demonstrated in charge/discharge processes, achieving high reversible capacity (184 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (177&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) of the optimized cathode in an Al&#8211;MOF battery. The findings provide a new insight for the rational design of stable high&#8208;energy Al&#8211;MOF batteries.

         <title>Enabling Fast Na+ Transfer Kinetics in the Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Region of Hard&#8208;Carbon Anodes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast sodium storage in the whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;region is realized by rational manipulation of the microstructure of hard carbons (HCs) using a ZnO&#8208;assisted bulk etching strategy. It is revealed that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p&#8208;band center, respectively, which can be balanced by manipulating the physical parameters of HCs.








Abstract
Efficient electrode materials, that combine high power and high energy, are the crucial requisites of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), which have unwrapped new possibilities in the areas of grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Hard carbons (HCs) are considered as the leading candidate anode materials for SIBs, however, the primary challenge of slow charge&#8208;transfer kinetics at the low potential region (&lt;0.1&#160;V) remains unresolved till date, and the underlying structure&#8211;performance correlation is under debate. Herein, ultrafast sodium storage in the whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;region (0.01&#8211;2&#160;V), with the Na+ diffusion coefficient enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude (&#8776;10&#8211;7 cm2 s&#8211;1) through rationally deploying the physical parameters of HCs using a ZnO&#8208;assisted bulk etching strategy is reported. It is unveiled that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p&#8208;band center, respectively, and balance of Ea and Eb is critical in enhancing the charge&#8208;storage kinetics. The charge&#8208;storage mechanism in HCs is evidenced through comprehensive in(ex) situ techniques. The as prepared HCs microspheres deliver a record high rate performance of 107 mAh g&#8211;1 @ 50 A g&#8211;1 and unprecedented electrochemical performance at extremely low temperature (426 mAh g&#8211;1 @ &#8722;40 &#176;C).

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Photosensitizable Bacterial Cellulose as Engineered Living Material for Skin Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitizable bacterial cellulose is obtained via direct microbial metabolism biosynthesis for wound repair in vivo with effective antibacterial functions.








Abstract
Living materials based on bacterial cellulose (BC) represent a natural and promising candidate for wound dressing. Both physical adsorption and chemical methods have been applied to BC for realizing antibacterial function. However, effective and long&#8208;lasting incorporation of bactericidal moieties to BC remains challenging. Herein, a Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans&#8208;based direct synthetic method to fabricate photosensitizer&#8208;grafted BC through&#160;in situ&#160;bacterial metabolism in the presence of TPEPy&#8208;modified glucose is explored. The results verify that the direct biosynthesis method is efficient and convenient to endow BC with outstanding fluorescence and light&#8208;triggered photodynamic bactericidal activity for skin wound repair. This work presents a new approach to fabricate eco&#8208;friendly and active wound dressing with light&#8208;controlled bactericidal activity by microbial metabolism. The successful modification of the glucose carbon source of microorganisms also offers insights for biosyntheses of other living materials through microbial metabolism.

A single&#8208;atom W&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet&#8202;@&#8202;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) is synthesized, as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The introduction of single&#8208;atom W causes the delocalization of the Ni spin states, which increases the Ni d&#8208;electronic states and optimizes the H* adsorption kinetics, significantly reducing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (O* to OOH*). 








Abstract
Developing robust and highly active non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) is crucial for the industrialization of hydrogen energy. In this study, a highly active and durable single&#8208;atom W&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet&#8202;@&#8202;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) electrocatalyst is prepared. W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the HER and OER with ultralow overpotentials (39 and 106&#160;mV for the HER and 171 and 239&#160;mV for the OER at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively) and excellent long&#8208;term durability (500 h), outperforming commercial precious&#8208;metal catalysts and many other previously reported transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based compounds (TMCs). The introduction of single&#8208;atom W delocalizes the spin state of Ni, which results in an increase in the Ni d&#8208;electron density. This causes the optimization of the adsorption/desorption process of H and a significant reduction in the adsorption free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (O* &#8594; OOH*), thus accelerating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HER and OER. This work provides a rational feasible strategy to design single&#8208;atom catalysts for water splitting and to develop advanced TMC electrocatalysts by regulating delocalized spin states.

The introduction of single-atom W causes the delocalization of the Ni spin states, which increases the Ni d-electronic states and optimizes the H* adsorption kinetics, significantly reducing the energy barrier for the rate-determining step (O* to OOH*).

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Structure in Aqueous Electrolyte via Dynamic Water Intercalation/Deintercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To stabilize the layered structure in aqueous electrolyte, Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t is developed to mitigate H+ attack and the adverse phase transition. Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t provides open channels from (001) planes, enabling dynamic water intercalation/deintercalation in the layered structure. With reversible water intercalation/deintercalation, the layered structure is effectively stabilized in aqueous electrolyte, resulting in outstanding cycle performance in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs) with nonflammable feature attract great attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the layered cathode materials (such as LiCoO2) present serious capacity decay in ALIBs. The degradation mechanism of layered cathode materials in ALIBs is still not clear and an effective strategy to improve cycling stability remains a great challenge. In this work, the authors use LiCoO2 as a typical example to investigate its structural degradation in aqueous electrolytes. It is found that H+ insertion accelerated irreversible layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition is the main reason causing structural degradation and fast capacity fading in LiCoO2. Subsequently, Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t with intermediate spin Co3+ is developed to mitigate H+ influence and the adverse phase transition in aqueous electrolyte. It is interesting to discover that reversible water intercalation/deintercalation occurs in the layered structure during charge/discharge, which effectively suppresses the layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition with cycling. Benefiting from the stabilized layered structure, the Li&#8208;excess Li1.08Co0.92O1.92 shows a significantly improved cycling performance in the neutral aqueous electrolyte with a large specific capacity and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising structural regulation strategy for the layered cathode materials, enabling their potential application in ALIBs.

         <title>Synergetic Anion Vacancies and Dense Heterointerfaces into Bimetal Chalcogenide Nanosheet Arrays for Boosting Electrocatalysis Sulfur Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoZn&#8208;S nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces show an outstanding sulfur conversion activity for lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries. DFT calculations reveal that the sulfur vacancies and built&#8208;in interfacial field can promote the formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity. The catalytic sulfur cathode exhibits good electrochemical performance especially under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation.








Abstract
Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenides. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenides in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during the discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn&#8208;S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur&#8208;vacancy and build&#8208;in interfacial field in CoZn&#8208;S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well&#8208;designed 3D nanosheet array structures shorten the ion&#8208;transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn&#8208;S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the built&#8208;in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity.

A self&#8208;assembled CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/shell nanoplatelets&#8208;whispering gallery mode (WGM) microlaser with ultralow&#8208;threshold, tunable&#8208;wavelength, and excellent photostability is proposed. Both multi&#8208; and single&#8208;mode high quality factor WGM lasing are achieved with ultralow thresholds. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.








Abstract
The realization of efficient on&#8208;chip microlasers with scalable fabrication, ultralow threshold, and stable single&#8208;frequency operation is always desired for a wide range of miniaturized photonic systems. Herein, an effective way to fabricate nanostructures&#8208; whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) lasers by drop&#8208;casting CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/buffer&#8208;shell@graded&#8208;shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) dispersion onto silica microspheres is presented. Benefiting from the excellent gain properties from the interface engineered core/hybrid shell NPLs and high&#8208;quality factor WGM resonator from excellent optical field confinement, the proposed room&#8208;temperature NPLs&#8208;WGM microlasers show a record&#8208;low lasing threshold of 3.26 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 under nanosecond laser pumping among all colloidal NPLs&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. The presence of sharp discrete transverse electric&#8208; and magnetic&#8208;mode spikes, the inversely proportional dependence of the free spectra range on microsphere sizes and the polarization anisotropy of laser output represent the first direct experimental evidence for NPLs&#8208;WGM lasing nature, which is verified theoretically by the computed electric&#8208;field distribution inside the microcavity. Remarkably, a stable single&#8208;mode lasing output with an ultralow lasing threshold of 3.84 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 is achieved by the Vernier effect through evanescent field coupling. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogel Self&#8208;Assembled by Monomeric Nucleoside for Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously achieving high strength and injectability in one hydrogel is challenging. A high strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;FA)). Notably, it exhibits excellent biocompatibility, fast biodegradation, antibacterial property, and osteoclast inhibition, making it a potential candidate biomaterial for tooth&#8208;extraction wound healing and tissue engineering.








Abstract
Hydrogels with high mechanical strength and injectability have attracted extensive attention in biomedical and tissue engineering. However, endowing a hydrogel with both properties is challenging because they are generally inversely related. In this work, by constructing a multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system, a high&#8208;strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is successfully fabricated. It is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;FA)) with distilled water/phosphate buffered saline as solvent. Its storage modulus reaches 1 MPa at a concentration of 5.0 wt%, which is the strongest supramolecular hydrogel comprising an ultralow&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW &lt; 300) gelator. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent shear&#8208;thinning injectability, and completes the sol&#8211;gel transition in seconds after injection at 37 &#176;C. The multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system is essentially based on the synergistic interactions between the double NH2 groups, water molecules, and 2&#8242;&#8208;F atoms. Furthermore, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel exhibits excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity. When applied to rat molar extraction sockets, compared to natural healing and the commercial hemorrhage agent gelatin sponge, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel exhibits faster degradation and induces less osteoclastic activity and inflammatory infiltration, resulting in more complete bone healing. In summary, this study provides ideas for proposing a multifunctional, high&#8208;strength, and injectable supramolecular hydrogel for various biomedical engineering applications.

         <title>Electrically Programmable Interfacial Adhesion for Ultrastrong Hydrogel Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroadhesion strategy capable of realizing ultrastrong and universal hydrogel bonding in an electrically programmable way is reported. With the synergistic effect of electric fields and entropy on hydrated ion diffusion, its peak adhesive strength can reach 1.2&#160;MPa. Further, a mechanoelectric coupling model is established to determine directional diffusion of the ions and resultant smart electroadhesion.








Abstract
Adjustable interfacial adhesion is of great significance in smart&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;related engineering fields. This study presents an electroadhesion strategy for universal and ultrastrong hydrogel bonding with electrically programmable strength. An ionic hydrogel containing lithium ions is designed to achieve hydrated&#8208;ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, where external electric fields are employed to precisely control spatiotemporal dynamics of the ion diffusion across ionic adhesion region (IAR). The hydrogel can realize a universal, ultrastrong, efficient, tough, reversible, and environmentally tolerant electroadhesion to diverse hydrogels, whose peak adhesion strength and interfacial adhesion toughness are as high as 1.2&#160;MPa and 3750 J m&#8722;2, respectively. With a mechanoelectric coupling model, the dominant role of the hydrated ions in IAR played in the interfacial electroadhesion is further quantitatively revealed. The proposed strategy opens a door for developing high&#8208;performance adhesion hydrogels with electrically programmable functions, which are indispensable for various emerging fields like flexible electronics and soft robotics.

         <title>A Fully Flexible Intelligent Thermal Touch Panel Based on Intrinsically Plastic Ag2S Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully flexible intelligent thermal touch panel based on the intrinsically plastic Ag2S semiconductor can well perceive finger touch signals in real&#8208;time and displays intelligent feed back of Chinese characters and letters on an app.








Abstract
Wearable touch panels, a typical flexible electronic device, can recognize and feed back the information of finger touch and movement. Excellent wearable touch panels are required to accurately and quickly monitor the signals of finger movement as well as the capacity of bearing various types of deformation. High&#8208;performance thermistor materials are one of the key functional components, but to date, a long&#8208;standing bottleneck is that inorganic semiconductors are typically brittle while the electrical properties of organic semiconductors are quite low. Herein, a high&#8208;performance flexible temperature sensor is reported by using plastic Ag2S with ultrahigh temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8722;4.7% K&#8722;1 and resolution of 0.05 K, and rapid response/recovery time of 0.11/0.11 s. Moreover, the temperature sensor shows excellent durability without performance damage or loss during force stimuli tests. In addition, a fully flexible intelligent touch panel composed of a 16 &#215; 10 Ag2S&#8208;film&#8208;based temperature sensor array, as well as a flexible printed circuit board and a deep&#8208;learning algorithm is designed for perceiving finger touch signals in real&#8208;time, and intelligent feedback of Chinese characters and letters on an app. These results strongly show that high&#8208;performance flexible inorganic semiconductors can be widely used in flexible electronics.

         <title>Heterometallic Benzenehexathiolato Coordination Nanosheets: Periodic Structure Improves Crystallinity and Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of copper and nickel ions in 2D coordination nanosheets based on benzenehexathiolato&#8208;metal complex motifs induces a periodic in&#8208;plane metal arrangement and a bilayer structure. This heterometallicity affords improved film crystallinity and thus higher electrical conductivities in comparison with the pristine ones, reaching up to 1300 S cm&#8722;1. This strategy expands the variation and function of coordination nanomaterials.








Abstract
Coordination nanosheets are an emerging class of 2D, bottom&#8208;up materials having fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, planar, graphite&#8208;like structures with high electrical conductivities. Since their discovery, great effort has been devoted to expand the variety of coordination nanosheets; however, in most cases, their low crystallinity in thick films hampers practical device applications. In this study, mixtures of nickel and copper ions are employed to fabricate benzenehexathiolato (BHT)&#8208;based coordination nanosheet films, and serendipitously, it is found that this heterometallicity preferentially forms a structural phase with improved film crystallinity. Spectroscopic and scattering measurements provide evidence for a bilayer structure with in&#8208;plane periodic arrangement of copper and nickel ions with the NiCu2BHT formula. Compared with homometallic films, heterometallic films exhibit more crystalline microstructures with larger and more oriented grains, achieving higher electrical conductivities reaching metallic behaviors. Low dependency of Seebeck coefficient on the mixing ratio of nickel and copper ions supports that the large variation in the conductivity data is not caused by change in the intrinsic properties of the films. The findings open new pathways to improve crystallinity and to tune functional properties of 2D coordination nanosheets.

         <title>Artificial Heterogeneous Interphase Layer with Boosted Ion Affinity and Diffusion for Na/K&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>

Long&#8208;life Na&#8208;metal and K&#8208;metal batteries are realized by development of a heterogeneous protective layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and Na2S (K2S) on the surface of Na (K) foil. Such layer possesses the advantages of excellent sodiophilicity/potassiophilicity, high Young's modulus, and high ionic conductivity, inhibiting the dendrite growth during the repeated Na (K) plating/stripping.








Abstract
Metallic Na (K) are considered a promising anode materials for Na&#8208;metal and K&#8208;metal batteries because of their high theoretical capacity, low electrode potential, and abundant resources. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) is introduced on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K). Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that a heterogeneous Na2S/V (K2S/V) protective layer can effectively improve Na (K)&#8208;ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics, inhibiting the growth of Na (K) dendrites during Na (K) plating/stripping. Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na2S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, and the K2S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na3V2(PO4)3||Na2S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 and a high power density of 23.5&#160;kW kg&#8211;1. The achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation of Hydrogel Actuators by Autocatalytic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators made of polyacrylamide bilayer hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks are controlled by an autocatalytic front of thiols. This regulation enables an autonomous sequential actuation, gradual unrolling, and screwing. In addition, these actuators can activate each other in a relay fashion or switch an electrical circuit.








Abstract
Regulating hydrogel actuators with chemical reaction networks is instrumental for constructing life&#8208;inspired smart materials. Herein, hydrogel actuators are engineered that are regulated by the autocatalytic front of thiols. The actuators consist of two layers. The first layer, which is regular polyacrylamide hydrogel, is in a strained conformation. The second layer, which is polyacrylamide hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks, maintains strain in the first layer. When thiols released by the autocatalytic front reduce disulfide crosslinks, the hydrogel actuates by releasing the mechanical strain in the first layer. The autocatalytic front is sustained by the reaction network, which uses thiouronium salts, disulfides of &#946;&#8208;aminothiols, and maleimide as starting components. The gradual actuation by the autocatalytic front enables movements such as gradual unrolling, screwing, and sequential closing of &#8220;fingers.&#8221; This actuation also allows the transmission of chemical signals in a relay fashion and the conversion of a chemical signal to an electrical signal. Locations and times of spontaneous initiation of autocatalytic fronts can be preprogrammed in the spatial distribution of the reactants in the hydrogel. To approach the functionality of living matter, the actuators triggered by an autocatalytic front can be integrated into smart materials regulated by chemical circuits.

         <title>Star&#8208;Polymer&#8211;DNA Gels Showing Highly Predictable and Tunable Mechanical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA gels with predictable mechanical responses are developed using a star&#8208;polymer strategy and a pair of presimulated DNA sequences. The macroscopic stress&#8208;relaxation time of the DNA gel is connected directly to the microscopic lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over an extended time range from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. In addition, the DNA gels are spatially homogeneous, hysteresis&#8208;less, and self&#8208;healable.








Abstract
Dynamically crosslinked gels are appealing materials for applications that require time&#8208;dependent mechanical responses. DNA duplexes are ideal crosslinkers for building such gels because of their excellent sequence addressability and flexible tunability in bond energy. However, the mechanical responses of most DNA gels are complicated and unpredictable. Here, a DNA gel with a highly homogeneous gel network and well predictable mechanical behaviors is demonstrated by using a pair of star&#8208;polymer&#8211;DNA precursors with presimulated DNA sequences showing the two&#8208;state transition. The melting curve analysis of the DNA gels reveals the good correspondence between the thermodynamic potentials of the DNA crosslinkers and the presimulated values by DNA calculators. Stress&#8208;relaxation tests and dissociation kinetics measurements show that the macroscopic relaxation time of the DNA gels is approximately equal to the lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over 4 orders of magnitude from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. Furthermore, a series of durability tests find the DNA gels are hysteresis&#8208;less and self&#8208;healable after the applications of repeated temperature and mechanical stimuli. These results demonstrate the great potential of star&#8208;polymer&#8211;DNA precursors for building gels with predictable and tunable viscoelastic properties, suitable for applications such as stress&#8208;response extracellular matrices, injectable solids, and soft robotics.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Changing DNA&#8208;Linked Nanoparticle Films Dictated by Lateral and Vertical Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of top&#8208;down plasmonic photopatterning and bottom&#8208;up DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly is used to fabricate free&#8208;standing nanoparticle films encoded with instructions for dynamic shape changes. The distinct plasmonic properties of the incorporated nanoparticles enable on&#8208;demand lateral patterning with 3D selectivity, which, in turn, allows for fine control over the structure and morphing actions of DNA&#8208;linked nanoparticle films.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale building blocks into complex nanostructures with controlled structural anisotropy can open up new opportunities for realizing active nanomaterials exhibiting spatiotemporal structural transformations. Here, a combination of bottom&#8208;up DNA&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly and top&#8208;down photothermal patterning is adopted to fabricate free&#8208;standing nanoparticle films with vertical and lateral heterogeneity. This approach involves the construction of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticle films by DNA&#8208;directed layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly, followed by on&#8208;demand lateral patterning by the direct photothermal writing method. The distinct plasmonic properties of nanospheres and nanorods constituting the multidomain films enable photopatterning in a selective domain with precisely controlled vertical depths. The photopatterned films exhibit complex morphing actions instructed by the lateral and vertical patterns inscribed in the film as well as the information carried in DNA.

Inspired by the structural&#8208;color change behavior of soap bubbles, a novel biomimetic 3D human lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip microsystem, which allows for visual sensing and real&#8208;time monitoring of cellular mechanics, is presented.

Abstract
Lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models hold great promise for disease modeling and drug screening. Herein, inspired by the iridescence phenomenon of soap bubbles, a novel biomimetic 3D microphysiological lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system with breathing visualization is presented. The system, with an array of pulmonary alveoli at the physiological scale, is constructed and coated with structural color materials. Cyclic deformation is induced by regular airflow, resembling the expansion and contraction of the alveoli during rhythmic breathing. As the deformation is accompanied with corresponding synchronous shifts in the structural color, the constructed system offers self&#8208;reporting of the cell mechanics and enables real&#8208;time monitoring of the cultivation process. Using this system, the dynamic relationships between the color atlas and disease symptoms, showing the essential role of mechanical stretching in the phenotypes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are investigated. These features make this human lung system ideal in biological study, disease monitoring, and drug discovery.

Cyclic deformation is induced by regular airflow, resembling the expansion and contraction of the alveoli during rhythmic breathing. As the deformation is accompanied with corresponding synchronous shifts in the structural color, the constructed system offers self-reporting of the cell mechanics and enables real-time monitoring of the cultivation process. Using this system, the dynamic relationships between the color atlas and disease symptoms, showing the essential role of mechanical stretching in the phenotypes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are investigated. These features make this human lung system ideal in biological study, disease monitoring, and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrical Tuning of Plasmonic Conducting Polymer Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically tunable conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) polymer nano&#8208;optical antennas are reported. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, gradual electrical tuning of their nano&#8208;optical response is demonstrated. This work opens for electrically tunable metasurfaces and takes important steps toward applications ranging from tunable flat metalenses and holograms to adaptable smart windows.








Abstract
Nanostructures of conventional metals offer manipulation of light at the nanoscale but are largely limited to static behavior due to fixed material properties. To develop the next frontier of dynamic nano&#8208;optics and metasurfaces, this study utilizes the redox&#8208;tunable optical properties of conducting polymers, as recently shown to be capable of sustaining plasmons in their most conducting oxidized state. Electrically tunable conducting polymer nano&#8208;optical antennas are presented, using nanodisks of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) (PEDOT:Sulf) as a model system. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, the concept enables gradual electrical tuning of the nano&#8208;optical response, which was&#160;found to be related to the modulation of both density and mobility of the mobile polaronic charge carriers in the polymer. The resonance position of the PEDOT:Sulf nanoantennas can be conveniently controlled by disk size, here reported down to a wavelength of around 1270 nm. The presented concept may be used for electrically tunable metasurfaces, with tunable farfield as well as nearfield. The work thereby opens for applications ranging from tunable flat meta&#8208;optics to adaptable smart windows.

         <title>Realizing 19.05% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells by Progressively Improving Charge Extraction and Suppressing Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progressive improvement of charge extraction and suppression of charge recombination by side&#8208;chain engineering of Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), employing a ternary blend and introducing a volatilizable solid additive, fine&#8208;tunes the electronic properties of the NFAs and optimizes the morphology of the active layer and contributes to a record power conversion efficiency of 19.05% for single&#8208;junction polymer solar cells.








Abstract
Improving charge extraction and suppressing charge recombination are critically important to minimize the loss of absorbed photons and improve the device performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, highly efficient PSCs are demonstrated by progressively improving the charge extraction and suppressing the charge recombination through the combination of side&#8208;chain engineering of new nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), adopting ternary blends, and introducing volatilizable solid additives. The 2D side chains on BTP&#8208;Th induce a certain steric hindrance for molecular packing and phase separation, which is mitigated by fluorination of side chains on BTP&#8208;FTh. Moreover, by introducing two highly crystalline molecules as the second acceptor and volatilizable solid additive, respectively, into the BTP&#8208;FTh&#8208;based host blend, the molecular crystallinity is significantly improved and the blend morphology is finely optimized. As expected, enhanced charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination are progressively realized, contributing to the largely improved fill factor (FF) of the resultant devices. Accompanied by the enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% is realized finally.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Amorphous Interfaces Coupling of CoSe2/CoP with Optimized d&#8208;Band Center and Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline&#8208;amorphous CoSe2/CoP heterojunction is prepared. Thanks to the synergistic&#8208;effect of heterojunction and amorphous structure, the electronic coupling at the interfaces has been significantly strengthened and the d&#8208;band center has been deeply tailored. It optimizes the valence state and the H adsorption of Co and reduces the kinetic barrier of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, achieving excellent HER activity.








Abstract
Amorphous and heterojunction materials have been widely used in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, the current used individual strategy still has limited effects. Hence efficient tailoring tactics with synergistic effect are highly desired. Herein, the authors have realized the deep optimization of catalytic activity by a constructing crystalline&#8211;amorphous CoSe2/CoP heterojunction. Benefiting from the strong electronic coupling at the interfaces, the d&#8208;band center of the material moves further down compared to its crystalline&#8211;crystalline counterpart, optimizing the valence state and the H adsorption of Co and lowering the kinetic barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The heterojunction shows an overpotential of 65&#160;mV to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the acidic medium. Besides, it also shows competitive properties in both neutral and basic media. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the catalytic activity through combining a crystalline and amorphous heterojunction, which can be implemented for other transition metal compound electrocatalysts.

Supramolecular Hydrogels
In article number 2108300, Hang Zhao, Xianglong Han, Qianming Chen, and co&#8208;workers introduce a high&#8208;strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel, which was constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2'&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8208;FA). Notably, it also exhibits excellent biocompatibility, fast biodegradation, antibacterial properties, and osteoclast inhibition, making it a potential candidate biomaterial for tooth&#8208;extraction wound healing and tissue engineering.

Nanosprings
In article number 2108419, Ziyao Zhou, Houbing Huang, Yong Peng, Ming Liu, and co&#8208;workers report freestanding, epitaxial, ferroelectric nanosprings with superscalability, which provide insights regarding mechanical behaviors and domain evolution of ferroelectric oxide springs. The excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under coexisting axial and shear strains. The superstretchable, elastic, and recoverable oxide spring provides a novel platform to flexible electronics.

Solid Electrolyte Interphase
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a critical role in determining the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal anodes. However, viewing the SEI in batteries remains extremely challenging due to its supersensitivity to the electron beam under a microscope. In article number 2108252, Ju Li, Meng Gu, and co&#8208;workers develop an ultralow&#8208;dosage cryo&#8208;TEM protocol to directly visualize the SEI in 3D at different charging states, revealing surprising and fundamentally significant results for the SEI. The optimized chemo&#8208;mechanical properties of the SEI contribute significantly to the superior performances of Li&#8208;metal batteries.

Hydrogel Actuators
Biochemical circuits regulate the movement of living organisms. In article number 2106816,  Sergey N. Semenov and co&#8208;workers use a synthetic chemical reaction network based on thiols to regulate hydrogel actuators. The signal inducing the actuation is propagated by the autocatalytic front of the thiols. It can jump from one actuator to another or be initiated by the chemical circuit with preprogrammed delay.

Immunotherapy
In article number 2106350, Dan Peer and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy to boost chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by using a dual cell&#8208;targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost. With this approach, chemo&#8208;induced immunogenic cancer cell death is increased, tumor myeloid cell is reprogrammed, and cytotoxic T cell is recruited, which consequently improves responsiveness to immunotherapy.

         <title>Theory of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), namely phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts spin selectivity to various electron processes, has long defied a comprehensive theoretical explanation. Here, the status of CISS in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions is reviewed. For each, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding is discussed and remaining challenges are identified.








Abstract
A critical overview of the theory of the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, that is, phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts significant spin selectivity to various electron processes, is provided. Based on discussions in a recently held workshop, and further work published since, the status of CISS effects&#8212;in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions&#8212;is reviewed. For each, a detailed discussion of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding is provided and remaining challenges and research opportunities are identified.

         <title>Cellular Nanosponges for Biological Neutralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely cellular nanosponges, as host cell decoys for biological neutralization applications is reviewed, including their use to neutralize bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. For each area, the design of different cellular nanosponges and their corresponding neutralization functions are discussed.








Abstract
Biological neutralization represents a general strategy that deploys therapeutic agents to bind with harmful molecules or infectious pathogens, block their bioactivity, and thus prevent them from causing the diseases. Here, a comprehensive review of using cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely &#8220;cellular nanosponges,&#8221; as host decoys for a wide range of biological neutralization applications is provided. Compared to traditional neutralization strategies, the cellular nanosponges stand out by mimicking susceptible host cells rather than accommodating the structures of the causative agents for the design of therapeutics. As all pathological agents must interact with host cells for bioactivity, nanosponges bypass the diversity of these agents and create function&#8208;driven and broad&#8208;spectrum neutralization solutions. The review focuses on the recent progress of using this new nanomedicine platform for neutralization against five primary pathological agents, including bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. Existing studies have established cellular nanosponges as versatile tools for biological neutralization. A thorough review of the cellular nanosponge technology is expected to inspire more refined cellular nanosponge designs and unique neutralization applications to address unsolved medical problems.

         <title>Efficiency of Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. An important contribution to the EQE of a PLED orignates from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in a PPV&#8208;based PLED, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.








Abstract
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. The EQE of an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is governed by a number of parameters, such as the electrical efficiency, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the optical outcoupling efficiency and the spin statistics for singlet exciton generation. In the last decade, the electrical efficiency has been determined from a numerical PLED device model. More recently, an optical model to simulate the fraction of photons outcoupled to air for PLEDs with a broad recombination zone has been developed. Together with the directly measured PLQY, the EQE of a PLED can then be estimated. However, it has been observed that the measured EQEs of fluorescent PLEDs, including the model system super&#8208;yellow poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (SY&#8208;PPV) often exceed the expected values. To solve this discrepancy, it is demonstrate that the electrical PLED model has to be expanded by the inclusion of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA), which is shown to be responsible for a substantial EQE enhancement. Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in SY&#8208;PPV PLEDs, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.

         <title>Recent Advances in Oxidation Stable Chemistry of 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review briefly introduces preparation methods, oxidation mechanisms, a comprehensive summarization of factors affecting oxidation and a detailed account of strategies to mitigate MXenes degeneration. It furthermore offers an overview of in situ synthesis MXene derivatives with enhanced performance, and presents perspectives for the challenges and opportunities for the protection and application of MXenes and their derivatives.








Abstract
As an emerging star of 2D nanomaterials, 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, present a large potential in various research areas owing to their intrinsic multilayer structure and intriguing physico&#8208;chemical properties. However, the fabrication and application of functional MXene&#8208;based devices still remain challenging as they are prone to oxidative degradation under ambient environment. Within this review, the preparation methods of MXenes focusing on the recent investigations on their thermal structure&#8211;stability relationships in inert, oxidizing, and aqueous environments are systematically introduced. Moreover, the key factors that affect the oxidation of MXenes, such as, atmosphere, temperature, composition, microstructure, and aqueous environment, are reviewed. Based on different scenarios, strategies for avoiding or delaying the oxidation of MXenes are proposed to encourage the utilization of MXenes in complicated environments, especially at high temperature. Furthermore, the chemistry of MXene&#8208;derived oxides is analyzed, which can offer perspectives on the further design and fabrication of novel 2D composites with the unique structures of MXenes being preserved.
