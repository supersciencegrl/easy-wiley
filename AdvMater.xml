         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Precisely Prescribed Multi&#8208;Prodrug Combination by Engineered Nanocarrier Enables Efficient Individualized Cancer Chemotherapy</title>

Abstract
The limited anticancer drug library and the frequent occurrence of drug resistance have driven monotherapy&#8208;based cancer therapy into a difficult situation. Considering the formidable process of new drug discovery, combination therapy using currently available drugs is a potential alternative. Nevertheless, the barrier between in vitro combination screening and precise in vivo delivery remains insurmountable in the current free drug&#8208; or nanoparticle&#8208;based combination therapy, which substantially hinders the application of combination therapy. Herein, we proposed a novel, precise drug delivery strategy to realize efficient and individualized combination therapy. We engineered nano&#8208;medicine using a microfluidics&#8208;based mixer by combining rationally designed polymeric prodrugs of three commercial chemotherapeutics and a cascade&#8208;responsive block copolymer; the nano&#8208;medicine possessed ratiometric drug loading and synchronized drug release. In addition to quantitative drug loading and precisely controlled drug combination, consistent nano&#8208;properties of these nanoparticles made their in vivo fate predictable. Consequently, tumor growth and metastasis could be effectively inhibited by precisely prescribed nanoparticles derived from in vitro combination screening. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study clearly revealed the feasibility of overcoming the current drug library limitations through precise delivery of any predetermined drug combination, facilitating translational research of individualized combination therapy.

&lt;p&gt;The limited anticancer drug library and the frequent occurrence of drug resistance have driven monotherapy-based cancer therapy into a difficult situation. Considering the formidable process of new drug discovery, combination therapy using currently available drugs is a potential alternative. Nevertheless, the barrier between in vitro combination screening and precise in vivo delivery remains insurmountable in the current free drug- or nanoparticle-based combination therapy, which substantially hinders the application of combination therapy. Herein, we proposed a novel, precise drug delivery strategy to realize efficient and individualized combination therapy. We engineered nano-medicine using a microfluidics-based mixer by combining rationally designed polymeric prodrugs of three commercial chemotherapeutics and a cascade-responsive block copolymer; the nano-medicine possessed ratiometric drug loading and synchronized drug release. In addition to quantitative drug loading and precisely controlled drug combination, consistent nano-properties of these nanoparticles made their in vivo fate predictable.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Lipid Nanotherapeutic Boost for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO1) was shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1&#8208;targeted therapeutics could become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1&#8208;inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell&#8208; and cancer cell&#8208; dual targeted HO1&#8208;inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed using RNAi loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). T&#8208;iLNTB&#8208;mediated HO1 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T&#8208;iLNTB induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold&#8208;to&#8208;Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy. Finally, ex vivo study proves that HO1&#8208;inhibition directly affects tumor macrophage differentiation. This study demonstrates the potential of T&#8208;iLNTB as a novel therapeutic modality for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;Chemo-immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard-of-care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo-immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) was shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1-targeted therapeutics could become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo-immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1-inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell- and cancer cell- dual targeted HO1-inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T-iLNTB) is developed using RNAi loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). T-iLNTB-mediated HO1 inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard-of-care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T-iLNTB induces CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold-to-Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Engineered Nanodecoys for the Multi&#8208;Target Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over&#8208;activated T cells and over&#8208;produced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines form a self&#8208;amplified signaling loop to continuously exacerbate the dysregulated inflammatory response and propel the progression of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). Herein, immuno&#8208;engineered nanodecoys (NDs) based on poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) coated with PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing macrophage membrane (PRM) were developed to mediate multi&#8208;target interruption of the self&#8208;promoted inflammatory cascade in AIDs. PRM collected from IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;treated RAW 264.7 cells possessed elevated surface levels of adhesion molecule receptors and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine receptors, and thus systemically administered PRM NDs afforded higher accumulation level in the inflamed tissues and stronger scavenging efficiency toward multiple pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. More importantly, IFN&#8208;&#947; treatment induced remarkable PD&#8208;L1 expression on PRM, thereby allowing PRM NDs to bind mPD&#8208;1 on CD4+ T cell surfaces or neutralize free sPD&#8208;1, which reconstructed the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory axis to suppress CD4+ T cell activation and restore immune tolerance. As such, PRM NDs provoked potent and cooperative anti&#8208;inflammatory and immune&#8208;suppressive efficacies to alleviate autoimmune damages in Zymosan A&#8208;induced arthritis mice and dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis mice. This study provides an enlightened example for the immuno&#8208;engineering of cell membrane&#8208;based NDs, rendering promising implications into the treatment of AIDs via multi&#8208;target immune&#8208;modulation.

         <title>Toward Exotic Layered Materials: 2D Cuprous Iodide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only a few dozen 2D crystals have been successfully prepared, though many more&#8212;including metal iodides&#8212;are predicted to exist. A major reason for this disparity is their instability under ambient conditions. A wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize 2D&#8208;CuI, stabilizing it by graphene encapsulation in a one&#8208;step process, is designed, and its chemical structure is imaged.








Abstract
Heterostructures composed of 2D materials are already opening many new possibilities in such fields of technology as electronics and magnonics, but far more could be achieved if the number and diversity of 2D materials were&#160;increased. So far, only a few dozen 2D crystals have been extracted from materials that exhibit a layered phase in ambient conditions, omitting entirely the large number of layered materials that may exist at other temperatures and pressures. This work demonstrates how such structures can be stabilized in 2D van der Waals (vdw) stacks under room temperature via growing them directly in graphene encapsulation by using graphene oxide as the template material. Specifically, an ambient stable 2D structure of copper and iodine, a material that normally only occurs in layered form at elevated temperatures between 645 and 675&#160;K, is produced. The results establish a simple route to the production of more exotic phases of materials that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to stabilize for experiments in&#160;ambient.

         <title>Retina&#8208;Inspired Color&#8208;Cognitive Learning via Chromatically Controllable Mixed Quantum Dot Synaptic Transistor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial photonic synapses are emerging as a promising implementation to emulate the human visual cognitive system by consolidating a series of processes for sensing and memorizing visual information into one system. In particular, mimicking retinal functions such as multispectral color perception and controllable nonvolatility is important for realizing artificial visual systems. However, many studies to date have focused on monochromatic light&#8208;based photonic synapses, and thus, the emulation of color discrimination capability remains an important challenge for visual intelligence. Here, we propose an artificial multispectral color recognition system by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of ratio&#8208;controllable mixed quantum dot (mixed QD; M&#8208;QD) photoabsorbers and metal&#8208;oxide semiconducting channels. The biological photoreceptor inspires M&#8208;QD photoabsorbers with a precisely designed red (R), green (G), and blue (B)&#8208;QD ratio, enabling full&#8208;range visible color recognition with high photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion efficiency. In addition, adjustable synaptic plasticity by modulating gate bias allows multiple nonvolatile&#8208;to&#8208;volatile memory conversion, leading to chromatic control in the artificial photonic synapse. To ensure the viability of the developed proof of concept, we demonstrate a 7&#215;7 pixelated photonic synapse array capable of performing outstanding color image recognition based on adjustable wavelength&#8208;dependent volatility conversion.

Here, we propose an artificial multispectral color recognition system by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of ratio-controllable mixed quantum dot (mixed QD; M-QD) photoabsorbers and metal-oxide semiconducting channels. The biological photoreceptor inspires M-QD photoabsorbers with a precisely designed red (R), green (G), and blue (B)-QD ratio, enabling full-range visible color recognition with high photo-to-electric conversion efficiency. In addition, adjustable synaptic plasticity by modulating gate bias allows multiple nonvolatile-to-volatile memory conversion, leading to chromatic control in the artificial photonic synapse. To ensure the viability of the developed proof of concept, we demonstrate a 7&#215;7 pixelated photonic synapse array capable of performing outstanding color image recognition based on adjustable wavelength-dependent volatility conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Wearable Pressure Sensors for Pulse Wave Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide. The rapid development of flexible sensing technologies and wearable pulse pressure sensors have attracted keen research interest and have been widely used for long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time cardiovascular status monitoring. Owing to their compelling characteristics, including light weight, cost&#8208;effectiveness, wear comfort, and high sensitivity to pulse pressures, physiological pulse waveforms can be precisely and continuously monitored by flexible pulse sensors for wearable health monitoring. In this review, we present an overview of wearable pressure sensors for human pulse wave monitoring, with a focus on the transduction mechanism, microengineering structures, and related applications in pulse wave monitoring and cardiovascular condition assessment. We first outline the conceptualizations and methods for the acquisition of physiological and pathological information related to the cardiovascular system. The biomechanics of arterial pulse waves and the working mechanism of various wearable pressure sensors, including triboelectric, piezoelectric, magnetoelastic, piezoresistive, capacitive, and optical sensors, are also subject to systematic debate. We then summarize the exemplary applications of pulse wave measurement based on microengineering structured devices. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges that wearable pulse pressure sensors face, as well as their potential as a wearable intelligent system for personalized healthcare.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Associated Immune&#8208;Cell&#8208;Mediated Tumor&#8208;Targeting Mechanism with NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine&#8208;based SH1 is reported as a structure&#8208;inherent tumor&#8208;targeting (SITT) fluorophore without targeting&#8208;ligands. A tumor&#8208;associated immune&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated targeting mechanism for SITT strategy is suggested, which is confirmed via in vitro flow cytometry and in vivo second near&#8208;infrared spectral window imaging. SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer models with a high tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.








Abstract
The strategy of structure&#8208;inherent tumor targeting (SITT) with cyanine&#8208;based fluorophores is receiving more attention because no chemical conjugation of targeting moieties is required. However, the targeting mechanism behind SITT has not yet been well explained. Here, it is demonstrated that heptamethine&#8208;cyanine&#8208;based fluorophores possess not only targetability of tumor microenvironments without the need for additional targeting ligands but also second near&#8208;infrared spectral window (NIR&#8208;II) imaging capabilities, i.e., minimum scattering and ultralow autofluorescence. The new SITT mechanism suggests that bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived and/or tissue&#8208;resident/tumor&#8208;associated immune cells can be a principal target for cancer detection due to their abundance in tumoral tissues. Among the tested, SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability and a high tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) ranging from 9.5 to 47 in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer mouse models upon a single bolus intravenous injection. Furthermore, SH1 can be used to detect small cancerous tissues smaller than 2&#8239;mm in diameter in orthotopic lung cancer models. Thus, SH1 could be a promising cancer&#8208;targeting agent and have a bright future for intraoperative optical imaging and image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.

         <title>Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy via the Convenient A2AR Inhibition Using a Tunable Nanocatalyst with Light&#8208;Enhanced Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;tailored nanoreactor is designed to achieve tumor&#8208;activated oxygen generation and near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;guided/accelerated oxygen supplementation for tumor&#8208;specific A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR) inhibition to prime antitumor T cell immunity. The photo&#8208;modulated nanoreactor not only brakes the shackles of immunosuppression but also enhances the anti&#8208;PD1 immunotherapy.








Abstract
Blockade of A2A adenosine receptors (A2AR)&#8208;adenosinergic signaling shows high potency to mobilize antitumor immunity for its in&#8208;depth involvement in immune regulation of nearly all immune cells. Available A2AR inhibition strategies are mainly based on small molecules or proteins inhibitors, yet are limited by the non&#8208;specific operation as well as the off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, the first effort to design a convenient tumor&#8208;specific A2AR inhibition strategy to improve antitumor immune responses via the spatiotemporally controlled oxygen supply by virtue of a versatile photo&#8208;modulated nanoreactor is reported on. This nanoreactor, consisting of a catalase&#8208;mimicking shell (Pt nanocatalyst) and a photothermal core (polydopamine), is rationally designed for achieving the near&#8208;infrared radiation (NIR)&#8208;guided/accelerated oxygen supplementation on tumor site, and for relieving the A2AR&#8208;mediated immunosuppression without toxicity concern. Meanwhile, the NIR light could also mediate the direct photothermal ablation of tumor, and elicit immunogenic cell deaths to boost antitumor immunity. In a poorly immunogenic breast cancer model, the intravenous injection of the nanoreactor leads to the improved immune response with an increased animal survival rate, and achieves the long&#8208;term immunological memory effect against tumor recurrence as well as rechallenge. This convenient nanoreactor&#8208;stimulated A2AR inhibition approach provides a versatile promising paradigm for improving these existing immunotherapies.

         <title>Boosting Charge Transport in BiVO4 Photoanode for Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of hole polarons is the main cause of the slow migration of hole carriers to the surface for BiVO4 photoanode, which is localized at the BiO8 unit cell. A deep eutectic solvent that can leach Bi atoms from the BiVO4 crystal to selectively destroy the unit structure is reported. After losing Bi atoms from the BiVO4 crystal, the hole carriers will be in a more chainless state and can reach the surface with a faster migration speed to participate in the water oxidation.








Abstract
The ability to regulate charge separation is pivotal for obtaining high efficiency of any photoelectrode used for solar fuel production. Vacancy engineering for metal oxide semiconductor photoelectrode is a major strategy but has faced a formidable challenge in bulk charge transport because of the elusive charge self&#8208;trapping site. In this work, a new deep eutectic solvent to engineer bismuth vacancies (Bivac) of BiVO4 photoanode is reported; the novel Bivac can remarkably increase the charge diffusion coefficient by 5.8&#160;times (from 1.82 &#215; 10&#8722;7 to 1.06 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1), which boosts the charge transport efficiency. Through further loading CoBi cocatalyst to enhance charge transfer efficiency, the photocurrent density of BiVO4 photoanode with optimal Bivac concentration reaches 4.5 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is higher than that of previously reported Ovac engineered BiVO4 photoanode where the BiVO4 photoanode is synthesized by a similar procedure. This work perfects a cation defect engineering that enables the potential capability to equate the charge transport properties in different types of semiconductor materials for solar fuel conversion.

         <title>Interfacial Design for a 4.6&#160;V High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Crystalline LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials have attracted intensive interest. However, the single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 suffers severe structural instability and capacity fading when charged to high voltages (4.6 V vs Li/Li+) due to Co and O element dissolution, crack formation, and electrolyte penetration. In this work, the above problems are inhibited by forming a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the surface of LiCoO2.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials have attracted intensive interest in offering greater capacity retention than their polycrystalline counterparts by reducing material surfaces and phase boundaries. However, the single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 suffers severe structural instability and capacity fading when charged to high voltages (4.6&#160;V) due to Co element dissolution and O loss, crack formation, and subsequent electrolyte penetration. Herein, by forming a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) in an all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte, reversible planar gliding along the (003) plane in a single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 cathode is protected due to the prevention of element dissolution and electrolyte penetration. The robust CEI effectively controls the performance fading issue of the single&#8208;crystalline cathode at a high operating voltage of 4.6&#160;V, providing new insights for improved electrolyte design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery cathode materials.

         <title>Fast Ionic Storage in Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion diffusion coefficients are highly related to the size and dimension of tunnels in materials, the radius of various ions, and the coinserted or lattice H2O molecules. Monovalent and divalent ions show significant differences in reaction kinetics in materials for their unique diffusion characteristics. Therefore, comprehensive review and prospects are provided for fast ionic storage in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The highly dynamic nature of grid&#8208;scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage solution for renewable&#8208;energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and 1D/2D/3D and over&#8208;3D&#8208;tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over&#8208;3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes are developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

         <title>Compositionally Graded KNN&#8208;Based Multilayer Composite with Excellent Piezoelectric Temperature Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of structural gradient is proposed by designing compositionally graded multilayer composite with multiple successive phase transitions. The structural gradient ceramics exhibit a superior piezoelectric temperature stability over extensively studied lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics, and thereby achieve a new record performance.








Abstract
The inherent disadvantage of lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate (KNN)&#8208;based ceramics is the severe temperature instability of piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) caused by the polymorphic phase boundary. Herein, a new concept of structural gradient is proposed by designing compositionally graded multilayer composites with multiple successive phase transitions, to solve the challenge of the inferior temperature stability. The structural gradient ceramics exhibit a superior temperature reliability (d33 remains almost unchanged in the temperature range of 25&#8211;100 &#176;C), far outperforming the previously reported KNN counterparts with d33 variation above 27% over the same temperature range. The synergistic contribution of the continuous phase transition, the strain gradient, and the complementary effect of each constituent layer leads to the excellent temperature stability, which is also confirmed by phase&#8208;field simulation. These findings are expected to provide a new paradigm for functional material design with outstanding temperature stability.

Abstract
The shuttling behaviour and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, we present a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) &#960;&#8208;d conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework, Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D, as an efficient sulfur host to overcome these limitations. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D is characterized by a remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble LiPS species. Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D also acts as an effective catalyst for S reduction during the discharge process and Li2S oxidation during the charging process. In addition, the delocalization of electrons in the &#960;&#8208;d system of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D provides a superior electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer. Thus, cathodes based on Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D enable LSBs with excellent performance, e.g., impressive cycling stability with over 82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 C, superior rate performance of 575 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.63 mAh cm&#8722;2 under raised sulfur loading of 6.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The strategies and advantages here demonstrated can be extended to a broader range of &#960;&#8208;d conjugated MOFs materials, which we believe have a high potential as sulfur hosts in LSBs.

         <title>Stabilization of Metastable Halide Perovskite Lattices in the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects of metastability in halide perovskites, especially the phase stabilization in the 2D limit due to the dominance of surface effects, are critically reviewed. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which provide new insights on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites constitute a new class of semiconductors that are structurally tailorable, exhibiting rich structural polymorphs. In this perspective, the polymorphism in lead halide perovskites is described&#8212;a material system currently used for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Strategies for stabilizing the metastable perovskite polymorphs based on crystal size reduction and surface functionalization are critically reviewed. Focus is on an unprecedented stabilization of metastable perovskite lattices in the 2D limit (e.g., with a thickness down to a few unit cells) due to the dominance of surface effects. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which bring new insights on the relationships between the crystal structures and optoelectronic properties and lead to emergent ferroelectricity in halide perovskites. A comprehensive understanding is provided on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties, with an emphasis on the second order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion caused by the oversized A&#8208;cations. Finally, future perspectives on new structure exploration and studies of fundamental photophysical properties using stabilized perovskite lattices are provided.

This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A-cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which bring new insights on the relationships between the crystal structures and optoelectronic properties and lead to emergent ferroelectricity in halide perovskites. A comprehensive understanding is provided on how the A-cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties, with an emphasis on the second order Jahn-Teller distortion caused by the oversized A-cations. Finally, future perspectives on new structure exploration and studies of fundamental photophysical properties using stabilized perovskite lattices are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Iminosemiquinone linker&#8208;based conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted much attention as next&#8208;generation electronic materials due to their high electrical conductivity combined with high porosity. However, the utility of such c&#8208;MOFs in high&#8208;performance devices has been limited to date by the lack of high&#8208;quality MOFs thin&#8208;film processing. Herein, we introduce a technique known as Microfluidic&#8208;Assisted Solution Shearing combined with Post&#8208;synthetic Rapid Crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process to generate a high&#8208;quality, flexible, and transparent thin&#8208;film of Ni3(hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) uniformly over a large&#8208;area in a high&#8208;throughput manner with thickness controllability down to tens of nanometers. The MASS&#8208;PRC process utilizes 1) micromixer&#8208;embedded blade to simultaneously mix and continuously supply metal&#8208;ligand solution towards the drying front during solution shearing to generate an amorphous thin&#8208;film, followed by 2) immersion in amine solution for rapid directional crystal growth. As&#8208;synthesized c&#8208;MOF film had transparency of up to 88.8% and conductivity as high as 37.1 S/cm. High uniformity in conductivity was confirmed over a 3500 mm2 area with an arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) of 4.78&#160;nm. Our flexible thin&#8208;film demonstrated the highest level of transparency for Ni3(HITP)2 and the highest hydrogen sulfide (H2S) sensing performance (2085% at 5&#160;ppm) amongst c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based H2S sensors, enabling wearable gas sensing applications.

         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of solution&#8208;processable materials with regulated patterning, dimensions, and orientation lays foundation for the integration of high&#8208;performance devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art assembly methods developed based on superwetting interfaces are overviewed. The confined capillary liquids have been highlighted as a versatile and robust platform for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal nanoparticles.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of solution&#8208;processable materials imposes stringent and simultaneous requirements of controlled nucleation and growth, tunable geometry and dimensions, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly, which is challenging in solution process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Superwetting interfaces, underpinned by programmable surface chemistry and topography, are promising for steering transport, dewetting, and microfluid dynamics of liquids, thus opening a new paradigm for micro&#8208;/nanostructure assembly in solution process. Herein, assembly methods on the basis of superwetting interfaces are reviewed for constructing long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered micro&#8208;/nanostructures. Confined capillary liquids, including capillary bridges and capillary corner menisci realized by controlling local wettability and surface topography, are highlighted for simultaneously attained deterministic patterning and long&#8208;range order. The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single&#8208;crystalline micro&#8208;/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal&#8208;nanoparticle superlattices, which lead to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities. Finally, a perspective for promising directions in this realm is provided.

         <title>KTaO3&#8212;The New Kid on the Spintronics Block</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If a truly multifunctional material with a large spin&#8208;orbit coupling is looked for, it would be hard to beat KTaO3 (KTO). The 2D electron gas housed by KTO&#8208;based thin films and heterostructures exhibits spin&#8208;polarization, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, persistent photocurrent, etc., and provides a platform to realize exotic relativistic quantum particles. Read this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review for all the fascinating details.








Abstract
Long after the heady days of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity, the oxides came back into the limelight in 2004 with the discovery of the 2D electron gas (2DEG) in SrTiO3 (STO) and several heterostructures based on it. Not only do these materials exhibit interesting physics, but they have also opened up new vistas in oxide electronics and spintronics. However, much of the attention has recently shifted to KTaO3 (KTO), a material with all the &#8220;good&#8221; properties of STO (simple cubic structure, high mobility, etc.) but with the additional advantage of a much larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling. In this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review of the fascinating world of KTO, it is attempted to cover the remarkable progress made, particularly in the last five years. Certain unsolved issues are also indicated, while suggesting future research directions as well as potential applications. The range of physical phenomena associated with the 2DEG trapped at the interfaces of KTO&#8208;based heterostructures include spin polarization, superconductivity, quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, persistent photocurrent, Rashba effect, topological Hall effect, and inverse Edelstein Effect. It is aimed to discuss, on a single platform, the various fabrication techniques, the exciting physical properties and future application possibilities of this family of materials.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque Switching in an All&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure with an atomically sharp interface based on topological semimetal shows spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;driven magnetization switching. These findings highlight that engineering vdW&#8208;type topological materials and magnets offers a promising route to energy&#8208;efficient magnetization control in SOT&#8208;based spintronics.








Abstract
Current&#8208;induced control of magnetization in ferromagnets using spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) has drawn attention as a new mechanism for fast and energy efficient magnetic memory devices. Energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices require a spin&#8208;current source with a large SOT efficiency (&#958;) and electrical conductivity (&#963;), and an efficient spin injection across a transparent interface. Herein, single crystals of the van der Waals (vdW)&#160;topological semimetal WTe2&#160;and&#160;vdW ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 are used to satisfy the requirements in their all&#8208;vdW&#8208;heterostructure with an atomically sharp interface. The results exhibit values of &#958;&#160;&#8776; 4.6 and &#963;&#160;&#8776; 2.25 &#215; 105&#160;&#937;&#8208;1 m&#8208;1 for WTe2. Moreover, the significantly reduced switching current density of 3.90 &#215; 106 A cm&#8722;2 at 150 K is obtained, which is an order of magnitude smaller than those of conventional heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet thin films. These findings highlight that engineering vdW&#8208;type&#160;topological materials and magnets&#160;offers a promising route to energy&#8208;efficient magnetization control in&#160;SOT&#8208;based spintronics.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Amorphous Interfaces Coupling of CoSe2/CoP with Optimized d&#8208;band Center and Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous and heterojunctions materials have been widely used in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, the current used individual strategy still has limited effects. Hence efficient tailoring tactics with synergistic&#8208;effect are highly desired. Herein, we have realized the deep optimization of catalytic activity by constructing crystalline&#8208;amorphous CoSe2/CoP heterojunction. Benefiting from the strong electronic coupling at the interfaces, the d&#8208;band center of the material moves further down compared to its crystalline&#8208;crystalline counterpart, optimizing the valence state and the H adsorption of Co and lowering the kinetic barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The heterojunction shows an overpotential of 65&#160;mV to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in the acidic medium. Besides, it also shows competitive properties in both neutral and basic media. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the catalytic activity through combining crystalline and amorphous heterojunction, which can be implemented for other transition metal compound electrocatalysts.

         <title>Heterometallic Benzenehexathiolato Coordination Nanosheets: Periodic Structure Improves Crystallinity and Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coordination nanosheets are an emerging class of two&#8208;dimensional, bottom&#8208;up materials having fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, planar, graphite&#8208;like structures with high electrical conductivities. Since their discovery, great effort has been devoted to expand the variety of coordination nanosheets; however, in most cases, their low crystallinity in thick films hampers practical device applications. In this study, mixtures of nickel and copper ions are employed to fabricate benzenehexathiolato (BHT) &#8208;based coordination nanosheet films, and serendipitously, we find that this heterometallicity preferentially forms a structural phase with improved film crystallinity. Spectroscopic and scattering measurements provide evidence for a bilayer structure with in&#8208;plane periodic arrangement of copper and nickel ions with the NiCu2BHT formula. Compared with homometallic films, heterometallic films exhibit more crystalline microstructures with larger and more oriented grains, achieving higher electric conductivities reaching metallic behaviours. Low dependency of Seebeck coefficient on the mixing ratio of nickel and copper ions supports that the large variation in the conductivity data is not caused by change in the intrinsic properties of the films. Our findings open new pathways to improve crystallinity and to tune functional properties of two&#8208;dimensional coordination nanosheets.

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Structure in Aqueous Electrolyte via Dynamic Water Intercalation/Deintercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs) with nonflammable feature attract great attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the layered cathode materials (such as LiCoO2) present serious capacity decay in ALIBs. The degradation mechanism of layered cathode materials in ALIBs is still not clear and effective strategy to improve cycling stability remains a great challenge. In this work, we use LiCoO2 as a typical example to investigate its structural degradation in aqueous electrolytes. It is found that H+ insertion accelerated irreversible layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition is the main reason causing structural degradation and fast capacity fading in LiCoO2. Subsequently, Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8208;tO2&#8208;t with intermediate spin Co3+ is developed to mitigate H+ influence and the adverse phase transition in aqueous electrolyte. It is interesting to discover that reversible water intercalation/deintercalation occur in the layered structure during charge/discharge, which effectively suppresses the layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition with cycling. Benefiting from the stabilized layered structure, the Li&#8208;excess Li1.08Co0.92O1.92 shows significantly improved cycling performance in the neutral aqueous electrolyte with large specific capacity and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising structural regulation strategy for the layered cathode materials, enabling their potential application in ALIBs.

         <title>Observation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Biexcitons in Pristine&#8208;Quality CH3NH3PbBr3 Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs) are fascinating materials whose optoelectronic properties are arguably excitonic. In the HP family, biexcitons are known to exist only in low dimensions where exciton&#8208;exciton binding is strongly enhanced by quantum and dielectric confinements. In this paper, however, we show that they indeed do exist in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) bulk CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) single crystals if the pristine crystal quality is ensured for subtle binding of two excitons. The existence of biexcitons is clearly evidenced below 30 K with a binding energy of &#8764;3.9 &#177; 0.3 meV according to i) exciton&#8208;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two&#8208;photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann&#8208;type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence. Because of the polariton effect, the two&#8208;photon resonance occurs at the excited biexciton state from which longitudinal&#8208;transverse splitting is calculated to be 3.7 meV. The discovery of the 3D biexcitons underscores the very quality of HP crystals for generating various many&#8208;body excitonic phases in MAPbBr3 and its analogues towards the improved understanding of their fundamental properties and highly efficient optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Full&#8208;flexible Intelligent Thermal Touch Panel Based on Intrinsically Plastic Ag2S Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wearable touch panel, a typical flexible electronic device, can recognize and feedback the information of finger touch and movement. Excellent wearable touch panels are required to accurately and quickly monitor the signals of finger movement as well as the capacity of bearing various deformation. High&#8208;performance thermistor materials are one of the key functional components, but to date, a long&#8208;standing bottleneck is that inorganic semiconductors are typically brittle while the electrical properties of organic semiconductors are quite low. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance flexible temperature sensor by using plastic Ag2S with ultrahigh temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8208;4.7%/K and resolution of 0.05 K, and rapid response/recovery time of 0.11/0.11 s. Moreover, the temperature sensor shows excellent durability without performance damage or lose during force stimuli tests. In addition, full&#8208;flexible intelligent touch panel composed of 16&#215;10 Ag2S film&#8208;based temperature sensor array, as well as flexible printed circuit board and deep learning algorithm is designed for perceive finger touch signals in real&#8208;time and intelligent feedback Chinese characters and letters on App. These results strongly show that high&#8208;performance flexible inorganic semiconductors can be widely used in flexible electronics.

         <title>A Solution&#8208;processed Inorganic Emitter with High Spectral Selectivity for Efficient Subambient Radiative Cooling in Hot Humid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Daytime radiative cooling provides an eco&#8208;friendly solution to space cooling with zero energy consumption.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daytime radiative cooling provides an eco-friendly solution to space cooling with zero energy consumption. Despite significant advances, most state-of-the-art radiative coolers show broadband infrared emission with low spectral selectivity, which limits their cooling temperatures, especially in hot humid regions. Here we report an all-inorganic narrowband emitter comprising a solution-derived SiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; layer sandwiched between a reflective substrate and a self-assembly monolayer of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microspheres. It shows a high and diffusive solar reflectance (96.4%) and strong infrared-selective emittance (94.6%) with superior spectral selectivity (1.46). Remarkable subambient cooling of up to 5&#176;C in autumn and 2.5&#176;C in summer are achieved under high humidity without any solar shading or convection cover at noontime in a subtropical coastal city, Hong Kong. Owing to the all-inorganic hydrophobic structure, the emitter shows outstanding resistance to ultraviolet and water in the long-term durability tests.

         <title>High&#8208;performance ternary perovskite&#8208;organic solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells in which two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are incorporated within a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite network exhibit improved stability with respect to purely 3D systems, but lower record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Here, we report a breakthrough in achieving enhanced PCEs, increased stability, and suppressed photocurrent hysteresis by incorporating n&#8208;type, low optical gap conjugated organic molecules into 2D:3D mixed perovskite composites. The resulting ternary perovskite&#8208;organic composites display extended absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region, improved film morphology, enlarged crystallinity, balanced charge transport, efficient photo&#8208;induced charge transfer, and suppressed counter&#8208;ion movement. As a result, the ternary perovskite&#8208;organic solar cells exhibit PCEs over 23%, which are among the best PCEs for perovskite solar cells with the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device structure. Moreover, the ternary perovskite&#8208;organic solar cells possess dramatically enhanced stability and diminished photocurrent hysteresis. All these results demonstrate that our strategy of exploiting ternary perovskite&#8208;organic composite thin films provides a facile way to realize high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

The resulting ternary perovskite-organic composites display extended absorption in the near-infrared region, improved film morphology, enlarged crystallinity, balanced charge transport, efficient photo-induced charge transfer, and suppressed counter-ion movement. As a result, the ternary perovskite-organic solar cells exhibit PCEs over 23%, which are among the best PCEs for perovskite solar cells with the &lt;i&gt;p-i-n&lt;/i&gt; device structure.

         <title>A Facile &#8220;Double Catalysts&#8221; Approach to Directionally Fabricate Pyridinic N&#8208;B Pair Doped Crystal Graphene Nanoribbons/Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Abstract
The carbon material is one promising electrocatalyst in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Heteroatoms doping, the most widely&#8208;used modulating strategy, has attracted many efforts in the past decade. Despite all this, the catalytic activity of heteroatoms modulated carbon is hard to compare to that of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, a &#8220;double catalysts&#8221; (Fe salt, H3BO3) strategy is presented to directionally fabricate porous structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons (GNs)/amorphous carbon doped by pyridinic N&#8208;B pairs. The porous structure and GNs accelerate ion/mass and electron transport, respectively. The N percent in pyridinic N&#8208;B pairs accounts for &#8764;80% of all doped N species. The pyridinic N&#8208;B pair drives ORR via an almost 4e&#8722; transfer pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (0.812&#160;V versus RHE) and onset potential (0.876&#160;V versus RHE) in the alkaline solution. The ORR catalytic performance of as&#8208;prepared carbon catalysts approximates commercial Pt/C and outperforms most prior carbon&#8208;based catalysts. The assembled Zn&#8208;air battery exhibits a high peak power density of 94&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. The DFT simulation unravels that, the pyridinic N&#8208;B pair possesses the highest catalytic activity among all potential configurations, due to the highest charge density at C active sites neighboring B, which enhances interaction strength with intermediates in the p&#8208;band center.

         <title>Bioinspired 2D Isotropically Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels are fabricated through synergistically engineering the 2D lamellar microstructures and nanocrystalline domains, involving the formation of preferentially aligned lamellar micro/nanostructures through the bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting process, followed by compression annealing. Their application as load&#8208;bearing components in a jellyfish&#8208;inspired underwater robot is investigated.








Abstract
Engineering conventional hydrogels with muscle&#8208;like anisotropic structures can efficiently increase the fatigue threshold over 1000 J m&#8722;2 along the alignment direction; however, the fatigue threshold perpendicular to the alignment is still as low as &#8776;100&#8211;300 J m&#8722;2, making them nonsuitable for those scenarios where isotropic properties are desired. Here, inspired by the distinct structure&#8211;properties relationship of heart valves, a simple yet general strategy to engineer conventional hydrogels with unprecedented yet isotropic fatigue resistance, with a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold over 1,500 J m&#8722;2 along two arbitrary in&#8208;plane directions is reported. The two&#8208;step process involves the formation of preferentially aligned lamellar micro/nanostructures through a bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting process, followed by compression annealing, synergistically contributing to extraordinary resistance to fatigue crack propagation. The study provides a viable means of fabricating soft materials with isotropically extreme properties, thereby unlocking paths to apply these advanced soft materials toward applications including soft robotics, flexible electronics, e&#8208;skins, and tissue&#160;patches.

         <title>A Multilevel Analytical Theory for Prediction of Ferroelectric Perovskite Oxide Properties from Composition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multilevel model for the prediction of the technologically important properties of perovskite oxide ferroelectric solid solutions is developed, starting at the level of the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the constituent ions and ending at the level of collective macroscopic behavior. This approach is likely to be generally applicable to different classes of materials and functional properties.








Abstract
Prediction of properties from composition is a fundamental goal of materials science that is particularly relevant for ferroelectric perovskite oxide solid solutions where compositional variation is a primary tool for material design. Design of ferroelectric oxide solid solutions has been guided by heuristics and first&#8208;principles and Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theoretical methods that become increasingly difficult to apply in ternary, quaternary, and quintary solid solutions. To address this problem, a multilevel model is developed for the prediction of the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition temperature (Tc), coercive field (Ec), and polarization (P) of PbTiO3&#8208;derived ferroelectric solid solutions from composition. The characteristics of the materials at different length scales, starting at the level of the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the constituent ions and ending at the level of collective behavior, are analytically related by using ferroelectric domain walls and cationic off&#8208;center displacements as the key links between the different levels of the model. The obtained composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships provide a unified quantitatively predictive theory for understanding PbTiO3&#8208;derived solid solutions. Such a multilevel analytical modeling approach is likely to be generally applicable to different classes of ferroelectric perovskite oxides and to other functional properties, and to materials and properties beyond the field of ferroelectrics.

         <title>Dynamic Metal&#8211;Ligand Interaction of Synergistic Polymers for Bistable See&#8208;Through Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible see&#8208;through bistable electrochromic display based on polymer&#8208;assisted dynamic metal&#8211;ligand coordination is achieved successfully. It benefits from the stabilization of dye molecules by metal ions, the fixing effect, and the inhibited diffusion for metal ions by the closely associated ligand polymers. The synergistic polymers possess good film&#8208;forming ability, easy fabrication, and high transmittance with excellent bistability. These contribute potential for energy&#8208;saving displays.








Abstract
Bistable electrochromic materials are a promising alternative solution to reduce energy consumption in displays. Limited by the mechanism and lack of a design strategy, only a few electrochromic materials have truly been able achieve bistability. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to design bistable electrochromic materials based on polymer&#8208;assisted dynamic metal&#8211;ligand coordination. The mechanism and materials of such unconventional electrochromic systems are proved by sufficient characterization. Synergistic stabilization of polymerized switchable dyes and the ionic ligand polymer are attracted to each other by supramolecular forces. The color states of the dye molecules are controlled and stabilized by valence changes of the metal ions. Meanwhile, through the polymerization of the electrochromic material and the nearby metal&#8211;ligand material, the metal ions of the electroinduced valence change are tightly fixed, and the related diffusion problem of the active EC component is also almost completely suppressed. This strategy successfully enables preparation of the corresponding transparent electrochromic displays with good performances, such as, the display information is clearly visible for more than 1.5 h without consuming energy.&#160;Furthermore, the new way of dynamic coordination or dissociation bistable displays could likely prosper the development of the electrochromic area and inspire other fields.

&lt;p&gt;A flexible see-through bistable electrochromic display based on polymer-assisted dynamic metal&#8211;ligand coordination is achieved successfully. It benefits from the stabilization of dye molecules by metal ions, the fixing effect, and the inhibited diffusion for metal ions by the closely associated ligand polymers. The synergistic polymers possess good film-forming ability, easy fabrication, and high transmittance with excellent bistability. These contribute potential for energy-saving displays.

         <title>Tailoring Hyperbranched Poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) as a Robust and Universal Platform for Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;degradable, hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) (HPAE) with well&#8208;tailored structure enables highly efficient cytosolic protein/peptide delivery into cancer cells, and it quickly degrades in response to over&#8208;produced H2O2 to facilitate the intracellular cargo release and potentiate the protein activity.








Abstract
Cytosolic protein delivery is a prerequisite for protein&#8208;based biotechnologies and therapeutics on intracellular targets. Polymers that can complex with proteins to form nano&#8208;assemblies represent one of the most important categories of materials, because of the ease of nano&#8208;fabrication, high protein loading efficiency, no need for purification, and maintenance of protein bioactivity. Stable protein encapsulation and efficient intracellular liberation are two critical yet opposite processes toward cytosolic delivery, and polymers that can resolve these two conflicting challenges are still lacking. Herein, hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) (HPAE) with backbone&#8208;embedded phenylboronic acid (PBA) is developed to synchronize these two processes, wherein PBA enhanced protein encapsulation via nitrogen&#8211;boronate (N&#8211;B) coordination while triggered polymer degradation and protein release upon oxidation by H2O2 in cancer cells. Upon optimization of the branching degree, charge density, and PBA distribution, the best&#8208;performing A2&#8208;B3&#8208;C2&#8208;S2&#8208;P2 is identified, which mediates robust delivery of various native proteins/peptides with distinct molecular weights (1.6&#8211;430&#160;kDa) and isoelectric points (4.1&#8211;10.3) into cancer cells, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Moreover, A2&#8208;B3&#8208;C2&#8208;S2&#8208;P2 mediates effective cytosolic delivery of saporin both in vitro and in vivo to provoke remarkable anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. Such a potent and universal platform holds transformative potentials for protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (A&#8208;HSCs) based on a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode, an activated carbon cloth anode, and an aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte are successfully developed. The A&#8208;HSCs deliver an ultrahigh capacitance, amenable area energy density, and decent durability. This study proposes a new paradigm for electrochemical energy storage.








Abstract
The development of novel electrochemical energy storage devices is a grand challenge. Here, an aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (A&#8208;HSC), consisting of a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 based cathode, an activated carbon cloth anode, and an aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte is developed. The aqueous A&#8208;HSC demonstrates an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1550 mF cm&#8722;2 with a wide voltage window of 2.0 V. An amenable peak areal energy density (861.2 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2) and a decent capacitance retention (72.2% after 5000 cycles) are also achieved, surpassing traditional metal&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors. Ex situ characterizations reveal that NH4+ intercalation/deintercalation in the layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 is accompanied by hydrogen bond formation/breaking. This work proposes a new paradigm for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Smart Adhesives via Magnetic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart adhesive that exploits bioinspired adhesives and hard&#8208;magnetic soft materials is introduced to achieve dynamically tunable adhesion. The smart adhesive with a magnetic tip is actuated by a magnetic field to create an initial crack at the adhesion interface, so as to modulate the adhesion from strong to weak.








Abstract
Smart adhesives possess a wide range of applications owing to their reversibly and repeatedly switchable adhesion in transfer technology. Despite recent advances, it still remains a technical and scientific challenge to achieve strategies for rapidly tunable adhesion in a noncontact manner. In this study, a smart adhesive to achieve dynamically tunable adhesion is developed. Specifically, a mushroom&#8208;shaped adhesive with a magnetized tip is actuated to reversibly and rapidly transform the morphology via magnetic actuation. The smart adhesive has two working modes, namely, selective pickup mode and pick&#8208;and&#8208;place mode. In the selective pickup mode, the external magnetic field is applied and the tip undergoes bending deformation. Changes in tip morphology allow for a reversible switch of the adhesion between &#8220;turn on&#8221; and &#8220;turn off.&#8221; In the pick&#8208;and&#8208;place mode, the external magnetic field is applied when the target object needs to be released. Upward bending deformation of the micro&#8208;beam, a part of the tip, creates an initial crack at the edge of the adhesion interface. The propagation of the edge crack modulates the adhesion from strong to weak and the target object is instantly released. The proposed smart adhesive may be of interest for practical applications demanding highly precise and swiftly controlled movements.

         <title>Surface Passivation Using 2D Perovskites toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in 2D/3D heterostructure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using surface passivation. The basic crystal structure, surface passivation strategy/process, optoelectronic properties, enhanced stability, and outstanding performance based on 2D/3D PSCs are systematically discussed. In addition, some emerging challenges and critical thoughts for 2D/3D PSCs are proposed to provide insights into follow&#8208;up studies.








Abstract
3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for use in next&#8208;generation photovoltaic devices. However, some challenges need to be addressed before their commercial production, such as enormous defects formed on the surface, which result in severe SRH recombination, and inadequate material interplay between the composition, leading to thermal&#8208;, moisture&#8208;, and light&#8208;induced degradation. 2D perovskites, in which the organic layer functions as a protective barrier to block the erosion of moisture or ions, have recently emerged and attracted increasing attention because they exhibit significant robustness. Inspired by this, surface passivation by employing 2D perovskites deposited on the top of 3D counterparts has triggered a new wave of research to simultaneously achieve higher efficiency and stability. Herein, we&#160;exploited a vast amount of literature to comprehensively summarize the recent progress on 2D/3D heterostructure PSCs using surface passivation. The review begins with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the advantages of the combination of 2D and 3D perovskites. Then, the surface passivation strategies, optoelectronic properties, enhanced stability, and photovoltaic performance of 2D/3D PSCs are systematically discussed. Finally, the perspectives of passivation techniques using 2D perovskites to offer insight into further improved photovoltaic performance in the future are proposed.

         <title>Zwitterionic Polymer Electroplating Facilitates the Preparation of Electrode Surfaces for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy) is applied to produce an optimal surface for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy efficiently hydrates the electrode surface to minimize nonspecific protein adsorption, while enabling rapid, controlled polymer deposition through electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes are used to detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human saliva.








Abstract
Surface chemistry critically affects the diagnostic performance of biosensors. An ideal sensor surface should be resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, yet be conducive to analytical responses. Here a new polymeric material, zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy), is reported to produce optimal surface condition for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy combines two unique advantages: the zwitterionic function that efficiently hydrates electrode surface, hindering nonspecific binding of hydrophobic proteins; and the pyrrole backbone, which enables rapid (&lt;7&#160;min), controlled deposition of ZiPPy through electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes show lower electrochemical impedance and less nonspecific protein adsorption (low fouling), outperforming bare and polypyrrole&#8208;coated electrodes. Moreover, affinity ligands for target biomarkers can be immobilized together with ZiPPy in a single&#8208;step electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes are developed with specificity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). The prepared sensor detects SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies in human saliva down to 50&#160;ng mL&#8722;1, without the need for sample purification or secondary labeling.

         <title>Nanolayer Laser Absorber for Femtoliter Chemistry in Polymer Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct challenges in femtoliter chemistry are precise chemical transfer and reaction in ultrasmall volumes. Here, a novel nanoabsorber film, revolutionizing the standard laser&#8208;induced forward transfer of polymers with significantly improved resolution, time&#8208;, and cost&#8208;efficiency is introduced. Moreover, this technology enables in situ photochemical oxidation within milliseconds, offering a potentially rapid approach for high&#8208;throughput screening of photochemical reaction conditions and substrate scope.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) has the potential to be an alternative approach to atomic force microscopy based scanning probe lithography techniques, which have limitations in high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;scale patterning. However, traditional donor slides limit the resolution and chemical flexibility of LIFT. Here, a hematite nanolayer absorber for donor slides to achieve high&#8208;resolution transfers down to sub&#8208;femtoliters is proposed. Being wettable by both aqueous and organic solvents, this new donor significantly increases the chemical scope for the LIFT process. For parallel amino acid coupling reactions, the patterning resolution can now be increased more than five times (&gt;111&#160;000 spots&#160;cm&#8722;2 for hematite donor vs 20&#160;000 spots&#160;cm&#8722;2 for standard polyimide donor) with even faster scanning (2&#160;vs 6&#160;ms per spot). Due to the increased chemical flexibility, other types of reactions inside ultrasmall polymer reactors: copper (I) catalyzed click chemistry and laser&#8208;driven oxidation of a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, suggesting the potential of LIFT for both deposition of chemicals, and laser&#8208;driven photochemical synthesis in femtoliters within milliseconds can be explored. Since the hematite shows no damage after typical laser transfer, donors can be regenerated by heat treatment. These findings will transform the LIFT process into an automatable, precise, and highly efficient technology for high&#8208;throughput femtoliter chemistry.

         <title>Biohybrid Variable&#8208;Stiffness Soft Actuators that Self&#8208;Create Bone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinduced variable&#8208;stiffness actuators are prepared by combining polypyrrole and alginate gel functionalized with cell&#8208;derived plasma membrane nanofragments. The actuators can morph in various shapes and change their properties from soft to rigid by growing their own bone, due to mineralization, within 2 days. Different patterning for programmed directional movements, and morphing and adhesion to bone tissue are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Inspired by the dynamic process of initial bone development, in which a soft tissue turns into a solid load&#8208;bearing structure, the fabrication, optimization, and characterization of bioinduced variable&#8208;stiffness actuators that can morph in various shapes and change their properties from soft to rigid are hereby presented. Bilayer devices are prepared by combining the electromechanically active properties of polypyrrole with the compliant behavior of alginate gels that are uniquely functionalized with cell&#8208;derived plasma membrane nanofragments (PMNFs), previously shown to mineralize within 2 days, which promotes the mineralization in the gel layer to achieve the soft to stiff change by growing their own bone. The mineralized actuator shows an evident frozen state compared to the movement before mineralization. Next, patterned devices show programmed directional and fixated morphing. These variable&#8208;stiffness devices can wrap around and, after the PMNF&#8208;induced mineralization in and on the gel layer, adhere and integrate onto bone tissue. The developed biohybrid variable&#8208;stiffness actuators can be used in soft (micro&#8208;)robotics and as potential tools for bone repair or bone tissue engineering.

         <title>Ethylamine Iodide Additive Enables Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transformed Highly Oriented Perovskite for Excellent Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylamine iodide (EAI) is employed to modify pure FAPbI3 film, and a novel solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition theory is raised to depict the effect of EAI on the perovskite crystallization. The photodetector based on the modified film shows high performance.








Abstract
Perovskite has been widely applied in the optoelectronic field due to its strong light absorption and high carrier mobility. Maintaining high crystallization is critical to fabricate high&#8208;performance perovskite devices, where many methods have been reported, such as the use of additives in precursor solutions. However, there are few reports for the working mechanism of these additives. Herein, a new method to obtain highly crystalline formamidinium&#8208;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films by introducing ethylamine iodide (EAI) into perovskite precursors is reported and a novel working mechanism for such alkyl amine additives in the crystallization process of perovskites is proposed. Unlike traditional liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (L&#8211;S) crystallization theory, the research results indicate that EAI affects the solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8211;S) transition process from the intermediate yellow phase to the final black phase, and this mechanism is further verified to be universal using other common alkyl amines. A self&#8208;powered photodetector based on an as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film is fabricated with an external quantum efficiency of over 90%. This work provides a deeper understanding of the perovskite crystallization process.

         <title>Bistability, Remanence, Read/write&#8208;memory and Logic Gate Function via A Stimuli Responsive Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stimuli responsive materials change their state in response to external triggers. Switching between different states enables to write, store and read information, if the transition between the states exhibits hysteresis. Thermally responsive polymers exhibit an intrinsic hysteresis for the volume phase transition between the swollen and de&#8208;swollen solution state. We show that this hysteresis can be used to realize bistability, remanence and reversible write/read information storage. This is demonstrated for the simplest and most widely used thermoresponsive polymer, PNIPAM, as well as for PNIPAM block copolymers, which widen the hysteresis window. We show that the hysteresis is related to cluster domain assembly/disassembly during the phase transition. Information can be written thermally using a laser, or using heated or cooled pen tips on a thin film backscattering display. The bistable state can additionally be switched by pH enabling an AND&#8208;logic gate function. Furthermore, we discovered an unusual memory state, where information is visible in the hysteresis window, and invisible at higher temperatures, allowing to hide encoded information. Since hysteresis is a very common intrinsic phenomenon for responsive materials, this principle to encode and store information is potentially applicable to a broad range of responsive materials.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Field Simulations of Tunable Polar Topologies in Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric/Paraelectric Multilayers with Ultrahigh Energy Storage Performance</title>

Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are emerging energy storage components that require both high energy storage density and high efficiency. The conventional approach to energy storage enhancement is polar nanodomain engineering via chemical modification. Here we propose a new approach of domain engineering by exploiting tunable polar topologies that have been observed recently in ferroelectric/paraelectric multilayer films. Using phase&#8208;field simulations, we demonstrate that vortex, spiral, and in&#8208;plane polar structures can be stabilized in BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (BFO/STO) multilayers by tailoring the strain state and layer thickness. Various switching dynamics are realized in these polar topologies, resulting in relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208; and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors, respectively. Ultrahigh energy storage densities above 170 J cm&#8722;3 and efficiencies above 95% are achievable in STO/BFO/STO trilayers. This strategy should be generally implementable in other multilayer dielectrics and offers a new avenue to enhancing energy storage by tuning the polar topologies and thus the polarization characteristics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystals have been intensively studied as functional materials. Recently, integration of various disciplines has led to new directions in the design of functional liquid&#8208;crystalline materials in the fields of energy, water, photonics, actuation, sensing, and biotechnology. Here, recent advances in functional liquid crystals based on polymers, supramolecular complexes, gels, colloids, and inorganic&#8208;based hybrids are reviewed, from design strategies to functionalization of these materials and interfaces. New insights into liquid crystals provided by significant progress in advanced measurements and computational simulations, which enhance new design and functionalization of liquid&#8208;crystalline materials, are also discussed.

         <title>Star&#8208;Polymer&#8208;DNA Gels Showing Highly Predictable and Tunable Mechanical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dynamically crosslinked gels are appealing materials for applications that require time&#8208;dependent mechanical responses. DNA duplexes are ideal crosslinkers for building such gels because of their excellent sequence addressability and flexible tunability in bond energy. However, the mechanical responses of most DNA gels are complicated and unpredictable despite the high potential of DNA. Here, we demonstrate a DNA gel with a highly homogeneous gel network and well&#8208;predictable mechanical behaviors by using a pair of star&#8208;polymer&#8208;DNA precursors with presimulated DNA sequences showing the two&#8208;state transition. The melting curve analysis of the DNA gels reveals the good correspondence between the thermodynamic potentials of the DNA crosslinkers and the presimulated values by DNA calculators. Stress&#8208;relaxation tests and dissociation kinetics measurements show that the macroscopic relaxation time of the DNA gels is approximately equal to the lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over four orders of magnitude from 0.1&#8208;2,000&#160;sec. Furthermore, a series of durability tests find the DNA gels are hysteresis&#8208;less and self&#8208;healable after the applications of repeated temperature and mechanical stimuli. These results demonstrate the great potential of star&#8208;polymer&#8208;DNA precursors for building gels with predictable and tunable viscoelastic properties, suitable for applications such as stress&#8208;response extracellular matrices, injectable solids, and soft robotics.

         <title>Revisiting the Roles of Natural Graphite in Ongoing Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphite commonly including artificial graphite and natural graphite (NG) possesses a relatively high theoretical capacity of 372&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 and appropriate lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation potential, which has been extensively used as the anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With the requirements of reducing CO2 emission to achieve carbon neutral, the market share of NG anode will continue to grow due to its excellent processability and low production energy consumption. NG is divided into flake graphite (FG) and microcrystalline graphite (MG), which is resourceful in China. In the past 30 years, many research teams have foucused on developing modified NG and its derivate materials, which promotes their wide applications in LIBs with superior electrochemical performance. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the origin, roles and research progress of NG&#8208;based materials in ongoing LIBs, including their structure, properties, electrochemical performance, modification methods, derivates, composites and applications, especially the strategies to improve their high&#8208;rate and low&#8208;temperature charging performance. The development orientation as well as future applications of NG&#8208;based materials is also prospected, which will provide significant guidance for the current and future research of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.

         <title>Doping Control of Magnetic Anisotropy for Stable Antiskyrmion Formation in Schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, vortex&#8208;like topological spin textures, have attracted much interest in a wide range of research fields from fundamental physics to spintronics applications. Recently, growing attention has also been paid to antiskyrmions emerging in opposite topological charge in non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnets with D2d or S4 symmetry. In these magnets, complex interplay among anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, and magnetic dipolar interactions generates a variety of magnetic structures. However, the relation between the stability of antiskyrmions and these magnetic interactions remains to be elucidated. In this work, we control the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of schreibersite (Fe,Ni)3P with S4 symmetry by doping and investigate its impact on the stability of antiskyrmions. Our magnetometry study, supported by ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, shows that the variation of the Ni content and slight doping with 4d transition metals considerably change the magnetic anisotropy. In particular, doping with Pd induces easy&#8208;axis anisotropy, giving rise to formation of antiskyrmions, while a temperature&#8208;induced spin reorientation is observed in a Rh&#8208;doped compound. In combination with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we quantitatively analyze the stability of antiskyrmion as functions of uniaxial anisotropy and demagnetization energy, and demonstrate that subtle balance between them is necessary to stabilize the antiskyrmions.

         <title>Continuous Carbon Channels Enable Full Na&#8208;Ion Accessibility for Superior Room&#8208;Temperature Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique continuous carbon pores serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide full Na&#8208;ion accessibility. The formation of a solid sodium sulfide interphase in the channels plays critical roles in enabling fast and stable cycling performance of Na&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Porous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li&#8211;S and Na&#8211;S batteries. However, for these sub&#8208;nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na&#8208;ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon&#8208;hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of &#8776;90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1) for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Endogenous Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Coupled Electrospun Short Fiber via Collecting Wound Exudation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with excellent reversible hydroscopicity and biostable conductivity is fabricated to achieve precise tissue remodeling by collecting a large amount of secretions in the early stages of wound healing and transmitting bioelectrical signals to proactively match the cascade reaction of tissue repair.








Abstract
Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF, is constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibits rapid reversible water absorption, reaching maximum after only 30 s. The stable and uniform distribution of polydopamine&#8208;reduced graphene oxide endows the scaffold with stable electrical and mechanical performances even after long&#8208;term immersion. Due to its unique &#8208; bionic structure and tissue affinity, the scaffold further acts as an &#8220;electronic skin,&#8221; which transmits endogenous bioelectricity via absorbing wound exudates, promoting the treatment of diabetic wounds. Furthermore, under the endogenous EF, the cascade release of vascular endothelial growth factor accelerates the healing process. Thus, the versatile scaffold is expected to be an ideal candidate for repairing different defect tissues, especially electrosensitive tissues.

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Cell&#8208;Biomimetic Nanoparticles for Targeted Therapy of Multiple Myeloma Based on Bone Marrow Homing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insufficient delivery of drug limits the therapeutic effect of multiple myeloma. A myeloma cell&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier, which can enter bone marrow based on bone marrow homing and target tumor cells through homologous targeting, is developed. Thus, the amount of drug available at the myeloma site in the bone marrow is increased and an enhanced therapeutic effect is achieved.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy. It is characterized by abnormal transformation and uncontrolled clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), which can destroy bone structure and inhibit hematopoiesis. Although there are new therapeutic methods, they are not curative, mainly because it is difficult to deliver an effective amount of drug to BM, leading to a failure to eradicate MM cells inside the BM. BM homing is an important and unique characteristic of MM cells and it is mainly affected by surface molecules on the tumor cell membrane. Inspired by this mechanism, an MM&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier is developed by coating bortezomib (BTZ)&#8208;loaded poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCEC) nanoparticles with the MM cell membrane. The MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can enter the BM based on BM homing as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; and target the tumor cells through homologous targeting. In this way, drug availability at the myeloma site is enhanced so as to inhibit MM growth. In addition, these MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can escape phagocytosis by the MPS and have a long circulation effect. The in vivo therapeutic results demonstrate an excellent treatment efficacy for MM. Accordingly, this strategy may be a promising platform for the treatment of MM.

         <title>Unraveling Anionic Redox for Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes: Breakthroughs and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic redox reaction in sodium layered transition oxides is considered as a promising tactics to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Herein, a comprehensive review of anionic redox reaction is summarized in terms of evolution history, fundamental mechanism, major challenges, available strategies, classification of sodium layered oxide cathodes, progressive characterization techniques, and prospective trend.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as the next generation of sustainable energy technologies have received widespread investigations for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems (EESs) and smart grids due to the huge natural abundance and low cost of sodium. Although the great efforts are made in exploring layered transition metal oxide cathode for SIBs, their performances have reached the bottleneck for further practical application. Nowadays, anionic redox in layered transition metal oxides has emerged as a new paradigm to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Based on this point, in this review, the development history of anionic redox reaction is attempted to systematically summarize and provide an in&#8208;depth discussion on the anionic redox mechanism. Particularly, the major challenges of anionic redox and the corresponding available strategies toward triggering and stabilizing anionic redox are proposed. Subsequently, several types of sodium layered oxide cathodes are classified and comparatively discussed according to Na&#8208;rich or Na&#8208;deficient materials. A large amount of progressive characterization techniques of anionic oxygen redox is also summarized. Finally, an overview of the existing prospective and the future development directions of sodium layered transition oxide with anionic redox reaction are analyzed and suggested.

         <title>Anisotropic Foams via Frontal Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and convenient method to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization is described. A full factorial combination of variables is used to correlate the input parameters with the structure of the obtained foams. This work shows promise for creating foams with aligned cellular structures that allow anisotropic mass and energy transport properties in high&#8208;performance structural solids.








Abstract
The properties of foams, an important class of cellular solids, are most sensitive to the volume fraction and openness of its elementary compartments; size, shape, orientation, and the interconnectedness of the cells are other important design attributes. Control of these morphological traits would allow the tailored fabrication of useful materials. While approaches like ice templating have produced foams with elongated cells, there is a need for rapid, versatile, and energy&#8208;efficient methods that also control the local order and macroscopic alignment of cellular elements. Here, a fast and convenient method is described to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization. Foams are fabricated by curing mixtures of dicyclopentadiene and a blowing agent via frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP). The materials are characterized using microcomputed tomography (micro&#8208;CT) and an image analysis protocol to quantify the morphological characteristics. The cellular structure, porosity, and hardness of the foams change with blowing agent, concentration, and resin viscosity. Moreover, a full factorial combination of variables is used to correlate each parameter with the structure of the obtained foams. The results demonstrate the controlled production of foams with specific morphologies using the simple and efficient method of frontal polymerization.

         <title>Vibrational Strong Coupling between Surface Phonon Polaritons and Organic Molecules via Single Quartz Micropillars</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational strong coupling between surface phonon polaritons and molecular vibrations is demonstrated by using single quartz micropillars as optical resonators at mid&#8208;infrared frequencies. The vibrational strong coupling at single optical resonator level shows pronounced mode splitting, anticrossing dispersion, and molecular number dependent coupling strength, which prominently elevates the sensitivity of vibrational strong coupling.








Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC), the strong coupling between optical resonances and the dipolar absorption of molecular vibrations at mid&#8208;infrared frequencies, holds the great potential for the development of ultrasensitive infrared spectroscopy, the modification of chemical properties of molecules, and the control of chemical reactions. In the realm of ultracompact VSC, there is a need to scale down the size of mid&#8208;infrared optical resonators and to elevate their optical field strength. Herein, by using single quartz micropillars as mid&#8208;infrared optical resonators, the strong coupling is demonstrated between surface phonon polariton (SPhP) resonances and molecular vibrations from far&#8208;field observation. The single quartz micropillars support sharp SPhP resonances with an ultrasmall mode volume, which strongly couples with the molecular vibrations of 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohol (C7H7NO3) molecules featuring pronounced mode splitting and anticrossing dispersion. The coupling strength depends on the molecular concentration and reaches the strong coupling regime with only 7300 molecules. The findings pave the way for promoting the VSC sensitivity, miniaturing the VSC devices, and will boost the development of ultracompact mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopy and chemical reaction control devices.

         <title>Controlling the Emission Zone by Additives for Improved Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The position of the in situ formed emission zone (EZ) in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells has a profound influence on the device performance because of microcavity effects and doping and electrode quenching. This study shows that the inclusion of easily tuned additives can rationally shift the EZ position for improved performance.








Abstract
The position of the emission zone (EZ) in the active material of a light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) has a profound influence on its performance because of microcavity effects and doping&#8208; and electrode&#8208;induced quenching. Previous attempts of EZ control have focused on the two principal constituents in the active material&#8212;the organic semiconductor (OSC) and the mobile ions&#8212;but this study demonstrates that it is possible to effectively control the EZ position through the inclusion of an appropriate additive into the active material. More specifically, it is shown that a mere modification of the end group on an added neutral compound, which also functions as an ion transporter, results in a shifted EZ from close to the anode to the center of the active material, which translates into a 60% improvement of the power efficiency. This particular finding is rationalized by a lowering of the effective electron mobility of the OSC through specific additive: OSC interactions, but the more important generic conclusion is that it is possible to control the EZ position, and thereby the LEC performance, by the straightforward inclusion of an easily tuned additive in the active material.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Opto&#8208;Thermoelectric Tweezers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel graphene&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezers configuration is demonstrated. Due to the outstanding photo&#8208;thermal properties of the graphene substrate, it brings new advantages of a much broader working bandwidth and a larger working area, and the working power is sharply reduced. Furthermore, parallel trap multiple particles as desired shapes can be easily generated with structured graphene patterns.








Abstract
Since the discovery of graphene, its excellent physical properties have greatly improved the performance of optoelectronic devices and brought important technological advances to optical research and its applications. Here, graphene is introduced to the field of optical&#8208;tweezer technology and demonstrate a new graphene&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezer. This technology not only reduces the incident light energy required by two orders of magnitude (compared with traditional optical tweezers), it also brings new advantages such as a much broader working bandwidth and a larger working area compared to those of widely researched gold&#8208;film&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezers. Compared with gold film, graphene exhibits higher thermal conductivity and higher uniformity and is easier to process. Thus, it is found that even monolayer graphene provides stable trapping for particles in a broad bandwidth and that performance is enhanced as the number of graphene layers increases. Furthermore, parallel trap multiple particles as desired shapes can be easily generated with structured graphene patterns. This work demonstrates the enormous application potential of graphene in optical&#8208;tweezer technology and will promote their application to the trapping or concentration of cells and biomolecules as well as to microfluidics and biosensors.

         <title>Water&#8208;soluble Organic Photocatalyst Discovered for Highly Efficient Additive&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Grafting of Polymers from a Protein at Ambient and Aqueous Environments</title>

Abstract
Since the pioneering discovery of a protein bound to poly(ethylene glycol), the utility of protein&#8208;polymer conjugates (PPCs) is rapidly expanding to currently emerging applications. Photoinduced energy/electron transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization is a very promising method to prepare structurally well&#8208;defined PPCs, as it eliminates high&#8208;cost and time&#8208;consuming deoxygenation processes due to its oxygen tolerance. However, oxygen tolerance behavior of PET&#8208;RAFT has not been well investigated in aqueous environments and thereby the preparation of PPCs using PET&#8208;RAFT needs a substantial amount of sacrificial reducing agents or inert&#8208;gas purging processes. We herein report a novel water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) which enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven additive&#8208;free &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. Interestingly, the developed PC showed unconventional &#8220;oxygen acceleration&#8221; behavior for a variety of acrylic and acrylamide monomers in aqueous conditions without any additives, which is apparently distinct from previously reported systems. With such a PC, we successfully performed &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations from protein in ambient buffer conditions under green LED irradiations, which results in various PPCs having neutral, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic polyacrylates and polyacrylamides. We believe that our PC will be widely employed for a variety of photocatalysis in aqueous environments including the living cell system.

         <title>Multivariate Analysis Identifying [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ Design and Device Architecture Enables First&#8208;class Blue and White Light&#8208;emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) comprising only [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ have not been reported yet, as all the attempts towards blue&#8208;emitting complexes failed. Herein, a multivariate analysis based on prior&#8208;art [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based thin&#8208;film lighting (&gt;90 papers) and refined with computational calculations identified the best blue&#8208;emitting [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ design for LECs, that is, N^N: 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine and P^P: 4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene, to achieve predicted thin&#8208;film emission at 490&#160;nm and device performance of 3.8&#160;cd/A@170&#160;cd/m2. Validation came from the synthesis, X&#8208;ray structure, thin&#8208;film spectroscopic/microscopy/electrochemical characterization, and device optimization, realizing the first [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue&#8208;LEC with 3.6&#160;cd/A@180&#160;cd/m2. This represents a record performance compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tri&#8208;coordinate Cu(I)&#8208;complexes blue&#8208;LECs (0.17&#160;cd/A@20&#160;cd/m2). Success/versatility were confirmed with the synthesis of the analogous complex with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyrazine (N^N), showing a close prediction/experiment match: &#955;&#160;= 590/580&#160;nm; efficiency = 0.55/0.60&#160;cd/A@30&#160;cd/m2. Finally, an experimental design with a similar multivariate analysis was applied to fabricate the best white multicomponent host:guest LEC, significantly reducing the number of trial&#8208;error attempts towards the first white all&#8208;[Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;LECs with 0.6&#160;cd/A@30&#160;cd/m2. This corresponds to ca. 10&#8208;fold enhancement with regards to previous [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based white&#8208;LECs (&lt;0.05&#160;cd/A@&lt;12&#160;cd/m2). Hence, this work sets in the first multivariate approach to design emitters/active layers, accomplishing first&#8208;class [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue/white LECs that were still elusive.

Herein, a multivariate analysis based on prior-art [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based thin-film lighting (&amp;gt;90 papers) and refined with computational calculations identified the best blue-emitting [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; design for LECs, that is, N^N: 2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-6-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine and P^P: 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene, to achieve predicted thin-film emission at 490&#160;nm and device performance of 3.8&#160;cd/A@170&#160;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Validation came from the synthesis, X-ray structure, thin-film spectroscopic/microscopy/electrochemical characterization, and device optimization, realizing the first [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based blue-LEC with 3.6&#160;cd/A@180&#160;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This represents a record performance compared to the state-of-the-art tri-coordinate Cu(I)-complexes blue-LECs (0.17&#160;cd/A@20&#160;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Success/versatility were confirmed with the synthesis of the analogous complex with 2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-6-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyrazine (N^N), showing a close prediction/experiment match: &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 590/580&#160;nm; efficiency = 0.55/0.60&#160;cd/A@30&#160;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, an experimental design with a similar multivariate analysis was applied to fabricate the best white multicomponent host:guest LEC, significantly reducing the number of trial-error attempts towards the first white all-[Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-LECs with 0.6&#160;cd/A@30&#160;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This corresponds to &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 10-fold enhancement with regards to previous [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based white-LECs (&amp;lt;0.05&#160;cd/A@&amp;lt;12&#160;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Hence, this work sets in the first multivariate approach to design emitters/active layers, accomplishing first-class [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based blue/white LECs that were still elusive.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Constructing a Stable Interface Layer by Tailoring Solvation Chemistry in Carbonate Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvation chemistry in a commercial carbonate electrolyte is tailored by adding tetramethylurea cosolvent and an additive. As a result, a highly conductive and stable interface layer is constructed and lithium hexafluorophosphate decomposition is inhibited. This simple strategy can not only suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth and hydrogen fluoride production to prolong cycle life, but also enhances the temperature tolerance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density. However, commercial carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with the lithium&#8208;metal anode and detrimental hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation by lithium hexafluorophosphate decomposition. By introducing lithium nitrate additive and a small amount of tetramethylurea as a multifunctional cosolvent to a commercial carbonate electrolyte, NO3&#8722;, which is usually insoluble, can be introduced into the solvation structure of Li+ to form a conductive and stable solid electrolyte interface. At the same time, HF generation is suppressed by manipulating the solvation structure and a scavenging effect. As a result, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Li||Cu half cells using the designed carbonate electrolyte can reach 98.19% at room temperature and 96.14% at low temperature (&#8722;15&#160;&#176;C), and Li||LiFePO4 cells deliver a high capacity retention of 94.9% with a high CE of 99.6% after 550&#160;cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to extend the use of commercial carbonate electrolytes for next&#8208;generation battery systems.

         <title>Stable Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state aluminum batteries are constructed using quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte with high air stability, still operating well when exposed to air and if burning in fire, revealing a long&#8208;term air stability and high safety. The results offer a novel approach for designing highly stable and safe aluminum batteries, providing a feasible strategy to boost applications in grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) of low cost and high safety are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. With the presence of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, their high moisture sensitivity and poor stability would lead to critical issues in liquid RABs, including undesirable gas production, irreversible activity loss, and an unstable electrode interface, undermining the operation stability. To address such issues, herein, a stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed via encapsulating a small amount of an IL into a metal&#8211;organic framework, which not only protects the IL from moisture, but creates sufficient ionic transport network between the active materials and the electrolyte. Owing to the generated stable states at both positive&#8208;electrode&#8211;electrolyte and negative&#8208;electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces, the as&#8208;assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8211;graphite batteries deliver specific capacity of &#8776;75&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 (with positive electrode material loading &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, much higher than that in the conventional liquid systems). The batteries present a long&#8208;term cycling stability beyond 2000 cycles, with great stability even upon exposure to air within 2 h and under flame combustion tests. Such technology opens a new platform of designing highly safe rechargeable Al batteries for stable energy storage.

         <title>Strain Switching in van der Waals Heterostructures triggered by a Spin&#8208;Crossover Metal Organic Framework</title>

Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) provide the possibility of engineering new materials with emergent functionalities that are not accessible in another way. These heterostructures are formed by assembling layers of different materials used as building blocks. Beyond inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals, layered molecular materials remain still rather unexplored, with only few examples regarding their isolation as atomically thin&#8208;layers. Here, we enlarge the family of van der Waals heterostructures by introducing a molecular building block able to produce strain: the so&#8208;called spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). In these metal&#8208;organic materials, a spin transition can be induced by applying external stimuli like light, temperature, pressure or an electric field. In particular, smart vdWHs are prepared in which the electronic and optical properties of the 2D material (graphene and WSe2) are clearly switched by the strain concomitant to the spin transition. These molecular/inorganic vdWHs represent the deterministic incorporation of bistable molecular layers with other 2D crystals of interest in the emergent fields of straintronics and band engineering in low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Understanding Nanomaterial&#8208;Liver Interactions to Facilitate the Development of Safer Nanoapplications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanomaterials (NMs) are widely used in commercial and medical products, such as cosmetics, vaccines, and drug carriers. Exposure to NMs via various routes such as dermal, inhalation, and ingestion has been shown to gain access to the systemic circulation, resulting in the accumulation of NMs in the liver. The unique organ structures and blood flow features facilitate the liver sequestration of NMs, which may cause adverse effects in the liver. Currently, most in vivo studies were focused on NMs accumulation at the organ level and evaluation of the gross changes in liver structure and functions, however, cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific uptake and responses, as well as the molecular mechanisms at cellular levels linking the effects at organ levels are lagging. Herein, we systemically reviewed the diverse interactions of NMs with the liver, specifically on major liver cell types including Kupffer cells (KCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and hepatocytes as well as the detailed molecular mechanisms involved. In addition, we also reviewed the knowledge gained on nano&#8208;liver interactions that could facilitate the development of safer nanoproducts and nanomedicine.

Abstract
Harvesting the narrow bandgap excitons of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes for the achievement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission has attracted intensive attention for its fundamental importance and practical application. Herein, the triphenylene (TP)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) CT organic complex was designed and fabricated via the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process, which demonstrated the NIR emission with a maximum peak of 770&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.4%. The segregated stacking mode of TP&#8208;F4TCNQ CT complex based on the multiple types of intermolecular interaction has a low CT degree of 0.00103 and a small counter pitch angle of 40o between F4TCNQ and TP molecules, which breaks the forbidden electronic transitions of CT state, resulting in the effective NIR emission. Acting as the promising candidates for the active optical waveguide in the NIR region beyond 760&#160;nm, the self&#8208;assembled TP&#8208;F4TCNQ single&#8208;crystalline organic microwires displayed an ultra&#8208;low optical&#8208;loss coefficient of 0.060&#160;dB/&#956;m. This work holds considerable insights for the exploration of novel NIR&#8208;emissive organic materials via an universal &#8220;cocrystal engineering&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Three Dimensional Microvascularized Tissue Models by Laser&#8208;Based Cavitation Molding of Collagen</title>

Abstract
3D tissue models recapitulating human physiology are important for fundamental biomedical research, and they hold promise to become a new tool in drug development. An integrated and defined microvasculature in 3D tissue models is necessary for optimal cell functions. However, conventional bioprinting only allows the fabrication of hydrogel scaffolds containing vessel&#8208;like structures with large diameters (&gt;100&#160;&#956;m) and simple geometries. Recent developments in laser photoablation enable the generation of this type of structure with higher resolution and complexity, but the photo&#8208;thermal process can compromise cell viability and hydrogel integrity. To address these limitations, the present work reports in&#8208;situ 3D patterning of collagen hydrogels by femtosecond laser irradiation to create channels and cavities with diameters ranging from 20 to 60&#160;&#956;m. In this process, laser irradiation of the hydrogel generates cavitation gas bubbles that rearrange the collagen fibers, thereby creating stable microchannels. Such 3D channels can be formed in cell&#8208; and organoid&#8208;laden hydrogel without affecting the viability outside the lumen and can enable the formation of artificial microvasculature by the culture of endothelial cells and cell media perfusion. Thus, this method enables organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and 3D tissue models featuring complex microvasculature.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Confined Printing of Programmable Organic Microcrystal Assemblies for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Large&#8208;scale assembly of organic micro/nanocrystals into well&#8208;defined patterns with programmable structures is essential for applications such as information encryption at both high data density and high security level. Here we develop a magnetic field assisted approach that produces programmable assemblies of organic microcrystals with various shapes and orientations, using the magnetic domains of underneath ferromagnetic metal microarrays as the printing templates. The diamagnetic microcrystals tend to aggregate in the regions of minimal field strength, and thus their assembly behavior is precisely controlled by the local field distribution on top of magnetic domains on substrate. The dynamic assembly process of microcrystal assemblies can be programmed upon the sequence of applied field, and their shape changes are &#8764;100% reproducible on a large scale (&gt;20000 sites over 1 cm2). These features of magnetically programable assemblies are ideally suited for information encryption, for which we demonstrate the encryption&#8208;decryption&#8208;erasing of multi&#8208;level information from a quick&#8208;response code pattern based on the microcrystal assemblies under magnetic field.

The similarities and differences in the charge carrier dynamics in organic solar cells and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells, two leading technologies in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, are discussed, linking these back to the intrinsic material properties of organic and perovskite semiconductors, and how these factors impact on photovoltaic device performance is elucidated.








Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics in organic solar cells and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells, two leading technologies in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, are compared. The similarities and differences in charge generation, charge separation, charge transport, charge collection, and charge recombination in these two technologies are discussed, linking these back to the intrinsic material properties of organic and perovskite semiconductors, and how these factors impact on photovoltaic device performance is elucidated. In particular, the impact of exciton binding energy, charge transfer states, bimolecular recombination, charge carrier transport, sub&#8208;bandgap tail states, and surface recombination is evaluated, and the lessons learned from transient optical and optoelectronic measurements are discussed. This perspective thus highlights the key factors limiting device performance and rationalizes similarities and differences in design requirements between organic and perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Tailoring Competitive Adsorption Sites by Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy on Cobalt Oxides to Enhance the Electrooxidation of Biomass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) process is complicated, including the HMF and OH&#8722; jointly adsorbed and coupled with each other. In this work, the role of oxygen vacancies is investigated during HMFOR. It is found that the OH&#8722; tends to fill into Vo and participate in the dehydrogenation of HMF molecules, which can improve the catalytic activity of HMFOR.








Abstract
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers a promising green route to attain high&#8208;value chemicals from biomass. The HMF electrooxidation reaction (HMFOR) is a complicated process involving the combined adsorption and coupling of organic molecules and OH&#8722; on the electrode surface. An in&#8208;depth understanding of these adsorption sites and reaction processes on electrocatalysts is fundamentally important. Herein, the adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722;, and the role of oxygen vacancy on Co3O4 are initially unraveled. Correspondingly, instead of the competitive adsorption of OH&#8722; and HMF on the metal sites, it is observed that the OH&#8722; can fill into oxygen vacancy (Vo) prior to couple with organic molecules through lattice oxygen oxidation reaction process, which could accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step of the dehydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) intermediates. With the modulated adsorption sites, the as&#8208;designed Vo&#8208;Co3O4 shows excellent activity for HMFOR with the earlier potential of 90 and 120&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH and 1 m PBS solution. This work sheds insight on the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancy, which benefits designing a novel electrocatalysts to modulate the multi&#8208;molecules combined adsorption behaviors.

Both internal short circuit and chemical crossover within the battery are simultaneously prevented when the separator is employed. The results elucidate the underlying mechanism to ensure battery safety and highlight the design principles for advanced separators.








Abstract
The separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large&#8208;scale implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator (GS&#8208;PI) is fabricated via a novel gel&#8208;stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering during heating clearly shows that the as&#8208;prepared thin GS&#8208;PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit. Meanwhile, the unique nanoporous structure design further blocks chemical crosstalk and the associated exothermic reactions. Accelerating rate calorimetry tests reveal that the practical 1 Ah LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)/graphite pouch cell using GS&#8208;PI nanoporous separator show a maximum temperature rise (dT/dtmax) of only 3.7&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 compared to 131.6&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 in the case of Al2O3@PE macroporous separator. Moreover, despite the reduced pore size, the GS&#8208;PI separator demonstrates better cycling stability than conventional Al2O3@PE separator at high temperature without sacrificing specific capacity and rate capability.

         <title>Extreme Environmental Thermal Shock Induced Dislocation&#8208;Rich Pt Nanoparticles Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method is proposed to generate dislocation&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles in a liquid&#8208;nitrogen cooling medium. Structural stress and thermal stress trigger the formation of dislocations. The fast&#8208;cooling rate makes dislocations kinetically frozen in nanoparticles. The strain induced by dislocations downshifts the d&#8208;band center of the Pt, leading to weakened adsorption energy between the metal and reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Crystal structure engineering of nanomaterials is crucial for the design of electrocatalysts. Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials to optimize the crystal and electronic structures and improve the catalytic properties. However, it is almost impossible to produce and retain dislocations in commercial mainstream catalysts, such as single metal platinum (Pt) catalysts. In this work, a non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature (&gt;1400 K) thermal&#8208;shock method is reported to induce rich dislocations in Pt nanocrystals (Dr&#8208;Pt). The method is performed in an extreme environment (&#8776;77 K) created by liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced within milliseconds by thermal and structural stress during the crystallization process are kinetically frozen at an ultrafast cooling rate. The high&#8208;energy surface structures with dislocation&#8208;induced strain effects can prevent surface restructuring during catalysis. The findings indicate that a novel extreme environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method can successfully introduce rich dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and significantly boost its hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

         <title>Vertically Stacked Full Color Quantum Dots Phototransistor Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution and Enhanced Color&#8208;Selective Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of vertically stacked red (R), green (G), and blue (B) quantum dots (QDs), from chalcometallate RGB QD precursor films, with amorphous oxide semiconductor indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide phototransistor arrays for high&#8208;resolution active&#8208;matrix driving of color&#8208;selective multispectral photodetection is demonstrated. Efficient QD connectivity for reduced trap density and photopatternability essential for pixelation are achieved, which result in ultrahigh photosensitive optoelectronic properties.








Abstract
Color&#8208;selective multifunctional and multiplexed photodetectors have attracted considerable interest with the increasing demand for color filter&#8208;free optoelectronics which can simultaneously process multispectral signal via minimized system complexity. The low efficiency of color&#8208;filter technology and conventional laterally pixelated photodetector array structures often limit opportunities for widespread realization of high&#8208;density photodetectors. Here, low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed vertically stacked full color quantum dot (QD) phototransistor arrays are developed on plastic substrates for high&#8208;resolution color&#8208;selective photosensor applications. Particularly, the three different&#8208;sized/color (RGB) QDs are vertically stacked and pixelated via direct photopatterning using a unique chelating chalcometallate ligand functioning both as solubilizing component and, after photoexposure, a semiconducting cement creating robust, insoluble, and charge&#8208;efficient QD layers localized in the a&#8208;IGZO transistor region, resulting in efficient wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Thus, high&#8208;resolution vertically stacked full color QD photodetector arrays are successfully implemented with the density of 5500 devices cm&#8211;2 on ultrathin flexible polymeric substrates with highly photosensitive characteristics such as photoresponsivity (1.1 &#215; 104 AW&#8211;1) and photodetectivity (1.1 &#215; 1018 Jones) as well as wide dynamic ranges (&gt;150&#160;dB).

         <title>Versatile Preparation of Mesoporous Single&#8208;Layered Transition&#8208;Metal Sulfide/Carbon Composites for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous single&#8208;layered MoS2/carbon composite is successfully synthesized, which displays remarkable electrochemical performance for both sodium&#8208;ion batteries and sodium&#8208;ion full cells. The reaction mechanism is systematically investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations. This work may be expected to guide the future design protocol for various mesoporous single&#8208;layered transition&#8208;metal sulfide/carbon composite materials.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides are promising electrochemical energy storage materials due to their abundant active sites, large interlayer space, and high theoretical capacities, especially for sodium storage. However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hamper their applications. Herein, a versatile dual&#8208;template method is reported to elaborate ordered mesoporous single&#8208;layered MoS2/carbon composite with high specific area, uniform pore size, and large pore volume. The single&#8208;layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium&#8208;storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g&#8722;1 can remain at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 during 100 cycles. The mechanism is investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Light Intensity Analysis of Photovoltaic Parameters for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light intensity analysis of photovoltaic parameters is introduced as a simple method, allowing understanding of the dominating mechanisms limiting the device performance in perovskite solar cells. The method is based on the drift&#8208;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the trap&#8208;assisted recombination or ohmic losses in devices.








Abstract
The number of publications on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) continues to grow exponentially. Although the efficiency of PSCs has exceeded 25.5%, not every research laboratory can reproduce this result or even pass the border of 20%. Unfortunately, it is not always clear which dominating mechanism is responsible for the performance drop. Here, a simple method of light intensity analysis of the JV parameters is developed, allowing an understanding of what the mechanisms are that appear in the solar cell and limit device performance. The developed method is supported by the drift&#8208;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the interface or bulk recombination, series resistance, or shunt resistance in the perovskite solar cell. This method can help not only point toward the dominating of bulk or interface recombination in the devices but also determine which interface is more defective. A detailed and stepwise guidance for such a type of light intensity analysis of JV parameters is provided.

     alt="Light Intensity Analysis of Photovoltaic Parameters for Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light intensity analysis of photovoltaic parameters is introduced as a simple method, allowing understanding of the dominating mechanisms limiting the device performance in perovskite solar cells. The method is based on the drift-diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the trap-assisted recombination or ohmic losses in devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of publications on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) continues to grow exponentially. Although the efficiency of PSCs has exceeded 25.5%, not every research laboratory can reproduce this result or even pass the border of 20%. Unfortunately, it is not always clear which dominating mechanism is responsible for the performance drop. Here, a simple method of light intensity analysis of the &lt;i&gt;JV&lt;/i&gt; parameters is developed, allowing an understanding of what the mechanisms are that appear in the solar cell and limit device performance. The developed method is supported by the drift-diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the interface or bulk recombination, series resistance, or shunt resistance in the perovskite solar cell. This method can help not only point toward the dominating of bulk or interface recombination in the devices but also determine which interface is more defective. A detailed and stepwise guidance for such a type of light intensity analysis of &lt;i&gt;JV&lt;/i&gt; parameters is provided. The proposed method and the conclusions of this study are supported by a series of case studies, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method on real examples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosensor&#8208;Enabled Multiplexed On&#8208;Site Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical biosensor, with a synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;enabled antibody&#8208;free assay, for temporal monitoring of piperacillin/tazobactam in exhaled breath condensate, along with a correlation study exploring the link between monitored drug levels, is presented. The validation of the findings with gold&#8208;standard measurements demonstrates the suitability of the system as a low&#8208;cost, rapid, and sample&#8208;independent tool for multiplexed on&#8208;site therapeutic drug monitoring.








Abstract
Personalized antibiotherapy ensures that the antibiotic concentration remains in the optimal therapeutic window to maximize efficacy, minimize side effects, and avoid the emergence of drug resistance due to insufficient dosing. However, such individualized schemes need frequent sampling to tailor the blood antibiotic concentrations. To optimally integrate therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) into the clinical workflow, antibiotic levels can either be measured in blood using point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), or can rely on noninvasive sampling. Here, a versatile biosensor with an antibody&#8208;free assay for on&#8208;site TDM is presented. The platform is evaluated with an animal study, where antibiotic concentrations are quantified in different matrices including whole blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The clearance and the temporal evaluation of antibiotic levels in EBC and plasma are demonstrated. Influence of matrix effects on measured drug concentrations is determined by comparing the plasma levels with those in noninvasive samples. The system's potential for blood&#8208;based POCT is further illustrated by tracking &#223;&#8209;lactam concentrations in untreated blood samples. Finally, multiplexing capabilities are explored successfully for multianalyte/sample analysis. By enabling a rapid, low&#8208;cost, sample&#8208;independent, and multiplexed on&#8208;site TDM, this system can shift the paradigm of &#8220;one&#8209;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Ultrafast&#8208;Response/Recovery Flexible Piezoresistive Sensors with DNA&#8208;Like Double Helix Yarns for Epidermal Pulse Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hysteresis is a critical issue existing in textiles sensors. Distinct from the conventional methods, in this work, a biomimetic DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helix structure is introduced into a textile&#8208;based pressure sensor, providing a twisting force to allow quick and sufficient recovery from the deformation. Ultimately, the hysteresis is largely inhibited together with an improved response/relaxation time.








Abstract
A key challenge in textile sensors is to adequately solve the hysteresis for more broad and exacting applications. Unlike the conventional strategy in integrating elastic polymers into the textile, the hysteretic issue is critically addressed here through the structural design of yarns to provide a twisting force. The underlying mechanism is fully discussed based on theory and modeling, which are in good agreement with experimental data. Impressively, the pressure sensor outperforms almost all reported textile&#8208;based sensors in terms of recovery index, which refers to the ability to overcome the lagged deformation reflected by the hysteresis (5.3%) and relaxation time (2&#160;ms). Besides, the sensor superiority is also demonstrated by way of its ultrafast response time (2&#160;ms). Thanks to these merits, this pressure sensor is demonstrated to be capable of monitoring epidermal pulses and meanwhile shows great potential to advance the standardization and modernization of pulse palpation in traditional Chinese medicine.

         <title>An Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Performance Rotational Hydrodynamic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Enabled by Automatic Mode Switching and Charge Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge excitation and automatic mode switching triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which displays outstanding durability and electrical output at the same time. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability and broadening the range of working frequency as well as improving the electrical output performance of TENGs.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology for ambient mechanical energy harvesting, which provides a possibility to realize wild environment monitoring by self&#8208;powered sensing systems. However, TENGs are limited in some practical applications as a result of their low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high&#8208;performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switching (contact mode at low speed and noncontact at high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability, maintaining 94% electrical output after 72&#160;000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact&#8208;mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green light&#8208;emitting diodes to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting water&#8208;flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged quickly, and a self&#8208;powered fire alarm and self&#8208;powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency, and improving the electrical output of TENGs. In addition, the high&#8208;performance hydrodynamic TENG demonstrated in this work will have great applications for Internet of Things in remote areas.

         <dc:description>
A renewable magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery is developed with porous NiO on the Ni foam as a photoelectrode. The battery achieves an ultralow charge potential of 2.73&#160;V, a high energy efficiency of 96.7%, and good cycling stability. The effect mechanism of the improved battery performance with magnetic field and optical field is revealed.








Abstract
The photoassisted lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) system has emerged as an important direction for future development by effectively reducing the large overpotential in Li&#8211;O2 batteries. However, the advancement is greatly hindered by the rapidly recombined photoexcited electrons and holes upon the discharging and charging processes. Herein, a breakthrough is made in overcoming these challenges by developing a new magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery with 3D porous NiO nanosheets on the Ni foam (NiO/FNi) as a photoelectrode. Under illumination, the photogenerated electrons and holes of the NiO/FNi photoelectrode play a key role in reducing the overpotential during discharging and charging, respectively. By introducing the external magnetic field, the Lorentz force acts oppositely on the photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby suppressing the recombination of charge carriers. The magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery achieves an ultralow charge potential of 2.73 V, a high energy efficiency of 96.7%, and good cycling stability. This external magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted technology paves a new way of developing high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;O2 batteries and other energy storage systems.

         <title>Designing Artificial Vibration Modes of Piezoelectric Devices Using Programmable, 3D Ordered Structure with Piezoceramic Strain Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is proposed to artificially generate basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes in a broad frequency band other than only at eigenfrequency. A five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one 3D OSPSU is constructed, indicating the potential for nano&#8208;operation in microelectronic manufacturing.








Abstract
Piezoelectric ceramic devices, which utilize multifarious vibration modes to realize electromechanical coupling and energy conversions, are extensively used in high&#8208;technological fields. However, the excitation of basic modes is mainly subjected to natural eigenfrequency of ceramic devices, which is related to the structure and material parameters. Herein, inspired by metamaterial theory, a programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is developed to artificially generate basic modes in a broad frequency band other than only in narrow eigenfrequency. A (2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2) arrayed, co&#8208;fired, multilayer 3D OSPSU is painstakingly designed and fabricated for generating basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes at nonresonance. To validate the 3D OSPSU method, a five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one co&#8208;fired multilayer ceramic is constructed. The proposed methodology provides a new paradigm for creating extraordinary material properties of piezoelectric ceramics and will inspire brand&#8208;new piezoelectric device designs.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable 2D Cr5Te8 Nanosheets with Thickness&#8208;Tunable Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferromagnetism Cr5Te8 single crystals with high crystallinity are successfully synthesized via a tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition growth. The as&#8208;grown Cr5Te8 nanosheet shows air&#8208;stable and thickness&#8208;tunable ferromagnetic properties with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization, which open up new prospects for exploring 2D magnetism and spintronic device applications.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials have aroused widespread research interest owing to their promising application in spintronic devices. However, exploring new kinds of 2D magnetic materials with better stability and realizing their batch synthesis remain challenging. Herein, the synthesis of air&#8208;stable 2D Cr5Te8 ultrathin crystals with tunable thickness via tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth technology is reported. The importance of tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube CVD growth, which can significantly suppress the equilibrium shift to the decomposition direction and facilitate that to the synthesis reaction direction, for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality Cr5Te8 with accurate composition, is highlighted. By precisely adjusting the growth temperature, the thickness of Cr5Te8 nanosheets is tuned from &#8776;1.2&#160;nm to tens of nanometers, with the morphology changing from triangles to hexagons. Furthermore, magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that the Cr5Te8 nanosheet is ferromagnetic with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. The Curie temperature exhibits a monotonic increase from 100 to 160 K as the Cr5Te8 thickness increases from 10 to 30&#160;nm and no apparent variation in surface roughness or magnetic properties after months of exposure to air. This study provides a robust method for the controllable synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D ferromagnetic materials, which will facilitate research progress in spintronics.

         <title>Tissue Engineering with Mechanically Induced Solid&#8208;Fluid Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissues composed of a collagenous core surrounded by an epithelial sheet serve as shape&#8208;programmable living matter. The shaping process involves solid to fluid transitions in the epithelium induced by mechanical perturbations, and the generation of spatially distributed surface stresses at the interfaces. Optochemical and microsurgical operations generate a new shape that is autonomously stabilized by the re&#8208;epithelization process.








Abstract
Epithelia are contiguous sheets of cells that stabilize the shape of internal organs and support their structure by covering their surfaces. They acquire diverse morphological forms appropriate for their specific functions during embryonic development, such as the kidney tubules and the complex branching structures found in the lung. The maintenance of epithelial morphogenesis and homeostasis is controlled by their remarkable mechanics&#8212;epithelia can become elastic, plastic, and viscous by actively remodeling cell&#8211;cell junctions and modulating the distribution of local stresses. Microfabrication, finite element modelling, light&#8208;sheet microscopy, and robotic micromanipulation are used to show that collagen gels covered with an epithelial skin serve as shape&#8208;programmable soft matter. The process involves solid to fluid transitions induced by mechanical perturbations, generates spatially distributed surface stresses at tissue interfaces, and is amenable to both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques. The robustness and versatility of this strategy for engineering designer tissues is demonstrated by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of molded, carved, and assembled forms from the base material. The results provide insight into the active mechanical properties of the epithelia and establish methods for engineering tissues with sustainable architectures.

         <title>Silk Embolic Material for Catheter&#8208;Directed Endovascular Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials today are clinically approved for achieving vascular occlusion. In this work, a biomaterial comprising silk fibroin and nanoclay is developed and optimized as a multifunctional embolic agent that offers both embolization and drug&#8208;delivery capabilities. The silk embolic material exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed embolic drug carrier for the treatment of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Embolization is a catheter&#8208;based minimally invasive procedure that deliberately occludes diseased blood vessels for treatment purposes. A novel silk&#8208;based embolic material (SEM) that is developed and optimized to provide tandem integration of both embolization and the delivery of therapeutics is reported. Natural silk is processed into fibroin proteins of varying lengths and is combined with charged nanoclay particles to allow visibility and injectability using clinical catheters as small as 600 &#956;m in diameter at lengths &gt;100&#160;cm.&#160;SEMs loaded with fluorochrome labeled bovine albumin and Nivolumab, which is among the most used immunotherapy drugs worldwide, demonstrate a sustained release profile in vitro over 28 days. In a porcine renal survival model, SEMs with labeled albumin and Nivolumab successfully embolize porcine arteries without recanalization and lead to the delivery of both albumin and Nivolumab into the interstitial space of the renal cortex. Mechanistically, it is shown that tissue delivery is most optimal when the internal elastic membrane of the embolized artery is disrupted. SEM is a potential next&#8208;generation multifunctional embolic agent that can achieve embolization and deliver a wide range of therapeutics to treat vascular diseases including tumors.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D NbWO6 Perovskite Semiconductor Based Gas Sensors with Ultrahigh Selectivity under Low Working Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5 nm are synthesized for the fabrication of gas sensors, and the fabricated few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based semiconducting sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed with high selectivity and sensitivity at low temperature.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detection with high selectivity and low working temperature is of great significance due to its strong toxicity both to the environment and to humans and also as an endogenous signaling molecule existing in various physiological processes. 2D perovskites with high carrier mobility are promising candidates for gas sensing; however, the development of stable and nontoxic 2D perovskites nanosheets still remains a challenge. Herein, 2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5&#160;nm are synthesized by liquid exfoliation, and the gas&#8208;sensing performance based on these ultrathin nanosheets is investigated. A few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed (&lt;6 s) with high selectivity and sensitivity (S&#160;= 12.5 vs 50&#160;ppm) at low temperature (150&#160;&#176;C). A small variation of H2S concentration (&lt;0.5&#160;ppm) can be detected with a fully reversible resistance signal. This work sheds light on the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensors working in ambient conditions based on low&#8208;dimensional, nontoxic, and wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;2D all-inorganic NbWO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5 nm are synthesized for the fabrication of gas sensors, and the fabricated few-layer NbWO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-based semiconducting sensor exhibits fast H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S sensing speed with high selectivity and sensitivity at low temperature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) detection with high selectivity and low working temperature is of great significance due to its strong toxicity both to the environment and to humans and also as an endogenous signaling molecule existing in various physiological processes. 2D perovskites with high carrier mobility are promising candidates for gas sensing; however, the development of stable and nontoxic 2D perovskites nanosheets still remains a challenge. Herein, 2D all-inorganic NbWO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5&#160;nm are synthesized by liquid exfoliation, and the gas-sensing performance based on these ultrathin nanosheets is investigated. A few-layer NbWO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-based sensor exhibits fast H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S sensing speed (&amp;lt;6 s) with high selectivity and sensitivity (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 12.5 vs 50&#160;ppm) at low temperature (150&#160;&#176;C). A small variation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S concentration (&amp;lt;0.5&#160;ppm) can be detected with a fully reversible resistance signal. This work sheds light on the development of high-performance gas sensors working in ambient conditions based on low-dimensional, nontoxic, and wide-bandgap perovskite semiconductors. The high carrier mobility, ultrathin structure, and soft nature make this type of 2D perovskite semiconductor an ideal material candidate for the fabrication of flexible, transparent, and wearable sensing devices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Injection as a Pathway to Enhancing Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films driven via local oxygen vacancy migration is observed via temperature dependent band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. Observations are supported by finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory calculations pointing toward the discovery of a new method of enhancing functional responses in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Since their discovery in late 1940s, perovskite ferroelectric materials have become one of the central objects of condensed matter physics and materials science due to the broad spectrum of functional behaviors they exhibit, including electro&#8208;optical phenomena and strong electromechanical coupling. In such disordered materials, the static properties of defects such as oxygen vacancies are well explored but the dynamic effects are less understood. In this work, the first observation of enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films is reported driven via dynamic local oxygen vacancy control in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A persistence in peizoelectricity past the bulk Curie temperature and an enhanced electromechanical response due to a created internal electric field that further enhances the intrinsic electrostriction are explicitly demonstrated. The findings are supported by a series of temperature dependent band excitation PFM in ultrahigh vacuum and a combination of modeling techniques including finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory. This study shows the pivotal role that dynamics of vacancies in complex oxides can play in determining functional properties and thus provides a new route toward&#8211; achieving enhanced ferroic response with higher functional temperature windows in ferroelectrics and other ferroic materials.

         <title>A Universal Nonhalogenated Polymer Donor for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, with different side&#8208;chain orientations and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are reported. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, PB1 only produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3%, while PB2 gives an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. More importantly, PB2 has good compatibility with various electron acceptors. PB2 achieves excellent PCEs of 18.4% and 27.1% for ternary OPV cells and indoor light photovoltaic devices, respectively.








Abstract
Nonhalogenated polymers have great potential in the commercialization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to their advantage in low&#8208;cost preparation. However, non&#8208;halogenated polymers usually have high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and inferior self&#8208;aggregation properties in solution, thus resulting in low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, are prepared. When the polymers are used to fabricate OPV cells with BTP&#8208;eC9, the PB1&#8208;based device only gives a PCE of 5.3%, while the PB2&#8208;based device shows an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. After the introduction of PBDB&#8208;TF as the third component, the PB2:PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based device with an optimal weight ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 achieves a PCE up to 18.4%. More importantly, PB2 exhibits good compatibility with various nonfullerene acceptors to achieve better PCEs than those of classical polymer (PBDB&#8208;T and PBDB&#8208;TF)&#8208;based devices. When PB2 is combined with a wide&#8208;bandgap electron acceptor (F&#8208;BTA3), this device shows excellent PCE of 27.1% and 24.6% for 1 and 10 cm2 devices, respectively, under light intensity of 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode illumination. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of low&#8208;cost materials and broadening the application of OPV cells.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrocatalyst with single Zn(I) sites is discovered to accelerate kinetics of hydrogenation process for efficient N2 reduction.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts for NH3 electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, an unusual NRR electrocatalyst is reported with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Zn1N&#8211;C). The Zn1N&#8211;C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;16.1&#160;&#181;g NH3 h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#160;V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts with transition metals atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated (TM&#8208;Nx) sites. 15N2 isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding nitrogen gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH3. Structural characterization reveals that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn&#8211;N4 moieties are likely the active sites, and the nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR process. In situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation elucidate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step during the NH3 production. The graphitic N atoms adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn&#8211;N4 moieties could significantly lower the energy barrier for this step to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics duing the NRR.

         <title>Homojunction Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells with over 1&#160;&#181;m&#8208;Thick Photoactive Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a charge&#8208;transfer doping strategy to tune the carrier&#8208;type, P/N homojunction CsPbI3 perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated; the P/N homojunction significantly improves the carrier dynamic process and outputs record high efficiency in a QD active layer with thickness over 1&#160;&#181;m, demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QD PVs.








Abstract
The solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) reported so far generally suffer from poor thickness tolerance and it is difficult for them to be compatible with large&#8208;scale solution printing technology. However, the recently emerged perovskite QDs, with unique high defect tolerance, are particularly well&#8208;suited for efficient photovoltaics. Herein, efficient CsPbI3 perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated first with over 1&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick active layer by developing an internal P/N homojunction. Specifically, an organic dopant 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(perfluoronaphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylidene) dimalononitrile (F6TCNNQ) is introduced into CsPbI3 QD arrays to prepare different carrier&#8208;type QD arrays. The detailed characterizations reveal successful charge&#8208;transfer doping of QDs and carrier&#8208;type transformation from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. Subsequently, the P/N homojunction perovskite QD solar cell is assembled using different carrier&#8208;type QDs, delivering an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.29%. Most importantly, this P/N homojunction strategy realizes remarkable thickness tolerance of QD solar cells, showing a record high efficiency of 12.28% for a 1.2&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick QD active&#8208;layer and demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QDs solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;The solution-processed solar cells based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) reported so far generally suffer from poor thickness tolerance and it is difficult for them to be compatible with large-scale solution printing technology. However, the recently emerged perovskite QDs, with unique high defect tolerance, are particularly well-suited for efficient photovoltaics. Herein, efficient CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated first with over 1&#160;&#181;m-thick active layer by developing an internal P/N homojunction. Specifically, an organic dopant 2,2&#8242;-(perfluoronaphthalene-2,6-diylidene) dimalononitrile (F6TCNNQ) is introduced into CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QD arrays to prepare different carrier-type QD arrays. The detailed characterizations reveal successful charge-transfer doping of QDs and carrier-type transformation from n-type to p-type. Subsequently, the P/N homojunction perovskite QD solar cell is assembled using different carrier-type QDs, delivering an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.29%. Most importantly, this P/N homojunction strategy realizes remarkable thickness tolerance of QD solar cells, showing a record high efficiency of 12.28% for a 1.2&#160;&#181;m-thick QD active-layer and demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QDs solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality Bias Tissue Homeostasis by Manipulating Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that upregulates M2 macrophage polarization and activates downstream immune signaling to restore tissue homeostasis. These findings provide a more practical, simple, and efficient material strategy for regulating macrophages to treat disease.








Abstract
The physiological chirality of extracellular environments is substantially affected by pathological diseases. However, how this stereochemical variation drives host immunity remains poorly understood. Here, it is reported that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that helps to restore tissue homeostasis by manipulating immunological response. Quantitative multi&#8208;omics in vivo and in vitro shows that M&#8208;nanofibrils significantly inhibit inflammation and promote tissue regeneration by upregulating M2 macrophage polarization and downstream immune signaling compared with P&#8208;nanofibrils. Molecular analysis and theoretical simulation demonstrate that M&#8208;chirality displays higher stereo&#8208;affinity to cellular binding, which induces higher cellular contractile stress and activates mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZOl to conduct Ca2+ influx. In turn, the nuclear transfer of STAT is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote M2 polarization. These findings underscore the structural mechanisms of disease, providing design basis for immunotherapy with bionic functional materials.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Nacre&#8208;Inspired Polyimide&#8208;Mica Nanocomposite Films with Excellent Mechanical Stability for LEO Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyimide&#8208;mica (PI&#8208;Mica) nanocomposite film with outstanding mechanical properties and atomic oxygen resistance is produced by integrating mica nanosheets with polyimide into a double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica in the top layer. This unique microstructure and advantages of mica also impart the film with favorable resistance to ultraviolet, space debris, and high temperatures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding comprehensive performance, polyimide (PI) composite films are widely used on the external surfaces of spacecraft to protect them from the adverse conditions of low Earth orbit (LEO). However, current PI composite films have inadequate mechanical properties and atomic oxygen (AO) resistance. Herein, this work fabricates a new PI&#8208;based nanocomposite film with greatly enhanced mechanical properties and AO resistance by integrating mica nanosheets with PI into a unique double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica nanosheets in the top layer. In addition, the unique microstructure and the intrinsic properties of mica also impart the nanocomposite film with favorable ultraviolet and high&#8208;temperature resistance. The comprehensive performance of this material is superior to those of pure PI, single&#8208;layer PI&#8208;mica, and previously reported PI&#8208;based composite films. Thus, the double&#8208;layer nanocomposite film displays great potential as an aerospace material for use in LEO.

         <title>Doping&#8208;Induced Dielectric Catastrophe Prompts Free&#8208;Carrier Release in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general mechanism for the doping&#8208;induced insulator&#8211;conductor transition in organic semiconductors is proposed. Multiscale simulations unveil the high polarizability of dopant&#8211;semiconductor complexes and predict large nonlinear enhancements of the dielectric constant as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. Such an enhanced screening frees charges from Coulomb barriers at concentrations of 5&#8211;10%, in accordance with experiments.








Abstract
The control over material properties attainable through molecular doping is essential to many technological applications of organic semiconductors, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes or thermoelectrics. These excitonic semiconductors typically reach the degenerate limit only at impurity concentrations of 5&#8211;10%, a phenomenon that has been put in relation with the strong Coulomb binding between charge carriers and ionized dopants, and whose comprehension remained elusive so far. This study proposes a general mechanism for the release of carriers at finite doping in terms of collective screening phenomena. A multiscale model for the dielectric properties of doped organic semiconductor is set up by combining first principles and microelectrostatic calculations. The results predict a large nonlinear enhancement of the dielectric constant (tenfold at 8% load) as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. This can be attributed to the presence of highly polarizable host&#8211;dopant complexes, plus a nontrivial leading contribution from dipolar interactions in the disordered and heterogeneous system. The enhanced screening in the material drastically reduces the (free) energy barriers for electron&#8211;hole separation, rationalizing the possibility for thermal charge release. The proposed mechanism is consistent with conductivity data and sets the basis for achieving higher conductivities at lower doping loads.

         <title>A Dynamic and Self&#8208;Adapting Interface Coating for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is proposed for constructing a dynamic and adaptive volume change interface coating to stabilize zinc anodes and prepare poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/TiO2&#8722;x as a reasonable artificial interface coating, which can provide continuous dynamic protection and induce rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+. This provides an effective and feasible approach for the protection and practical application of zinc&#8208;metal anodes.








Abstract
The zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion battery has attracted much attention due to its high safety and environmental protection. At present, the critical issues of the generation of dendrites and the accumulation of dead Zn on the surface will lead to a sharp decline of the battery life. Zn dendrites can be inhibited to some extent by constructing an interface protective coating. However, the existing rigid coating method cannot maintain conformal contact with Zn due to the volume change of Zn deposition and will cause fracture irreversibly during the cycle. Here, a highly self&#8208;adaptable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/TiO2&#8722;x coating is developed that can dynamically adapt to volume changes and inhibit dendrites growth. PDMS has high dynamic and self&#8208;adaptability due to the crosslinking of the B&#8211;O bond. In addition, the rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+ is induced by the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich TiO2&#8722;x. The assembled cells still achieve 99.6% coulombic efficiency after 700 cycles at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The adaptive interface coating constructed provides a sufficient guarantee for the stable operation of the Zn anode.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral intermetallic compounds are promising candidates to promote heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. Combining experimental and theoretical surface science methods, enantiospecific control is demonstrated for a halogen elimination reaction with a difference in the debromination temperatures of the two surface enantiomers of up to an unprecedented 46 K on the prototypical chiral intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces.








Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions, is investigated; specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Asymmetric halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to an unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanodot Electrocatalysts Converting Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ amine functionalization is a general strategy that can be applied to nanoscale carbon catalysts, i.e., in the form of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) regardless of their crystal structure, to promote the selectivity and production rate of CH4 in CO2 electroreduction. Specifically, amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve CH4 Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of industrial relevance.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), which can be used not only as fuel but also as a hydrogen carrier, has drawn great attention for use in supporting carbon capture and utilization. The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in situ amine functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion is presented. Amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve a CH4 Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH4 partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, approximating to or even outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These GQDs also convert CO2 to C2 products mainly including C2H4 and C2H5OH with a maximum FE of &#8776;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH4 yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C2 production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.

         <title>Polarimetric Image Sensor and Fermi Level Shifting Induced Multichannel Transition Based on 2D PdPS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide spectral response photodetector and polarimetric image sensor based on 2D palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS) are designed. The photoresponse range of PdPS is from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet to the near&#8208;infrared. The PdPS&#8208;based polarimetric imaging sensor achieves object imaging and hidden&#8208;target detection in complex environments.








Abstract
2D materials have been attracting high interest in recent years due to their low structural symmetry, excellent photoresponse, and high air stability. However, most 2D materials can only respond to specific light, which limits the development of wide&#8208;spectrum photodetectors. Proper bandgap and the regulation of Fermi level are the foundations for realizing electronic multichannel transition, which is an effective method to achieve a wide spectral response. Herein, a noble 2D material, palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS), is designed and synthesized. The bandgap of PdPS is around 2.1&#160;eV and the formation of S vacancies, interstitial Pd and P atoms promote the Fermi level very close to the conduction band. Therefore, the PdPS&#8208;based photodetector shows impressive wide spectral response from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared based on the multichannel transition. It also exhibits superior optoelectrical properties with photoresponsivity (R) of 1 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 and detectivity (D*) of 4 &#215; 1011 Jones at 532&#160;nm. Moreover, PdPS exhibits good performance of polarization detection with dichroic ratio of &#8776;3.7 at 808&#160;nm. Significantly, it achieves polarimetric imaging and hidden&#8208;target detection in complex environments through active detection.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Release Platform for Multieffective Helicobacter Pylori Targeting Therapy and Intestinal Flora Protective Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;generation platform for the treatment of H. pylori is reported. This platform integrates inflammatory targeted adhesion, multieffectively antibacterial capability, inflammatory regulation, and gastric mucosa repair, and also avoids simultaneously the imbalance of gastrointestinal flora homeostasis.








Abstract
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. Antibiotics, as traditional method for eliminating H. pylori, have no targeting effect, which causes serious bacterial resistance and gut dysbacteriosis. Moreover, antibiotics can hardly address hyperactive inflammatory response or damaged gastric mucosal barrier caused by H. pylori infection. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework hydrogen&#8208;generation nanoparticle (Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8) is reported, which is encapsulated with ascorbate palmitate (AP) hydrogel. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the outer AP hydrogel can target and adhere to the inflammatory site through electrostatic interactions, and is then hydrolyzed by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enriching in inflammatory sites. The released Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles are further decomposed by gastric acid to generate zinc ions (Zn2+) and hydrogen, thus effectively killing H. pylori, alleviating inflammation and restoring impaired gastric mucosa simultaneously. Unexpectedly, this metal&#8211;organic framework hydrogen&#8208;generation platform (Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8&#8202;@&#8202;AP) also has an effect toward avoiding the imbalance of intestinal flora, which thus provides a more precise, effective, and healthy strategy for the treatment of H. pylori infection.

         <title>Modeling the Triboelectric Behaviors of Elastomeric Nonwoven Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An analytical model is developed for nonwoven&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) working at conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact mode. The model fits well with different sets of experimental data at reasonable mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and suggests that nonwoven triboelectric output reaches a maximum at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;An analytical model is developed for nonwoven-based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) working at conductor-to-dielectric contact mode. The model fits well with different sets of experimental data at reasonable mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and suggests that nonwoven triboelectric output reaches a maximum at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Extracellular Matrix in Synthetic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Prostate Cancer Organoids Regulate Therapeutic Response to EZH2 and DRD2 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroendocrine prostate cancer is epigenetically transformed tumors for which no targeted therapies exist. Using a combination of transcriptomics, proteomics, spatial omics, and microscopy on patient biopsies, the extracellular matrix tumor microenvironment is defined. Informed by findings, synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based prostate cancer organoids are developed to grow patient tumor cells under the defined microenvironment conditions, leading to the discovery of novel therapeutics.








Abstract
Following treatment with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, &#8776;20% of prostate cancer patients progress by shedding their AR&#8208;dependence. These tumors undergo epigenetic reprogramming turning castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer adenocarcinoma (CRPC&#8208;Adeno) into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC&#8208;NEPC). No targeted therapies are available for CRPC&#8208;NEPCs, and there are minimal organoid models to discover new therapeutic targets against these aggressive tumors. Here, using a combination of patient tumor proteomics, RNA sequencing, spatial&#8208;omics, and a synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based organoid, putative extracellular matrix (ECM) cues that regulate the phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic underpinnings of CRPC&#8208;NEPCs are defined. Short&#8208;term culture in tumor&#8208;expressed ECM differentially regulated DNA methylation and mobilized genes in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs. The ECM type distinctly regulates the response to small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of epigenetic targets and Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), the latter being an understudied target in neuroendocrine tumors. In vivo patient&#8208;derived xenograft in immunocompromised mice showed strong anti&#8208;tumor response when treated with a DRD2 inhibitor. Finally, we&#160;demonstrate that therapeutic response in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs under drug&#8208;resistant ECM conditions can be overcome by first cellular reprogramming with epigenetic inhibitors, followed by DRD2 treatment. The synthetic organoids suggest the regulatory role of ECM in therapeutic response to targeted therapies in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs and enable the discovery of therapies to overcome resistance.

         <title>Simultaneous Realization of Superoleophobicity and Strong Substrate Adhesion in Water via a Unique Segment Orientation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile noncovalent coating strategy is provided to simultaneously realize underwater superoleophobicity and strong substrate adhesion based on a mixture of amphiphilic polyurethane and a water&#8208;miscible solvent. By immersing the coating in water, hydrophobic segments will orientate and pile along the substrate surface via a segment orientation mechanism. Hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to a hydrogel surface.








Abstract
The underwater superoleophobicity of a coating is often caused by its preferential water affinity, which, however, normally weakens the substrate adhesion property. In this work, a new strategy is reported for achieving strong underwater adhesion between a well&#8208;designed amphiphilic polyurethane coating and a diverse range of substrates while also rendering the coating surface's superoleophobicity. When the coating, which is a mixture of an amphiphilic polyurethane and a water miscible solvent, is immersed in water, the hydrophobic segments aggregate to orientate and pile along the surface of substrates via a segment orientation mechanism triggered by solvent exchange with water penetration to exert strong adhesion. At the same time, the hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to form a hydrogel coating, endowing the substrate with underwater superoleophobicity. This work provides a facile, versatile, and scalable approach for the future design of superoleophobic coatings in a water environment.

         <title>Design of Quasi&#8208;MOF Nanospheres as a Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (quasi&#8208;MOF) nanospheres are developed as a sulfur electrocatalyst, wherein abundant metal nodes that act as active sites are exposed, rendering strong lithium polysulfides absorbability. The dynamic structure evolution over the sulfur reduction reaction can effectively promote catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics. This quasi&#8208;MOF sulfur composite demonstrates a decent electrochemical performance with prolonged cycle lifespan.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries owing to their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application.&#160;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely investigated as&#160;a sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, a strategy to design quasi&#8208;MOF nanospheres, which contain a transition&#8208;state structure between the MOF and the metal oxide via controlled ligand exchange strategy, to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst, is presented. The quasi&#8208;MOF not only inherits the porous structure of the MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of the quasi&#8208;MOF and its impact on the durability of the catalyst over the course of the electrochemical process is acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, the quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity&#8208;fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of quasi&#8208;MOF&#8208;based composites but also provides guidance for application in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting White Light Printed Image Multiplexing by Fast Nanosecond Laser Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Up to four images are encoded in a single random plasmonic metasurface created by fast nanosecond laser processing. Each laser&#8208;induced pixel exhibits various colors in different observation modes, which can be controlled independently to enable multiplexing. The approach, different from holography, makes possible the observation of various images on the same support by the naked eye under different observation angles.








Abstract
Passive plasmonic metasurfaces enable image multiplexing by displaying different images when altering the conditions of observation. Under white light, three&#8208;image multiplexing with polarization&#8208;selective switching has been recently demonstrated using femtosecond&#8208;laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces. Here, the implementation of image multiplexing is extended, thanks to a color&#8208;search algorithm, to various observation modes compatible with naked&#8208;eye observation under incoherent white light and to four&#8208;image multiplexing under polarized light. The laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces enabling image multiplexing exhibit self&#8208;organized patterns that can diffract light or induce dichroism through hybridization between the localized surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles and a lattice resonance. Improved spatial resolution makes the image quality compatible with commercial use in secured documents as well as the processing time and cost thanks to the use of a nanosecond laser. This high&#8208;speed and flexible laser process, based on energy&#8208;efficient nanoparticle reshaping and self&#8208;organization, produces centimeter&#8208;scale customized tamper&#8208;proof images at low cost, which can serve as overt security features.

This high-speed and flexible laser process, based on energy-efficient nanoparticle reshaping and self-organization, produces centimeter-scale customized tamper-proof images at low cost, which can serve as overt security features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Ligand Screening by Magnetic Nanoassembly Modulates Stem Cell Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic screens of various sizes are elastically coupled to RGD&#8208;presenting surfaces with nanogaps. Large magnetic screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering for mechanotransduction&#8208;dependent differentiation of stem cells, which can be dynamically hindered by lowering the nanogaps. Conversely, small magnetic screens facilitate stem cell adhesion and differentiation by dynamically raising the nanogaps.








Abstract
In native microenvironment, diverse physical barriers exist to dynamically modulate stem cell recruitment and differentiation for tissue repair. In this study, nanoassembly&#8208;based magnetic screens of various sizes are utilized, and they are elastically tethered over an RGD ligand (cell&#8208;adhesive motif)&#8208;presenting material surface to generate various nanogaps between the screens and the RGDs without modulating the RGD density. Large screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering to facilitate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells, which are not observed with small screens. Magnetic downward pulling of the large screens decreases the nanogaps, which dynamically suppress the focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. Conversely, magnetic upward pulling of the small screens increases the nanogaps, which dynamically activates focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. This regulation mechanism is also shown to be effective in the microenvironment in vivo. Further diversifying the geometries of the physical screens can further enable diverse modalities of multifaceted and safe unscreening of the distributed RGDs to unravel and modulate stem cell differentiation for tissue repair.

         <title>Ultrafast Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation from Metal&#8211;Organic Framework to 2D Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that single crystallinity can be totally maintained even through dramatic structural changes, which only requires several seconds. Ultrathin 2D single crystals can be obtained by the strategy, which is difficult for traditional methods. This discovery illustrates the possibility of transforming from 3D frameworks to 2D inorganic single crystals, vastly expanding the research scope of the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations have received considerable interest in crystal engineering, owing to providing a key platform for creating new materials. However, because of the limited tolerance of chemical bonds against the lattice strains, it is challenging to maintain the crystallinity when the structure changes dramatically. Here, a peculiar SCSC transformation from organic crystals to inorganic crystals, simultaneously achieving a drastic change in structure, connectivity, and dimension, is reported. As a demonstration, after reacting with liquid gallium, zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) can easily transform to 2D hydroxide single crystals. Interestingly, long&#8208;range ordered metallic atoms of hydroxide inherited from the ordered atomic arrangement of ZIF&#8208;8, but the connectivity is distinct. With good universality and extensibility, this transformation vastly expands the research scope of the SCSC transformations and provides a novel pathway for the synthesis of crystalline materials.

         <title>Interpolation between W Dopant and Co Vacancy in CoOOH for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpolation principle between W dopant and Co vacancy with opposite modulation effect is proposed to tune the electronic structure of CoOOH for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, near&#8208;optimal electronic states and near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics are achieved, leading to high catalytic activity. Such an interpolation principle can open up a new methodology for efficient catalyst design.








Abstract
Electronic structure engineering via integrating two defect structures with opposite modulation effects holds the key to fully unlocking the power of a catalyst. Herein, an interpolation principle is proposed to activate CoOOH via W doping and Co vacancies for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory suggests opposite roles for the W dopant and the Co vacancy but a synergy between them in tuning the electronic states of the Co site, leading to near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics and dramatically lowered catalytic overpotential. Experimental studies confirm the modulation of the electronic structure and validate the greatly enhanced catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 298.5&#160;mV to drive 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The discovery of the interpolation between dopants and vacancies opens up a new methodology to design efficient catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.

         <title>A Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic Semiconductor Photocatalyst for Nitrogen Fixation in a &#8220;One&#8208;Stone&#8208;Two&#8208;Birds&#8221; Manner</title>

         <dc:description>
A Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed out of oxygen&#8208;deficient semiconductor MoO3 spheres for efficient nitrogen photofixation. The abundant oxygen vacancies in the spheres &#8220;kill two birds with one stone.&#8221; They serve as active sites for nitrogen molecules and induce localized surface plasmon resonance simultaneously. Apparent quantum efficiencies of over 1% are recorded from 700&#160;nm up to 1064&#160;nm.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has received much attention owing to attractive plasmonic enhancement effects in improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. However, the photocatalytic efficiencies have remained low mainly due to the short carrier lifetime caused by the rapid recombination of plasmon&#8208;generated hot charge carriers. Although plasmonic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterostructures can improve the separation of hot charge carriers, a large portion of the hot charge carriers are lost when they cross the Schottky barrier. Herein, a Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic semiconductor photocatalyst, MoO3&#8722;x, which allows for efficient N2 photofixation in a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; manner, is demonstrated. The oxygen vacancies in MoO3&#8722;x serve as the &#8220;stone.&#8221; They &#8220;kill two birds&#8221; by functioning as the active sites for the chemisorption of N2 molecules and inducing localized surface plasmon resonance for the generation of hot charge carriers. Benefiting from this unique strategy, plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x exhibits a remarkable photoreactivity for NH3 production up to the wavelength of 1064&#160;nm with apparent quantum efficiencies over 1%, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion efficiency of 0.057% without any hole scavenger. This work shows the great potential of plasmonic semiconductors to be directly used for photocatalysis. The concept of the Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free design will pave a new path for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>3D Printed, Solid&#8208;State Conductive Ionoelastomer as a Generic Building Block for Tactile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer is designed for high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of soft ionic conductor with arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks display excellent and temperature&#8208;tolerant electrical&#8211;mechanical properties, as well as can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile devices such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit sensitivities much higher than their bulky counterparts.








Abstract
Shaping soft and conductive materials into preferential architectures via 3D printing is highly attractive for numerous applications ranging from tactile devices to bioelectronics. A landmark type of soft and conductive materials is hydrogels/ionogels. However, 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels/ionogels still suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: limited stability in their electrical&#8211;mechanical properties caused by the evaporation and leakage of liquid within hydrogels/ionogels. Although photocurable liquid&#8208;free ion&#8208;conducting elastomers can circumvent these limitations, the associated photocurable process is cumbersome and hence the printing quality is relatively poor. Herein, a fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer (SCIE) is developed that enables high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks possess many promising features over the conventional ion&#8208;conducting materials, including high resolution architectures (even &#8776;50&#160;&#181;m overhanging lattices), good Young's modulus (up to &#8776;6.2&#160;MPa), and stretchability (fracture strain of &#8776;292%), excellent conductivity tolerance in a wide range of temperatures (from &#8722;30 to 80&#160;&#176;C), as well as fine elasticity and antifatigue ability even after 10&#160;000 loading&#8211;unloading cycles. It is further demonstrated that the printed building blocks can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile sensors such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit several times higher in sensitivity than their bulky counterparts.

         <title>3D Printed MXene Aerogels with Truly 3D Macrostructure and Highly Engineered Microstructure for Enhanced Electrical and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printing method based on inkjet printing and unidirectional freeze casting is utilized to fabricate pristine Ti3C2Tx aerogels with truly 3D shapes and vertically aligned MXene sheets. 3D printed aerogels are proposed for flexible/wearable electronics due to their excellent electromechanical performance. Enhanced electrochemical performance of the micro&#8208;supercapacitors is attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and ionic diffusion achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Assembling 2D materials such as MXenes into functional 3D aerogels using 3D printing technologies gains attention due to simplicity of fabrication, customized geometry and physical properties, and improved performance. Also, the establishment of straightforward electrode fabrication methods with the aim to hinder the restack and/or aggregation of electrode materials, which limits the performance of the electrode, is of great significant. In this study, unidirectional freeze casting and inkjet&#8208;based 3D printing are combined to fabricate macroscopic porous aerogels with vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx sheets. The fabrication method is developed to easily control the aerogel microstructure and alignment of the MXene sheets. The aerogels show excellent electromechanical performance so that they can withstand almost 50% compression before recovering to the original shape and maintain their electrical conductivities during continuous compression cycles. To enhance the electrochemical performance, an inkjet&#8208;printed MXene current collector layer is added with horizontally aligned MXene sheets. This combines the superior electrical conductivity of the current collector layer with the improved ionic diffusion provided by the porous electrode. The cells fabricated with horizontal MXene sheets alignment as current collector with subsequent vertical MXene sheets alignment layers show the best electrochemical performance with thickness&#8208;independent capacitive behavior.

         <title>Cr&#8208;Doped Pd Metallene Endows a Practical Formaldehyde Sensor New Limit and High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D Cr&#8208;doped Pd metallene (Cr&#8208;Pdene) with few atomic layers as an advanced catalyst provides an anti&#8208;poisoning formaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;CO2 means for the formaldehyde oxidation reaction. The Cr&#8208;Pdene&#8208;based practical electrochemical sensor can accurately detect ppb&#8208;level gaseous formaldehyde and micromolar&#8208;level liquid formaldehyde in indoor air and different foods with long&#8208;term stability, good repeatability, and high selectivity.








Abstract
Electrochemical sensors for detecting micromolecule organics are desirable for improving the perception of environmental quality and human health. However, currently, the electrochemical sensors for formaldehyde are substantially limited on the market due to the long&#8208;term unsolved problems of the low electrooxidation efficiency and CO poisoning issue of commercial Pd catalysts. Here, a 2D Cr&#8208;doped Pd metallene (Cr&#8208;Pdene) with few atomic layers is shown as an advanced catalyst for ultrasensitive and selective sensing of formaldehyde via a highly efficient formaldehyde electrooxidation. It is found that the doping of Cr into Pd metallene can efficiently optimize the electronic structure of Pd and weaken the interaction between Pd and CO, providing an anti&#8208;poisoning means to favor CO2 production and suppress CO adsorption. The Cr&#8208;Pdene&#8208;based electrochemical sensor exhibits one order of magnitude higher detection range and, especially, much higher anti&#8208;interference for formaldehyde than that of the conventional sensors. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the Cr&#8208;Pdene can be integrated into commercializable wireless sensor networks or handheld instruments for promising applications relating to the environment, health, and food.

Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries
A &#8220;Quasi&#8208;MOF&#8221; nanosphere is introduced by Yongguang Zhang, Xin Wang, Zhongwei Chen, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2105541 as an efficient and durable sulfur electrocatalyst toward accelerated sulfur reduction reaction. The reversible de&#8208;ligandation/ligandation of this Quasi&#8208;MOF over the course of the electrochemical process endows its with excellent catalytic activity and remarkable durability. Attributed to these structural advantages, the Quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low&#8208;capacity fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling.

Broad&#8208;Spectrum Photodetection
In article number 2107206, Yue&#8208;Yang Liu, Zhongming Wei, and co&#8208;workers show how upward movement of the Fermi level enables multichannel transition of electrons. This mechanism achieves a broad spectral response in a PdPS&#8208;based photodetector. In addition, the PdPS&#8208;based polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector and polarimetric image sensor realize the application of object detection.

Perovskite Solar Cells
Light&#8208;intensity analysis of JV parameters is introduced by Yulia Galagan and Damian Glowienka in article number 2105920 as a simple method to allow understanding of the dominating mechanisms that limit device performance in perovskite solar cells. The method is based on the drift&#8211;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from trap&#8208;assisted recombination or ohmic losses in devices.

Nanocrystal Dislocations
Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials. In article number 2106973, Yanan Chen and co&#8208;workers report a non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method (HTS) to induce dislocations in nanocrystals by using liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced by thermal and structural stress are frozen in nanoparticles. The extreme environmental HTS can introduce dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and improve hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

         <title>A Critical Outlook for the Pursuit of Lower Contact Resistance in Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Though organic transistors have long been considered as a potential cornerstone technology for flexible electronics applications, their widespread commercialization in high&#8208;frequency circuits has been substantially impeded by high contact resistance. A review of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reveals the pivotal role of the organic&#8208;semiconductor morphology and the key challenges now to be overcome, such as Fermi&#8208;level pinning and low charge&#8208;carrier densities.








Abstract
To take full advantage of recent and anticipated improvements in the performance of organic semiconductors employed in organic transistors, the high contact resistance arising at the interfaces between the organic semiconductor and the source and drain contacts must be reduced significantly. To date, only a small portion of the accumulated research on organic thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has reported channel&#8208;width&#8208;normalized contact resistances below 100 &#937;cm, well above what is regularly demonstrated in transistors based on inorganic semiconductors. A closer look at these cases and the relevant literature strongly suggests that the most significant factor leading to the lowest contact resistances in organic TFTs so far has been the control of the thin&#8208;film morphology of the organic semiconductor. By contrast, approaches aimed at increasing the charge&#8208;carrier density and/or reducing the intrinsic Schottky barrier height have so far played a relatively minor role in achieving the lowest contact resistances. Herein, the possible explanations for these observations are explored, including the prevalence of Fermi&#8208;level pinning and the difficulties in forming optimized interfaces with organic semiconductors. An overview of the research on these topics is provided, and potential device&#8208;engineering solutions are discussed based on recent advancements in the theoretical and experimental work on both organic and inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies of Low&#8208;Cost Aluminum Anodes for High&#8208;Performance Al&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al, with the features of high specific capacity, low&#8208;cost, and abundant reserves, is promising for energy storage. The recent progress of Al anodes for various Al&#8208;based batteries is summarized. The challenges of Al anodes leading to a mismatch between theoretical and practical performance are discussed. Comprehensive strategies for Al anodes to boost the electrochemical performance are presented.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing market of electric vehicles and the upcoming grid&#8208;scale storage systems have stimulated the fast growth of renewable energy storage technologies. Aluminum&#8208;based batteries are considered one of the most promising alternatives to complement or possibly replace the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high specific capacity, good safety, low cost, light weight, and abundant reserves of Al. However, the anode problems in primary and secondary Al batteries, such as, self&#8208;corrosion, passive film, and volume expansion, severely limit the batteries&#8217; practical performance, thus hindering their commercialization. Herein, an overview of the currently emerged Al&#8208;based batteries is provided, that primarily focus on the recent research progress for Al anodes in both primary and rechargeable systems. The anode reaction mechanisms and problems in various Al&#8208;based batteries are discussed, and various strategies to overcome the challenges of Al anodes, including surface oxidation, self&#8208;corrosion, volume expansion, and dendrite growth, are systematically summarized. Finally, future research perspectives toward advanced Al batteries with higher performance and better safety are presented.

         <title>Emerging Electrocatalysts for Water Oxidation under Near&#8208;Neutral CO2 Reduction Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent theoretical and experimental development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under near pH&#8208;neutral CO2 reduction conditions is reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. These electrocatalysts range from noble&#8208;metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, and (hydro)oxides. Density functional theory, and particularly machine learning, and operando characterizations are also included.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which produces valuable fuels and chemicals under near&#8208;neutral conditions, offers a renewable approach to alleviate the global energy crisis as well as the increasing concerns on climate change. However, to implement this strategy, one of the major challenges, the sluggish kinetics of the paired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, needs to be surmounted. It is therefore highly desirable to explore high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective OER electrocatalysts suitable for CO2RR conditions, which is very different from those widely investigated under acidic or alkaline conditions. In this review, the ongoing development of OER electrocatalysts under near pH&#8208;neutral CO2&#8208;saturated (bi)carbonate solutions are highlighted and the future opportunities are discussed. It is started with a brief introduction on OER paired with CO2RR, the relevant theoretical tools such as density functional theory (DFT) and particularly machine learning (ML), and the operando characterization techniques. Then, there are some detailed discussions of recent progress on the rational design of OER electrocatalysts under CO2RR conditions ranging from noble&#8208;metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, (hydro)oxides, and so on. Finally, a perspective for developing OER electrocatalysts integrated with CO2 electroreduction is proposed.

         <title>Bioactive Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic polymers as intrinsically bioactive agents. This review presents new opportunities in the development of synthetic polymers with the ability to selectively recognize and bind biological targets, to exert anticancer and/or antibacterial activity, and others that can agglutinate or otherwise bind to viruses.








Abstract
Synthetic polymers are omnipresent in society as textiles and packaging materials, in construction and medicine, among many other important applications. Alternatively, natural polymers play a crucial role in sustaining life and allowing organisms to adapt to their environments by performing key biological functions such as molecular recognition and transmission of genetic information. In general, the synthetic and natural polymer worlds are completely separated due to the inability for synthetic polymers to perform specific biological functions; in some cases, synthetic polymers cause uncontrolled and unwanted biological responses. However, owing to the advancement of synthetic polymerization techniques in recent years, new synthetic polymers have emerged that provide specific biological functions such as targeted molecular recognition of peptides, or present antiviral, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. In this review, the emergence of this generation of bioactive synthetic polymers and their bioapplications are summarized. Finally, the future opportunities in this area are discussed.

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Cell&#8208;Laden Hydrogels for Improved Biological Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes recent progress and future opportunities to design dual&#8208;stage crosslinked bioinks, which are gels both prior to and after printing. These active, living materials are composed of both acellular and cellular components. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable greater biofunctionality.








Abstract
The encapsulation of cells within gel&#8208;phase materials to form bioinks offers distinct advantages for next&#8208;generation 3D bioprinting. 3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for patterning cells, but the technology remains limited in its ability to produce biofunctional, tissue&#8208;like constructs due to a dearth of materials suitable for bioinks. While early demonstrations commonly used viscous polymers optimized for printability, these materials often lacked cell compatibility and biological functionality. In response, advanced materials that exist in the gel phase during the entire printing process are being developed, since hydrogels are uniquely positioned to both protect cells during extrusion and provide biological signals to embedded cells as the construct matures during culture. Here, an overview of the design considerations for gel&#8208;phase materials as bioinks is presented, with a focus on their mechanical, biochemical, and dynamic gel properties. Current challenges and opportunities that arise due to the fact that bioprinted constructs are active, living hydrogels composed of both acellular and cellular components are also evaluated. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable control over the evolution of the living construct after printing to achieve greater biofunctionality.

Abstract
Colloidally grown nanosized semiconductors yield extremely high&#8208;quality optoelectronic materials. Many examples have pointed to near perfect photoluminescence quantum yields, meaning non&#8208;radiative optical processes (losses) can be completely suppressed allowing for technology&#8208;leading materials as high purity color centers in display technology and emitters in LEDs. Furthermore, because of high chemical yield, and improved understanding of the surfaces, these materials, particularly colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can also be ideal candidates for other optoelectronic applications. Given the strong drive toward carbon neutrality and limiting climate change, electricity from solar photovoltaics will play a large role in the power generation sector. QDs have been developed and shown dramatic improvements over the past 15 years as photoactive materials in photovoltaics and have unique potential with various innovative deposition properties which could lead to exceptionally low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance devices. Once the key issues related to charge transport in optically thick arrays are addressed, QD&#8208;based photovoltaic technology could become a better candidate for practical application. In this article, w e show how the possibilities of different deposition techniques could bring QD&#8208;based solar cells to the industrial level and discuss the challenges for perovskite QD solar cells in particular, to achieve large&#8208;area fabrication for further advancing technology to solve pivotal energy and environmental issues.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Polymer Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator for Precision Cancer Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;activatable polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator comprising a near infrared&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer and an amphipathic polymer conjugated with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist via an acid&#8208;labile linker is developed. The synergistic activity of released immunogenic factors and precise activation of TLR7 pathways at a tumor site elicits effective adaptive antitumor response via an in&#160;situ vaccine&#8208;like function.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine combined with immunotherapy has become a promising strategy for treating cancer in terms of safety and potency; however, precise regulation of the activation of antitumor immunity remains challenging. Herein, a smart semiconducting polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator (SPNI), which responds to the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), for precision photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer, is reported. The SPNI is self&#8208;assembled by a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer and an amphipathic polymer conjugated with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist via an acid&#8208;labile linker. Upon arrival at tumor site, SPNI undergoes hydrolysis and triggers an efficient liberation of TLR7 agonist in response to the acidic TME for dendritic cell activation. Moreover, SPNI exerts photodynamic effects for direct tumor eradication and immunogenic cancer cell death under NIR photoirradiation. The synergistic action of released immunogenic factors and acidic&#8208;TME&#8208;activated TLR7 agonist can serve as an in situ generated cancer vaccine to evoke strong antitumor activities. Notably, such localized immune activation boosts systemic antitumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T infiltration to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Thereby, this work presents a general strategy to devise prodrug of immunotherapeutics for precise regulation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Sensitive Linear&#8211;Dendritic Block Copolymer&#8211;Drug Prodrug as a Nanoplatform for Tumor Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear&#8211;dendritic block copolymer prodrug with enzyme and pH dual&#8208;responsiveness is synthesized through a new synthesis strategy. The prodrug and photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) self&#8208;assemble to form nanoparticles for efficient drug delivery and controlled release drug. Doxorubicin (DOX) and Ce6 exert a synergistic antitumor effect by intensifying cell DNA damage and activating apoptotic pathways, resulting in an excellent antitumor effect.








Abstract
Linear&#8211;dendritic block copolymer (LDBCs) are highly attractive candidates for smart drug&#8208;delivery vehicles. Herein, an amphiphilic poly[(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (POEGMA) linear&#8208;peptide dendritic prodrug of doxorubicin (DOX) prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported. The hydrophobic&#8208;dye&#8208;based photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) is employed for encapsulation in the prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) to obtain an LDBCs&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery system (LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6) that offers a combination cancer therapy. Due to the presence of Gly&#8211;Phe&#8211;Leu&#8211;Gly peptides and hydrazone bonds in the prodrug structure, LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 is degraded into small fragments, thus specifically triggering the intracellular release of DOX and Ce6 in the tumor microenvironment. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 with laser irradiation treatment significantly induces apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest. The combination treatment can not only suppress tumor growth, but also significantly reduce tumor metastasis compared with treatments with DOX or Ce6 through regulating EMT pathway, TGF&#946; pathway, angiogenesis, and the hypoxia pathway. LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 displays a synergistic chemo&#8208;photodynamic antitumor efficacy, resulting in a high inhibition in tumor growth and metastasis, while maintaining an excellent biosafety. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential of the biodegradable and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive LDBCs as an intelligent multifunctional drug&#8208;delivery vehicle for high&#8208;efficiency cancer combination therapy.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Cost and Air&#8208;Stable Rechargeable Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aluminum&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolyte composed of Al(ClO4)3&#183;9H2O and succinonitrile is developed for rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). The electrolyte is highly conductive, nonflammable, and air&#8208;stable. The charge/discharge process of this AIB follows Al3+ insertion/extraction, and three&#8208;electron transfer is realized.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserves, low cost, and high capacity of the Al anode. However, the development of AIBs is currently hindered by the usage of AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride electrolyte, which is expensive, highly corrosive, and extremely air&#8208;sensitive. Herein, a new hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of hydrated aluminum perchlorate and succinonitrile for low&#8208;cost, noncorrosive, and air&#8208;stable AIBs is reported. Crystal water in the hydrated aluminum perchlorate plays a vital role in forming the HEE, in which one H2O and five succinonitrile molecules coordinate with one Al3+ ion. The optimized ratio of Al(ClO4)3&#183;9H2O to succinonitrile is 1:12. When combining with the self&#8208;doped polyaniline cathode, the associated AIB delivers a high discharge capacity of 185 mAh g&#8722;1 over 300 cycles; and the charge/discharge mechanism in the HEE is studied experimentally and theoretically. The HEE is nonflammable, air&#8208;stable, and noncorrosive, thus enabling good air tolerance and facile fabrication of AIBs.

         <title>Controlled Activation of TRPV1 Channels on Microglia to Boost Their Autophagy for Clearance of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein and Enhance Therapy of Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized with accumulation of Lewy bodies with a major component of fibrillar alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn). Herein, we report the clearance of &#945;&#8208;syn to boost PD therapeutic efficacy by enhancing the autophagy of microglia via controlled opening of their surface TRPV1 channels with rationally designed photothermal nanoagent. We prepared Cu2&#8722;xSe&#8208;anti&#8208;TRPV1 nanoparticles (CS&#8208;AT NPs) to target the microglia and open their surface TRPV1 channels under the second near infrared (NIR&#8208;II) laser irradiation to cause influx of Ca2+ to activate ATG5 and Ca2+/CaMKK2/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, which promoted phagocytosis and degradation of &#945;&#8208;syn. By using focused ultrasound, we efficiently delivered CS&#8208;AT NPs into striatum of PD mice with high expression of TRPV1 receptors. We demonstrate that the athletic ability of PD mice treated by CS&#8208;AT NPs and NIR&#8208;II irradiation was significantly improved due to the phagocytotic clearance of &#945;&#8208;syn by microglia with enhanced autophagy. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, ionized calcium binding adapter protein 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein and pSer129&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn (p&#8208;&#945;&#8208;syn) of treated PD mice were almost recovered to the normal levels of healthy mice. Our study provides insights into the activation of microglial autophagy by targeting surface ion channels to improve the treatment of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract
Organic semiconducting emitters integrated with butterfly&#8208;mimetic photonic crystals (PhCs) are fascinating for dramatic advantages over light outcoupling efficiency and multifunctional strain sensors, as well as the key step toward electrically pumped lasers. Herein, we report an unprecedentedly direct mesoscale self&#8208;assembly into one&#8208;dimensional PhCs, through a covalently gridization&#8208;driven approach of wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymers. A simple solvent&#8208;casting procedure allows for in&#8208;situ self&#8208;assembly of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated nanopolymer, poly{[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]grid}&#8208;co&#8208;{[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]grid} (PODPFG), into well&#8208;defined multilayer architectures with an excellent toughness (30&#8764;40 J m&#8211;3). This ordered meso&#8208;architecture shows a typical Bragg&#8208;Snell diffraction behavior to testify the PhC nature, along with a high effective refractive index (1.80&#8764;1.88) and optical transmittance (85&#8764;87%). The PhC films also exhibit an angle&#8208;dependent blue/green photoluminescence switching, an electroluminescence efficiency enhancement by 150%&#8764;250%, and an amplified spontaneous emission enhancement with ultralow waveguide loss coefficient (2.60 cm&#8211;1). Gridization of organic semiconductors offers promising opportunities for cross&#8208;scale morphology&#8208;directed molecular design in multifunctional organic mechatronics and intelligences.

         <title>Tailoring Aggregation Extent of Photosensitizers to Boost Phototherapy Potency for Eliciting Systemic Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discretely integrated nanofabrication platform (named Pt&#8208;ICG/PES) is reported to boost phototherapy potency and antitumor immunity. Tailoring the aggregation extent of indocyanine green (ICG) to an optimized state can simultaneously relieve photobleaching and aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching effects, maximizing phototherapy efficiency. Equipped with photodynamic therapy/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES magnifies immunogenic cell death effect, exerting synergistic promotion effect of antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Phototherapy is effective for triggering the immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect. However, its efficacy is limited by low 1O2&#160;generation and photothermal conversion efficacy due to two irreconcilable obstacles, namely the aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching (ACQ) effect and photobleaching. In this work, a discretely integrated nanofabrication (DIN) platform (Pt&#8208;ICG/PES) is developed by facile coordination coassembly of cisplatin (Pt), photosensitizer molecules (indocyanine green (ICG)), and polymeric spacer (p(MEO2MA&#8208;co&#8208;OEGMA)&#8208;b&#8208;pSS (PES)). By controlling the ICG/PES feeding ratio, the aggregation of ICG can be easily tailored using PES as an isolator to balance the ACQ effect and photobleaching, thereby maximizing the phototherapy potency of Pt&#8208;ICG/PES. With the optimized ratio of each component, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES integrates the complementarity of photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and chemotherapeutics to magnify the ICD effect, exerting a synergistic antitumor immunity&#8208;promoting effect. Additionally, temperature&#8208;sensitive PES enables photothermally guided drug delivery. In a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES elicits effective release of danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns, dendritic cell maturation, cytotoxic T lymphocytes activation, cytokine secretion, M2&#160;macrophage repolarization, and distal tumor suppression, confirming the excellent in situ tumor ICD effect as well as robust systematic antitumor immunity. Ultimately, a versatile DIN strategy is developed to optimize the phototherapeutic efficacy for improving antitumor effects and strengthening systemic antitumor immunity.

         <title>Oriented 2D Perovskite Wafers for Anisotropic X&#8208;ray Detection through a Fast Tableting Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new composition of 2D perovskite&#8212;4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bismuth iodide [(F&#8208;PEA)3BiI6] is reported, and large and oriented perovskite wafers over 1 cm2 are obtained through a facile and time&#8208;saving strategy by tableting disordered 2D perovskite powders. Consequently, the unique anisotropy of four&#8208;times conductivity difference between the vertical and lateral directions enables great potential application in hard X&#8208;ray detection.








Abstract
2D perovskite single crystals have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials owing to their unique anisotropic properties. However, growing large 2D perovskite single crystals remains challenging and time&#8208;consuming. Here, a new composition of lead&#8208;free 2D perovskite&#8212;4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bismuth iodide [(F&#8208;PEA)3BiI6] is reported. An oriented bulk 2D wafer with a large area of 1.33 cm2 is obtained by tableting disordered 2D perovskite powders, resulting in anisotropic resistivities of 5 &#215; 1010 and 2 &#215; 1011&#160;&#937; cm in the lateral and vertical directions, respectively. Trivalent Bi3+ ions are employed to achieve a stronger ionic bonding energy with I&#8208; ions, which intrinsically suppress the ion&#8208;migration effect. Thus, the oriented wafer presents good capabilities in both charge collection and ion&#8208;migration suppression under a large applied bias along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, making it suitable for low&#8208;dosage X&#8208;ray detection. The large&#8208;area wafer shows a sensitive response to hard X&#8208;rays operated at a tube voltage of 120 kVp with the lowest detectable dose rate of 30 nGy s&#8208;1. Thus, the fast tableting process is a facile and effective strategy to synthesize large&#8208;area, oriented 2D wafers, showing excellent X&#8208;ray detection performance and operational stability that are comparable to those of 2D perovskite single crystals.

         <title>Redistributed Current Density in Lateral Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors Enabling Uniform Area Emission with Good Stability and Arbitrary Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of lateral organic light&#8208;emitting transistor with the incorporation of a charge&#8208;transport buffer layer (CTB&#8208;OLET) affords uniform RGB area emission with good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 106), high loop stability, and arbitrary tunability, enabling a high aperture ratio of over 80%, suggesting its great potential for next&#8208;generation display technology.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), integrating the functions of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) and organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) in a single device, are promising for the next&#8208;generation display technology. However, the great challenge of achieving uniform area emission in OLETs with good stability and arbitrary tunability hinders their development in this field. Herein, an effective solution to obtain well&#8208;defined area emission in lateral OLETs by incorporating a charge&#8208;transport buffer (CTB) layer between the conducting channel and emitting layer is proposed. Comprehensive theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate redistributed potential beneath the drain electrode under the shielding effect of the CBT layer, resulting in a highly uniform current density. In this case, uniform recombination of balanced holes and electrons can be guaranteed, which is essential for the formation of area emission in the following OLETs. RGB OLETs with uniform area emission are constructed, which show good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 106), high loop stability (over 200 cycles) and high aperture ratio (over 80%) due to the arbitrary tunability of the device geometry.

     alt="Redistributed Current Density in Lateral Organic Light-Emitting Transistors Enabling Uniform Area Emission with Good Stability and Arbitrary Tunability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel kind of lateral organic light-emitting transistor with the incorporation of a charge-transport buffer layer (CTB-OLET) affords uniform RGB area emission with good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;), high loop stability, and arbitrary tunability, enabling a high aperture ratio of over 80%, suggesting its great potential for next-generation display technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic light-emitting transistors (OLETs), integrating the functions of an organic field-effect transistor (OFET) and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) in a single device, are promising for the next-generation display technology. However, the great challenge of achieving uniform area emission in OLETs with good stability and arbitrary tunability hinders their development in this field. Herein, an effective solution to obtain well-defined area emission in lateral OLETs by incorporating a charge-transport buffer (CTB) layer between the conducting channel and emitting layer is proposed. Comprehensive theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate redistributed potential beneath the drain electrode under the shielding effect of the CBT layer, resulting in a highly uniform current density. In this case, uniform recombination of balanced holes and electrons can be guaranteed, which is essential for the formation of area emission in the following OLETs. RGB OLETs with uniform area emission are constructed, which show good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;), high loop stability (over 200 cycles) and high aperture ratio (over 80%) due to the arbitrary tunability of the device geometry. This work provides a new avenue for constructing area-emission lateral OLETs, which have great potential for display technology because of their good compatibility with conventional fabrication techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Assembling Diverse Skyrmionic Phases in Fe3GeTe2 Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Skyrmionic magnetic states are promising in advanced spintronics. Such topic is experiencing recent progresses in 2D magnets, with, e.g., a near 300K Curie temperature observed in Fe3GeTe2. However, despite previous studies reporting skyrmions in Fe3GeTe2, such system remains elusive since it has been reported to host either N&#233;el&#8208;type or Bloch&#8208;type textures, while a net Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction (DMI) cannot occur in this compound for symmetry reason. It is thus desirable to develop an accurate model to deeply understand Fe3GeTe2. Here, we apply a newly developed method adopting spin invariants to build a first&#8208;principle&#8208;based Hamiltonian, which (i) predicts colorful topological defects assembled from the unit of Bloch lines, and (ii) reveals the critical role of specific forms of fourth&#8208;order interactions in Fe3GeTe2. Rather than DMI, it is the multiple fourth&#8208;order interactions, with symmetry and spin&#8208;orbit couplings considered, that stabilize both N&#233;el&#8208;type and Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions, as well as antiskyrmions, without any preference for clockwise versus counterclockwise spin rotation. Our study also demonstrates that spin invariants can be used as a general approach to study complex magnetic interactions.

         <title>Circular Polarized Light Emission in Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chiral inorganic nanostructures strongly interact with photons changing their polarization state. The resulting circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) has cross&#8208;disciplinary importance for a variety of chemical/biological processes and is essential for development of chiral photonics. However, the polarization effects are often complex and could be misinterpreted. CPLE in nanostructured media has multiple origins and several optical effects are typically convoluted into a single output. Analysing CPLE data obtained for nanoclusters, NPs, nanoassemblies, and nanocomposites from metals, chalcogenides, perovskite, and other nanostructures, we show that there are several distinct groups of nanomaterials for which CPLE is dominated either by circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) or circularly polarized scattering (CPS); there are also many nanomaterials for which they are comparable. We also show that (1) CPL and CPS contributions involve light&#8208;matter interactions at different structural levels; (2) contribution from CPS is especially strong for nanostructured microparticles, nanoassemblies and composites; and (3) engineering of materials with strongly polarized light emission requires synergistic implementation of CPL and CPS effects. These findings are expected to guide development of CPLE materials in a variety of technological fields, including 3D displays, information storage, biosensors, optical spintronics, and biological probes.

         <title>Multilayer WSe2/MoS2 heterojunction phototransistors through periodically arrayed nanopore structures for bandgap engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising building blocks for various optoelectronic applications, limitations remain for multilayered TMD&#8208;based photodetectors: an indirect bandgap and a short carrier lifetime by strongly bound excitons. Accordingly, multilayered TMDs with a direct bandgap and an enhanced carrier lifetime are required for the development of various optoelectronic devices. Here, we propose periodically arrayed nanopore structures (PANS) for improving the efficiency of multilayered p&#8208;WSe2/n&#8208;MoS2 phototransistors. We performed density functional theory calculations as well as photoluminescence and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence measurements to characterize the photodetector figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit of multilayered p&#8208;WSe2/n&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures with PANS. The characteristics of the heterojunction devices with PANS reveal an enhanced responsivity and detectivity measured under 405&#160;nm laser excitation, which at 1.7 &#215; 104 AW&#8211;1 and 1.7 &#215; 1013 Jones are almost two orders of magnitude higher than those of pristine devices, 3.6 &#215; 102 AW&#8211;1 and 3.6 &#215; 1011 Jones, respectively. Such enhanced optical properties of WSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions with PANS represent a significant step toward next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Syntheses of 2D Materials: Flash Joule Heating and Other Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although studied for decades, 2D materials have often struggled to surpass small scales. Recent progress in the larger&#8208;scale synthesis of graphene represents an exciting paradigm shift. An overview of scalable graphene powder and film production is provided, addressing industrial and academic trends, and specifically highlighting flash Joule heating methods.








Abstract
In the past 17 years, the larger&#8208;scale production of graphene and graphene family materials has proven difficult and costly, thus slowing wider&#8208;scale commercial applications. The quality of the graphene that is prepared on larger scales has often been poor, demonstrating a need for improved quality controls. Here, current industrial graphene synthetic and analytical methods, as well as recent academic advancements in larger&#8208;scale or sustainable synthesis of graphene, defined here as weights more than 200 mg or films larger than 200 cm2, are compiled and reviewed. There is a specific emphasis on recent research in the use of flash Joule heating as a rapid, efficient, and scalable method to produce graphene and other 2D nanomaterials. Reactor design, synthetic strategies, safety considerations, feedstock selection, Raman spectroscopy, and future outlooks for flash Joule heating syntheses are presented. To conclude, the remaining challenges and opportunities in the larger&#8208;scale synthesis of graphene and a perspective on the broader use of flash Joule heating for larger&#8208;scale 2D materials synthesis are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;Although studied for decades, 2D materials have often struggled to surpass small scales. Recent progress in the larger-scale synthesis of graphene represents an exciting paradigm shift. An overview of scalable graphene powder and film production is provided, addressing industrial and academic trends, and specifically highlighting flash Joule heating methods.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 17 years, the larger-scale production of graphene and graphene family materials has proven difficult and costly, thus slowing wider-scale commercial applications. The quality of the graphene that is prepared on larger scales has often been poor, demonstrating a need for improved quality controls. Here, current industrial graphene synthetic and analytical methods, as well as recent academic advancements in larger-scale or sustainable synthesis of graphene, defined here as weights more than 200 mg or films larger than 200 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, are compiled and reviewed. There is a specific emphasis on recent research in the use of flash Joule heating as a rapid, efficient, and scalable method to produce graphene and other 2D nanomaterials. Reactor design, synthetic strategies, safety considerations, feedstock selection, Raman spectroscopy, and future outlooks for flash Joule heating syntheses are presented. To conclude, the remaining challenges and opportunities in the larger-scale synthesis of graphene and a perspective on the broader use of flash Joule heating for larger-scale 2D materials synthesis are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orchestrated Yolk&#8208;Shell Nanohybrids Regulate Macrophage Polarization and Dendritic Cell Maturation for Oncotherapy with Augmented Antitumor Immunity</title>

Abstract
The protumoral and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) greatly limit the antitumor immune responses of nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we explore the intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of orchestrated nanoparticles and their ability to simultaneously trigger tumor antigen release, thereby reversing immunosuppression and achieving potent antitumor immunity and augmented cancer therapy. By optimizing both the composition and morphology, a facile strategy is proposed to construct yolk&#8208;shell nanohybrids (Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA, FCMP). The intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of FCMP are utilized to reprogram macrophages to M1 phenotype and induce the maturation of dendritic cells, which regulate the immunosuppressive TME. In addition, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of FCMP contribute to amplified immunogenic cell death induced by multi&#8208;augmented chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and synergistic tumor treatment. Taking advantage of the unique yolk&#8208;shell structure, accurate T1&#8208;T2 dual&#8208;mode magnetic resonance imaging can be realized and CDT can be maximized through sufficient exposure of both the Fe3O4 core and MnO2 shell. Potent antitumor effects are found to substantially inhibit the growth of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the strategy could be extended to the synthesis of other yolk&#8208;shell nanohybrids with tailored properties since the cores are tunable. This work establishes a novel strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoplatforms with yolk&#8208;shell structure for effective cancer therapy with immunomodulation&#8208;enhanced antitumor immunity.

         <title>P&#8208;doped NiTe2 with Te&#8208;vacancies in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Prevents Shuttling and Promotes Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have been hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish polysulfide conversion kinetics. Here, a P&#8208;doped nickel tellurium electrocatalyst with Te&#8208; vacancies (P&#8834;NiTe2&#8208;x) anchored on maize&#8208;straw carbon (MSC) nanosheets, served as a functional layer (MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8208;x) on the separator of high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries. The P&#8834;NiTe2&#8208;x electrocatalyst enhanced the intrinsic conductivity, strengthened the chemical affinity for polysulfides, and accelerated sulfur redox conversion. The MSC nanosheets enabled NiTe2 nanoparticle dispersion and Li+ diffusion. In&#8208;situ Raman and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra confirmed that the MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8208;x restrained the shuttle effect and accelerated the redox conversion. The MSC/P&#8834;NiTe2&#8208;x&#8208;based cell had a cyclability of 637 mAh g&#8211;1 at 4 C over 1800 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.0139% per cycle, high rate performance of 726 mAh g&#8211;1 at 6 C, and a high areal capacity of 8.47 mAh cm&#8211;2 under a sulfur configuration of 10.2&#160;mg cm&#8211;2, and a low electrolyte/sulfur usage ratio of 3.9. This work demonstrates that vacancy&#8208;induced doping of heterogeneous atoms enables durable sulfur electrochemistry and could impact future electrocatalytic designs related to various energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>A Facile, Protein&#8208;derived Supramolecular Theranostic Strategy for Multimodal&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided Photodynamic and Photothermal Immunotherapy in vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Theranostic systems that permit both diagnosis and treatment in vivo are highly appealing means by which to meet the demands of precision medicine. However, most such systems remain subject to issues related to complex molecular design and synthesis, potential toxicity, and possible photoactivity changes. Herein, we propose a novel supramolecular theranostic strategy involving biomarker protein activation (BPA) and a host&#8208;guest strategy. To exemplify BPA, we demonstrate a facile &#8220;one&#8208;for&#8208;all&#8221; nanotheranostic agent for both albumin detection and cancer treatment that utilizes a nanoparticulate heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY dye derivative (B4 NPs). The fluorescence and photoactivity of BODIPY dyes are completely suppressed by aggregation&#8208;induced self&#8208;quenching in the nanoparticulate state. However, a Balb/c nude mouse model was used to confirm that, following the disassembly of injected B4 NPs, BODIPY specifically binds albumin in vivo, accompanied by significantly enhanced biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). More importantly, our supramolecular host&#8208;guest BPA strategy enables the resultant nanoplatform to act as a facile and efficient strategy for photodynamic and photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Structural Insights into Multi&#8208;Metal Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic approach exploring the complex structure of multi&#8208;metal oxide electrocatalysts is developed to obtain high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. A detailed model study of uniform&#8208;sized Mn&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and Co&#8208;containing oxide nanoparticles reveals that the incorporation of Co tunes the geometric and electronic structure of Mn active sites, elucidating the catalytic origin of the remarkable ORR activity.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;metal oxide (MMO) materials have significant potential to facilitate various demanding reactions by providing additional degrees of freedom in catalyst design. However, a fundamental understanding of the (electro)catalytic activity of MMOs is limited because of the intrinsic complexity of their multi&#8208;element nature. Additional complexities arise when MMO catalysts have crystalline structures with two different metal site occupancies, such as the spinel structure, which makes it more challenging to investigate the origin of the (electro)catalytic activity of MMOs. Here, uniform&#8208;sized multi&#8208;metal spinel oxide nanoparticles composed of Mn, Co, and Fe as model MMO electrocatalysts are synthesized and the contributions of each element to the structural flexibility of the spinel oxides are systematically studied, which boosts the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Detailed crystal and electronic structure characterizations combined with electrochemical and computational studies reveal that the incorporation of Co not only increases the preferential octahedral site occupancy, but also modifies the electronic state of the ORR&#8208;active Mn site to enhance the intrinsic ORR activity. As a result, nanoparticles of the optimized catalyst, Co0.25Mn0.75Fe2.0&#8208;MMO, exhibit a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.904&#160;V (versus RHE) and mass activity of 46.9 A goxide&#8722;1 (at 0.9&#160;V versus RHE) with promising stability.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (at 0.9&#160;V versus RHE) with promising stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Interfacial Modification and Crystallization Control by Biguanide Hydrochloride for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with PCE of 24.4%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl) is used at the tin oxide/perovskite interface for simultaneous interfacial modification and crystallization control. Assisted by Lewis coordination, electrostatic coupling and hydrogen bond anchoring between BGCl and its neighbors, better energetic alignment, reduced interfacial defects, and homogeneous perovskite crystallites are achieved, yielding an impressive power conversion efficiency of 24.4% and long&#8208;term device stability.








Abstract
Interfacial modification, which serves multiple roles, is vital for the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Here, a multifunctional interfacial material, biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl), is introduced between tin oxide (SnO2) and perovskite to enhance electron extraction, as well as the crystal growth of the perovskite. The BGCl can chemically link to the SnO2 through Lewis coordination/electrostatic coupling and help to anchor the PbI2. Better energetic alignment, reduced interfacial defects, and homogeneous perovskite crystallites are achieved, yielding an impressive certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4%, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19&#160;V and a drastically improved fill factor of 82.4%. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 95% of its initial PCE after aging for over 500 h at 20&#160;&#176;C and 30% relative humidity in ambient conditions. These results suggest that the incorporation of BGCl is a promising strategy to modify the interface and control the crystallization of the perovskite, toward the attainment of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells as well as other perovskite&#8208;based electronics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Blockade of PD&#8208;L1 with Bacteria&#8208;Derived Outer&#8208;Membrane Vesicle for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An LyP1 polypeptide&#8208;modified outer&#8208;membrane vesicle loaded with a PD&#8208;1 plasmid is developed for inducing the self&#8208;expression of PD&#8208;1 by tumor cells and achieving self&#8208;blockade of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway. The outer&#8208;membrane protein component can recruit cytotoxic lymphocyte cells and natural killer cells to tumor microenvironment, further improving the antitumor activity of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 self&#8208;blocking therapy.








Abstract
The checkpoint inhibitor therapy that blocks programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) and its major ligand PD&#8208;L1 has achieved encouraging clinical efficacy in certain cancers. However, the binding of checkpoint inhibitors with other immune cells that express PD&#8208;L1 often results in a low response rate to the blockade and severe adverse effects. Herein, an LyP1 polypeptide&#8208;modified outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (LOMV) loaded with a PD&#8208;1 plasmid is developed to achieve self&#8208;blockade of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. The nanocarriers accumulate in the tumor tissue through OMV&#8208;targeting ability and are internalized into the tumor cells via the LyP1&#8208;mediated target, subsequently delivering PD&#8208;1 plasmid into the nucleus, leading to the expression of PD&#8208;1 by the tumor cells. In addition, a magnetic particle chemiluminescence kit is developed to quantitatively detect the binding rate of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1. The self&#8208;expressed PD&#8208;1 bonded with the PD&#8208;L1 is expressed by both autologous and neighboring tumor cells, achieving self&#8208;blockade. Simultaneously, the outer&#8208;membrane protein of LOMV recruits cytotoxic lymphocyte cells and natural killer cells to tumor tissues and stimulates them to secrete IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8202;&#8202;, improving the antitumor activity of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 self&#8208;blocking therapy.

         <title>A &#8220;Pre&#8208;Constrained Metal Twins&#8221; Strategy to Prepare Efficient Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Cooperative Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained metal twin&#8221; strategy is presented for the first time to prepare dual&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts (FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC) with continuous FeN4 and CoN4. The FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC delivers excellent catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and Zn&#8211;air batteries. The synergistic effect between the two metals optimizes the free energy of the oxygen intermediate state, resulting in improved performance.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts (DACs) are a novel frontier in oxygen electrocatalysis, boasting functional and electronic synergies between contiguous metal centers and higher catalytic activities than single&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts. However, the definition and catalytic mechanism of DACs configurations remain unclear. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained metal twins&#8221; strategy is proposed to prepare contiguous FeN4 and CoN4 DACs with homogeneous conformations embedded in a N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC). A programmable phthalocyanines dimer is used as a structural moiety to anchor the bimetallic sites (containing Co and Fe) in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to achieve delocalized dispersion before pyrolysis. The resultant FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergetic interaction of adjacent metals optimizes the d&#8208;band center position of metal centers and balances the free energy of the *O intermediate, thereby improving the oxygen electrocatalytic activity. This work opens up an avenue for the rational design of DACs with tailored electronic structures and uniform geometric configurations.

         <title>Anisotropic Carrier Mobility from 2H WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic carrier mobility is realized in 2H WSe2. The intrinsic screening layer responds to the electrical anisotropy, which is confirmed by theoretical calculations and experimental results, excluding phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering. The electrical anisotropy provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties and is an essential step for exploring and integrating transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) transistors in multi&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic devices.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with 2H phase are expected to be building blocks in next&#8208;generation electronics; however, they suffer from electrical anisotropy, which is the basics for multi&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic devices, digital inverters, and anisotropic memtransistors, which are highly desired in neuromorphic computing. Herein, the anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe2 is reported, where the anisotropic degree of carrier mobility spans from 0.16 to 0.95 for various WSe2 field&#8208;effect transistors under a gate voltage of &#8722;60&#160;V. Phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering are excluded for anisotropic mobility. An intrinsic screening layer is proposed and confirmed by Z&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging to respond to the electrical anisotropy. Seven types of intrinsic screening layers are created and calculated by density functional theory to evaluate the modulated electronic structures, effective masses, and scattering intensities, resulting in anisotropic mobility. The discovery of anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe2 provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties of 2H TMDCs and fertile ground for exploring and integrating TMDC electronic transistors with better performance along the direction of high mobility.

         <title>Interface Engineering Between Multi&#8208;Elemental Alloy Nanoparticles and a Carbon Support Toward Stable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach is used to improve the stability (e.g., nanoparticle agglomeration) of multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles on a carbon substrate. MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon catalysts with a hierarchical structure are synthesized via a high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method. The catalysts show excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, holding great potential for a range of catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles have recently received notable attention owing to their high activity and superior phase stability. Previous syntheses of MEA nanoparticles mainly used carbon as the support, owing to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and tunable defective sites. However, the interfacial stability issue, such as nanoparticle agglomeration, remains outstanding due to poor interfacial binding between MEA and carbon. Such a problem often causes performance decay when MEA nanoparticles are used as catalysts, hindering their practical applications. Herein, an interface engineering strategy is developed to synthesize MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon hierarchical catalysts, where the oxide on carbon helps disperse and stabilize the MEA nanoparticles toward superior thermal and electrochemical stability. Using several MEA compositions (PdRuRh, PtPdIrRuRh, and PdRuRhFeCoNi) and oxides (TiO2 and Cr2O3) as model systems, it is shown that adding the oxide renders superior interfacial stability and therefore excellent catalytic performance. Excellent thermal stability is demonstrated under transmission electron microscopy with in situ heating up to 1023 K, as well as via long&#8208;term cycling (&gt;370 hours) of a Li&#8211;O2 battery as a harsh electrochemical condition to challenge the catalyst stability. This work offers a new route toward constructing efficient and stable catalysts for various applications.

         <title>High performance in&#8208;memory photodetector realized by charge storage in van der Waals MISFET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The emerging data&#8208;intensive applications in optoelectronics are driving innovation towards the fused integration of sensing, memory, and computing to break through the restrictions of von Neumann architecture. However, the present photodetectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multi&#8208;functions required in single devices. Here, a novel route for the integration of non&#8208;volatile memory into a photodetector is proposed with a WSe2/h&#8208;BN van der Waals heterostructure on Si/SiO2 substrate to realize the in&#8208;memory photodetection. Our photodetector exhibits an ultra&#8208;high readout photocurrent of 3.4 &#956;A and photoresponsivity of 337.8 AW&#8211;1 in the solar&#8208;blind wavelength region, together with an extended retention time of more than 10 years. Furthermore, the charge storage&#8208;based non&#8208;volatile mechanism of h&#8208;BN/SiO2 has been successfully proven for the first time through a novel analysis of in&#8208;situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. Our results represent a leap forward to future applications and insightful mechanisms of in&#8208;memory photodetection.

         <title>Stretchable Mesh Nanoelectronics for Three&#8208;Dimensional Single&#8208;Cell Chronic Electrophysiology from Developing Brain Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived brain organoids have shown great potential for studies of human brain development and neurological disorders. However, quantifying the evolution of the electrical properties of brain organoids during development is currently limited by the measurement techniques, which cannot provide long&#8208;term stable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) bioelectrical interfaces with developing brain organoids. Here, we report a cyborg brain organoid platform, in which &#8220;tissue&#8208;like&#8221; stretchable mesh nanoelectronics are designed to match the mechanical properties of brain organoids and to be folded by the organogenetic process of progenitor or stem cells, distributing stretchable electrode arrays across the 3D organoids. The tissue&#8208;wide integrated stretchable electrode arrays show no interruption to brain organoid development, adapt to the volume and morphological changes during brain organoid organogenesis, and provide long&#8208;term stable electrical contacts with neurons within brain organoids during development. The seamless and non&#8208;invasive coupling of electrodes to neurons enables long&#8208;term stable, continuous recording and captures the emergence of single&#8208;cell action potentials from early&#8208;stage brain organoid development.

         <title>Universal Strategy for Growing Tenacious Hydrogel Coating from a Sticky Initiation Layer (SIL)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controllably coating the surfaces of substrates/medical devices with hydrogels exhibits great application potential, but lacks universal techniques. Herein, a new method, namely ultraviolet triggered surface catalytically initiated radical polymerization (UV&#8208;SCIRP) from a sticky initiation layer (SIL) [SIL@ UV&#8208;SCIRP], is proposed for growing hydrogel coating, which involves three key steps: (1) depositing sticky polydopamine/Fe3+ coating on the surface of the substrates&#8208;SIL, (2) reducing Fe3+ ions to Fe2+ ions as active catalysts by UV illumination with the assistance of citric acid, and (3) conducting SCIRP in a monomer solution at room temperature for growing hydrogel coating. In this manner, practically any substrate surface (natural or artificial materials) can be modified by hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness and diverse compositions. The hydrogel coatings exhibit good interface bonding with substrates and enable easy changes in their wettability and lubrication performances. Importantly, this novel method facilitates the smooth growth of uniform hydrogel lubrication coatings on the surface of a range of medical devices with complex geometries. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the slippery balls coated with hydrogel exhibit smooth movement within the catheter and esophagus. Hence, this method can prove to be a pioneering universal modification tool, especially in surface/interface science and engineering.

         <title>Combating Complement's Deleterious Effects on Nanomedicine by Conjugating Complement Regulatory Proteins to Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When nanoscale drug carriers enter the blood, they are rapidly bound by complement proteins, such as C3, which mark the nanocarriers for clearance by phagocytes and produce an anaphylaxis&#8208;like reaction. In this work, nanocarriers are conjugated to the complement&#8208;cleaving enzyme Factor I, and it abrogates several major problems facing nanomedicine.








Abstract
Complement opsonization is among the biggest challenges facing nanomedicine. Nearly instantly after injection into blood, nanoparticles are opsonized by the complement protein C3, leading to clearance by phagocytes, fouling of targeting moieties, and release of anaphylatoxins. While surface polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) partially decrease complement opsonization, most nanoparticles still suffer from extensive complement opsonization, especially when linked to targeting moieties. To ameliorate the deleterious effects of complement, two of mammals&#8217; natural regulators of complement activation (RCAs), Factors H and I, are here conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles. In vitro, Factor H or I conjugation to PEG&#8208;coated nanoparticles decrease their C3 opsonization, and markedly reduce nanoparticle uptake by phagocytes. In an in vivo mouse model of sepsis&#8208;induced lung injury, Factor I conjugation abrogates nanoparticle uptake by intravascular phagocytes in the lungs, allowing the blood concentration of the nanoparticle to remain elevated much longer. For nanoparticles targeted to the lung's endothelium by conjugation to anti&#8208;ICAM antibodies, Factor I conjugation shifts the cell&#8208;type distribution away from phagocytes and toward endothelial cells. Finally, Factor I conjugation abrogates the severe anaphylactoid responses common to many nanoparticles, preventing systemic capillary leak and preserving blood flow to visceral organs and the brain. Thus, conjugation of RCAs, like Factor I, to nanoparticles is likely to help in nanomedicine's long battle against complement, improving several key parameters critical for clinical success.

         <title>Competitive Coordination&#8208;Oriented Monodispersed Ruthenium Sites in Conductive MOF/LDH Heteronanotree Catalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media</title>

Abstract
Rational exploration of efficient, inexpensive, and robust electrocatalysts is critical for the efficient water splitting. Conjugated conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) with multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to construct bifunctional heterostructure catalysts is considered an efficient but complicated strategy. Here, we report the fabrication of a cMOF/LDH heteronanotree catalyst (CoNiRu&#8208;NT) coupled with monodispersed ruthenium (Ru) sites via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy. Rich&#8208;amino hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) linkers coordinate with the LDH nanotrunk to form the cMOF nanobranch, providing numerous anchoring sites to precisely confine and stabilize Ru&#8208;N4 sites into the CoNiRu&#8208;NT heteronanotree structure. Moreover, monodispersed and reduced Ru moieties facilitate H2O adsorption and dissociation, and the heterointerface between the cMOF and LDH further modifies the chemical and electronic structures. The optimized heteronanotree array CoNiRu&#8208;NT displays a significant increase in electrochemical water splitting properties in alkaline media, affording low overpotentials of 22&#160;mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 and 255&#160;mV at 20 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. In an actual electrochemical system, heteronanotree CoNiRu&#8208;NT drives an overall water splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.47&#160;V to reach 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2. This performance is comparable to that of pure noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials and superior to that of mostly reported MOF&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Visible&#8208;blind ZnMgO Colloidal Quantum Dot Downconverters expand Silicon CMOS Sensors Spectral Coverage into Ultraviolet and enable UV Band Discrimination</title>

Abstract
Selective spectral detection of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is highly important across numerous fields from health and safety to industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Herein, we report a non&#8208;toxic, visible&#8208;blind, inorganic quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based sensing scheme that expands the spectral coverage of Silicon CMOS sensors into the UV, enabling efficient UV detection without affecting the sensor performance in the visible and UV&#8208;band discrimination. The reported scheme employs zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) QDs with compositionally tunable absorption across UV and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the visible. The efficient luminescence and large stokes shift of these QDs have been exploited herein to act as an efficient downconverting material that enhances the UV sensitivity of Si&#8208;photodetector (Si&#8208;PD). A Si&#8208;PD integrated with the QDs results in a nine&#8208;fold improvement in photoresponsivity from 0.83&#160;mA/W to 7.5&#160;mA/W at 260&#160;nm. Leveraging the tunability of these QDs we further report on a simple UV band identification scheme, using two distinct band gap ZnMgO QDs stacked in a tandem architecture whose spectral emission color depends on the UV&#8208;band excitation light. The downconverting stack enables facile discrimination of UV light using a standard CMOS image sensor (camera) or by the naked eye and avoids the use of complex optics.

Herein, we report a non-toxic, visible-blind, inorganic quantum dot (QD)-based sensing scheme that expands the spectral coverage of Silicon CMOS sensors into the UV, enabling efficient UV detection without affecting the sensor performance in the visible and UV-band discrimination. The reported scheme employs zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) QDs with compositionally tunable absorption across UV and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the visible. The efficient luminescence and large stokes shift of these QDs have been exploited herein to act as an efficient downconverting material that enhances the UV sensitivity of Si-photodetector (Si-PD).

Abstract
The primary roles of precision medicine are to perform real&#8208;time examination, administer on&#8208;demand medication, and apply instruments continuously. However, most current therapeutic systems implement these processes separately, leading to treatment interruption and limited recovery in patients. Personalized healthcare and smart medical treatment have greatly promoted research on and development of biosensing and drug delivery integrated systems, with intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) as typical systems, which have received increasing attention because of their non&#8208;invasive and customizable nature. This review focuses on the latest progress in research on IWMDs, including their mechanisms of integrating biosensing and on&#8208;demand drug delivery. The current challenges and future development directions of IWMDs are also discussed.

         <title>Elastic Plasmonic&#8208;Enhanced Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Cavities with Ultrasensitive Stretching Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel plasmon&#8208;enhanced stretchable Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities obtained by a catalytic self&#8208;embedding process of Au&#8208;nanodomes into elastomeric materials are demonstrated. The resulting FP resonances are amplified by the broad plasmonic resonances of the Au nanostructures and modulated by the scattering from the wrinkled surface. The optical response is highly mechanically tunable in both FP resonances intensity and spectral position.








Abstract
The emerging stretchable photonics field faces challenges, like the robust integration of optical elements into elastic matrices or the generation of large optomechanical effects. Here, the first stretchable plasmonic&#8208;enhanced and wrinkled Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities are demonstrated, which are composed of self&#8208;embedded arrays of Au nanostructures at controlled depths into elastomer films. The novel self&#8208;embedding process is triggered by the Au nanostructures&#8217; catalytic activity, which locally increases the polymer curing rate, thereby inducing a mechanical stress that simultaneously pulls the Au nanostructures into the polymer and forms a wrinkled skin layer. This geometry yields unprecedented optomechanical effects produced by the coupling of the broad plasmonic modes of the Au nanostructures and the FP modes, which are modulated by the wrinkled optical cavity. As a result, film stretching induces drastic changes in both the spectral position and intensity of the plasmonic&#8208;enhanced FP resonances due to the simultaneous cavity thickness reduction and cavity wrinkle flattening, thus increasing the cavity finesse. These optomechanical effects are exploited to demonstrate new strain&#8208;sensing approaches, achieving a strain detection limit of 0.006%, i.e., 16&#8208;fold lower than current optical strain&#8208;detection schemes.

         <title>An Asymmetry Field&#8208;Effect Phototransistor for Solving Large Exciton Binding Energy of 2D TMDCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric split&#8208;gate phototransistor configuration, called the &#8220;asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT) is demonstrated. The structure allows for an effective modulation of the electric&#8208;field profile throughout the channel, as well as enhanced photocarrier transport, thereby providing a new platform for improving optoelectronic properties and probing photocarrier dynamics in intrinsic 2D material layers.








Abstract
The probing of fundamental photophysics is a key prerequisite for the construction of diverse optoelectronic devices and circuits. To date, though, photocarrier dynamics in 2D materials remains unclear, plagued primarily by two issues: a large exciton binding energy, and the lack of a suitable system that enables the manipulation of excitons. Here, a WSe2&#8208;based phototransistor with an asymmetric split&#8208;gate configuration is demonstrated, which is named the &#8220;asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT). This structure allows for the effective modulation of the electric&#8208;field profile across the channel, thereby providing a standard device platform for exploring the photocarrier dynamics of the intrinsic WSe2 layer. By controlling the electric field, this work the spatial evolution of the photocurrent is observed, notably with a strong signal over the entire WSe2 channel. Using photocurrent and optical spectroscopy measurements, the physical origin of the novel photocurrent behavior is clarified and a room&#8208;temperature exciton binding energy of 210 meV is determined with the device. In the phototransistor geometry, lateral p&#8211;n junctions serve as a simultaneous pathway for both photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing photodetection. The study establishes a new device platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.

Here, a WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based phototransistor with an asymmetric split-gate configuration is demonstrated, which is named the &#8220;asymmetry field-effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT). This structure allows for the effective modulation of the electric-field profile across the channel, thereby providing a standard device platform for exploring the photocarrier dynamics of the intrinsic WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer. By controlling the electric field, this work the spatial evolution of the photocurrent is observed, notably with a strong signal over the entire WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel. Using photocurrent and optical spectroscopy measurements, the physical origin of the novel photocurrent behavior is clarified and a room-temperature exciton binding energy of 210 meV is determined with the device. In the phototransistor geometry, lateral p&#8211;n junctions serve as a simultaneous pathway for both photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing photodetection. The study establishes a new device platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Layer Number of 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOFs Towards Photocoupled Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding monolayer and bilayer 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be easily synthesized via bottom&#8208;up growth. Interestingly, a difference in the atomic layer number results in a distinct catalytic pathway of photocoupled electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The monolayer exhibits a high selectivity of C2 species, while the major products over the bilayer are C1 species. The photocoupled electrocatalytic mechanisms are further studied.








Abstract
Inspired by the success of graphene, a series of single&#8208; or few&#8208;layer 2D materials have been developed and applied in the past decade. Here, the successful preparation of monolayer and bilayer 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a facile solvothermal method is reported. The structure transition from monolayer to bilayer drives distinct electronic properties and restructuring behaviors, which finally results in distinct catalytic pathways towards CO2 electrocatalysis. The monolayer favors CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 pathway due to the restructuring of Cu&#63743;O4 sites, while CO and HCOO&#8722; are the major products over the bilayer. In photocoupled electrocatalysis, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the C2 compounds shows a nearly fourfold increase on the monolayer than that under dark conditions (FEC2 increases from 11.9% to 41.1% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V). For comparison, the light field plays a negligible effect on the bilayer. The light&#8208;induced selectivity optimization is investigated by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work opens up a novel possibility to tune the selectivity of carbon products just by tailoring the layer number of the 2D material.

         <title>Mixed Dimethylammonium/Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskite Crystals for Improved Structural Stability and Enhanced Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed technique termed solvent acidolysis crystallization (SAC) allows the growth of mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide crystals with the highest, as of yet, dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the perovskite cubic phase. This mixed cation composition not only suppresses the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition but also leads to improved photodetection capabilities both at room temperature and 200 K.








Abstract
The solvent acidolysis crystallization technique is utilized to grow mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide (DMA/MAPbBr3) crystals reaching the highest dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the 3D cubic perovskite phase. These mixed perovskite crystals show suppression of the orthorhombic phase and a lower tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;cubic phase&#8208;transition temperature compared to MAPbBr3. A distinct behavior is observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties of MAPbBr3 and mixed DMA/MAPbBr3 crystals due to the different organic cation dynamics governing the phase transition(s). Furthermore, lateral photodetectors based on these crystals show that, at room temperature, the mixed crystals possess higher detectivity compared to MAPbBr3 crystals caused by structural compression and reduced surface trap density. Remarkably, the mixed&#8208;crystal devices exhibit large enhancement in their detectivity below the phase&#8208;transition temperature (at 200 K), while for the MAPbBr3 devices only insignificant changes are observed. The high detectivity of the mixed crystals makes them attractive for visible&#8208;light communication and for space applications. The results highlight the importance of the synthetic technique for compositional engineering of halide perovskites that governs their structural and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Organic Electrochemical Diodes Enabled by Asymmetric Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric design of the organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor layer allows for the rectification of input signals with a high current density of over 30 kA cm&#8722;2 in an aqueous electrolyte. The operation mechanism is elucidated with the help of numerical analysis and in operando electrochemical potential mapping methods, and analog/digital circuits are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of these novel device architectures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding electrical/electrochemical performance, operational stability, mechanical flexibility, and decent biocompatibility, organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors have shown great potential as implantable electrodes for neural recording/stimulation and as active channels for signal switching/amplifying transistors. Nonetheless, no studies exist on a general design rule for high&#8208;performance electrochemical diodes, which are essential for highly functional circuit architectures. In this work, generalizable electrochemical diodes with a very high current density over 30 kA cm&#8722;2 are designed by introducing an asymmetric active layer based on organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors. The underlying mechanism on polarity&#8208;sensitive balanced ionic doping/dedoping is elucidated by numerical device analysis and in operando spectroelectrochemical potential mapping, while the general material requirements for electrochemical diode operation are deduced using various types of conjugated polymers. In parallel, analog signal rectification and digital logic processing circuits are successfully demonstrated to show the broad impact of circuits incorporating organic electrochemical diodes. It is expected that organic electrochemical diodes will play vital roles in realizing multifunctional soft bioelectronic circuitry in combination with organic electrochemical transistors.

Abstract
While halide perovskites have excellent optoelectronic properties, their poor stability is a major obstacle towards commercialization. There is a strong interest to move away from organic A&#8208;site cations such as methylammonium and formamidinium towards Cs with the aim of improving thermal stability of the perovskite layers. While the optoelectronic properties and the device performance of Cs&#8208;based all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskites are very good, they are still trailing behind those of perovskites that use organic cations. Here, we review the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of all inorganic perovskites for photovoltaic applications by performing detailed meta&#8208;analyses of key performance parameters on the cell and material level. We discuss key material properties such as carrier mobilities, external photoluminescence quantum efficiency, photoluminescence lifetime and compare what we know about defect tolerance in all&#8208;inorganic relative to hybrid (organic&#8208;inorganic) perovskites. Subsequently, we adopt a unified approach for analyzing performance losses in perovskite solar cells based on breaking down the losses into several figures of merit representing recombination losses, resistive losses and optical losses. Based on this detailed loss analysis, we eventually develop guidelines for future performance improvement of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Tackling Humidity with Designer Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Gas Sensing Soft Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Humidity influence in sensing of volatile organic compounds is tuned by materials design. The anions of ionic liquids tailor the gas sensing material's sensitivity to humidity, yielding either humidity&#8208;sensitive or humidity&#8208;tolerant odorant sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact, thereby contributing to the widespread field of artificial olfaction.








Abstract
Relative humidity is simultaneously a sensing target and a contaminant in gas and volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing systems, where strategies to control humidity interference are required. An unmet challenge is the creation of gas&#8208;sensitive materials where the response to humidity is controlled by the material itself. Here, humidity effects are controlled through the design of gelatin formulations in ionic liquids without and with liquid crystals as electrical and optical sensors, respectively. In this design, the anions [DCA]&#8722; and [Cl]&#8722; of room temperature ionic liquids from the 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium family tailor the response to humidity and, subsequently, sensing of VOCs in dry and humid conditions. Due to the combined effect of the materials formulations and sensing mechanisms, changing the anion from [DCA]&#8722; to the much more hygroscopic [Cl]&#8722;, leads to stronger electrical responses and much weaker optical responses to humidity. Thus, either humidity sensors or humidity&#8208;tolerant VOC sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact are obtained. With the wide spread of 3D&#8208; and 4D&#8208;printing and intelligent devices, the monitoring and tuning of humidity in sustainable biobased materials offers excellent opportunities in e&#8208;nose sensing arrays and wearable devices compatible with operation at room conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Humidity influence in sensing of volatile organic compounds is tuned by materials design. The anions of ionic liquids tailor the gas sensing material's sensitivity to humidity, yielding either humidity-sensitive or humidity-tolerant odorant sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact, thereby contributing to the widespread field of artificial olfaction.

         <title>An NIR Discrete Metallacycle Constructed from Perylene Bisimide and Tetraphenylethylene Fluorophores for Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Radio&#8208;Chemotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A theranostic metallacycle (M) is developed for imaging&#8208;guided cancer radio&#8208;chemotherapy using perylene bisimide fluorophore (PPy) and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based di&#8208;Pt(II) organometallic precursor (TPE&#8208;Pt) as building blocks. Guided by in vivo fluorescence imaging, radio&#8208;chemotherapy is precisely carried out, which facilitates boosting the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesired side effects.








Abstract
To promote the clinical theranostic performances of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, imaging capability is urgently desired, and their chemotherapeutic efficacy needs to be upgraded. Herein, a theranostic metallacycle (M) is developed for imaging&#8208;guided cancer radio&#8208;chemotherapy using perylene bisimide fluorophore (PPy) and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based di&#8208;Pt(II) organometallic precursor (TPE&#8208;Pt) as building blocks. The formation of this discrete supramolecular coordination complex facilitates the encapsulation of M by a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive amphiphilic block copolymer to prepare M&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MNPs). TPE&#8208;Pt acts as a chemotherapeutic drug and also an excellent radiosensitizer, thus incorporating radiotherapy into the nanomedicine to accelerate the therapeutic efficacy and overcome drug resistance. The NIR&#8208;emission of PPy is employed to detect the intracellular delivery and tissue distribution of MNPs in real time. In vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate the excellent anticancer efficacy combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy; the administration of this nanomedicine effectively inhibits the tumor growth and greatly extends the survival rate of cisplatin&#8208;resistant A2780CIS&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Guided by in vivo fluorescence imaging, radio&#8208;chemotherapy is precisely carried out, which facilitates boosting of the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesired side effects. The success of this theranostic system brings new hope to supramolecular nanomedicines for their potential clinical translations.

         <title>Guiding Transition Metal&#8208;Doped Hollow Cerium Tandem Nanozymes with Elaborately Regulated Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Activities for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme is developed, serving as an H2O2 homeostasis disruptor to promote H2O2 evolvement, restrain the off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2, and realize intensive nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy of tumor. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using the nanozyme for in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process.








Abstract
Clinical applications of nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy (NCDT) have been severely limited by the poor catalytic efficiency of nanozymes, insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, and its off&#8208;target consumption. Herein, the authors&#160;developed a hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme (PHMZCO&#8208;AT) with regulated multi&#8208;enzymatic activities, that is, the enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities and inhibition of catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity. PHMZCO&#8208;AT as a H2O2 homeostasis disruptor promotes H2O2 evolution and restrains off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2 to achieve intensive NCDT. PHMZCO&#8208;AT with SOD&#8208;like activity catalyzes endogenous superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) into H2O2 in the tumor region. The suppression of CAT activity and depletion of glutathione by PHMZCO&#8208;AT largely weaken the off&#8208;target decomposition of H2O2 to H2O. Elevated H2O2 is then catalyzed by the downstream POD&#8208;like activity of PHMZCO&#8208;AT to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, further inducing tumor apoptosis and death. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using PHMZCO&#8208;AT due to the existence of paramagnetic Mn2+ and the high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability of elemental Zr, permitting in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process. This work presents a typical paradigm to achieve intensive NCDT efficacy by regulating multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of nanozymes to perturb the H2O2 homeostasis.

         <title>POM Anolyte for All&#8208;Anion Redox Flow Batteries with High Capacity Retention and Coulombic Efficiency at Mild pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the multi&#8208;electron redox ability, structure stability, and high redox kinetics of {BW12} polyoxometalate (POM) anion anolyte at mild pH, all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries coupled with different catholyte anion exhibit very high capacity retention. An in&#8208;operando aqueous flowing Raman spectroscopy technique is also first constructed to investigate the structural revolution and stability of POMs anion during battery operation.








Abstract
A highly soluble Li5BW12O40 cluster delivers 2 e&#8722; redox reaction with fast electron transfer rates (2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2&#160;cm s&#8722;1) and high diffusion coefficients (&#8776;2.08 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1) at mild pH ranging from 3 to 8. In&#8208;operando aqueous&#8208;flowing Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Raman shift changing of {BW12} clusters is due to the bond length changing between W&#8208;Ob&#8208;W and W&#8208;Oc&#8208;W at different redox states. The structure changing and redox chemistry of Li5BW12O40 are highly reversible, which makes the Li5BW12O40 cluster versatile to construct all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The cation&#8208;exchange Nafion membrane will also repel the cross permeability of the anion redox couples. Consequently, by coupling with Li3K[Fe(CN)6] catholyte, the aqueous RFB can be operated at pH 8 with a capacity retention up to 95% and an average Coulombic efficiency more than 99.79% over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.2&#160;V. Meanwhile, Li5BW12O40 cluster can also be paired with LiI catholyte to form aqueous RFBs at pH 7 and pH 3, the capacity retention of 94% and 90% can be realized over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.3&#160;V.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Thick Ternary Organic Solar Cells via R2R&#8208;Compatible Slot&#8208;Die Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient, thick ternary organic solar cells are fabricated by roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R)&#8208;compatible slot&#8208;die coating via kinetics manipulation. A highly crystalline molecule, BTR&#8208;Cl, is incorporated, and the phase&#8208;separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. The molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends is improved, which results in high power conversion efficiencies of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300 nm, respectively.








Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has crossed the 18% mark for OSCs, which are largely fabricated by spin&#8208;coating, and the optimal photoactive thickness is limited to 100&#160;nm. To increase reproducibility of results with industrial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing, slot&#8208;die coating coupled with a ternary strategy for optimal performance of large&#8208;area, thick OSCs is used. Based on miscibility differences, a highly crystalline molecule, BTR&#8208;Cl, is incorporated, and the phase&#8208;separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. BTR&#8208;Cl provides an early liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and early aggregation of Y6, which slightly improves the molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends, resulting in high PCEs of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300&#160;nm, respectively. The ternary design strategy for large&#8208;area and thick films is further used to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency flexible devices, which promises reproducibility of the lab results from slot&#8208;die coating to industrial R2R manufacturing.

         <title>Reliable and Remote Monitoring of Absolute Temperature during Liver Inflammation via Luminescence&#8208;Lifetime&#8208;Based Nanothermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lifetime&#8208;based infrared luminescent nanothermometers are shown to be minimally affected by the effects of biological tissues on the propagation of photons. Real&#8208;time and reliable thermal monitoring of the liver of a mouse subjected to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced inflammation is achieved through the use of bright Ag2S nanoparticles. Remarkable thermal sensitivity (3% &#176;C&#8211;1 around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C) are obtained.








Abstract
Temperature of tissues and organs is one of the first parameters affected by physiological and pathological processes, such as metabolic activity, acute trauma, or infection&#8208;induced inflammation. Therefore, the onset and development of these processes can be detected by monitoring deviations from basal temperature. To accomplish this, minimally invasive, reliable, and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of internal organs is required. Luminescence nanothermometry is the ideal technology for meeting these requirements. Although this technique has lately undergone remarkable developments, its reliability is being questioned due to spectral distortions caused by biological tissues. In this work, how the use of bright Ag2S nanoparticles featuring temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence lifetime enables reliable and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of the liver in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced inflammation is demonstrated. Beyond the remarkable thermal sensitivity (&#8776; 3% &#176;C&#8211;1 around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution obtained (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C), the results included in this work set a blueprint for the development of new diagnostic procedures based on the use of intracorporeal temperature as a physiological indicator.

         <title>Microfluidic Screening&#8208;Assisted Machine Learning to Investigate Vertical Phase Separation of Small Molecule:Polymer Blend</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic channel embedded solution shearing is developed, which enables time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient generation and screening of thin&#8208;films of varying experimental conditions. Gaussian Process Regression algorithm tuned by Bayesian optimization is utilized to predict the transistor performance, optimize the experimental conditions, and investigate the vertical phase separation during solvent evaporation.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing is a widely utilized technique for the fabrication of various devices. In particular, the tunability of the ink composition and coating condition allows precise control of thin&#8208;film properties and device performance. Despite the advantage of having such tunability, the sheer number of possible combinations of experimental parameters render it infeasible to efficiently optimize device performance and analyze the correlation between experimental parameters and device performance. In this work, a microfluidic screening&#8208;embedded thin&#8208;film processing technique is developed, through which thin&#8208;films of varying ratios of small molecule semiconductor:polymer blend are simultaneously generated and screened in a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient manner. Moreover, utilizing the thin&#8208;films of varying combinations of experimental parameters, machine learning models are trained to predict the transistor performance. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithms tuned by Bayesian optimization shows the best predictive accuracy amongst the trained models, which enables narrowing down of the combinations of experimental parameters and investigation of the degree of vertical phase separation under the predicted parameter space. The technique can serve as a guideline for elucidating the underlying complex parameter&#8208;property&#8208;performance correlations in solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing, thereby accelerating the optimization of various thin&#8208;film devices in the future.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomachinery for Enhancement of Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8211;amorphous calcium phosphate nanomachine that induces extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils and regenerates new bone in a dynamic and programmable manner is developed. This multifunctional nanomachinery is comparable to the function of osteoblasts. The RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines that simulate physiological processes brings new opportunities and challenges to bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
The visionary idea that RNA adopts nonbiological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal. These RNA molecules have ample chemical functionality and self&#8208;assemble to form distinct nanostructures in response to external stimuli. They may be combined with inorganic materials to produce nanomachines that carry cargo to a target site in a controlled manner and respond dynamically to environmental changes. Comparable to biological cells, programmed RNA nanomachines have the potential to replicate bone healing in vitro. Here, an RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachine is developed, which accomplishes intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen scaffolds to mimic bone formation in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that noncovalent hydrogen bonding provides the energy source that initiates self&#8208;assembly of these nanomachines. Incorporation of the RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines into collagen scaffolds in vivo creates an osteoinductive microenvironment within a bone defect that is conducive to rapid biomineralization and osteogenesis. Addition of RNA&#8208;degrading enzymes into RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines further creates a stop signal that inhibits unwarranted bone formation in tissues. The potential of RNA in building functional nanostructures has been underestimated in the past. The concept of RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines participating in physiological processes may transform the nanoscopic world of life science.

         <title>Revealing the Sulfur Redox Paths in a Li&#8211;S Battery by an In Situ Hyphenated Technique of Electrochemistry and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of sulfur in a Li&#8211;S battery are very complicated and the evaluation of their mechanism is challenging. Many hidden information can be easily revealed by an in situ electrochemistry and mass spectrometry (EC&#8208;MS) and it shines a light for design novel catalyst and system for the Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is one of the most promising next generation energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific energy. However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides formed during cell operation is a crucial reason for the low cyclability suffered by current Li&#8211;S batteries. As a result, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the sulfur cathode redox reactions is urgently required for further advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, the direct observation of polysulfides in a Li&#8208;S battery is reported by an in situ hyphenated technique of electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. Several short&#8208;lived lithium polysulfide intermediates during sulfur redox have been identified. Furthermore, this method is applied to a mechanistic study of an electrocatalyst that has been observed to promote the polysulfides conversion in a Li&#8211;S cell. Through the abundance distributions of various polysulfides before and after adding the electrocatalyst, compelling experimental evidences of catalytic selectivity of cobalt phthalocyanine to those long&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediates are obtained. This work can provide guidance for the design of novel cathode to overcome the shuttle effect and facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics.

&lt;p&gt;The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is one of the most promising next generation energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific energy. However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides formed during cell operation is a crucial reason for the low cyclability suffered by current Li&#8211;S batteries. As a result, an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the sulfur cathode redox reactions is urgently required for further advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, the direct observation of polysulfides in a Li-S battery is reported by an in situ hyphenated technique of electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. Several short-lived lithium polysulfide intermediates during sulfur redox have been identified. Furthermore, this method is applied to a mechanistic study of an electrocatalyst that has been observed to promote the polysulfides conversion in a Li&#8211;S cell. Through the abundance distributions of various polysulfides before and after adding the electrocatalyst, compelling experimental evidences of catalytic selectivity of cobalt phthalocyanine to those long-chain polysulfide intermediates are obtained. This work can provide guidance for the design of novel cathode to overcome the shuttle effect and facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Long&#8208;Range Order from Freeform Disordered Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, disordered metasurface has attracted considerable interests due to the potential applications in imaging, holography, and wavefront shaping. However, how to emerge long&#8208;range ordered phase distribution in disordered metasurfaces remains an outstanding problem. Here, a general framework is proposed to generate spatially homogenous in&#8208;plane phase distribution from disordered metasurface, by engineering disorder parameters together with topology optimization. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an all&#8208;dielectric disordered supercell metasurface with relatively homogeneous in&#8208;plane phase fluctuation is designed by disorder parameter engineering, manifesting as polarization conversion&#8208;dependent random scattering or unidirectional transmission. Then, topology optimization approach is utilized to overcome the lattice coupling effect and to further improve the homogeneity of complex electric field fluctuation. In comparison with initial supercell metasurface, the phase fluctuation range and relative efficiency of topology&#8208;optimized freeform metasurface are significantly improved, leading to long&#8208;range ordered electric field distribution. Moreover, three experimental realizations are performed, all of which agree well with theoretical results. This methodology may inspire more exotic optical phenomena and find more promising applications in disordered metasurfaces and disordered&#160;optics.

         <title>Efficient Single&#8208;Emitter Plasmonic Patch Antenna Fabrication by Deterministic in Situ Optical Lithography using Spatially Modulated Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;emitter plasmonic patch antennas are room&#8208;temperature deterministic single photon sources, which exhibit highly accelerated and directed single photon emission. However, for efficient operation these structures require three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale deterministic control of emitter positioning within the device, which is a demanding task, esp. when emitter damage during fabrication is a major concern. To overcome this limitation, our deterministic room&#8208;temperature in situ optical lithography protocol uses spatially modulated light to position a plasmonic structure non&#8208;destructively on any selected single&#8208;emitter with three&#8208;dimensional nanoscale control. In this paper the emission statistics of such plasmonic antennas that embed a deterministically positioned single colloidal CdSe/CdS quantum dot that highlight acceleration and brightness of emission are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the presented antenna induces a 1000&#8208;fold effective increase in the absorption cross&#8208;section, and under high pumping, these antennas show nonlinearly enhanced emission.

         <title>Sulfuration of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based Cathode Materials for Multi&#8208;Anionic Redox and Stabilized Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich transition metal oxides (LLOs) can deliver high specific capacity over 250 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, stemming from additional contribution of oxygen redox. However, the formation of O(2&#8211;n)&#8208; (0&lt;n&lt;2) species and even oxygen gas during the deep oxidation stage lead to progressive structural transformation that cause the voltage decay / hysteresis, sluggish kinetics and poor thermo&#8208;stability, preventing the real&#8208;world application of LLOs. Therefore, the substantive key relies in enhancing the anionic redox stability in LLOs. Here, we have purposed a sulfuration procedure of LLOs (S&#8208;LLOs), in which sulfur anions incorporate into oxygen sites in the lattice structure and form polyanions on the surface. Proved by structural characterizations and DFT calculations, sulfur anions in the interior lattice can reversibly participate in the redox process and enhance the integral coordination stability by mitigating undesired oxygen redox. Moreover, S polyanions at surface form a protecting layer for interfacial stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that S&#8208;LLO demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 307.8 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1, an outstanding capacity retention rate of 91.5% after 200 cycles, along with excellent voltage maintenance, rate capability and thermo&#8208;stability. The sulfuration process of LLOs with multi&#8208;anionic redox mechanism highlights a promising strategy to design novel high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials with superior cycling performance.

Abstract
The realization of efficient on&#8208;chip microlasers with scalable fabrication, ultralow threshold, and stable single&#8208;frequency operation is always desired for a wide range of miniaturized photonic systems. Herein, an effective way to fabricate nanostructures&#8208; whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) lasers by drop&#8208;casting CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/buffer&#8208;shell@graded&#8208;shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) dispersion onto silica microspheres is presented. Benefiting from the excellent gain properties from the interface engineered core/hybrid shell NPLs and high&#8208;quality factor WGM resonator inherent from excellent optical field confinement, the proposed room&#8208;temperature NPLs&#8208;WGM microlasers show a record&#8208;low lasing threshold of 3.26 &#956;J cm&#8211;2 under nanosecond laser pumping among all colloidal NPLs&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. The presence of sharp discrete transverse electric&#8208; and magnetic&#8208;mode spikes, the inversely proportional dependence of the free spectra range on the size of microsphere and the polarization anisotropy of laser output represent the first direct experimental evidence for NPLs&#8208;WGM lasing nature, which is verified theoretically by the computed electric&#8208;field distribution inside the microcavity. Remarkably, a stable single&#8208;mode lasing output with an ultra&#8208;low lasing threshold of 3.84 &#956;J cm&#8211;2 is achieved by the Vernier effect through evanescent field coupling. Our results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetism in Perylene Diimide Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of pure organic magnets with high Curie temperatures remains a challenging task in material science. Introducing high&#8208;density free radicals to strongly interacting organic molecules may be an effective method to this end. In this study, we use a solvothermal approach with excess hydrazine hydrate to concurrently reduce and dissolve rigid&#8208;backbone perylene diimide (PDI) crystallites into the soluble dianion species with a remarkably high reduction potential. The as&#8208;prepared PDI powders comprising radical anion aggregates were fabricated by the subsequent self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous oxidation process. The results of magnetic measurements show that the PDI powders exhibited room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and a Curie temperature higher than 400 K, with a vast saturation magnetization that reached &#8764;1.2 emu&#183;g&#8722;1. Elemental analysis along with diamagnetic signal of the ablated residue were used to rule out the possibility that the magnetism was due to metal contaminations. Our findings suggest that the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering can survive at room&#8208;temperature in organic semiconductors, and offers a new optional way to create room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.

Abstract
The large non&#8208;radiative recombination is the main factor that limits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we synthetized two novel structurally similar oligomers (5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D and A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination of the ternary OSCs. Although the HOMO energy levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers showed ultra&#8208;high EQEEL of 0.05% and improved VOC was achieved in ternary OSCs, indicating that suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP&#8208;BO4Cl fine&#8208;tunes the morphology of the active layer and forms synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs processed by green solvent of o&#8208;xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance. This is the first work that demonstrates novel structurally compatible D&#8208;A type oligomers are effective third components, and provides new understanding of energy loss mechanisms towards high performance OSCs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large non-radiative recombination is the main factor that limits state-of-the-art organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we synthetized two novel structurally similar oligomers (5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D-A-D-A-D and A-D-A-D-A configuration for high-performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non-radiative recombination of the ternary OSCs. Although the HOMO energy levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers showed ultra-high EQE&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.05% and improved &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; was achieved in ternary OSCs, indicating that suppressing non-radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP-BO4Cl fine-tunes the morphology of the active layer and forms synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTP-BO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP-BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state-of-the-art OSCs processed by green solvent of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance.

         <title>Neisseria Meningitidis Opca Protein/MnO2 Hybrid Nanoparticles for Overcoming Blood Brain Barrier to Treat Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The major hurdle in glioblastoma therapy is the low efficacy of drugs crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB). Neisseria meningitidis is known to specifically enrich in the central nervous system through the guidance of an outer membrane invasion protein named Opca. Here, by loading a chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) in the hollow manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles with surface modification of Opca protein of Neisseria meningitidis, a bionic nanotherapeutic system (MTX@MnO2&#8208;Opca) is demonstrated to effectively overcome the BBB. The presence of Opca protein enables the drug to cross the BBB and penetrate into tumor tissues. After accumulating in glioblastoma, the nanotherapeutic system catalyzes the decomposition of excess H2O2 in the tumor tissue and thereby generates O2, which alleviates tumor hypoxia and enhances the effect of chemotherapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. This bionic nanotherapeutic system may exhibit great potential in the treatment of glioblastoma.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode with Reinforced Electrochemical Performance Enabled by Convertible Amorphous Li2CO3 Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;nickel (Ni&#8805;90%) cathodes with high specific capacity hold great potential for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical application is restricted by the high interfacial reactivity under continuous air erosion and electrolyte assaults. Herein, a stable high&#8208;nickel cathode was rationally designed via in&#8208;situ induction of a dense amorphous Li2CO3 on the particle surface by a preemptive atmosphere control. Among the residual lithium compounds, Li2CO3 is the most thermodynamically stable one so that the dense Li2CO3 coating layer can serve as a physical protection layer to isolate the cathodes from contact with moist air. Furthermore, amorphous Li2CO3 can be transformed into a robust F&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) during cycling, which reinforces the cathodes interfacial stability and improves electrochemical performance. The assembled coin cell with this modified cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 232.4 mAh g&#8211;1 with a superior initial coulombic efficiency of 95.1%, and a considerable capacity retention of 90.4% after 100 cycles. Furthermore, no slurry gelation occurred during large&#8208;scale electrode fabrication process. This work opens a valuable perspective on the evolution of amorphous Li2CO3 in LIBs and provides guidance on protecting unstable high&#8208;capacity cathodes for energy storage devices.

The role of iodide as an additive in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is not well understood, especially in the charging process. The recent advances on LiI are reviewed and the synergistic effect with water is discussed. Alternative approaches for enabling the charging process are also provided.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries possess a high theoretical energy density, which means they could become a potential alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nevertheless, the charging process of Li&#8211;O2 batteries requires much higher energy, due to the insulating nature of the discharge product. It has been revealed that the anion additive, lithium iodide (LiI), can tune the cell chemistry to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as the product and facilitate the kinetics during the charging process. Although numerous studies have been reported, the role of this additive is still under investigation. Herein, the recent advances focusing on the use of LiI in Li&#8211;O2 batteries are reviewed, its catalytic behavior on discharge and charge is discussed, and its synergistic effect with water is understood. The ambiguity existing among the studies are also revealed, and solutions to the current issues are introduced.

         <title>Fabrication of Circularly Polarized MR&#8208;TADF Emitters with Asymmetrical Peripheral&#8208;Lock Enhancing Helical B/N&#8208;Doped Nanographenes</title>

Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into a new advanced material, a CPMR&#8208;TADF material. OLEDs based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters show excellent performance, attaining a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light simultaneously.








Abstract
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), which exhibit novel circularly polarized luminescence and excellent color fidelity, respectively, have gained immense popularity. In this study, integrated CP&#8208;TADF and MR&#8208;TADF (CPMR&#8208;TADF) are prepared by strategic design and synthesis of asymmetrical peripherally locked enantiomers, which are separated and denoted as (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN4 and (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN5 and exhibit TADF and circularly polarized light (CPL) properties. As the entire molecular frame participates in the frontier molecular orbitals, the resulting helical chirality of (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN4&#8208; and (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN5&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) helps in achieving a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 49/49 and 48/48&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.6%/19.0% and 22.0%/26.5%, respectively. Importantly, unambiguous circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN4) and +1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN5) are obtained. The results indicate successful exploitation of CPMR&#8208;TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;based OLEDs to exhibit three characteristics: high efficiency, color purity, and circularly polarized light.

In this study, integrated CP-TADF and MR-TADF (CPMR-TADF) are prepared by strategic design and synthesis of asymmetrical peripherally locked enantiomers, which are separated and denoted as (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;,&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;)-/(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;,&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;)-&lt;b&gt;BN4&lt;/b&gt; and (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;,&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;)-/(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;,&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;&#8243;)-&lt;b&gt;BN5&lt;/b&gt; and exhibit TADF and circularly polarized light (CPL) properties. As the entire molecular frame participates in the frontier molecular orbitals, the resulting helical chirality of (+)/(&#8722;)-&lt;b&gt;BN4&lt;/b&gt;- and (+)/(&#8722;)-&lt;b&gt;BN5&lt;/b&gt;-based solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) helps in achieving a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 49/49 and 48/48&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.6%/19.0% and 22.0%/26.5%, respectively. Importantly, unambiguous circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with dissymmetry factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;) of +3.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;BN4&lt;/b&gt;) and +1.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&#8722;1.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;BN5&lt;/b&gt;) are obtained. The results indicate successful exploitation of CPMR-TADF-emitter-based OLEDs to exhibit three characteristics: high efficiency, color purity, and circularly polarized light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Encapsulation of Metallic Zn in a Hybrid MXene/Graphene Aerogel as a Stable Zn Anode for Foldable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) in graphene&#8211;MXene aerogel is prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The Zn metal is completely encapsulated inside the host in a 3D microscale manner, which suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition. Meanwhile, the aerogel, with excellent flexibility, achieves stable electrochemical performance for foldable Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
A 3D host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of a zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process. During cycling, the composite anode endows an in situ solid electrolyte interface with zinc fluoride at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to inherent fluorine terminations in MXene, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Furthermore, the design wherein bulk Zn is distributed in a 3D microscale manner suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation, through in/ex situ tests. As a result, in a symmetrical cell test, the electrode has a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. After continuous single folding followed by double folding, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state foldable cell with the composite anode and a LiMn2O4 cathode (60% depth of discharge) maintains high&#8208;capacity retention of over 91%. This research presents a revolutionary encapsulating idea for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, as well as foldable investigation.

         <title>Intracellular Condensates of Oligopeptide for Targeting Lysosome and Addressing Multiple Drug Resistance of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome selective construction of biomolecular hydrogel with emerging biological functions provides a novel strategy for controlling cancer cell fates by inducing lysosomal&#8208;membrane permeabilization and addressing multidrug resistance in a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.








Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have been demonstrated as a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems and play a crucial role in controlling cellular functions. However, the spatiotemporal construction of artificial biomolecular condensates with functions remains challenging and has been less explored. Herein, a general approach is reported to construct biomolecular condensates (e.g., hydrogel) in the lysosome of living cells for cancer therapy and address multiple drug resistance induced by lysosome sequestration. Aromatic&#8208;motif&#8208;appended pH&#8208;responsive hexapeptide (LTP) derived from natural insulin can be uptaken by cancer cells mainly through caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis, ensuring the proton&#8208;triggered phase transformation (solution to hydrogel) of LTP inside the lysosome specifically. Lysosomal hydrogelation further leads to enlargement of the lysosome in cancer cells and increases the permeability of the lysosome, resulting in cancer cell death. Importantly, lysosomal assemblies can significantly improve the efficiency of current chemotherapy drugs toward multidrug resistance (MDR) cells in vitro and in xenograft tumor models. As an example of functional artificial condensates in lysosomes, this work provides a new strategy for controlling functional condensates formation precisely in the organelles of living cells and addressing MDR in cancer therapy.

         <title>Silk Microneedle Patch Capable of On&#8208;Demand Multidrug Delivery to the Brain for Glioblastoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk microneedle (SMN) patch allows the integration of multiple therapeutic drugs with controlled release profiles to stop bleeding, inhibit angiogenesis, and promote apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of silk and applying a trigger of transcranial near&#8208;infrared light. SMN effectively suppresses tumor volume and improves the survival rate of mice in vivo.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM patients. However, challenges still exist when surgery is difficult or impossible to remove the tumor completely. Herein, the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch is reported for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different doses. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents (thrombin and temozolomide) and targeted drug (bevacizumab) are loaded into the SMN patch with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs are spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application is non&#8208;toxic and results in decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multidrug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

         <title>Loading Single&#8208;Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N&#8208;Rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembled hollow N&#8208;rich carbon plates with single&#8208;Ni atoms (Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)) are constructed using a novel dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework (ZTF) as precursor. The open structure and high external surface area enable the Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst with fast mass transfer and highly exposed single&#8208;Ni sites towards efficient CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

         <title>Controllable SiOx Nanorod Memristive Neuron for Probabilistic Bayesian Inference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probabilistic SiOx nanorod memristive neuron is fabricated by employing the glancing angle deposition technique. Due to the SiOx nanorod structure, a multitude of Si switching filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges can be formed, leading to different probabilistic activation functions with controllability. Furthermore, the self&#8208;resting neural operation and probabilistic Bayesian inferences are also demonstrated with the fabricated device.








Abstract
Modern artificial neural network technology using a deterministic computing framework is faced with a critical challenge in dealing with massive data that are largely unstructured and ambiguous. This challenge demands the advances of an elementary physical device for tackling these uncertainties. Here, we&#160;designed and fabricated a SiOx nanorod memristive device by employing the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, suggesting a controllable stochastic artificial neuron that can mimic the fundamental integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire signaling and stochastic dynamics of a biological neuron. The nanorod structure provides the random distribution of multiple nanopores all across the active area, capable of forming a multitude of Si filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges after the electromigration process, leading to a stochastic switching event with very high dynamic range (&#8776;5.15 &#215; 1010) and low energy (&#8776;4.06 pJ). Different probabilistic activation (ProbAct) functions in a sigmoid form are implemented, showing its controllability with low variation by manufacturing and electrical programming schemes. Furthermore, as an application prospect, based on the suggested memristive neuron, we&#160;demonstrated the self&#8208;resting neural operation with the local circuit configuration and revealed probabilistic Bayesian inferences for genetic regulatory networks with low normalized mean squared errors (&#8776;2.41 &#215; 10&#8208;2) and its robustness to the ProbAct variation.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;expressing programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are prepared for autoimmune diseases treatment. As cell&#8208;free carrier, MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 restore tissue lesion by reshaping the local immune microenvironment via programmed cell death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway, which may potentially provide a universal platform technique for the immunotherapy of various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, a programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 + (PD&#8208;L1) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology is developed for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 is observed in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. A technology is developed using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Digital Light Processing Based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Digital Light Processing based (bio)printing system is developed, integrating a microfluidic mixer for the generation of composable gradients of desired (bio)inks on the fly. Various planar and volumetric structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, cell densities, growth factor concentrations, hydrogel stiffness, and porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified, suggesting the promising potential of the technology toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only a few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in 3D constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely by adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that (bio)ink waste is minimized when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing this time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly supports the potential of the unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

         <title>Textured Electrodes: Manipulating Built&#8208;In Crystallographic Heterogeneity of Metal Electrodes via Severe Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, characteristic of commercial metal foils results in rough electrodeposit morphology in either metal plating/stripping processes. An accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology is reported to achieve uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. Electrochemical analysis shows that ARB can produce large improvements in reversibility of metal anodes.








Abstract
Control of crystallography of metal electrodeposit films has recently emerged as a key to achieving long operating lifetimes in next&#8208;generation batteries. It is reported that the large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, that appears characteristic of commercial metal foils, results in rough morphology upon plating/stripping. On this basis, an accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology&#8212;a severe plastic deformation process&#8212;is developed. Zn metal is used as a first example to interrogate the concept. It is demonstrated that the ARB process is highly effective in achieving uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. After the ARB process, the Zn grains exhibit a strong (002) texture (i.e., [002]Zn//ND). The texture transitions from a classical bipolar pattern to a nonclassical unipolar pattern under large nominal strain eliminate the orientational heterogeneity of the foil. The strongly (002)&#8208;textured Zn remarkably improves the plating/stripping performance by nearly two orders of magnitude under practical conditions. The performance improvements are readily scaled to achieve pouch&#8208;type full batteries that deliver exceptional reversibility. The ARB process can, in principle, be applied to any metal chemistry to achieve similar crystallographic uniformity, provided the appropriate temperature and accumulated strains are employed. This concept is evaluated using commercial Li and Na foils, which, unlike Zn (HCP), are BCC crystals. The simple process for creating strong textures in both hexagonal and cubic metals and illustrating the critical role such built&#8208;in crystallography plays underscores opportunities for developing highly reversible thin metal anodes (e.g., hexagonal Zn, Mg, and cubic Li, Na, Ca, Al).

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controllable Distribution of Combination Therapeutics in Solid Tumors by Dually Modified Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy but have proven to be extremely challenging. In this work, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics is described in solid tumors, which can reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy.

Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy, but they have proven to be extremely challenging. Here, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics in solid tumors is reported to reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy. By combining synthetic biology and interfacial chemistry, bacteria are inside and outside concurrently modified to express photothermal melanin and to attach immune checkpoint inhibitors on their surface. Due to the nature of bacteria to colonize the hypoxia intratumoral environment, both therapeutic agents can be distributed homogenously and lastingly in tumors during ex vivo human and in vivo mouse studies. Spatiotemporally controllable localization of melanin can repeatedly generate a moderate yet uniform heating of the tumor upon light exposure in a broad treatment window. Combination with similarly localized inhibitors elicits a dual photothermally stimulated and checkpoint&#8208;blockade&#8208;mediated immune activation effect, synergistically reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic values are demonstrated by significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice in both subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models. Colonization of dually modified bacteria paves an avenue for spatiotemporally controllable distribution of therapeutic drugs in solid tumors.

         <title>Exploring the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 System and Potential for High Capacitive Energy Storage Density and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and electrical properties of antiferroelectric PbHfO3 and &#8220;potentially&#8221; ferroelectric SrHfO3 are explored. Further, the energy&#8208;storage properties of the solid solution Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&lt;&#160;1) films are probed. An optimum strontium content is identified that leads to increased electric&#8208;breakdown strength and decreased hysteresis&#8208;loss in PbHfO3 resulting in concurrent enhancement of the capacitive energy storage density and efficiency.








Abstract
The hafnate perovskites PbHfO3 (antiferroelectric) and SrHfO3 (&#8220;potential&#8221; ferroelectric) are studied as epitaxial thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates with the added opportunity of observing a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 system. The resulting (240)&#8208;oriented PbHfO3 (Pba2) films exhibited antiferroelectric switching with a saturation polarization &#8776;53 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at 1.6 MV cm&#8722;1, weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;186 at 298 K, and an antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at &#8776;518 K. (002)&#8208;oriented SrHfO3 films exhibited neither ferroelectric behavior nor evidence of a polar P4mm phase . Instead, the SrHfO3 films exhibited a weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;25 at 298 K and no signs of a structural transition to a polar phase as a function of temperature (77&#8211;623 K) and electric field (&#8211;3 to 3 MV cm&#8722;1). While the lack of ferroelectric order in SrHfO3 removes the potential for MPB, structural and property evolution of the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&lt;&#160;1) system is explored. Strontium alloying increased the electric&#8208;breakdown strength (EB) and decreased hysteresis loss, thus enhancing the capacitive energy storage density (Ur) and efficiency (&#951;). The composition, Pb0.5Sr0.5HfO3 produced the best combination of EB&#160;= 5.12&#160;&#177; 0.5 MV cm&#8722;1, Ur&#160;= 77&#160;&#177; 5 J cm&#8722;3, and &#951;&#160;= 97&#160;&#177; 2%, well out&#8208;performing PbHfO3 and other antiferroelectric oxides.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Electroactive Nanoporous Silicon: Large and Fully Reversible Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanical Actuation in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers in aqueous electrolytes, with laser cantilever bending experiments, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by low operation voltages of 1&#8201;V is demonstrated. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity upon ion adsorption and desorption.








Abstract
Nanoporosity in silicon results in interface&#8208;dominated mechanics, fluidics, and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material. However, their active control, for example, by electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by potential variations of &#8776;1&#8201;V is shown. Laser cantilever bending experiments in combination with in operando voltammetry and step coulombmetry allow this large electro&#8208;actuation to be traced to the concerted action of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimeter cross&#8208;section and determination of the capacitive charge&#8211;stress coupling parameter upon ion adsorption and desorption as well as the intimately related stress actuation dynamics for perchloric and isotonic saline solutions. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity (Hellmann&#8211;Feynman interactions) with respect to the importance of oxide formation and wall roughness on the single&#8208;nanopore scale. The observation of robust electrochemo&#8208;mechanical actuation in a mainstream semiconductor with wafer&#8208;scale, self&#8208;organized nanoporosity opens up novel opportunities for on&#8208;chip integrated stress generation and actuorics at exceptionally low operation&#160;voltages.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance, Sensitive, Wearable Multifunctional Sensor Based on Rubber/CNT for Human Motion and Skin Temperature Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sensor with high performance is fabricated from the hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and sericin&#8208;modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The sensor is a good fit for the basic requirements of full&#8208;human motion detection and real&#8208;time temperature variation monitoring, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human activity and health.








Abstract
Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non&#8208;covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi&#8208;functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m&#8722;1, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 &#176;C&#8722;1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real&#8208;time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclometalated Ru(II) complex, RuZ, is reported to be able to self&#8208;assemble and accumulate in high levels in multi&#8208;drug resistant cancer cells. RuZ significantly increases cancer cell death by dual metabolic inhibition and interactions with multiple biological targets. Overall, the results suggest that RuZ could represent a potential treatment for cancers including multi&#8208;drug resistant cancers.








Abstract
The synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, is reported, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium, resulting in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreases oxygen consumption and inhibits glycolysis, which decreases cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. The decrease in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increase the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increases cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and, in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increases the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggests that the RuZ primarily decreases the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increases the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibits the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines are resistant to clinical drugs. It is also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenografts. To the best of our&#160;knowledge, the results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Complementary Zwitterionic Peptides Direct Nanoparticle Assembly and Enable Enzymatic Selection of Endocytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activated assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the zwitterionic peptide, LRGD, as a self&#8208;complementary, electrostatic binding moiety is illustrated. PEGylated peptide ligands containing the LRGD sequence are immobilized on the AuNPs. Cancer&#8208;specific enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), cleave the peptide ligands and subsequently unveil the LRGD moieties that promote multivalent, electrostatic interactions, leading to the assembly of the AuNPs.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in biological systems holds promise to convert and amplify disease&#8208;specific signals to physical or mechanical signals that can direct cell fate. However, it remains challenging to design physiologically stable self&#8208;assembling systems that demonstrate tunable and predictable behavior. Here, the use of zwitterionic tetrapeptide modalities to direct nanoparticle assembly under physiological conditions is reported. The self&#8208;assembly of gold nanoparticles can be activated by enzymatic unveiling of surface&#8208;bound zwitterionic tetrapeptides through matrix metalloprotease&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), which is overexpressed by cancer cells. This robust nanoparticle assembly is achieved by multivalent, self&#8208;complementary interactions of the zwitterionic tetrapeptides. In cancer cells that overexpress MMP&#8208;9, the nanoparticle assembly process occurs near the cell membrane and causes size&#8208;induced selection of cellular uptake mechanism, resulting in diminished cell growth. The enzyme responsiveness, and therefore, indirectly, the uptake route of the system can be programmed by customizing the peptide sequence: a simple inversion of the two amino acids at the cleavage site completely inactivates the enzyme responsiveness, self&#8208;assembly, and consequently changes the endocytic pathway. This robust self&#8208;complementary, zwitterionic peptide design demonstrates the use of enzyme&#8208;activated electrostatic side&#8208;chain patterns as powerful and customizable peptide modalities to program nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and alter cellular response in biological context.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Enabled Fabrication of Graphene Wrinkle Arrays for Epitaxial Growth of AlN Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of the transfer medium that has poor wettability on the corrugated surface of graphene, the graphene wrinkle arrays are successfully fabricated without altering the crystalline orientation of entire graphene films, which is promising for numerous applications. This work opens up a new way for periodically modifying the surface properties of graphene for epitaxial growth of AlN films.








Abstract
Formation of graphene wrinkle arrays can periodically alter the electrical properties and chemical reactivity of graphene, which is promising for numerous applications. However, large&#8208;area fabrication of graphene wrinkle arrays remains unachievable with a high density and defined orientations, especially on rigid substrates. Herein, relying on the understanding of the formation mechanism of transfer&#8208;related graphene wrinkles, the graphene wrinkle arrays are fabricated without altering the crystalline orientation of entire graphene films. The choice of the transfer medium that has poor wettability on the corrugated surface of graphene is proven to be the key for the formation of wrinkles. This work provides a deep understanding of formation process of transfer&#8208;related graphene wrinkles and opens up a new way for periodically modifying the surface properties of graphene for potential applications, including direct growth of AlN epilayers and deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes.

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency Limit of Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescent OLEDs Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) process can recycle nonradiative triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons and enhance the efficiency of fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Conventionally, the theoretical limit of delayed emission ratio by the TTA process is known to be 37.5% in anthracene&#8208;based molecules. In this work, 48% of delayed emission ratio is achieved by TTA with carefully designed blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Triplet harvesting is important for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is one triplet&#8208;harvesting strategy. However, for blue&#8208;emitting anthracene derivatives, the theoretical maximum radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio generated from the TTA process is known to be 15% in addition to the initially generated singlets of 25%, which is insufficient for high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent devices. In this study, nearly 25% of the radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio is realized by TTA using an anthracene derivative, breaking the theoretical limit. As a result, efficient deep&#8208;blue TTA fluorescent devices are developed, exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of 10.2% and 8.6% with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.134, 0.131) and (0.137, 0.076), respectively. The theoretical model provided herein explains the experimental results considering both the TTA and reverse intersystem crossing to a singlet state from higher triplet states formed by the TTA, clearly demonstrating that the radiative singlet ratio generated from TTA can reach 37.5% (total radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio: 62.5%), well above 15% (total 40%), despite the molecule having S1, T2&#160;&lt;&#160;2T1&#160;&lt; Q1 energy levels, which will lead to the development of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 28% if the outcoupling efficiency is 45%.

         <title>Viologen&#8208;Immobilized 2D Polymer Film Enabling Highly Efficient Electrochromic Device for Solar&#8208;Powered Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) film is synthesized, which enables high utilization of viologen moieties and fast ion transport. On this basis, the as&#8208;fabricated V2DP&#8208;based ECDs exhibit a rapid switching speed, and a high coloration efficiency (989 cm2 C&#8722;1). Furthermore, the highly efficient V2DP ECDs are vertically integrated with transparent solar cells, thereby generating energy&#8208;saving EC window systems.








Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar&#8208;powered EC windows.

&lt;p&gt;Fully crystalline viologen-immobilized 2D polymer (&lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt;) film is synthesized, which enables high utilization of viologen moieties and fast ion transport. On this basis, the as-fabricated &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt;-based ECDs exhibit a rapid switching speed, and a high coloration efficiency (989 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the highly efficient &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt; ECDs are vertically integrated with transparent solar cells, thereby generating energy-saving EC window systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar-powered EC windows. Here, the high-performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen-immobilized 2D polymer (&lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt;) thin film as the color-switching layer is demonstrated. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size &#8776; 4.5&#160;nm; pore density &#8776; 5.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the synthetic &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt; film enables high utilization of redox-active viologen moieties and benefits for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as-fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, it is managed to fabricate transmission-tunable, self-sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the &lt;b&gt;V2DP&lt;/b&gt; ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self-powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Existence of Localized Single&#8208;Photon Emitters in the Perovskite Film of All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbBr3 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;photon emitters are universally observed from all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films at the cryogenic temperature, owing to local thickness variations of the composing CsPbBr3 microcrystals and the resulting low potential&#8208;energy regions. The discovery of such novel emitting species in a perovskite film, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have drawn a lot of research attention very recently owing to their potential solution to the instability issue currently faced by the organic&#8211;inorganic counterparts. Meanwhile, the halide perovskites in a solid film are manifested as microscale morphologies whose functionalities are unavoidably affected by the interior or exterior presence of various nanoscale entities. Here all&#8208;inorganic solid films are fabricated with varying densities of single CsPbBr3 microcrystals, showing that very sharp photoluminescence peaks can be universally observed at 4 K with the linewidths being as narrow as hundreds of &#956;eV. The single&#8208;photon emission nature is confirmed for such a photoluminescence peak, whose intensity is completely quenched above &#8776;30&#160;K to suggest its possible origin from a low potential&#8208;energy region of the single microcrystal. The discovery of such a novel emitting species in halide perovskites, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will surely impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
L12 PdCuSn, L12 Pd3Sn, and fcc Pd3Sn nanorods are controlled synthesized using a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method. The as&#8208;synthesized ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the ethanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media with better performance compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, fcc Pd3Sn nanorods, and the commercial Pd/C catalyst.








Abstract
The crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters determining their physicochemical properties and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size, and morphology. Here, a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, that is, an ordered intermetallic and a disordered alloy with L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, the approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ratiometric FRET Encoded Hierarchical ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au Cluster for Ultrasensitive Quantifying MicroRNA In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed probes enable the ultrasensitive quantifying microRNA with zeptomolar level and the distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo, which offers new avenues for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.








Abstract
Here, Zirconium metal&#8722;organic frameworks&#8202;@&#8202;gold (ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au) cluster architectures have been fabricated and then functionalized with two fluorescent dyes (Quasar [QS] and Cyanine5.5 [Cy5.5]) through deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization, to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) encoded ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5 complex. In the presence of the target intracellular microRNA (miR)&#8208;21, the fluorescence of Cy5.5 at 705&#160;nm (F705) decreases and the fluorescence of QS at 665&#160;nm (F665) increases when Cy5.5 is released from the surface of ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5. The change in the fluorescence ratio (F705/F665) shows an outstanding linear range of 0.006&#8211;67.9 amol/ngRNA, and the limit of detection is 4.51 zmol/ngRNA in living cells. The high ratio loading of nucleic acid on surface of ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au cluster and two fluorescence encoded signal enables better sensitivity and reliability. Zeptomolar sensitivity and good linearity against target affords distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of the cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo. At the same time, the architecture displays remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency (53.7%) and gives rise to outstanding therapy ability in vivo. This strategy offers new avenues for the intelligent quantification of miRNAs for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.

         <title>Designing a Zn&#8211;Ag Catalyst Matrix and Electrolyzer System for CO2 Conversion to CO and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>

Catalysts, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are developed for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and beyond. The system consists of highly porous Ag dispersed in a Zn matrix, which leads to high CO2 utilization as described by multiphysics modeling. Coupling to microbiology allows for further upgrading to multicarbon products.








Abstract
CO2 emissions can be transformed into high&#8208;added&#8208;value commodities through CO2 electrocatalysis; however, efficient low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are needed for global scale&#8208;up. Inspired by other emerging technologies, the authors report the development of a gas diffusion electrode containing highly dispersed Ag sites in a low&#8208;cost Zn matrix. This catalyst shows unprecedented Ag mass activity for CO production: &#8722;614&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.17&#160;mg&#160;of Ag. Subsequent electrolyte engineering demonstrates that halide anions can further improve stability and activity of the Zn&#8211;Ag catalyst, outperforming pure Ag and Au. Membrane electrode assemblies are constructed and coupled to a microbial process that converts the CO to acetate and ethanol. Combined, these concepts present pathways to design catalysts and systems for CO2 conversion toward sought&#8208;after products.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Enabled Mechanical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With mechanical energy as the stimulus, CO2 is converted into solid carbon and O2 in a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based reaction system. Using the synergism of Ga nanodroplets and Ag&#8211;Ga nanorods, CO2 conversion proceeds through the triboelectrochemical reaction on Ga, while the Ag&#8211;Ga rods ensure the system's sustainability. This is achieved at a remarkably low energy consumption and high efficiency.








Abstract
A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8211;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano&#8208;dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

         <title>Manipulating Color Emission in 2D Hybrid Perovskites by Fine Tuning Halide Segregation: A Transparent Green Emitter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled halide substitution in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites is an effective strategy to vary the material bandgap, obtaining a palette of light emitters, whereby transparent thin films emitting in the green are realized. By fine&#8208;tuning the halide content, nanoscale phase segregation happens, resulting in a controlled nanoscale spatial distribution of recombination centers.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials offer an ideal playground for easily tuning their color and, accordingly, the spectral range of their emitted light. In contrast to common procedures, this work demonstrates that halide substitution in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites not only progressively modulates the bandgap, but it can also be a powerful tool to control the nanoscale phase segregation&#8212;by adjusting the halide ratio and therefore the spatial distribution of recombination centers. As a result, thin films of chloride&#8208;rich perovskite are engineered&#8212;which appear transparent to the human eye&#8212;with controlled tunable emission in the green. This is due to a rational halide substitution with iodide or bromide leading to a spatial distribution of phases where the minor component is responsible for the tunable emission, as identified by combined hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging and elemental mapping. This work paves the way for the next generation of highly tunable transparent emissive materials, which can be used as light&#8208;emitting pixels in advanced and low&#8208;cost optoelectronics.

         <title>Conjugated Polymer Mesocrystals with Structural and Optoelectronic Coherence and Anisotropy in Three Dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens are demonstrated exhibiting near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing. Predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting polymer semicnductors throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy predicted along all three crystallographic axes, without the need to grow single crystals.








Abstract
Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens that exhibit near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing are demonstrated. A predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy along all three crystallographic axes, with high mobilities found along the &#960;&#8208;stacking. Indeed, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 2.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are measured along the &#960;&#8208;stack, which are some of the highest mobilities reported for polymers at low charge&#8208;carrier densities (drop&#8208;cast films display mobilities of maximum &#8776;10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). The structural coherence also leads to an unusually well&#8208;defined photoluminescence line&#8208;shape characteristic of an H&#8208;aggregate (measured from the surface perpendicular to the materials flow), rather than the typical HJ&#8208;aggregate feature usually found for P3HT. The approach is widely applicable: to electrical conductors and materials used in n&#8208;type devices, such as poly{[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl]&#8208;alt&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene)} (N2200) where the mesocrystalline structure leads to high electron transport along the polymer backbones (&#8776;1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). This versatility and the broad applicability of channel&#8208;die pressing signifies its promise as a straightforward, readily scalable method to fabricate bulk semiconducting polymer structures at macroscopic scales with properties typically accessible only by the tedious growth of single crystals.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building up on the excellent optical properties of perovskite materials, the electron and hole spin dynamics provide fundamental insights into the carrier&#8211;nuclear spin system. In the model perovskite, bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2, Land&#233; factors, key spin relaxation times, and mechanisms are determined. Optically detected NMR reveals the dominance of the lead spin hyperfine interaction at the top of the valence band.








Abstract
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8211;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk formamidinium caesium lead iodine bromide (FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2) and to determine key parameters characterizing interactions of their spins, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the lead (207Pb) isotope in optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8211;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures, photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. The findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

     alt="Lead-Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building up on the excellent optical properties of perovskite materials, the electron and hole spin dynamics provide fundamental insights into the carrier&#8211;nuclear spin system. In the model perovskite, bulk FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;2.8&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;, Land&#233; factors, key spin relaxation times, and mechanisms are determined. Optically detected NMR reveals the dominance of the lead spin hyperfine interaction at the top of the valence band.

         <title>Over 21% Efficiency Stable 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure formamidinum (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.07% (certified over 20%), the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date, together with the improved device stability. The high&#8208;efficiency device exhibits a narrowed bandgap and unique 2D&#8211;3D intermixing phase distribution for improved light absorption and superior charge transport.








Abstract
Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D&#8208;like phase to 2D phases, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier&#8208;diffusion length (&#8776;1.98&#160;&#181;m). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow &#948;&#8208;phase formation of pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C persistent heating after 1500&#160;h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure&#8208;FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.

         <title>Coupling Spin Defects in a Layered Material to Nanoscale Plasmonic Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of plasmonic gap cavities are used to enhance emission from spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The cavities are silver nanocubes&#160;positioned on top of a gold mirror, encapsulating multilayer hBN with embedded boron vacancy spin defects. Nearly an order of magnitude enhancement is demonstrated at room temperature, associated with an efficient optically detected magnetic resonance readout.








Abstract
Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB&#8208;) centers, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the VB&#8208; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and, as a result, exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, a scalable approach is demonstrated to dramatically enhance the VB&#8208; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few&#8208;layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, two orders of magnitude are extracted in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding twofold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and in realization of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.

Abstract
Repeated cold rolling and folding is employed to fabricate a metallurgical composite of sodium&#8211;antimony&#8211;telluride Na2(Sb2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) dispersed in electrochemically active sodium metal, termed &#8220;NST&#8208;Na.&#8221; This new intermetallic has a vacancy&#8208;rich thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure and enables state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in widely employed carbonate and ether electrolytes. NST&#8208;Na achieves 100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DOD) in 1 m NaPF6 in G2, with 15 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.4%, for 1000 h&#160;of plating/stripping. Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) with NST&#8208;Na and Na3V2(PO4)3&#160;(NVP) or sulfur cathodes give significantly improved energy, cycling, and CE (&gt;99%). An anode&#8208;free battery with NST collector and NVP obtains 0.23% capacity decay per cycle. Imaging and tomography using conventional and cryogenic microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) indicate that the sodium metal fills the open space inside the self&#8208;supporting sodiophilic NST skeleton, resulting in dense (pore&#8208;free and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#8208;free) metal deposits with flat surfaces. The baseline Na deposit consists of filament&#8208;like dendrites and &#8220;dead metal&#8221;, intermixed with pores and SEI. Density functional theory calculations show that the uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of the Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain application situations of solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs) inevitably face harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature/electronic&#8208;field/radiation). Gallium oxide with an ultrawide bandgap is regarded as one of the most promising materials for SBPDs. Defect and doping engineering, including Ga&#8208;rich design and doping compensation, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for low&#8208;cost amorphous GaOX to force a way towards harsh&#8208;condition&#8208;resistant SBPDs.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with an ultrawide bandgap, is currently regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs), which are greatly demanded in harsh environment, such as space exploration and flame prewarning. However, realization of high&#8208;performance SBPDs with high tolerance toward harsh environments based on low&#8208;cost Ga2O3 material faces great challenges. Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaOX (a&#8208;GaOX) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a&#8208;GaOX film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaOX SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record&#8208;high responsivity rejection ratio (R254 nm/R365 nm) of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107, 102 times higher detectivity, and 2&#160;&#215;&#160;102 times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#160;&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V). The proposed DD engineering provides an effective strategy towards highly harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant GaOX SBPDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalytic Small Interfering RNA Nanocarriers for Synergistic Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;catalytic siRNA nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with a ceria (CeO2) nanozymes&#8208;mediated rough surface can catalyze the delivery process and amplify the cellular uptake efficiency. The CeO2 nanozymes catalyze excess reactive oxygen species scavenging and cooperate with siSNCA to reduce the formation of &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates in the treatment process. S/Ce&#8208;PABMS exhibit superior synergistic treatment effects and significantly improve dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, the CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA&#8208;targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the Parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice is significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers, S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;enabled phase transition of stretchable periodic metasurfaces between any two Bravais lattices, which reflect their symmetry, is demonstrated analytically and experimentally. Such transition offers a flexible way to engineer the resonance regime and dispersion relation of metasurfaces. In particular, the strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering leads to linearly and circularly polarized dichroism, which is demonstrated for information decoding.








Abstract
Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces&#8212;the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, the authors report the strain&#8208;enabled phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. They analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary 2D Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. They further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metasurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

         <title>Investigation of the Effect of 3D Meniscus Geometry on Fluid Dynamics and Crystallization via In Situ Optical Microscopy&#8208;Assisted Mathematical Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D geometrical model of the meniscus is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy, within which a mathematical model for momentum and mass transport is developed. Utilizing 3D meniscus geometry, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductors is elucidated, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin&#8208;film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus, is proposed. The 3D meniscus geometry, which changes depending on the experimental parameters, is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy. Thereafter, mass and momentum transport mathematical models are applied to obtain numerical solutions of transport phenomena within the meniscus. Utilizing these results, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductor is elucidated, which has previously been unknown. The 3D meniscus modeling is particularly important for this analysis, as dendrite formation is strongly dependent on the meniscus geometry near the contact line and mass transport variation perpendicular to the coating direction. This technique enables the study of complex relationship between experimental parameters and solidification process, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems; whereby, better understanding of thin&#8208;film growth and device performance optimization is possible.

         <title>Strongly Anisotropic Strain&#8208;Tunability of Excitons in Exfoliated ZrSe3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zirconium triselenide is a 2D semiconductor material with an interesting in&#8208;plane anisotropic crystal structure. Here, it is demonstrated that the excitons of this material are very sensitive to uniaxial strains and, interestingly, their tunability strongly depends on the direction along which the uniaxial strain is applied.








Abstract
The effect of uniaxial strain on the band structure of ZrSe3, a semiconducting material with a marked in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy, is studied. By using a modified three&#8208;point bending test apparatus, thin ZrSe3 flakes are subjected to uniaxial strain along different crystalline orientations monitoring the effect of strain on their optical properties through micro&#8208;reflectance spectroscopy. The obtained spectra show excitonic features that blueshift upon uniaxial tension. This shift is strongly dependent on the direction along which the strain is being applied. When the flakes are strained along the b&#8208;axis, the exciton peak shifts at &#8776;60&#8211;95 meV %&#8722;1, while along the a&#8208;axis, the shift only reaches &#8776;0&#8211;15 meV %&#8722;1.

     alt="Strongly Anisotropic Strain-Tunability of Excitons in Exfoliated ZrSe3"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zirconium triselenide is a 2D semiconductor material with an interesting in-plane anisotropic crystal structure. Here, it is demonstrated that the excitons of this material are very sensitive to uniaxial strains and, interestingly, their tunability strongly depends on the direction along which the uniaxial strain is applied.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of uniaxial strain on the band structure of ZrSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a semiconducting material with a marked in-plane structural anisotropy, is studied. By using a modified three-point bending test apparatus, thin ZrSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; flakes are subjected to uniaxial strain along different crystalline orientations monitoring the effect of strain on their optical properties through micro-reflectance spectroscopy. The obtained spectra show excitonic features that blueshift upon uniaxial tension. This shift is strongly dependent on the direction along which the strain is being applied. When the flakes are strained along the &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-axis, the exciton peak shifts at &#8776;60&#8211;95 meV %&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while along the &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-axis, the shift only reaches &#8776;0&#8211;15 meV %&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Ab initio calculations are conducted to study the influence of uniaxial strain, applied along different crystal directions, on the band structure and reflectance spectra of ZrSe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibiting a remarkable agreement with the experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Bioprinting
In article number 2107038, Yu Shrike Zhang and co&#8208;workers develop a (bio)printing system based on Digital Light Processing to utilize the integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. As such, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios, supporting the potential of the platform in numerous biomedical applications.

Artificial Biomolecular Condensates
In article number 2104704, Huaimin Wang and co&#8208;workers report a general approach for constructing artificial biomolecular condensates of oligopeptide in living cells. The rationally designed aromatic&#8208;capped peptides can reversibly form a nanofibrous hydrogel with a change of the conformation and morphologies in the lysosome. The formed condensates undergo swelling in the lysosome, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization and re&#8208;direction of therapeutic drugs to the target.

Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into new CPMR&#8208;TADF materials by Xiugang Wu, You&#8208;Xuan Zheng, Weiguo Zhu, Pi&#8208;Tai Chou, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2105080. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters attain a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage simultaneously: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light.

Anode&#8208;Free Batteries
In article number 2106005, Hui Dong, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers report an intermetallic for anode&#8208;free batteries. The winter scene shows a birthday cake with lit candles that are melting: the cake represents the complex structure of a cycled sodium&#8208;metal anode with the protruding candles being the dendrites. A slice, obtained by cryogenic focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy, further reveals the underlying porosity that develops during repeated plating and stripping of the metal. The thick non&#8208;uniform red frosting on the cake represents the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that drives the dendrite growth.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
Triplet exciton harvesting via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation, is known to generate only 40% of the total radiative excitons in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) theoretically. In article number 2100161, Yun&#8208;Hi Kim, Jang&#8208;Joo Kim, and co&#8208;workers realize a total radiative exciton ratio of nearly 50% with a carefully designed anthracene derivative and device structure, breaking the theoretical efficiency limit of OLEDs based on anthracene derivatives.

Electro&#8208;Actuation
In article number 2105923, Manuel Brinker and Patrick Huber report laser cantilever bending experiments that show large and reversible electrosorption&#8208;induced deformation of wafer&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon in aqueous electrolytes (isotonic saline solution) at exceptionally small operation voltages. This paves the way for on&#8208;chip integrated actuation and stress generation, e.g.,  in (bio&#8208;)medical environments, as is illustrated by electro&#8208;mechanical stimulation of living cells.

Tumor Therapy
In article number 2106606, Nan Qin, Tiger H. Tao, and co&#8208;workers report a heterogenous silk microneedle patch to spatiotemporally and sequentially deliver multiple therapeutic drugs for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of brain tumor cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of the silk and applying a trigger of transcranial NIR&#8208;light irradiation. This biodegradable patch has potential applications for the clinical treatment of intracranial tumors.

Deep&#8208;UV Photodetectors
High&#8208;performance harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant deep&#8208;UV (DUV) photodetectors have important applications in space exploration and flame prewarning. In article number 2106923, Xiaolong Zhao, Shibing Long, and co&#8208;workers tailor defect/doping engineering based on the low&#8208;cost GaOX to obtain high&#8208;performance DUV detectors. The defect/doping engineering induces recrystallization, doping compensation, and nanopore formation inside the material, giving it great potential for DUV detection in harsh conditions.

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough overview is given on the fundamental properties of tin halide perovskites tailored to their application in solar cells. A detailed discussion of the crystal structure, electronic properties, photophysics, and thin&#8208;film crystallization of tin halide perovskites provides a foundation to highlight its exceptional properties and reveals research strategies to improve the performance of tin halide solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity. High power conversion efficiencies are achieved with lead&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Tin&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their bandgap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites currently limit their efficiency. The aim of this review is to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from 3D to low&#8208;dimensional structures. At the end, recent progress in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each subtopic, the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;Healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are inherently safe, but prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. In this work, the variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics in the literature is reviewed and limitations and opportunities are discussed. Two promising research fields are bridged, and a guide is given toward selecting suitable processing methods based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics application.








Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. Herein, the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in the literature is reviewed, and limitations and opportunities discussed thoroughly. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability, and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader toward selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Biomaterials Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of machine learning (ML) in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds and has made a big impact into biomaterials research, ranging from discovery of bioactive chemical moieties, screening and optimization of material properties, to developing materials that interface better with biological systems. There is still untapped potential to integrate with ML for the next frontier in biomaterials.








Abstract
Biomaterials is an exciting and dynamic field, which uses a collection of diverse materials to achieve desired biological responses. While there is constant evolution and innovation in materials with time, biomaterials research has been hampered by the relatively long development period required. In recent years, driven by the need to accelerate materials development, the applications of machine learning in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds. The combination of machine learning with high&#8208;throughput theoretical predictions and high&#8208;throughput experiments (HTE) has shifted the traditional Edisonian (trial and error) paradigm to a data&#8208;driven paradigm. In this review, each type of biomaterial and their key properties and use cases are systematically discussed, followed by how machine learning can be applied in the development and design process. The discussions are classified according to various types of materials used including polymers, metals, ceramics, and nanomaterials, and implants using additive manufacturing. Last, the current gaps and potential of machine learning to further aid biomaterials discovery and application are also discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Fluorinated Graphene from Synthesis to Applications: Critical Review on Functional Chemistry and Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in fluorinated graphene (FG) from the synthesis methods to the broad applications and the relationship between the structures and properties are reviewed in detail. Especially, rational structure engineering and the abundant functional chemistry are the significant directions which are further discussed for the future development of FG.








Abstract
Fluorinated graphene (FG), as an emerging member of the graphene derivatives family, has attracted wide attention on account of its excellent performances and underlying applications. The introduction of a fluorine atom, with the strongest electronegativity (3.98), greatly changes the electron distribution of graphene, resulting in a series of unique variations in optical, electronic, magnetic, interfacial properties and so on. Herein, recent advances in the study of FG from synthesis to applications are introduced, and the relationship between its structure and properties is summarized in detail. Especially, the functional chemistry of FG has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, which has opened a universal route for the functionalization and even multifunctionalization of FG toward various graphene derivatives, which further broadens its applications. Moreover, from a particular angle, the structure engineering of FG such as the distribution pattern of fluorine atoms and the regulation of interlayer structure when advanced nanotechnology gets involved is summarized. Notably, the elaborated structure engineering of FG is the key factor to optimize the corresponding properties for potential applications, and is also an up&#8208;to&#8208;date research hotspot and future development direction. Finally, perspectives and prospects for the problems and challenges in the study of FG are put forward.

         <title>Bimetallic Janus Nanocrystals: Syntheses and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals feature a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement of two distinct metals divided by a heterogeneous interface. This unique structure allows one to present both metals on the same particle while tailoring the plasmonic coupling and electronic interaction between them, making the structure particularly viable for plasmonic, catalytic, and photocatalytic applications.








Abstract
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals have received considerable interest in recent years owing to their unique properties and niche applications. The side&#8208;by&#8208;side distribution of two distinct metals provides a flexible platform for tailoring the optical and catalytic properties of nanocrystals. First, a brief introduction to the structural features of bimetallic Janus nanocrystals, followed by an extensive discussion of the synthetic approaches, is given. The strategies and experimental controls for achieving the Janus structure, as well as the mechanistic understandings, are specifically discussed. Then, a number of intriguing properties and applications enabled by the Janus nanocrystals are highlighted. Finally, this article is concluded with future directions and outlooks with respect to both syntheses and applications of this new class of functional nanomaterials.

The advanced rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs), including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCTs, electrochemistry, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, ELISA, and microarray&#8208;based platforms, act figuratively as the Great Wall to the widespread transmission of acute respiratory virus infections by enabling early and rapid detection of these pathogens, as is the case during the current pandemic.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing global threats to human life caused by the human acute respiratory virus (RV) infections have cost billions of lives, created a significant economic burden, and shaped society for centuries. The timely response to emerging RVs could save human lives and reduce the medical care burden. The development of RV detection technologies is essential for potentially preventing RV pandemic and epidemics. However, commonly used detection technologies lack sensitivity, specificity, and speed, thus often failing to provide the rapid turnaround times. To address this problem, new technologies are devised to address the performance inadequacies of the traditional methods. These emerging technologies offer improvements in convenience, speed, flexibility, and portability of point&#8208;of&#8208;care test (POCT). Herein, recent developments in POCT are comprehensively reviewed for eight typical acute respiratory viruses. This review discusses the challenges and opportunities of various recognition and detection strategies and discusses these according to their detection principles, including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCT, electrochemistry, lateral flow assays, microfluidics, enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays, and microarrays. The importance of limits of detection, throughput, portability, and specificity when testing clinical samples in resource&#8208;limited settings is emphasized. Finally, the evaluation of commercial POCT kits for both essential RV diagnosis and clinical&#8208;oriented practices is included.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;Based Biopolymer Processing as a Route toward Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastics sustainability is a growing issue and structural biopolymers from nature (e.g., cellulose, chitin, silk) offer new, long&#8208;term solutions. Recent advances with thermoplastic processing, as well as fibrillation strategies, offer new routes to more competitive processing strategies than traditional solution approaches. Challenges remain with scaling, further insight into mechanisms, use of molecular modeling and plasticizer optimization.








Abstract
Some of the most abundant biomass on earth is sequestered in fibrous biopolymers like cellulose, chitin, and silk.&#160;These types of natural materials offer unique and striking mechanical and functional features that have driven strong interest in their utility for a range of applications, while also matching environmental sustainability needs.&#160;However, these material systems are challenging to process in cost&#8208;competitive ways to compete with synthetic plastics due to the limited options for thermal processing.&#160;This results in the dominance of solution&#8208;based processing for fibrous biopolymers, which presents challenges for scaling, cost, and consistency in outcomes. However, new opportunities to utilize thermal processing with these types of biopolymers, as well as fibrillation approaches, can drive renewed opportunities to bridge this gap between synthetic plastic processing and fibrous biopolymers, while also holding sustainability goals as critical to long&#8208;term successful outcomes.

         <title>Bioinspired and Biomimetic Delivery Platforms for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of biomimetic designs into delivery platforms for cancer vaccines can enhance efficacy while retaining good safety profiles, which contributes to expediting the clinical translation of cancer vaccines. A detailed overview of current progress, potential challenges, and future directions of bioinspired delivery platforms for cancer vaccines is provided here.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines aim at eliciting tumor&#8208;specific responses for the immune system to identify and eradicate malignant tumor cells while sparing the normal tissues. Furthermore, cancer vaccines can potentially induce long&#8208;term immunological memory for antitumor responses, preventing metastasis and cancer recurrence, thus presenting an attractive treatment option in cancer immunotherapy. However, clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines has remained low due to longstanding challenges, such as poor immunogenicity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, tumor heterogeneity, inappropriate immune tolerance, and systemic toxicity. Recently, bioinspired materials and biomimetic technologies have emerged to play a part in reshaping the field of cancer nanomedicine. By mimicking desirable chemical and biological properties in nature, bioinspired engineering of cancer vaccine delivery platforms can effectively transport therapeutic cargos to tumor sites, amplify antigen and adjuvant bioactivities, and enable spatiotemporal control and on&#8208;demand immunoactivation. As such, integration of biomimetic designs into delivery platforms for cancer vaccines can enhance efficacy while retaining good safety profiles, which contributes to expediting the clinical translation of cancer vaccines. Recent advances in bioinspired delivery platforms for cancer vaccines, existing obstacles faced, as well as insights and future directions for the field are discussed here.

         <title>Electrode Engineering in Halide Perovskite Electronics: Plenty of Room at the Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Contact engineering is a prerequisite for achieving desirable functionality and performance of semiconductor electronics, which is particularly critical for organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid halide perovskites due to their ionic nature and highly reactive interfaces. Although the interfaces between perovskites and charge transporting layers have attracted lots of attention due to the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diode applications, achieving reliable perovskite/electrode contacts for electronic devices such as transistors and memories remains as a bottleneck. Herein, we present a critical review on the elusive nature of perovskite/electrode interfaces with a focus on the interfacial electrochemistry effects. The basic guidelines of electrode selection are given for establishing non&#8208;polarized interfaces and optimal energy level alignment for perovskite materials. Furthermore, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies on interface&#8208;related electrode engineering are reviewed and discussed, which aim at achieving Ohmic transport and eliminating hysteresis in perovskite devices. We also discuss the role and multiple functionalities of self&#8208;assembled monolayers that offer a unique approach toward improving perovskite/electrode contacts. The insights on electrode engineering pave the way to advancing stable and reliable perovskite devices in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>EG&#8208;like Brush Polymer Conjugate of RNA Aptamer that Shows Reversible Anticoagulant Activity and Minimal Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics are an emerging class of drugs. RNA aptamers are of significant therapeutic and clinical interest because their activity can be easily reversed in vivo&#8212;a useful feature that is difficult to achieve using other therapeutic modalities. Despite their therapeutic promise, RNA aptamers are limited by their poor blood circulation. The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to RNA aptamers addresses this limitation. However, an RNA aptamer&#8208;PEG conjugate that is a reversible anticoagulant failed in a clinical trial due to the reactivity of the conjugate with pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies, leading to anaphylactoid responses, and has cast a pall over PEGylation of aptamers and other biologics, despite its long history of utility in drug delivery. Here, we eliminated PEG antibody&#8208;reactivity of this RNA aptamer by conjugating it to a next generation PEG&#8208;like brush polymer&#8212;poly[(oligoethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)] (POEGMA). The conjugate retained the drug's therapeutic action and the ability to be easily reversed. Importantly, this conjugate does not bind pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies that are prevalent in humans as measured in vitro and does not induce a humoral immune response against the polymer itself in mice. These findings suggest a path to rescuing the PEGylation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines from the deleterious side&#8208;effects of PEG.
