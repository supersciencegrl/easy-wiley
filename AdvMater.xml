         <title>Directed Neural Stem Cells Differentiation via Signal Communication with Ni&#8208;Zn Micromotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neural stem cells, with capability of self&#8208;renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous neural stem cells, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogeneous cell transplantation. Yet how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, w e propose a pure water driven Ni&#8208;Zn micromotor via a self&#8208;established electric&#8208;chemical field. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target neural stem cell. Through electric&#8208;chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous neural stem cells w ere allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, Ni&#8208;Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via self&#8208;established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous neural stem cells.

         <title>Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode was confirmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode was almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density were obtained simultaneously. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes will promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

         <title>Bioinspired Bilevel Metamaterial for Multispectral Manipulation towards Visible, Multi&#8208;Wavelength Detection Lasers and Mid&#8208;Infrared Selective Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manipulation of the electromagnetic signature in multiple wavebands is necessary and effective in civil and industrial applications. However, the integration of multispectral requirements, particularly for the bands with comparable wavelengths, challenges the design and fabrication of current compatible metamaterials. Here, a bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation involving visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared, along with radiative cooling. The metamaterial, consisting of dual&#8208;deck Pt disks and SiO2 intermediate layer, is inspired by the broadband reflection splitting effect found in butterfly scales and achieves ultra&#8208;low specular reflectance (average 0.013) over the entire 0.8&#8208;1.6&#160;&#956;m with large scattering angles. Meanwhile, tunable visible reflection and selective dual absorption peaks in MIR can be simultaneously realized, providing structural color, effective radiative thermal dissipation at 5&#8211;8&#160;&#956;m and 10.6&#160;&#956;m laser absorption. The metamaterial is fabricated by a low&#8208;cost colloidal lithography method combined with two patterning processes. Multispectral manipulation performances are experimentally demonstrated and a significant apparent temperature drop (maximum 15.7&#160;&#176;C) compared to the reference is observed under thermal imager. This work achieves optical response in multiple wavebands and provides a valuable way to effectively design multifunctional metamaterials inspired by nature.

         <title>Manipulations of Spin Wave by Photoelectrons in Ferromagnetic/Non&#8208;Ferromagnetic Alloyed Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spin wave is considered an alternative carrier with great promise for information sensing. The feasible excitation and low&#8208;power manipulation of spin waves still remain a challenge. In this regard, natural light enables spin wave tunability is profoundly investigated in Co60Al40 alloyed film. A reversible manner with 2&#176; of the critical angle of the body spin wave is achieved successfully. Meanwhile, an eye&#8208;catching shift (817&#160;Oe) of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field is obtained optically, leading to changes in magnetic anisotropy. Based on the modified Puszkarski's surface inhomogeneity model, the sunlight control of spin&#8208;wave resonance (SWR) can be comprehended by a photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced effective surface magnetic anisotropy change. Furthermore, the body spin wave is modulated stably with natural light illumination, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior. This work has both practical and theoretical importance for developing future sunlight&#8208;tunable magnonics/spintronics devices.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Activation of In&#8208;Layer Channels for Enhanced Ion Storage and Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, leveraging non&#8208;metallic ammonium ions, have arisen as a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their advancement has been hindered by the scarcity of high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion storage materials. In this study, w e propose an electrochemical phase transformation approach for the in&#8208;situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) with predominant growth on the (200) plane, corresponding to the tetragonal channels on (001) layers. O ur findings reveal that these tetragonal in&#8208;layer channels not only furnish NH4+ storage sites but also enhance transfer kinetics by providing rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. This crucial aspect has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The E&#8208;VOPO electrode exhibits exceptional ammonium&#8208;ion storage performance, including significantly increased specific capacity, enhanced rate capability, and robust cycling stability. The resulting full cell can be stably operated for 12500 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 for over 70 days. The proposed approach offers a new strategy for meticulously engineering electrode materials with facilitated ion storage and migration, thereby paving the way for developing more efficient and sustainable energy storage systems.

         <title>Reconfiguring Hard Carbons with Emerging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights three critical structural features of hard carbons for practical use in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores. The impact of these structural features upon sodium storage is systematically discussed and an ideal configuration, namely sieving carbons with tightened pore entrance and enlarged pore body, is finally proposed for superior sodium storage.








Abstract
Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non&#8208;graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode materials for emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs)&#65292; because of their changeable low&#8208;potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed and are difficult to accurately demonstrate as graphites do. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interest to clearly picture their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to sodium storage. In this review, the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons are revisited first, and a renewed understanding of their sodium storage is presented.

     alt="Reconfiguring Hard Carbons with Emerging Sodium-Ion Batteries: A Perspective"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review highlights three critical structural features of hard carbons for practical use in sodium-ion batteries, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores. The impact of these structural features upon sodium storage is systematically discussed and an ideal configuration, namely sieving carbons with tightened pore entrance and enlarged pore body, is finally proposed for superior sodium storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non-graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode materials for emerging sodium-ion batteries (SIBs)&#65292; because of their changeable low-potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed and are difficult to accurately demonstrate as graphites do. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interest to clearly picture their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to sodium storage. In this review, the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons are revisited first, and a renewed understanding of their sodium storage is presented. Three critical structural features are highlighted for hard carbons, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores, which are directly responsible for the presence of the low-potential plateaus and their reversible extension. The impact of these structural features upon the sodium storage is then deeply discussed and sieving carbons is finally proposed as an ideal configuration of carbon anode for superhigh sodium storage. This review is expected to offer a clear picture of hard carbons, and help realize a truly rational design of high-capacity carbon anodes, driving the industrialization of SIBs, and more promisingly open up a window for exploring their possible new uses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Title A Flexible Tough Hydrovoltaic Coating for Wearable Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The lack of strong binding mechanism between nanomaterials severely restricts the advantages of evaporation&#8208;driven hyhrovoltaic effect in wearable sensing electronics. It's a challenging task to observably improve the mechanical toughness and flexibility of hyhrovoltaic devices to match the wearable demand without abandoning the nanostructures and surface function. Here, we developed a flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating with both good electricity generation (open circuit voltage&#8764;3.18&#160;V) and sensitive ion sensing (2285&#160;V M&#8722;1 for NaCl solutions in 10&#8722;4&#8208;10&#8722;3&#160;M) capabilities. The porous nanostructure composed of Al2O3 nanoparticles is firmly locked by the strong binding effect of PAN, giving a critical binding force 4 times than that of Al2O3 film to easily deal with 9.92 m s&#8722;1 strong waterflow impact. Finally, skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures were proposed to achieve wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat. The flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating breaks through the mechanical brittleness limitation and broadens the applications of evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect in self&#8208;powered wearable sensing electronics.

         <title>Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Balanced Intra&#8208; and Inter&#8208;Chain Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Polymers: Beyond 30% External Quantum Efficiency</title>

Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is crucial for developing highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers. The balance of intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;chain TSCT can markedly improve the performance, but it is still a big challenge. In this contribution, an effective strategy for &#8220;intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;chain TSCT balance&#8221; is demonstrated by a series non&#8208;conjugated copolymers containing 9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine (DMAC) donor and triazine&#8208;phosphine oxide (PO) based acceptors. Steady&#8208;state and transient emission spectra indicate that compared to the corresponding blends, the copolymers can indeed achieve the balanced intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;chain TSCT through accurately optimizing inductive and steric effects of the acceptors. DPOT acceptor with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and the second bigger steric hindrance endows its copolymers with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 32%, respectively. It demonstrates that compared to other congeners, the synergistic inductive and steric effects effectively enhance TSCT in DPOT based copolymers for radiation, and suppresses singlet and triplet quenching. The record&#8208;high efficiencies of its devices make this kind of copolymers hold the potential for low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;efficiency applications.

         <title>Soft Multimaterial Magnetic Fibers and Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preform&#8208;to&#8208;fiber thermal drawing of magnetically responsive soft composite materials enables the fabrication of magnetic fibers with extreme aspect ratios and intricate internal multimaterial structures, resulting in diverse functionalities. The soft magnetic fibers can optimally steer in many different directions, lift heavy loads, and also can be weaved into forming functional magnetic textiles for programmable shape&#8208;morphing. 








Abstract
Magnetically responsive soft materials are promising building blocks for the next generation of soft robotics, prosthesis, surgical tools, and smart textiles. To date, however, the fabrication of highly integrated magnetic fibers with extreme aspect ratios, that can be used as steerable catheters, endoscopes, or within functional textiles remains challenging. Here, multimaterial thermal drawing is proposed as a material and processing platform to realize 10s of meters long soft, ultrastretchable, yet highly resilient magnetic fibers. Fibers with a diameter as low as 300&#160;&#181;m and an aspect ratio of 105 are demonstrated, integrating nanocomposite domains with ferromagnetic microparticles embedded in a soft elastomeric matrix. With the proper choice of filler content that must strike the right balance between magnetization density and mechanical stiffness, fibers withstanding strains of &gt;1000% are shown, which can be magnetically actuated and lift up to 370 times their own weight. Magnetic fibers can also integrate other functionalities like microfluidic channels, and be weaved into conventional textiles. It is shown that the novel magnetic textiles can be washed and sustain extreme mechanical constraints, as well as be folded into arbitrary shapes when magnetically actuated, paving the way toward novel intriguing opportunities in medical textiles and soft magnetic systems.

         <title>Bright and Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are seen as potentially promising candidates for novel light&#8208;emission applications, owing to their unique characteristics. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the development of 2D TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices and highlights the remaining challenges.








Abstract
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting devices owing to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. The dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface and direct&#8208;bandgap structure of monolayer TMDCs allow for near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies. The excellent mechanical and optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs offer great potential to fabricate TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) featuring good flexibility and transparency. Great progress has been made in the fabrication of bright and efficient LEDs with varying device structures. In this review, the aim is to provide a comprehensive summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the construction of bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs. After a brief introduction to the research background, the preparation of 2D TMDCs used for LEDs is briefly discussed. The requirements and the corresponding challenges to achieve bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs are introduced. Thereafter, various strategies to enhance the brightness of monolayer 2D TMDCs are described. Following that, the carrier&#8208;injection schemes enabling bright and efficient TMDC&#8208;based LEDs along with the device performance are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future prospects regarding the accomplishment of TMDC&#8208;LEDs with ultimate brightness and efficiency are discussed.

         <title>Type I Photosensitization with Strong Hydroxyl Radical Generation in NIR Dye Boosted by Vigorous Intramolecular Motions for Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the relationship between type I photosensitization with strong hydroxyl radical (&#8729;OH) formation and intramolecular motions is established. The solid&#8208;state intramolecular motions are almost maximized by the double engineering which may lead to a strong &#8729;OH generation. Combined with the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the synergistic phototherapy toward in vivo tumor can be well performed.








Abstract
Development of type I photosensitizers (PSs) with strong hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) formation is particularly important in the anaerobic tumor treatment. On the other hand, it is challenging to obtain an efficient solid&#8208;state intramolecular motion to promote the development of molecular machine and molecular motor. However, the relationship between them is never revealed. In this work, a pyrazine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared type I PS with remarkable donor&#8211;acceptor effect is developed. Notably, the intramolecular motions are almost maximized by the combination of intramolecular and intermolecular engineering to simultaneously introduce the unlimited bond stretching vibration and boost the group rotation. The photothermal conversion caused by the intramolecular motions is realized with efficiency as high as 86.8%. The D&#8211;A conformation of PS can also induce a very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting of 0.07&#160;eV, which is crucial to promote the intersystem crossing for the triplet sensitization. Interestingly, its photosensitization is closely related to the intramolecular motions, and a vigorous motion may give rise to a strong &#183;OH generation. In view of its excellent photosensitization and photothermal behavior, the biocompatible PS exhibits a superior imaging&#8208;guided cancer synergistic therapy.

     alt="Type I Photosensitization with Strong Hydroxyl Radical Generation in NIR Dye Boosted by Vigorous Intramolecular Motions for Synergistic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the relationship between type I photosensitization with strong hydroxyl radical (&lt;sup&gt;&#8729;&lt;/sup&gt;OH) formation and intramolecular motions is established. The solid-state intramolecular motions are almost maximized by the double engineering which may lead to a strong &lt;sup&gt;&#8729;&lt;/sup&gt;OH generation. Combined with the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the synergistic phototherapy toward in vivo tumor can be well performed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of type I photosensitizers (PSs) with strong hydroxyl radical (&lt;sup&gt;&#183;&lt;/sup&gt;OH) formation is particularly important in the anaerobic tumor treatment. On the other hand, it is challenging to obtain an efficient solid-state intramolecular motion to promote the development of molecular machine and molecular motor. However, the relationship between them is never revealed. In this work, a pyrazine-based near-infrared type I PS with remarkable donor&#8211;acceptor effect is developed. Notably, the intramolecular motions are almost maximized by the combination of intramolecular and intermolecular engineering to simultaneously introduce the unlimited bond stretching vibration and boost the group rotation. The photothermal conversion caused by the intramolecular motions is realized with efficiency as high as 86.8%. The D&#8211;A conformation of PS can also induce a very small singlet-triplet splitting of 0.07&#160;eV, which is crucial to promote the intersystem crossing for the triplet sensitization. Interestingly, its photosensitization is closely related to the intramolecular motions, and a vigorous motion may give rise to a strong &lt;sup&gt;&#183;&lt;/sup&gt;OH generation. In view of its excellent photosensitization and photothermal behavior, the biocompatible PS exhibits a superior imaging-guided cancer synergistic therapy. This work stimulates the development of advanced PS for the biomedical application and solid-state intramolecular motions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tenascin&#8208;C Activation of Lung Fibroblasts in a 3D Synthetic Lung Extracellular Matrix Mimic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;hydrogel that mimics the protein content and stiffness of healthy lung tissue is synthesized. Lung&#8208;mimicking material is applied&#160;to reveal the ability of tenascin&#8208;C to activate fibroblasts in lung&#8208;metastatic breast cancer. This novel hydrogel environment will be incredibly useful for research questions involving the lung extracellular matrix.








Abstract
The lung extracellular matrix (ECM) maintains the structural integrity of the tissue and regulates the phenotype and functions of resident fibroblasts. Lung&#8208;metastatic breast cancer alters these cell&#8208;ECM interactions, promoting fibroblast activation. There is a need for bio&#8208;instructive ECM models that match the ECM composition and biomechanics of the lung to study these cell&#8208;matrix interactions in vitro. Here, a synthetic, bioactive hydrogel is synthesized that mimics the native lung modulus and includes a representative distribution of the most abundant ECM peptide motifs responsible for integrin&#8208;binding and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;mediated degradation in the lung, which enables quiescent culture of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Stimulation with transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1), metastatic breast cancer conditioned media (CM), or tenascin&#8208;C&#8208;derived integrin&#8208;binding peptide activated hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated HLFs demonstrates multiple environmental methods to activate HLFs in a lung ECM&#8208;mimicking hydrogel. This lung hydrogel platform is a tunable, synthetic approach to studying the independent and combinatorial effects of ECM in regulating fibroblast quiescence and activation.

         <title>Completely Activated and Phase&#8208;Transformed Kfemnhcf for Zn/K Hybrid Batteries with 14500 Cycles by an OH&#8208;rich Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates have been recognized as superior cathode materials for zinc and zinc hybrid batteries, particularly the Prussian blue analogue (PBA). However, PBA development has been hindered by several limitations, including small capacities (&lt; 70 mAh g&#8722;1) and short lifespans (&lt;1000 cycles). These limitations generally arise due to incomplete activation of redox sites and structure collapse during intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in PBAs. According to this study, the adoption of a hydroxyl&#8208;rich (OH&#8208;rich) hydrogel electrolyte with extended electrochemical stability windows (ESWs) can effectively activate the redox site of low&#8208;spin Fe of the KxFeyMn1&#8208;y[Fe(CN)6]w&#183;zH2O (KFeMnHCF) cathode while tuning its structure. Additionally, the strong adhesion of the hydrogel electrolyte inhibits KFeMnHCF particles from falling off the cathode and dissolving. The easy desolvation of metal ions in the developed OH&#8208;rich hydrogel electrolytes can lead to a fast and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in the PBA cathode. As a result, the Zn||KFeMnHCF hybrid batteries achieve the unprecedented characteristics of 14500 cycles, a 1.7&#160;V discharge plateau, and a 100 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity. The results of this study provide a new understanding of the development of zinc hybrid batteries with PBA cathode materials and present a promising new electrolyte material for this application.

         <title>Reversible Crosslinking of Commodity Polymers via Photo&#8208;Controlled Metal&#8208;Ligand Coordination for High&#8208;Performance And Recyclable Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thermoset plastics, highly desired for their stability, durability, and chemical resistance, are currently consumed over 60 million tons annually across the globe, but they are difficult to recycle due to their crosslinked structures. The development of recyclable thermoset plastics is an important but challenging task. Here, we prepare recyclable thermoset plastics by crosslinking a commodity polymer, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with a small percentage of a Ru complex via nitrile&#8208;Ru coordination. PAN is obtained from industry and the Ru complex is synthesized in one step, which enables the production of recyclable thermoset plastics in an efficient way. Additionally, the thermoset plastics exhibit impressive mechanical performance, boasting a Young's modulus of 6.3&#160;GPa and a tensile strength of 109.8&#160;MPa. Moreover, they can be decrosslinked when exposed to both light and a solvent, and can then be re&#8208;crosslinked upon heating. This reversible crosslinking mechanism enables the recycling of thermosets from a mixture of plastic waste. We also demonstrate the preparation of recyclable thermosets from other commodity polymers such as SAN resins and polymer composites through reversible crosslinking. This study shows reversible crosslinking via metal&#8208;ligand coordination is a new strategy for designing recyclable thermosets using commodity polymers.

         <title>Water Induced Bandgap Engineering in Nanoribbons of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It has been predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator&#8208;metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, we&#160;theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that water adsorption greatly reduces bandgap of zigzag oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water adsorbed beside the BNNR induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V/nm thereby reducing its bandgap. Field effect transistors were&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of zBNNRs with adsorbates of water could&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements were&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgap in zBNNR. Wider zBNNRs exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV. This study yields fundamental insights in new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence And Photoluminescence Heterojunction for Superior Multi&#8208;mode Sensing Platform of Friction, Force, Pressure And Temperature in Fibers And 3D&#8208;printed Polymers</title>

Abstract
Endowing a single material with various types of luminescence, i.e., exhibiting a simultaneous optical response to different stimuli, is vital in various fields. A photoluminescence (PL)&#8208; and mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based multifunctional sensing platform was&#160;built by combining heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS:Mn2+ mechano&#8208;photonic materials using a 3D&#8208;printing technique and fiber spinning. ML&#8208;active particles were&#160;embedded in micron&#8208;sized cellulose fibers for flexible optical devices capable of emitting light driven by mechanical force. We&#160;also fabricated individual modified 3D&#8208;printed hard units that exhibit intense ML in response to mechanical deformation such as impact and friction. Importantly, they also allow low&#8208;pressure sensing up to &#8764;100&#160;bar, a range previously inaccessible by any other optical sensing technique. Moreover, the developed optical manometer based on the PL of the materials demonstrates a superior high&#8208;pressure sensitivity of &#8764;6.20&#160;nm/GPa. Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation&#8208; and emission&#8208;band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening and lifetime shortening. Our&#160;work supports the possibility of&#160;mass production of ML&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.

Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation- and emission-band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening and lifetime shortening. Our&#160;work supports the possibility of&#160;mass production of ML-active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Optimization of Charge Management And Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) have received tremendous attention in recent decades because of their advantages over their polymer counterparts. These advantages include well&#8208;defined chemical structures, easy purification, and negligible batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation. Remarkable progress with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17% has recently been achieved with improved charge management (FF &#215; JSC) and reduced energy loss (Eloss). Morphology control is the key factor in the progress of ASM&#8208;OSCs, which remains a significant challenge because of the similarities in the molecular structures of the donors and acceptors. In this review, we summarize the effective strategies for charge management and/or Eloss reduction from the perspective of effective morphology control. We aim to provide practical insights and guidance for material design and device optimization to promote further development of ASM&#8208;OSCs to a level where they can compete with or even surpass the efficiency of polymer solar cells.

         <title>Mechanochromism and Strain&#8208;Induced Crystallization in Thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived Stereoelastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Most elastomers undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization (SIC) under tension; as individual chains are held rigidly in a fixed position by an applied strain, their alignment along the strain field results in a shift from strain&#8208;hardening (SH) to SIC. A similar degree of stretching is associated with the tension necessary to accelerate mechanically&#8208;coupled, covalent chemical responses of mechanophores in overstretched chains, raising the possibility of an interplay between the macroscopic response of SIC, and the molecular response of mechanophore activation. Here we report thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived stereoelastomers, doped covalently with a dipropiolate&#8208;derivatized spiropyran (SP) mechanophore (0.25&#8208;0.38 mol%). Material properties of SP&#8208;containing films are consistent with undoped controls, indicating that the SP behaves as a reporter of the mechanical state of the polymer film. Uniaxial tensile tests reveal correlations between mechanochromism and SIC, which are strain rate&#8208;dependent. Potential consequences of the correlations between mechanochromism and SIC include the possibility that mechanochromophores may provide a pathway to bridge these phenomena, since molecular&#8208;level mechanochemical activation results in a macroscopic color change in the bulk material. When mechanochromic films are stretched slowly to the point of mechanophore activation, the covalently tethered mechanophore remains trapped in a force&#8208;activated state, even after the applied stress is removed. Additionally, the kinetics of mechanophore reversion correlate with the applied strain rate, resulting in highly tunable decoloration rates. Because these polymers are not covalently cross&#8208;linked, they can be recycled by melt&#8208;pressing into new films, which increases their potential range of strain&#8208;sensing, morphology&#8208;sensing, and shape&#8208;memory applications.

         <title>Intense Hydrochromic Photon Upconversion from Lead&#8208;Free Zero&#8208;Dimensional Metal Halides For Water Detection and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrochromic materials that change their luminescence color upon exposure to moisture have attracted considerable attention owing to their applications in sensing and information encryption. However, the existing materials lack high hydrochromic response and color tunability. This study reports the development of a new and bright zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3GdCl6 metal halide as the host for hydrochromic photon upconversion in the form of polycrystals (PCs) and nanocrystals (NCs). Lanthanides co&#8208;doped cesium gadolinium chloride metal halides exhibit upconversion luminescence (UCL) in the visible&#8211;infrared region upon 980&#160;nm laser excitation. In particular, Yb3+ and Er3+ co&#8208;doped PCs exhibit hydrochrmic UCL color change from green to red. These hydrochromic properties are quantitatively confirmed through sensitive detection of water in the tetrahydrofuran solvent via UCL color changes. This water&#8208;sensing probe exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Furthermore, the hydrochromic UCL property is exploited for stimuli&#8208;responsive information encryption via cyphertexts. These findings will pave way for the development of new hydrochromic upconverting materials for emerging applications, such as noncontact sensors, anticounterfeit and information encryption.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency of Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting by Structural Vibration Entropy in Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The majority of waste&#8208;heat energy exists in the form of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#176;C), which is immensely difficult to convert into usable energy using conventional energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC), which integrate battery and thermal&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting functionalities, have been considered an attractive system for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. Herein, we investigate the role of structural vibration modes in enhancing the efficacy of TREC systems. We analyze how changes in bonding covalency, influenced by the amount of structural water molecules, impact the vibration modes. We discover that even small amounts of water molecules can induce the A1g stretching mode of cyanide ligands with strong structural vibration energy, which significantly contributes to a larger temperature coefficient (&#593;) in a TREC system. Leveraging these insights, we have designed and implemented a highly efficient TREC system using a sodium&#8208;ion&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential of TREC systems, offering a deeper understanding of the intrinsic properties of Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) regulated by structural vibration modes. These insights open up new possibilities for enhancing the energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities of TREC systems.

         <title>Water Activation in Solar&#8208;Powered Vapor Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered water evaporation (SWE), based on the liquid&#8208;gas phase conversion concept using solar energy, has been given close attention as a promising technology to address the global water shortage. At molecular level, water molecules escaping from liquid water should overcome the attraction of the molecules on the liquid surface layer to evaporate. For this reason, it is better to reduce the energy required for evaporation by breaking a smaller number of hydrogen bonds or forming weak hydrogen bonds to ensure efficient and convenient vapor production. Many novel evaporator materials and effective water activation strategies have been proposed to stimulate rapid steam production and surpass the theoretical thermal limit. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the phase/enthalpy change process of water evaporation is unclear. In this review, we provide a summary of theoretical analyses of vaporization enthalpy, general calculations, and characterization methods. We have also outlined various water activation mechanisms to reduce evaporation enthalpy in evaporators. Moreover, unsolved issues associated with water activation are critically discussed to provide a direction for future research. Meanwhile, significant pioneering developments made in SWE have been highlighted, hoping to provide a relatively entire chain for more scholars who are just stepping into this field.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorinated carbon (CFx) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C&#8208;F bond in the highly fluorinated CFx. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG&#8208;N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C&#8208;F bonds. The DFG&#8208;N delivers an unprecedented dual performance for lithium primary batteries with a power density of 77456&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of 1067&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an ultrafast rate of 50 C, which is the highest level reported to date. The DFG&#8208;N also achieved a record power density of 15256 and 17881&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 C for sodium and potassium primary batteries, respectively. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the excellent performance of DFG&#8208;N is attributed to surface engineering strategies that remarkably improve electronic and ionic conductivity without sacrificing the high fluorine content. This work provides a compelling strategy for developing advanced ultrafast primary batteries that combine ultrahigh energy density and power density.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated carbon (CF&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C-F bond in the highly fluorinated CF&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG-N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C-F bonds.

         <title>Non&#8208;blinking Luminescence from Charged Single Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking behaviour from single quantum dots under steady illumination is an important but controversial topic. Its occurrence has impeded the use of single quantum dots in bio&#8208;imaging. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for it, although controversial, the most important of which is the non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination mechanism whereby photo&#8208;charging of quantum dots can lead to the blinking phenomenon. Here, the singly charged trion, which maintains photon emission, including the radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination, leads to fluorescence non&#8208;blinking which was observed in photo&#8208;charged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of different energy levels in the GQDs, caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups in the single GQDs. The suppressed blinking is due to the filling of trap sites owing to a Coulomb blockade. Our results provide a profound understanding of the special optical properties of GQDs, affording a reference for further in&#8208;depth research.

         <title>Thin Film Organic Heteroepitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, while rules for commensurate epitaxy of covalent or ionic inorganic material systems are known to be dictated by lattice matching constraints, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems are still being written. Here, we&#160; find that lattice matching alone is insufficient to achieve heteroepitaxy in molecular systems, owing to weak intermolecular forces that describe molecular crystals. We&#160; find that, in addition, the lattice matched plane also must be the lowest energy surface of the adcrystal to achieve, for the first time, one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate molecular heteroepitaxy. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the lattice matched interface to be of higher electronic quality than a disordered interface of the same materials.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring of Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of perovskite solar cells is a significant challenge for commercialization due to the inherent instability of the perovskite material and the interface defects between different layers in the device. Tailoring the interfaces in perovskite solar cells can enhance the device's efficiency and stability. This review discusses the theory of interface improvement and various interface materials for efficient, stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The interface tailoring is crucial for the efficiency and stability of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). The reported interface engineering primarily focuses on the energy level turning and trap state passivation to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this review, molecule modifications are classified according to the basics of electron transfer mechanisms for the interface tailoring of materials. An in&#8208;depth analysis of energy level modification and trap passivation, as well as the universal Density Functional Theory (DFT) method employed in interface tailoring. In addition, strategies to address environmental protection and large&#8208;scale mini&#8208;modules fabrication by interface engineering are also discussed. This review can guide the researchers in understanding interface engineering to design interface materials for efficient, stable, and eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

A comprehensive review is proposed on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four ultrasound&#8208;related biological applications and disease treatments. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are also conducted, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT).








Abstract
Nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented ultrasound (US) medicine is a unique area of interdisciplinary research that focuses on designing and engineering functional nanosystems to address the challenging issues in US&#8208;based biomedicine, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional microbubbles and optimizing the design of contrast and sonosensitive agents. The single&#8208;faceted summary of available US&#8208;related therapies is still a significant drawback. Here, The proposal of a comprehensive review on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four US&#8208;related biological applications and disease theranostics is aimed. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are relatively lacking, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT). The design concepts of the specific sono&#8208;therapies based on nanomedicines are initially introduced. Furthermore, the representative paradigms for nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/enhanced US therapies are elaborated according to therapeutic principles and diversity. This review provides an updated and comprehensive review of the field of nanoultrasonic biomedicine, and comprehensively discusses the progress of versatile ultrasonic disease treatments. Finally, the deep discussion on the facing challenges and prospects is expected to promote the emergence and establishment of a new branch of US biomedicine through the rational combination of nanomedicine and US clinical biomedicine.

         <title>Efficient Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells via Natural Tin Oxide Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit improved film morphology, crystallization, optical properties, and more interestingly, an upshifted Fermi level. Consequently, SnOx&#8208;doped devices have considerably reduced defects and improved transport of major carriers, resulting in a maximum efficiency of 22.16% for Sn&#8208;Pb single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable efficiency of 26.01% for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin/lead&#8208;based (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention for use in tandem solar cells. However, they are still plagued by serious carrier recombination due to inferior film properties resulting from the alloying of Sn with Pb elements, which leads to p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping behaviors. This work reports an effective tin oxide (SnOx) doping strategy to produce high&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films for utilization in efficient single&#8208;junction and tandem PSCs. SnOx can be naturally oxidized from tin diiodide raw powders and successfully incorporated into Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. Consequently, Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit dramatically improved morphology, crystallization, absorption, and more interestingly, upward&#8208;shifted Fermi levels. The resulting narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with natural SnOx doping have considerably reduced carrier recombination, therefore delivering a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16% for single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable PCE of 26.01% (with a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 25.33%) for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells. This work introduces a facile doping strategy for the manufacture of efficient single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap PSCs and their tandem solar cells.

         <title>3D Optical Coherence Thermometry Using Polymeric Nanogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translation of nanothermometry to the clinic faces limitations like lack of 3D thermal images and the need for tools that are clinically unavailable. To overcome them, optical coherence thermometry (OCTh) is developed by combining thermoresponsive nanogels with conventional optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems employed daily at hospitals. OCTh makes possible 3D thermal imaging of tissues subjected to photothermal processes.








Abstract
In nanothermometry, the use of nanoparticles as thermal probes enables remote and minimally invasive sensing. In the biomedical context, nanothermometry has emerged as a powerful tool where traditional approaches, like infrared thermal sensing and contact thermometers, fall short. Despite the strides of this technology in preclinical settings, nanothermometry is not mature enough to be translated to the bedside. This is due to two major hurdles: the inability to perform 3D&#160;thermal imaging and the requirement for tools that are readily available in the clinics. This work simultaneously overcomes both limitations by proposing the technology of optical coherence thermometry (OCTh). This is achieved by combining thermoresponsive polymeric nanogels and optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#8212;a 3D imaging technology routinely used in clinical practice. The volume phase transition of the thermoresponsive nanogels causes marked changes in their refractive index, making them temperature&#8208;sensitive OCT contrast agents. The ability of OCTh to provide 3D thermal images is demonstrated in tissue phantoms subjected to photothermal processes, and its reliability is corroborated by comparing experimental results with numerical simulations. The results included in this work set credible foundations for the implementation of nanothermometry in the form of OCTh in clinical practice.

         <title>Highly Reliable Textile&#8208;Type Memristor by Designing Aligned Nanochannels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor is fabricated by designing Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8776;0.089&#160;V). The resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array with high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity could seamlessly unify with sensing, power&#8208;supplying, and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interactions.








Abstract
Information&#8208;processing devices are the core components of modern electronics. Integrating them into textiles is the indispensable demand for electronic textiles to form close&#8208;loop functional systems. Memristors with crossbar configuration are regarded as promising building blocks to design woven information&#8208;processing devices that seamlessly unify with textiles. However, the memristors always suffer from severe temporal and spatial variations due to the random growth of conductive filaments during filamentary switching processes. Here, inspired by the ion nanochannels across synaptic membranes, a highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor made of Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8776;0.089&#160;V), high on/off ratio (&#8776;106), and low power consumption (0.1&#160;nW), is reported. Experimental evidence indicate that nanochannels with abundant active S defects can anchor silver ions and confine their migrations to form orderly and efficient conductive filaments. Such memristive performances enable the resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array to have high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity and process complex physiological data like brainwave signals with high recognition accuracy (95%). The textile&#8208;type memristor arrays are mechanically durable to withstand hundreds of bending and sliding deformations, and seamlessly unified with sensing, power&#8208;supplying, and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new generation human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Rocket&#8208;Inspired Effervescent Motors for Oral Macromolecule Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure and function of rockets, a novel micromotor delivery system is presented with scaled&#8208;down rocket&#8208;like architecture and effervescent&#8208;tablets&#8208;derived fuel for efficient oral macromolecule delivery by penetrating the intestinal barrier. It is demonstrated that these motors can efficiently move and stab into the intestinal mucosa for insulin delivery, exhibiting efficacy in regulating blood glucose level in a&#160;diabetic rabbit model.








Abstract
Oral administration is among the most convenient ways with good patient compliance for drug delivery; while it remains a challenge to achieve desirable bioavailability of most macromolecules due to the complex gastrointestinal barriers. Here, inspired by the structure and function of rocket, a novel micromotor delivery system is presented with scaled&#8208;down rocket&#8208;like architecture and effervescent&#8208;tablets&#8208;derived fuel for efficient oral macromolecule delivery by penetrating intestinal barrier. These rocket&#8208;inspired effervescent motors (RIEMs) are composed of sharp needle tips for both loading cargoes and efficient penetrating, and tail wings for loading effervescent powders and avoiding perforation. When exposed to a water environment, the effervescent fuel generates intensive CO2 bubbles to propel the RIEMs to move at high speed. Thus, the RIEMs with their sharp tip can inject into the surrounding mucosa for effective drug release. Furthermore, benefiting from their tail&#8208;wing design, perforation can be effectively avoided during the injection process, ensuring the safety of the RIEMs in gastrointestinal active delivery. Based on these advantages, it is demonstrated that the RIEMs can efficiently move and stab into the intestinal mucosa for insulin delivery, exhibiting efficacy in regulating blood sugar glucose in a diabetic rabbit model. These features indicate that these RIEMs are versatile and valuable for clinical oral delivery of macromolecules.

         <title>Single&#8208;Gate In&#8208;Transistor Readout of Current Superposition and Collapse Utilizing Quantum Tunneling and Ferroelectric Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superposition and collapse of nanostructured in&#8208;transistor current networks are demonstrated to be read and decoded by quantum tunneling and ferroelectric switching in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays and planar&#8208;gated nanofilms. The drain current output is therefore endowed with polymorphism due to the interplay of the polysilicon and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanostructures.








Abstract
In nanostructure assemblies, the superposition of current paths forms microscopic electric circuits, and different circuit networks produce varying results, particularly when utilized as transistor channels for computing applications. However, the intricate nature of assembly networks and the winding paths of commensurate currents hinder standard circuit modeling. Inspired by the quantum collapse of superposition states for information decoding in quantum circuits, the implementation of analogous current path collapse to facilitate the detection of microscopic circuits by modifying their network topology is explored. Here, the superposition and collapse of current paths in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to enrich the computational resources within transistors by engineering the channel length and quantity. Switching the ferroelectric polarization of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 gate dielectric, which drives these transistors out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, decodes the output polymorphism through circuit topological modifications. Furthermore, a protocol for the single&#8208;electron readout of ferroelectric polarization is presented with tailoring the channel coherence. The introduction of lateral path superposition results into intriguing metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions due to transient behavior of ferroelectric switching. This ability to adjust the current networks within transistors and their interaction with ferroelectric polarization in polycrystalline nanostructures lays the groundwork for generating diverse current characteristics as potential physical databases for optimization&#8208;based computing.

         <title>Charge Concentration Limits the Hydrogen Evolution Rate in Organic Nanoparticle Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity shows that the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by aqueous&#8208;soluble organic donor&#8211;acceptor nanoparticles is limited by charge concentration, and that nanoparticles have 3&#215; more long&#8208;lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition.








Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity is used to compare aqueous&#8208;soluble organic nanoparticle photocatalysts and bulk thin films composed of the same mixture of semiconducting polymer and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor molecule and the relationship between composition, interfacial surface area, charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, and photocatalytic activity is examined. The rate of hydrogen evolution reaction by nanoparticles composed of various donor:acceptor blend ratio compositions is quantitatively measured, and it is found that the most active blend ratio displays a hydrogen quantum yield of 0.83% per photon. Moreover, it is found that nanoparticle photocatalytic activity corresponds directly to charge generation, and that nanoparticles have 3&#215; more long&#8208;lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition. These results suggest that, under the current reaction conditions, with &#8776;3&#215; solar flux, catalytic activity by the nanoparticles is limited by the concentration of electrons and holes in operando and not a finite number of active surface sites or the catalytic rate at the interface. This provides a clear design goal for the next generation of efficient photocatalytic nanoparticles.

         <title>Separating Crystal Growth from Nucleation Enables the In Situ Controllable Synthesis of Nanocrystals for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylic acid&#8208;containing ammonium ligands separate nucleation and crystal growth in in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed perovskite nanocrystals, enabling quantum&#8208;confined nanocrystals with narrow size distributions. Deprotonated phosphonates further enhance photoluminescence quantum yields to unity through defect passivation. These allow for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with a maximum current efficiency of 109&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1 and a 45.6 h operating half&#8208;time with an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) display bright luminescence for light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications; however, they require post&#8208;synthesis ligand exchange that may cause surface degradation and defect formation. In situ&#8208;formed PNCs achieve improved surface passivation using a straightforward synthetic approach, but their LED performance at the green wavelength is not yet comparable with that of colloidal PNC devices. Here, it is found that the limitations of in situ&#8208;formed PNCs stem from uncontrolled formation kinetics: conventional surface ligands confine perovskite nuclei but fail to delay crystal growth. A bifunctional carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;containing ammonium hydrobromide ligand that separates crystal growth from nucleation is introduced, leading to the formation of quantum&#8208;confined PNC solids exhibiting a narrow size distribution. Controlled crystallization is further coupled with defect passivation using deprotonated phosphinates, enabling improvements in photoluminescence quantum yield to near unity. Green LEDs are fabricated with a maximum current efficiency of 109&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1 and an average external quantum efficiency of 22.5% across 25 devices, exceeding the performance of their colloidal PNC&#8208;based counterparts. A 45.6 h operating half&#8208;time is further documented for an unencapsulated device in N2 with an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Formation of Amorphous Iron&#8208;Calcium Phosphate with High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;bearing amorphous calcium phosphate (Fe&#8208;ACP) is prepared in the presence of ammonium iron citrate. The Fe&#8208;ACP particles can be highly stable in water and simulated body fluid. The particles show good biocompatibility and osteogenic properties. By applying the Fe&#8208;ACP particles as initial powders, calcium iron phosphate ceramics with superior mechanical strength and acid resistance are prepared.








Abstract
Amorphous iron&#8208;calcium phosphate (Fe&#8208;ACP) plays a vital role in the mechanical properties of teeth of some rodents, which are very hard, but its formation process and synthetic route remain unknown. Here, the synthesis and characterization of an iron&#8208;bearing amorphous calcium phosphate in the presence of ammonium iron citrate (AIC) are reported. The iron is distributed homogeneously on the nanometer scale in the resulting particles. The prepared Fe&#8208;ACP particles can be highly stable in aqueous media, including water, simulated body fluid, and acetate buffer solution (pH 4). In vitro study demonstrates that these particles have good biocompatibility and osteogenic properties. Subsequently, Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is utilized to consolidate the initial Fe&#8208;ACP powders. The results show that the hardness of the ceramics increases with the increase of iron content, but an excess of iron leads to a rapid decline in hardness. Calcium iron phosphate ceramics with a hardness of 4&#160;GPa can be achieved, which is higher than that of human enamel. Furthermore, the ceramics composed of iron&#8208;calcium phosphates show enhanced acid resistance. This study provides a novel route to prepare Fe&#8208;ACP, and presents the potential role of Fe&#8208;ACP in biomineralization and as starting material to fabricate acid&#8208;resistant high&#8208;performance bioceramics.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enabled Intelligent Design of Thermal Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning&#8208;enabled intelligent design method of thermal metamaterials is proposed by using a deep generative model. To realize automatic, real&#8208;time, and customizable design of thermal metamaterials, this framework is constructed via a pre&#8208;trained deep learning model to achieve an end&#8208;to&#8208;end mapping relationship between thermal response and microstructure, which provides great flexibility in the on&#8208;demand inverse design of thermal metamaterials.








Abstract
Thermal metamaterials are mixture&#8208;based materials that are engineered to manipulate, control, and process the flow of heat, enabling numerous advanced thermal metadevices. Conventional thermal metamaterials are predominantly designed with tractable regular geometries owing to the delicate analytical solution and easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement effective structures. Nevertheless, it is challenging to achieve the design of thermal metamaterials with arbitrary geometry, letting alone intelligent (automatic, real&#8208;time, and customizable) design of thermal metamaterials. Here, an intelligent design framework of thermal metamaterials is presented via a pre&#8208;trained deep learning model, which gracefully achieves the desired functional structures of thermal metamaterials with exceptional speed and efficiency, regardless of arbitrary geometry. It possesses incomparable versatility and is of great flexibility to achieve the corresponding design of thermal metamaterials with different background materials, anisotropic geometries, and thermal functionalities. The transformation thermotics&#8208;induced, freeform, background&#8208;independent, and omnidirectional thermal cloaks, whose structural configurations are automatically designed in real&#8208;time according to shape and background, are numerically and experimentally demonstrated. This study sets up a novel paradigm for an automatic and real&#8208;time design of thermal metamaterials in a new design scenario. More generally, it may open a door to the realization of an intelligent design of metamaterials in also other physical domains.

         <title>Dendritic Solid Polymer Electrolytes: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the review, it is not only focused on reviewing dendritic polymer electrolytes (PEs) in basic concept, synthesis methodologies, balancing of properties, ion transport mechanism, etc. but also try to outline the possibility of dendritic PEs toward on&#8208;demand design. It is believed that including examples of designing advanced/safe dendritic PEs will show the readers a more comprehensive prospect of this burgeoning field.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ions battery is widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve energy density. Therefore, Li&#8208;ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as a narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility, and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. In the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.

         <title>Augmenting Immunogenic Cell Death and Alleviating Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells by Sono&#8208;Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Nanopartners for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sono&#8208;activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartner is reported to overcome post&#8208;treatment hypoxia and target myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells for cancer immunotherapy. The release of drug partners in tumor microenvironment is precisely controlled by ultrasound activation, augmenting immunogenic cell death, and alleviating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells simultaneously. This sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic strategy greatly amplifies immunological effect for inhibiting bilateral tumor growths and preventing tumor metastases.








Abstract
Inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) by sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is promising for cancer immunotherapy, which however is inefficient due to oxygen depletion that compromises SDT effect and mediates recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The fabrication of sono&#8208;activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartners (SPNTi) to simultaneously augment ICD and alleviate MDSCs for immunotherapy is reported. A sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, hydrophobic hypoxia&#8208;responsive tirapazamine (TPZ)&#8208;conjugate, and MDSC&#8208;targeting drug (ibrutinib) are encapsulated inside such SPNTi with surface shell of a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;cleavable amphiphilic polymer. TPZ and ibrutinib serve as drug partners to enlarge immunotherapeutic effect. Upon sono&#8208;activation, SPNTi generate 1O2 to break 1O2&#8208;cleavable polymers for in situ liberations of TPZ&#8208;conjugate and ibrutinib in tumor sites, and oxygen is consumed to create severe hypoxic tumor microenvironment, in which, TPZ&#8208;conjugate is activated for augmenting ICD action, while ibrutinib alleviates MDSCs for promoting antitumor immunological effect. In a bilateral tumor mouse model, SPNTi&#8208;mediated sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapy results in growth restraints of primary and distant tumors and noteworthy precaution of tumor metastases. This study thus provides a sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic strategy with high precision and safety for cancer via overcoming post&#8208;treatment hypoxia and targeting MDSCs.

A versatile molecule featured by aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely DHTDP, synchronously enabling second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence and efficient photothermal conversion is developed elaborately. By camouflaging DHTDP nanoparticles with cancer cell membrane, the resultant biomimetic nanoparticles exhibit significantly facilitated delivery efficiency and homologous targeting capability, successfully achieving precise imaging and maximized therapeutic outcomes via trimodal imaging (NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8211;photoacoustic&#8211;photothermal imaging) guided photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Multimodal phototheranostics on the basis of a single molecule with one&#8208;for&#8208;all characteristics represents a convenient approach for effective cancer treatment. In this report, a versatile molecule featured by aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely DHTDP, synchronously enabling second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission and efficient photothermal conversion is developed by elaborate structural modulation. By camouflaging DHTDP nanoparticles with cancer cell membrane, the resultant biomimetic nanoparticles exhibit significantly both facilitated delivery efficiency and homologous targeting capability, and afford precise imaging guidance and maximize therapeutic outcomes in form of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (FLI)&#8211;photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8211;photothermal imaging (PTI) trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT). This study presents the first example of biomimetic multimodal phototheranostics loaded by homogeneity&#8208;targeting cell membrane, thus brings a new insight into the exploration of superior phototheranostics for practical cancer theranostics.

         <title>Phonon Polaritonics in Broad Terahertz Frequency Range with Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 offers low&#8208;loss, ultra&#8208;broadband, and temperature insensitive phonon&#8211;polaritons in the frequency range of 7&#8211;13&#160;THz within the &#8220;new terahertz gap&#8221;. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept phonon&#8211;polaritonic concentrators are experimentally realized to enhance electric field to the order of GV m&#8208;1 over a large volume resolvable by far&#8208;field optics for potential applications in non&#8208;equilibrium quantum materials and infrared molecular spectroscopy.








Abstract
Photonics in the frequency range of 5&#8211;15&#160;terahertz (THz) potentially open a new realm of quantum materials manipulation and biosensing. This range, sometimes called &#8220;the new terahertz gap&#8221;, is traditionally difficult to access due to prevalent phonon absorption bands in solids. Low&#8208;loss phonon&#8211;polariton materials may realize sub&#8208;wavelength, on&#8208;chip photonic devices, but typically operate in mid&#8208;infrared frequencies with narrow bandwidths and are difficult to manufacture on a large scale. Here, for the first time, quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 enables broadband surface phonon&#8211;polaritonic devices in 7&#8211;13&#160;THz. As a proof of concept, polarization&#8208;independent field concentrators are designed and fabricated to locally enhance intense, multicycle THz pulses by a factor of 6 and increase the spectral intensity by over 90 times. The time&#8208;resolved electric field inside the concentrators is experimentally measured by THz&#8208;field&#8208;induced second harmonic generation. Illuminated by a table&#8208;top light source, the average field reaches 0.5&#160;GV&#160;m&#8722;1 over a large volume resolvable by far&#8208;field optics. These&#160;results potentially enable scalable THz photonics with high breakdown fields made of various commercially available phonon&#8211;polariton crystals for studying driven phases in quantum materials and nonlinear molecular spectroscopy.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Crystal Biphasic Ferroelectrics with Tunable Biferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholestanyl 4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoate (X = Cl, Br, and&#160;I) shows ferroelectricity in solid and liquid&#8208;crystal phases, distinct from traditional ferroelectrics with either solid or liquid&#8208;crystal ferroelectric phases. Its solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid crystal transition temperature (TS&#8211;S and TS&#8211;LC) and spontaneous polarization in solid and liquid&#8208;crystal phases can be regulated by halogen substitutions, which are unprecedented in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity has been separately found in numerous solid and liquid crystal materials since its first discovery in 1920. However, a single material with biferroelectricity existing in both solid and liquid crystal phases is very rare, and the regulation of biferroelectricity has never been studied. Here, solid&#8211;liquid crystal biphasic ferroelectrics, cholestanyl 4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoate (4X&#8208;CB, X = Cl, Br, and I), which exhibits biferroelectricity in both the solid and liquid crystal phases, is presented. It is noted that the ferroelectric liquid crystal phase of 4X&#8208;CB is a cholesteric one, distinct from the ordinary chiral smectic ferroelectric liquid crystal phase. Moreover, 4X&#8208;CB shows solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid crystal phase transitions, of which the transition temperatures gradually increase from Cl to Br to I substitution. The spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 4X&#8208;CB in both solid and liquid crystal phases can also be regulated by different halogen substitutions, where the 4Br&#8208;CB has the optimal Ps because of the larger molecular dipole moment. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, 4X&#8208;CB is the first ferroelectric with tunable biferroelectricity, which offers a feasible case for the performance optimization of solid&#8211;liquid crystal biphasic ferroelectrics.

         <title>Intrinsic Descriptor Guided Noble Metal Cathode Design for Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsic descriptor &#966; is discovered to predict high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 battery cathode materials, which is experimentally verified and effectively guides the design of Pd@graphene catalyst with an ultralow overpotential (0.41&#160;V) and superior cycling performance up to 1400&#160;h.








Abstract
To date, the effect of noble metal (NM) electronic structures on CO2 reaction activity remains unknown, and explicit screening criteria are still lacking for designing highly efficient catalysts in CO2&#8208;breathing batteries. Herein, by preferentially considering the decomposition of key intermediate Li2CO3, an intrinsic descriptor constituted of the dx2&#8722;y2${{\rm{d}}}_{{x}^2 - {y}^2}$ orbital states and the electronegativity for predicting high&#8208;performance cathode material are discovered. As a demonstration, a series of graphene&#8208;supported noble metals (NM@G) as cathodes are fabricated via a fast laser scribing technique.

&lt;p&gt;An intrinsic descriptor &lt;i&gt;&#966;&lt;/i&gt; is discovered to predict high-performance Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery cathode materials, which is experimentally verified and effectively guides the design of Pd@graphene catalyst with an ultralow overpotential (0.41&#160;V) and superior cycling performance up to 1400&#160;h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the effect of noble metal (NM) electronic structures on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reaction activity remains unknown, and explicit screening criteria are still lacking for designing highly efficient catalysts in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-breathing batteries. Herein, by preferentially considering the decomposition of key intermediate Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an intrinsic descriptor constituted of the dx2&#8722;y2${{\rm{d}}}_{{x}^2 - {y}^2}$ orbital states and the electronegativity for predicting high-performance cathode material are discovered. As a demonstration, a series of graphene-supported noble metals (NM@G) as cathodes are fabricated via a fast laser scribing technique. Consistent with the preliminary prediction, Pd@G exhibits an ultralow overpotential (0.41&#160;V), along with superior cycling performance up to 1400&#160;h. Moreover, the overall thermodynamic reaction pathways on NM@G confirm the reliability of the established intrinsic descriptor. This basic finding of the relationship between the electronic properties of noble metal cathodes and the performance of Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries provides a novel avenue for designing remarkably efficient cathode materials for metal-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isotope Exchange Raman Spectroscopy (IERS): A Novel Technique to Probe Physicochemical Processes In Situ</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ technique for the direct characterization of mass&#8208;transport properties is presented, which is based on the coupling of Raman spectroscopy to isothermal isotope exchanges. Its original concept and unique strengths are demonstrated by studying Gd&#8208;doped ceria thin films. It is a new, rapid, cheap, and non&#8208;destructive approach to make O&#8208;transport visible that can be readily expanded to many laboratories worldwide.








Abstract
A novel in situ methodology for the direct study of mass&#8208;transport properties in oxides with spatial and unprecedented time resolution, based on Raman spectroscopy coupled to isothermal isotope exchanges, is developed. Changes in the isotope concentration, resulting in a Raman frequency shift, can be followed in real time, which is not accessible by conventional methods, enabling complementary insights for the study of ion&#8208;transport properties of electrode and electrolyte materials for advanced solid&#8208;state electrochemical devices. The proof of concept and strengths of isotope exchange Raman spectroscopy (IERS) is demonstrated by studying the oxygen isotope back&#8208;exchange in gadolinium&#8208;doped ceria (CGO) thin films. Resulting oxygen self&#8208;diffusion and surface exchange coefficients are compared to conventional time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) characterization and literature values, showing good agreement, while at the same time providing additional insight, challenging established assumptions. IERS captivates through its rapidity, simple setup, non&#8208;destructive nature, cost effectiveness, and versatile fields of application and thus can readily be integrated as new standard tool for in situ and operando characterization in many laboratories worldwide. The applicability of this method is expected to consolidate the&#160;understanding of elementary physicochemical processes and impact various emerging fields including solid oxide cells, battery research, and&#160;beyond.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Solvents Catalyzed Structural Transformation in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of 2D&#8211;3D structural transformation in metal halide compounds, in presence of protic solvents is elucidated. Hydrogen bonds between&#160;the solvent and different anions dictate the catalytic function, and the barrier reduction to allow the structural transformation. Interesting grain centers and grain boundaries are transformed differently, allowing design of artificial heterostructures.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites show the capability of performing structural transformation, allowing the formation of functional heterostructures. Unfortunately, the elusive mechanism governing these transformations limits their technological application. Herein, the mechanism of 2D&#8211;3D structural transformation is unraveled as catalyzed by solvents. By combining a spatial&#8208;temporal cation interdiffusivity simulation with experimental findings, it is&#160;validated that, protic solvents foster the dissociation degree of formadinium iodide (FAI) via dynamic hydrogen bond, then the stronger hydrogen bond of phenylethylamine (PEA) cation with selected solvents compared to dissociated FA cation facilitates 2D&#8211;3D transformation from (PEA)2PbI4 to FAPbI3. It is&#160;discovered that, the energy barrier of PEA out&#8208;diffusion and the lateral transition barrier of inorganic slab are diminished. For 2D films the protic solvents catalyze grain centers (GCs) and grain boundaries (GBs) transforme into 3D phases and quasi&#8208;2D phases, respectively. While in the solvent&#8208;free case, GCs transform into 3D&#8211;2D heterostructures along the direction perpendicular to the substrate, and most GBs evolve into 3D phases. Finally, memristor devices fabricated using the transformed films uncover that, GBs composed of 3D phases are more prone to ion migration. This work elucidates the fundamental mechanism of structural transformation in metal halide perovskites, allowing their use to fabricate complex heterostructures.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution, Highly Transparent, and Efficient Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of electrostatic force&#8208;induced deposition (EF&#8208;ID) is proposed by introducing alternating polyethyleneimine and fluorosilane patterns to synergistically improve the quantum dot (QD) pattern pixel accuracy, boost device transmittance, and reduce the device leakage current, which enables high resolution ranging from 1104 to 3031 PPI and a high efficiency of 15.6%, as well as highly transparent quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with a high transmittance of 90.7%, indicating an effective approach for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs with high efficiency and transparency.








Abstract
Aiming at next&#8208;generation displays, high&#8208;resolution quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with high efficiency and transparency are highly desired. However, there is limited study involving the improvements of QLED pixel resolution, efficiency, and transparency simultaneously, which undoubtedly restricts the practical applications of QLED for next&#8208;generation displays. Here, the strategy of electrostatic force&#8208;induced deposition (EF&#8208;ID) is proposed by introducing alternating polyethyleneimine (PEI) and fluorosilane patterns to synergistically improve the pixel accuracy and transmittance of QD patterns. More importantly, the leakage current induced by the void spaces between pixels that is usually reported for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs is greatly suppressed by substrate&#8208;assisted insulating fluorosilane patterns. Finally, high&#8208;performance QLEDs with high resolution ranging from 1104 to 3031 pixels per inch (PPI) and a high efficiency of 15.6% are achieved, among the best performances of high resolution QLEDs. Notably, the high resolution QD pixels greatly enhance the transmittance of the QD patterns, thus prompting an impressive transmittance of 90.7% for the transparent QLEDs (2116 PPI), which represents the highest transmittance of transparent QLED devices. Consequently, this work contributes an effective and general approach for high&#8208;resolution QLEDs with high efficiency and transparency.

         <title>Modulating The D&#8208;Band Center Enables Ultrafine Pt3Fe Alloy Nanoparticles for Ph&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

Abstract
By providing dual active sites to synergistically accelerate the H2O dissociation and H+ reduction, ordered intermetallic alloys usually show extraordinary performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres&#8208;supported intermetallic Pt3Fe alloys (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A) as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER is reported. The Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A exhibits low overpotential (&#951;10) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, 1.0&#160;M KOH, and 1.0&#160;M phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5d&#8722;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the d&#8208;band center of Pt 5d orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co&#8208;adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A to dissociate the H2O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* intermediates adsorption and H2 formation in alkaline and neutral conditions. The synthetic strategy is further extended to the synthesis of Pt3Co and Pt3Ni alloys with excellent HER activity in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes, demonstrating the great potential of these Pt&#8208;based alloys for practical applications.

Abstract
Soft robots are composed of compliant materials that facilitate high degrees of freedom, shape&#8208;change adaptability, and safer interaction with humans. An attractive choice of material for soft robotics is crosslinked networks of liquid crystal polymers (LCNs), as they are responsive to a wide variety of external stimuli and capable of undergoing fast, programmable, complex shape morphing, which allows for their use in a wide range soft robotic applications. However, unlike hydrogels, another popular material in soft robotics, LCNs have limited applicability in flooded or aquatic environments. This can be attributed not only to the poor efficiency of common LCN actuation methods underwater but also to the complicated relationship between LCNs and water. In this review, we elaborate on the relationship between water and LCNs and survey the existing body of literature where LCNs, both hygroscopic and non&#8208;hygroscopic, are utilized in aquatic soft robotic applications. We then discuss the challenges LCNs face in widespread adaptation to aquatic soft robotic applications and, finally, envisage possible paths forward for their successful use in aquatic environments.

         <title>Indirect Electrocatalysis S&#8208;N/S&#8208;S Bond Construction by Robust Polyoxometalate Based Foams</title>

Abstract
Indirect electrocatalytic conversion of cheap organic raw materials via the activation of S&#8208;H and N&#8208;H bonds into the value&#8208;added S&#8208;N/S&#8208;S bonds chemicals for industrial rubber production is a promising strategy to realize the atomic economic reaction, during which the kinetic inhibition that is associated with the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in traditional direct electrocatalysis can be eliminated to achieve higher performance. Here, for the first time, a series of di&#8208;copper substituted phosphotungstate based foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) have been fabricated with tunable loadings (17 to 44 wt%) that can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides. Specifically, the optimal PW10Cu2@CMC (44 wt%) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the construction of S&#8208;N/S&#8208;S bonds (yields up to 99%) coupling with the efficient production of H2 (&#8764;50&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (&#8764;14.4&#160;g in a batch&#8208;experiment) and the obtained products can serve as rubber vulcanization accelerators with superior properties to traditional industrial rubber additives in real industrial processes. This powerful catalysis system that can simultaneously produce rubber vulcanization accelerator and H2 might inaugurate a new electrocatalytic avenue to explore polyoxometalate&#8208;based foam catalysts in electrocatalysis field.

         <title>A Computationally Assisted Approach for Designing Wearable Biosensors toward Non&#8208;Invasive Personalized Molecular Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated computational framework named QuantumDock is developed for universal molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) development toward a variety of wearable biosensing applications. QuantumDock employs molecular docking and density functional theory to probe the molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules, optimizing the selectivity of the MIP biosensor for the wearable analysis of a wide range of biomarkers. (e.g., phenylalanine).








Abstract
Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine as they can non&#8208;invasively collect molecular information closely associated with an individual's health status. However, the majority of clinically relevant biomarkers cannot be continuously detected in situ using existing wearable approaches. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here, QuantumDock is introduced, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/cross&#8208;linker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, experimental validation of QuantumDock is performed successfully using solution&#8208;synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, a QuantumDock&#8208;optimized graphene&#8208;based wearable device is designed that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. For the first time, wearable non&#8208;invasive phenylalanine monitoring is demonstrated in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.

         <title>Large Anomalous Nernst Effects at Room Temperature in Fe3Pt Thin films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the discovery of a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt, which also shows a remarkable coercive field of about 1300&#160;Oe. The results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE without an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Heat current in ferromagnets can generate a transverse electric voltage perpendicular to magnetization, known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). ANE originates intrinsically from the combination of large Berry curvature and density of states near the Fermi energy. It shows technical advantages over the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect in converting waste heat to electricity due to its unique transverse geometry. However, materials showing giant ANE remain to be explored. Herein,&#160;&#160;a large ANE thermopower of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt epitaxial films is reported, which also show a giant transverse thermoelectric conductivity of &#945;yx &#8776; 4 A K&#8722;1&#160;m&#8722;1 and a remarkable coercive field of 1300&#160;Oe. The theoretical analysis reveals that the strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction in addition to the hybridization between Pt 5d and Fe 3d electrons leads to a series of distinct energy gaps and large Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone, which is the key for the large ANE. These results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE at zero magnetic field, providing pathways to explore materials with giant transverse thermoelectric effect without an external magnetic field.

         <title>Ion Tunnel Matrix Initiated Oriented Attachment for Highly Utilized Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of &#8220;trapping&#8208;then&#8208;planting&#8221; oriented&#8208;attached deposition is demonstrated toward high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;metal anode battery. Stable zinc plating/stripping for 6600 cycles (1320 h) at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% with a rigorous 100% ZUR (zinc utilization ratio) protocol are realized. Moreover, an anode&#8208;limited pouch cell with a low N/P of 1.2 that displays an energy density of 214&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is constructed; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Metallic zinc is an ideal anode for aqueous energy storage; however, Zn anodes suffer from nonhomogeneous deposition, low reversibility, and dendrite formation; these lead to an overprovision of zinc metal in full cells. Herein, oriented&#8208;attachment&#8208;regulated Zn stacking initiated through a trapping&#8208;then&#8208;planting process with a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is reported. Due to the isometric topology features of cubic&#8208;type Prussian blue analog (PBA), the initial Zn plating occurs at specific sites with equal spacing of &#8776;5&#160;&#197; in the direction perpendicular to the substrate; the trace amount of zinc ions trapped in tunnel matrix provides nuclei for the oriented attachment of Zn (002) deposits. As a result, the PBA&#8208;decorated substrate delivers high reversibility of dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping for more than 6600 cycles (1320&#160;h) and achieves an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 100% ZUR. Moreover, the anode&#8208;limited full cell with a low negative&#8211;positive electrode ratio (N/P) of 1.2 can be operated stably for 360 cycles, displaying an energy density of 214&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries. This work provides a proof of concept design of metal anodes with a high utilization ratio and a practical method for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

This work provides a proof of concept design of metal anodes with a high utilization ratio and a practical method for developing high-energy-density batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Ultrathin Black Phosphorus Nanodisks Hybridized with Fe3O4 Nanoclusters and Iron (V)&#8208;Oxo Complex for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>

Ultrathin black phosphorus nanodisks hybridized with Fe3O4 nanoclusters and iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex are rationally synthesized, and shown to exhibit ultrahigh stability in humid air, and competitive electrochemical potassium storage properties benefiting from unique structural and compositional merits.








Abstract
The practical&#160;application of metalloid black phosphorus (BP) based anodes for potassium ion batteries is mainly impeded by its instability in air and irreversible/sluggish potassium storage behaviors. Herein, a 2D composite is purposefully conceptualized, where ultrathin BP nanodisks with Fe3O4 nanoclusters are hybridized with Lewis acid iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex (FC) nanosheets (denoted as BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC). The introduced electron coordinate bridge between FC and BP, and hydrophobic surface of FC synergistically assure that BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC is ultrastable in humid air. With the purposeful structural and componential design, the resultant BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC anode is endowed with appealing electrochemical performance in terms of reversible capacity, rate behavior, and long&#8208;duration cycling stability in both half and full cells. Furthermore, the underlying formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms of BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC are tentatively proposed. The in&#8208;depth insights here will provide a crucial understanding in rational exploration of advanced anodes for next&#8208;generation PIBs.

         <title>Synergistic Modification of 2D Perovskite with Alternating Cations in the Interlayer Space and Multisite Ligand toward High&#8208;Performance Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic modulation strategy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) and multisite ligand 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MTD) is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;quality methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite films. The significantly inhibited nonradiative recombination enables the realization of high&#8208;efficiency inverted devices with a fascinating power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.58%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for inverted devices.








Abstract
The preparation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films is key to realize efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells. The trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination at grain boundary (GB) and surface poses a serious challenge for fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Here, a synergistic modulation strategy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite with alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) and multisite ligand 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (MTD) for fabricating high&#8208;quality methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite films is reported. The formation of ACI 2D perovskite promotes the nucleation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites, suppresses the generation of yellow phase, and promotes the formation of black phase, leading to increased grain size and crystallinity. Due to the synergistic effect of ACI 2D perovskite and MTD, the defects at GBs and surface are healed simultaneously. The significantly inhibited nonradiative recombination enables realization of high&#8208;efficiency inverted devices with a fascinating power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.58%, which is one of the highest PCEs reported for inverted devices. The synergistically modified unsealed device demonstrates an excellent long&#8208;term ambient stability, retaining 90.5% of its initial PCE after 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 30&#8211;40%. This work provides deep insights into minimizing nonradiative recombination losses through the rational synergistic engineering of GB and surface toward efficient and stable inverted devices.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Mechanical Bilayer Metamaterial with Global Area&#8208;Preserving Density Tunability for Acoustic Wave Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented 2D metamaterial consists of two layers that are actuated separately by a remotely applied magnetic field. This novel bilayer design strategy enables the adjustment of the area density while simultaneously preserving the overall dimensions. These designs can be further exploited in acoustic applications, including highly tunable bandgaps and waveguides.








Abstract
2D metamaterials have immense potential in acoustics, optics, and electromagnetic applications due to their unique properties and ability to conform to curved substrates. Active metamaterials have attracted significant research attention because of their on&#8208;demand tunable properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. 2D active metamaterials often achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which lead to changes in overall dimensions. This demands corresponding alterations of the conforming substrate, or the metamaterial fails to provide complete area coverage, which can be a significant limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area&#8208;preserving active 2D metamaterials with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent challenge. In this paper, magneto&#8208;mechanical bilayer metamaterials are presented that demonstrate area density tunability with area&#8208;preserving capability. The bilayer metamaterials consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials with distinct magnetization distributions. Under a magnetic field, each layer behaves differently, which allows the metamaterial to reconfigure its shape into multiple modes and to significantly tune its area density without changing its overall dimensions. The area&#8208;preserving multimodal shape reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new concept for the design of area&#8208;preserving active metamaterials for broader applications.

         <title>Implantable, Biodegradable, and Wireless Triboelectric Devices for Cancer Therapy Through Disrupting Microtubule and Actins Dynamics</title>

Abstract
Electric field&#8208;based stimulation is emerging as a new cancer therapeutic modality through interfering with cell mitosis. To address its limitations of complicated wire connections, bulky devices, and coarse spatial resolution, we propose an improved and alternative method for wirelessly delivering electrical stimulation into tumor tissues through designing an implantable, biodegradable and wirelessly controlled therapeutic triboelectric nanogenerator (ET&#8208;TENG). With the excitation of ultrasound (US) to the ET&#8208;TENG, the implanted ET&#8208;TENG can generate an alternating current voltage and concurrently release the loaded anti&#8208;mitotic drugs into tumor tissues, which synergistically disrupts the assembly of microtubules and filament actins, induces cell cycle arrest, and finally enhances cell death. With the assistance of US, the device can be completely degraded after the therapy, getting free of a secondary surgical extraction. The device can not only work around those unresectable tumors, but also provides a new application of wireless electric field in cancer therapy.

         <title>Rationally Designing High&#8208;Performance Versatile Organic Memristors Through Molecule&#8208;Mediated Ion Movements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic memory have attracted tremendous attention for next&#8208;generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; strikingly ease of structural design. However, due to their hardly controllable and low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecule with specific coordination groups&#8208;regulating ions have been rarely reported. In this work, as a generalized rational design strategy, w e introduced the well&#8208;known Tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) with multiple coordination groups and small plane structure into stable polymers framework to modulate the Ag migration and then achieved the high performance devices with ideal productivity, low operation voltage and power, stable switching cycles and state retention. Raman mapping demonstrated that the migrated Ag can specially coordinate with the embedded TCNQ molecules. Notably, w e can modulate the TCNQ molecule distribution inside the polymer framework and regulate the memristive behaviors through controlling the formed Ag conductive filaments (CFs) as demonstrated by the Raman mapping, in&#8208;situ C&#8208;AFM, XRD and depth&#8208;profiling XPS. Thus the controllable molecule&#8208;mediated Ag movements show its potential in rationally designing high performance devices and versatile functions and is enlightening in constructing memristors with molecule&#8208;mediated ion movements.

         <title>4D Visualization of a Nonthermal Coherent Magnon in the Laser Heated Lattice by an X&#8208;ray Free Electron Laser</title>

Abstract
Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic phenomena is an exciting achievement of mankind, expanding one's horizon of knowledge towards the functional nonequilibrium states. The dynamics acting on an extremely short timescale pushes the detection limits that reveal fascinating light&#8208;matter interactions for nonthermal creation of effective magnetic fields. While some cases are benchmarked by emergent transient behaviors, otherwise identifying the nonthermal effects remains challenging. Here, we introduce femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment using an X&#8208;ray free electron laser to distinguish between the effective field and the photoinduced thermal effect. We observe that a multiferroic Y&#8208;type hexaferrite exhibits magnetic Bragg peak intensity oscillations manifesting entangled antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Fourier components of a coherent antiferromagnetic magnon. The magnon trajectory constructed in three&#8208;dimensional space and time domains is decisive to evince ultrafast field formation preceding the lattice thermalization. We directly unravel a remarkable impact of photoexcitation across the electronic band gap, amplifying the photomagnetic coupling that is one of the highest among antiferromagnetic dielectrics. Leveraging the above&#8208;band&#8208;gap photoexcitation, this energy&#8208;efficient optical process further suggests a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Modulation with Covalent Organic Framework Enables Efficient And Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dual&#8208;interface modulation including buried interface as well as the top surface has recently been proven to be crucial for obtaining high photovoltaic performance in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time, we report the strategy of using functional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely HS&#8208;COFs, for dual&#8208;interface modulation, and further understand its intrinsic mechanisms in optimizing the bottom and top surfaces. Specifically, the buried HS&#8208;COFs layer can enhance the resistance against ultraviolet radiation, and more importantly, release the tensile strain, which is beneficial for enhancing device stability and improving the order of perovskite crystal growth. Furthermore, the detailed characterization results reveal that the HS&#8208;COFs on the top surface can effectively passivate the surface defects and suppress non&#8208;radiation recombination, as well as optimize the crystallization and growth of the perovskite film. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the dual&#8208;interface modified device delivers a champion efficiency of 24.26% and 21.30% for 0.0725 cm2 and 1 cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively. Moreover, it retains 88% and 84% of their initial efficiency after aging for 2000 hours under the ambient conditions (25&#176;C, relative humidity: 35&#8208;45%) and a nitrogen atmosphere with heating at 65&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>In Situ Activation of Snap&#8208;Through Instability in Multi&#8208;Response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contact&#8208;induced topological transformation is leveraged to introduce a highly versatile multistable metamaterial capable of switching its mechanical response post fabrication. The authors demonstrate how the in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of snap&#8208;through instability enable to generate non&#8208;volatile mechanical logic operations and to reprogram energy dissipation.








Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post&#8208;fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on&#8208;the&#8208;fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Sticky Artificial Spider Silk for Signal Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuron&#8208;inspired sticky artificial spider silk is prepared based on proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fibers, which exhibits excellent mechanical robustness and ionic conductivity. It provides a new design strategy for signal transmission and regulation applications in bioelectrodes and artificial synapse.








Abstract
Neurons exhibit excellent signal transmission capacity, which inspire artificial neuron materials for applications in the field of wearable electronics and soft robotics. In addition, the neuron fibers exhibit good mechanical robustness by sticking to the organs, which currently has rarely been studied. Here, a sticky artificial spider silk is developed by employing a proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fiber for application as artificial neuron fibers. Tuning the molecular electrostatic interactions by modulating the sequences of proton donors and acceptors, enables combination of excellent mechanical properties, stickiness, and ion conductivity. In addition, the PrDA hydrogel exhibits high spinning capacity for a wide range of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations. The PrDA artificial spider silk would shed light on the design of new generation of artificial neuron materials, bio&#8208;electrodes, and artificial synapses.

Numerous well&#8208;designed nanosystems have emerged that incorporate presupposed cascade amplification processes and can be activated by exogenous ultrasound stimulation or ultrasound&#8208;actuated specific substances to trigger chemotherapy, chemodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, ferroptosis, and other therapeutic modalities, with the aim of maximizing antitumor efficacy and minimizing detrimental effects.








Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered cascade amplification of nanotherapies has attracted considerable attention as an effective strategy for cancer treatment. With the remarkable advances in materials chemistry and nanotechnology, a large number of well&#8208;designed nanosystems have emerged that incorporate presupposed cascade amplification processes and can be activated to trigger therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ferroptosis, under exogenous US stimulation or specific substances generated by US actuation, to maximize antitumor efficacy and minimize detrimental effects. Therefore, summarizing the corresponding nanotherapies and applications based on US&#8208;triggered cascade amplification is essential. This review comprehensively summarizes and highlights the recent advances in the design of intelligent modalities, consisting of unique components, distinctive properties, and specific cascade processes. These ingenious strategies confer unparalleled potential to nanotherapies based on ultrasound&#8208;triggered cascade amplification and provide superior controllability, thus overcoming the unmet requirements of precision medicine and personalized treatment. Finally, the challenges and prospects of this emerging strategy are discussed and it is expected to encourage more innovative ideas and promote their further development.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Programmed Rewritable Lattice&#8208;Mediated Multistate Memory for High&#8208;Density Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;time programmable non&#8208;volatile memory is realized by utilizing light programming on a ReS2 device. The device exhibits more than 128 extremely stable states with linearly increasing conductance and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability. This device represents a significant contribution to memory technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter&#8208;free color image recorder applications.








Abstract
Mainstream non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) devices based on floating gate structures or phase&#8208;change/ferroelectric materials face inherent limitations that compromise their suitability for long&#8208;term data storage. To address this challenge, a novel memory device based on light&#8208;programmed lattice engineering of thin rhenium disulfide&#160;(ReS2 ) flakes is proposed. By inducing sulfur vacancies in the ReS2 channel through light illumination, the device's electrical conductivity is modified accordingly and multiple conductance states for data storage therefore are generated. The device exhibits more than 128 distinct states with linearly increasing conductance, corresponding to a sevenfold increase in storage density. Through further optimization to achieve atomic&#8208;level precision in defect creation, it is possible to achieve even higher storage densities. These states are extremely stable in vacuum or inert ambient showing long retention of &gt;10 years, while they can be erased upon exposure to the air. The ReS2 memory device can maintain its stability over multiple program&#8208;erase operation cycles and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability for incident light in the range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm.

&lt;p&gt;A multi-time programmable non-volatile memory is realized by utilizing light programming on a ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; device. The device exhibits more than 128 extremely stable states with linearly increasing conductance and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability. This device represents a significant contribution to memory technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter-free color image recorder applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream non-volatile memory (NVM) devices based on floating gate structures or phase-change/ferroelectric materials face inherent limitations that compromise their suitability for long-term data storage. To address this challenge, a novel memory device based on light-programmed lattice engineering of thin rhenium disulfide&#160;(ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ) flakes is proposed. By inducing sulfur vacancies in the ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel through light illumination, the device's electrical conductivity is modified accordingly and multiple conductance states for data storage therefore are generated. The device exhibits more than 128 distinct states with linearly increasing conductance, corresponding to a sevenfold increase in storage density. Through further optimization to achieve atomic-level precision in defect creation, it is possible to achieve even higher storage densities. These states are extremely stable in vacuum or inert ambient showing long retention of &amp;gt;10 years, while they can be erased upon exposure to the air. The ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; memory device can maintain its stability over multiple program-erase operation cycles and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability for incident light in the range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm. This device represents a significant contribution to NVM technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter-free color image recorder applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Thermoelectric Microdevices for 4D Thermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device is developed for direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale. The paradigm of a 3D&#8208;printed thermocouple micro&#8208;network provides new advantages to access microscopic thermodynamics without dimensional limit. In this study, microscale 4D temperature fields generated by Joule&#8208;heating or evaporative cooling are directly observed.








Abstract
Thermometry, the process of measuring temperature, is one of the most fundamental tasks not only for understanding the thermodynamics of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes but also for thermal management of microelectronics. However, it is a challenge to acquire microscale temperature fields in both space and time. Here, a 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device that enables direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale is reported. The device is composed of freestanding thermocouple probe networks, fabricated by bi&#8208;metal 3D printing with an outstanding spatial resolution of a few &#181;m. It shows that the developed 4D thermometry can explore dynamics of Joule heating or evaporative cooling on microscale subjects of interest such as a microelectrode or a water meniscus. The utilization of 3D printing further opens up the possibility to freely realize a wide range of on&#8208;chip, freestanding microsensors or microelectronic devices without the design restrictions by manufacturing processes.

         <title>Imitating Architectural Mortise&#8208;Tenon Structure for Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 material with implanted architectural mortise&#8208;tenon (MT) structures is developed. These MT structures not only improve the mechanochemical stability by suppressing the intrinsic anisotropic volume change but also provide an expressway for fast Li&#8208;ion transport. This layered LiNi0.8C0.1Mn0.1O2 exhibits a capacity retention of 82% over 1200 cycles (1C) and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are the most promising cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries, but chemo&#8208;mechanical failures during cycling and large first&#8208;cycle capacity loss hinder their applications in high&#8208;energy batteries. Herein, by introducing spinel&#8208;like mortise&#8208;tenon structures into the layered phase of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811), the adverse volume variations in cathode materials can be significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, these mortise&#8208;tenon structures play the role of the expressway for fast lithium&#8208;ion transport, which is substantiated by experiments and calculations. Moreover, the particles with mortise&#8208;tenon structures usually terminate with the most stable (003) facet. The new cathode exhibits a discharge capacity of 215&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%, and capacity retention of 82.2% after 1200 cycles at 1&#160;C. This work offers a viable lattice engineering to address the stability and low initial Coulombic efficiency of the Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides, and facilitates the implementation of Li&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;energy density and long durability.

         <title>Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Efficiency over Linear Assemblies of Copper&#8208;Cobalt Nanophases Stabilized by Redox Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical redox&#8208;driven linear assembly of sub&#8208;5&#160;nm CuCo nanocrystals, coupled with a specifically designed protective redox polymer, is first reported for designing an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid catalyst with enzyme&#8208;like properties, which enables enhanced nitrate (NO3&#8722;) adsorption and tandem catalysis of NO3&#8722; to ammonia (NH3) with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;97% at low overpotentials, leading to a record&#8208;high half&#8208;cell energy efficiency of &#8776;42.0%.








Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a net&#8208;zero carbon route to the realization of high ammonia (NH3) productivity. However, this route suffers from low energy efficiency (EE, with a half&#8208;cell EE commonly &lt;36%), since high overpotentials are required to overcome the weak NO3&#8722; binding affinity and sluggish NO3RR kinetics. To alleviate this, a rational catalyst design strategy that involves the linear assembly of sub&#8208;5&#160;nm Cu/Co nanophases into sub&#8208;20&#160;nm thick nanoribbons is suggested. The theoretical and experimental studies show that the Cu&#8208;Co nanoribbons, similar to enzymes, enable strong NO3&#8722; adsorption and rapid tandem catalysis of NO3&#8722; to NH3, owing to their richly exposed binary phase boundaries and adjacent Cu&#8208;Co sites at sub&#8208;5&#160;nm distance. In situ Raman spectroscopy further reveals that at low applied overpotentials, the Cu/Co nanophases are rapidly activated and subsequently stabilized by a specifically designed redox polymer that in situ scavenges intermediately formed highly oxidative nitrogen dioxide (NO2). As a result, a stable NO3RR with a current density of &#8776;450&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved, a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;97% for the formation of NH3, and an unprecedented half&#8208;cell EE of &#8776;42%.

         <title>Bifunctional Single Atom Catalysts for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries: From Dynamic Mechanism to Rational Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms, the rational regulations for various single atom catalysts (SACs) to improve their bifunctional activity and stability, and the challenges and future perspectives of bifunctional SACs for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;air batteries are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Ever&#8208;growing demands for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) call for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Among various electrocatalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to the merits of high atom utilization, structural tunability, and remarkable activity. Rational design of bifunctional SACs relies heavily on an in&#8208;depth understanding of reaction mechanisms, especially dynamic evolution under electrochemical conditions. This requires a systematic study in dynamic mechanisms to replace current trial and error modes. Herein, fundamental understanding of dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms for SACs is first presented combining in situ and/or operando characterizations and theoretical calculations. By highlighting structure&#8211;performance relationships, rational regulation strategies are particularly proposed to facilitate the design of efficient bifunctional SACs. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This review provides a thorough understanding of dynamic mechanisms and regulation strategies for bifunctional SACs, which are expected to pave the avenue for exploring optimum single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts and effective ZABs.

         <title>Organic Electroactive Materials for Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous batteries coupled with highly designable organic electrode materials have received extensive attention owing to the requirements of sustainable development. This review aims to provide the recent progress in organic electroactive materials for aqueous redox flow batteries and a general guideline to design those aqueous organic redox flow batteries by deciphering the relationship between properties and structures of organic electroactive materials.








Abstract
Organic electroactive materials take advantage of potentially sustainable production and structural tunability compared to present commercial inorganic materials. Unfortunately, traditional redox flow batteries based on toxic redox&#8208;active metal ions have certain deficiencies in resource utilization and environmental protection. In comparison, organic electroactive materials in aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) have received extensive attention in recent years for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage systems due to their inherent safety. This review aims to provide the recent progress in organic electroactive materials for ARFBs. The main reaction types of organic electroactive materials are classified in ARFBs to provide an overview of how to regulate their solubility, potential, stability, and viscosity. Then, the organic anolyte and catholyte in ARFBs are summarized according to the types of quinones, viologens, nitroxide radicals, hydroquinones, etc, and how to increase the solubility by designing various functional groups is emphasized. The research advances are presented next in the characterization of organic electroactive materials for ARFBs. Future efforts are finally suggested to focus on building neutral ARFBs, designing advanced electroactive materials through molecular engineering, and resolving problems of commercial applications.

         <title>Discrete Mononuclear Platinum(II) Complexes Realize High&#8208;Performance Red Phosphorescent OLEDs with EQEs of up to 31.8% and Superb Device Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
Robust red emission phosphor Pt(II) complexes with rigid molecular configuration, short&#8208;excited lifetimes and high PLQYs enable high&#8208;performance red OLEDs with EQEmax over 30% and T90@1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8208;2 over 14000&#160;h.









Abstract
Designing mononuclear platinum(II) complexes that do not rely on intermolecular aggregation for high&#8208;performance red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes remains a formidable challenge. In this work, three robust red&#8208;emitting Pt(II) complexes are&#160;created by utilizing a rigid 4&#8208;coordination configuration, where the ligands are&#160;formed by linking electron&#8208;donor of triphenylamine (TPA) moieties with electron&#8208;acceptor of pyridine, isoquinoline, and/or &#948;&#8208;carboline units. The thermal stability, electrochemical, and photophysical properties of the complexes are&#160;thoroughly examined. The complexes display efficient red phosphorescence, with high photoluminescence quantum yields and short excited lifetimes. The OLEDs dope with these complexes exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 31.8% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off even at high brightness. Significantly, the devices demonstrate exceptional long operational lifetime, with a T90 lifetime of over 14000&#160;h at initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, indicating the potential for these complexes to be practically utilizes.

         <title>Exogenous Antigen Upregulation Empowers Antibody Targeted Nanochemotherapy of Leukemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acute myeloid leukemia remains largely incurable due to the lack of suitable surface antigens and targeted therapeutics. This study presents a facile combination strategy of exogenous antigen upregulation with daratumumab antibody&#8208;directed polymersomal nanotherapeutics (DPV) that allows super&#8208;targeting and high&#8208;efficacy elimination of leukemia cells, leading to striking survival benefits with 20&#8211;40% complete cure.








Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is afflicted by a high&#8208;mortality rate and few treatment options. The lack of specific surface antigens severely hampers the development of targeted therapeutics and cell therapy. Here, it is shown that exogenous all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) mediates selective and transient CD38 upregulation on leukemia cells by up to 20&#8208;fold, which enables high&#8208;efficiency targeted nanochemotherapy of leukemia with daratumumab antibody&#8208;directed polymersomal vincristine sulfate (DPV). Strikingly, treatment of two CD38&#8208;low expressing AML orthotopic models with ATRA and DPV portfolio strategies effectively eliminates circulating leukemia cells and leukemia invasion into bone marrow and organs, leading to exceptional survival benefits with 20&#8211;40% of mice becoming leukemia&#8208;free. The combination of exogenous CD38 upregulation and antibody&#8208;directed nanotherapeutics provides a unique and powerful targeted therapy for leukemia.

         <title>Tuning the Organ Tropism of Polymersome for Spleen&#8208;Selective Nanovaccine Delivery to Boost Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed polymersome library reveals specific organ selectivity to the liver and spleen. With the advanced tailoring of splenic immune responses, spleen targeting nanovaccine can effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
The past few decades have witnessed explosive development in drug delivery systems. However, in vivo delivery suffers from non&#8208;specific distribution in non&#8208;targeted organs or tissues, which may cause undesired side effects and even genotoxicity. Here, a general strategy that enables tuning the tropism of polymersomes for liver&#8208; and spleen&#8208;selective delivery is reported. By using a library screening approach, spleen&#8208;targeted polymersome PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 and liver&#8208;targeted polymersome PA9&#8208;ZP3&#8208;5050 are identified accordingly. Meanwhile, the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging allows for in vivo dynamic evaluation of their spatial and temporal accumulation in specific tissues. O ur findings indicate that both polymer composition and protein corona on the surface are essential to determine the in vivo fate of polymersomes and tendency for specific organs. Importantly, PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 is employed as a systemic nanocarrier to co&#8208;deliver the antigen and adjuvant, which remarkably boost splenic immune responses in acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and melanoma lung metastasis mouse models. This study may open a new frontier for polymersomes in organ&#8208;selective delivery and other biomedical applications.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with an External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs are demonstrated with simultaneously reduced electron leakage and high outcoupling efficiency by regulating charge carrier transport and the near&#8208;field light field. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art green PeLED achieves a world record external quantum efficiency of 30.84% at a luminance of 6514&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. The PeLED also maintains an EQE value over 20% under high brightness conditions from &#8776;100 &#8201;to 32&#160;000&#8201;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are strong candidates for next&#8208;generation display and lighting technologies due to their high color purity and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. However, PeLEDs are not superior to commercial organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) in efficiency, as some key parameters affecting their efficiency, such as the charge carrier transport and light outcoupling efficiency, are usually overlooked and not well optimized. Here, ultrahigh&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs are reported with quantum efficiencies surpassing a milestone of 30% by regulating the charge carrier transport and near&#8208;field light distribution to reduce electron leakage and achieve a high light outcoupling efficiency of 41.82%. Ni0.9Mg0.1Ox films are applied with a high refractive index and increased hole carrier mobility as the hole injection layer to balance the charge carrier injection and insert the polyethylene glycol layer between the hole transport layer and the perovskite emissive layer to block the electron leakage and reduce the photon loss. Therefore, with the modified structure, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art green PeLEDs achieve a world record external quantum efficiency of 30.84% (average&#160;=&#160;&#8201;29.05&#160;&#177;&#160;0.77%) at a luminance of 6514&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This study provides an interesting idea to construct super high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs by balancing the electron&#8208;hole recombination and enhancing the light outcoupling.

         <title>Aging Property of Halide Solid Electrolyte at the Cathode Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) are anticipated as high&#8208;voltage cathode compatible SEs with their superior oxidation stability. However, the calendar aging of halide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries reveal that halide SEs could be vulnerable to interfacial instability with layered oxide cathodes. This unexpected instability originates from the reduction tendency of metal ions in the SE, where Li3InCl6 with In3+ shows high aging susceptibility.








Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes have recently emerged as a promising option for cathode&#8208;compatible catholytes in solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), owing to their superior oxidation stability at high voltage and their interfacial stability. However, their day&#8208; to month&#8208;scale aging at the cathode interface has remained unexplored until now, while its elucidation is indispensable for practical deployment. Herein, the stability of halide solid electrolytes (e.g., Li3InCl6) when used with conventional layered oxide cathodes during extended calendar aging is investigated. It is found that, contrary to their well&#8208;known oxidation stability, halide solid electrolytes can be vulnerable to reductive side reactions with oxide cathodes (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) in the long term. More importantly, the calendar aging at a low state of charge or as&#8208;fabricated state causes more significant degradation than at a high state of charge, in contrast to typical lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which are more susceptible to high&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;charge calendar aging. This unique characteristic of halide&#8208;based SSBs is related to the reduction propensity of metal ions in halide solid electrolytes and correlated to the formation of an interphase due to the reductive decomposition triggered by the oxide cathode in a lithiated state. This understanding of the long&#8208;term aging properties provides new guidelines for the development of cathode&#8208;compatible halide solid electrolytes.

         <title>Simple and Versatile Platforms for Manipulating Light with Matter: Strong Light&#8211;Matter Coupling in Fully Solution&#8208;Processed Optical Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully solution&#8208;processed microcavities are demonstrated that allow realizing strong light&#8211;matter coupling with an organic semiconductor, all enabled by a versatile molecular hybrid material that permits the fabrication of dielectric mirrors with high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index contrast between constituting layers.








Abstract
Planar microcavities with strong light&#8211;matter coupling, monolithically processed fully from solution, consisting of two polymer&#8208;based distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) comprising alternating layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index titanium oxide hydrate/poly(vinyl alcohol) hybrid material and a low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index fluorinated polymer are presented. The DBRs enclose a perylene diimide derivative (b&#8208;PDI&#8208;1) film positioned at the antinode of the optical mode. Strong light&#8211;matter coupling is achieved in these structures at the target excitation of the b&#8208;PDI&#8208;1. Indeed, the energy&#8208;dispersion relation (energy vs in&#8208;plane wavevector or output angle) in reflectance and the group delay of transmitted light in the microcavities show a clear anti&#8208;crossing&#8212;an energy gap between two distinct exciton&#8208;polariton dispersion branches. The agreement between classical electrodynamic simulations of the microcavity response and the experimental data demonstrates that the entire microcavity stack can be controllably produced as designed. Promisingly, the refractive index of the inorganic/organic hybrid layers used in the microcavity DBRs can be precisely manipulated between values of 1.50 to 2.10. Hence, microcavities with a wide spectral range of optical modes might be designed and produced with straightforward coating methodologies, enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the energy and lifetime of the microcavities&#8216; optical modes to harness strong light&#8211;matter coupling in a wide variety of solution processable active materials.

         <title>In Situ Anchoring Ultrafine ZnS Nanodots on 2D MXene Nanosheets for Accelerating Polysulfide Redox and Regulating Li Plating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine ZnS nanodots grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by a low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal method with abundant active site can not only act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of lithium polysulfides and mitigate the shutting effect, but also as a regulator for enabling uniform Li plating/stripping to inhibit the growth of Li dendrite.








Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery is a promising energy storage system due to its cost effectiveness and high energy density. However, formation of Li dendrites from Li metal anode and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) from S cathode impede its practical application. Herein, ultrafine ZnS nanodots are uniformly grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by a low&#8208;temperature (60 &#176;C) hydrothermal method for the first time. Distinctively, the ZnS nanodot&#8208;decorated MXene nanosheets (ZnS/MXene) can be easily filtered to be a flexible and freestanding film in several minutes. The ZnS/MXene film can be used as a current collector for Li&#8208;metal anode to promote uniform Li deposition due to the superior lithiophilicity of ZnS nanodots. ZnS/MXene powders obtained by freeze drying can be used as separator decorator to address the shuttle effect of LiPSs due to their excellent adsorbability. Theoretical calculation proves that the existence of ZnS nanodots on MXene can obviously improve the adsorption ability of ZnS/MXene with Li+ and LiPSs. Li&#8722;S full cells with composite Li&#8208;metal anode and modified separator exhibit remarkable rate and cycling performance. Other transition metal sulfides (CdS, CuS, etc.) can be also grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by the low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal strategy.

         <title>The Construction of a Microbial Synthesis System for Rare Earth Enrichment and Material Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomanufacturing of high&#8208;purity rare earth (RE) materials is achieved by establishing a microbial synthesis system. RE bioproducts can be extracellularly collected from RE tailings by microbial in situ synthesis. A series of RE&#8208;biosorbent columns with high affinity are developed by immobilizing specifically designed proteins with an agarose matrix. Moreover, the lanthanide&#8208;immobilized methanol dehydrogenase is biofabricated for high&#8208;value utilization of RE.








Abstract
Rare earth materials play an irreplaceable role in biomedical and high technology fields. However, typical mining and extraction approaches to rare earth elements (REEs) often lead to severe environmental problems and resource wastage due to the involvement of hazardous chemicals. Although biomining shows elegant alternatives, there are still grand challenges to sustainably isolate and recover REEs in nature because of insufficient metal&#8208;extracting microbes and RE&#8208;scavenging macromolecular tools. To obtain high&#8208;performance rare earth materials directly from rare earth ore, a new generation of biological synthesis strategies needs to be developed for the efficient preparation of REEs. The microbial synthesis system established here has achieved active biomanufacturing of high&#8208;purity rare earth products. Further, through employing robust affinity columns bioconjugated with structurally engineered proteins, outstanding separation of Eu/Lu and Dy/La is acquired with the purity of 99.9% (Eu), 97.1% (La), and 92.7% (Dy). More importantly, in situ one&#8208;pot synthesis of lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase is well harnessed and exclusively adsorbs La, Ce, Pr, and Nd in RE tailing for advanced biocatalysis, indicating high value&#8208;added application. Therefore, this novel biosynthetic platform provides an insightful roadmap to expand the scope of chassis engineering in terms of biofoundry and to manufacture valuable bioproducts related to REEs.

         <title>High Toughness Combined with High Strength in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;templated electrospinning strategy is proposed for the formation of oxide ceramic nanofibers, which exhibit high strength and high toughness simultaneously owing to their ideally homogeneous, dense, and defect&#8208;free structure.








Abstract
Traditional oxide ceramics are inherently brittle and highly sensitive to defects, making them vulnerable to failure under external stress. As such, endowing these materials with high strength and high toughness simultaneously is crucial to improve their performance in most safety&#8208;critical applications. Fibrillation of the ceramic materials and further refinement of the fiber diameter, as realized by electrospinning, are expected to achieve the transformation from brittleness to flexibility owing to the structural uniqueness. Currently, the synthesis of electrospun oxide ceramic nanofibers must rely on an organic polymer template to regulate the spinnability of the inorganic sol, whose thermal decomposition during ceramization will inevitably lead to pore defects, and seriously weaken the mechanical properties of the final nanofibers. Here, a self&#8208;templated electrospinning strategy is proposed for the formation of oxide ceramic nanofibers without adding any organic polymer template. An example is given to show that individual silica nanofibers have an ideally homogeneous, dense, and defect&#8208;free structure, with tensile strength as high as 1.41&#160;GPa and toughness up to 34.29&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, both of which are far superior to the counterparts prepared by polymer&#8208;templated electrospinning.

     alt="High Toughness Combined with High Strength in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-templated electrospinning strategy is proposed for the formation of oxide ceramic nanofibers, which exhibit high strength and high toughness simultaneously owing to their ideally homogeneous, dense, and defect-free structure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional oxide ceramics are inherently brittle and highly sensitive to defects, making them vulnerable to failure under external stress. As such, endowing these materials with high strength and high toughness simultaneously is crucial to improve their performance in most safety-critical applications. Fibrillation of the ceramic materials and further refinement of the fiber diameter, as realized by electrospinning, are expected to achieve the transformation from brittleness to flexibility owing to the structural uniqueness. Currently, the synthesis of electrospun oxide ceramic nanofibers must rely on an organic polymer template to regulate the spinnability of the inorganic sol, whose thermal decomposition during ceramization will inevitably lead to pore defects, and seriously weaken the mechanical properties of the final nanofibers. Here, a self-templated electrospinning strategy is proposed for the formation of oxide ceramic nanofibers without adding any organic polymer template. An example is given to show that individual silica nanofibers have an ideally homogeneous, dense, and defect-free structure, with tensile strength as high as 1.41&#160;GPa and toughness up to 34.29&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, both of which are far superior to the counterparts prepared by polymer-templated electrospinning. This work provides a new strategy to develop oxide ceramic materials that are strong and tough.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evidence for Anisotropic Superconductivity Beyond Pauli Limit in Infinite&#8208;Layer Lanthanum Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that the superconductivity is intrinsically anisotropic in lanthanum nickelates with enhanced crystalline quality and superconductivity by systematic magnetotransport measurements. Therefore, the quasi&#8208;2D hole bands from Ni may be dominant in formation of Cooper pairs and a cuprate&#8208;like picture may be still valid in describing the superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates.








Abstract
After being expected to be a promising analog to cuprates for decades, superconductivity has recently been discovered in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates, providing new opportunities to explore mechanisms of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity. However, in sharp contrast to the single&#8208;band and anisotropic superconductivity in cuprates, nickelates exhibit a multi&#8208;band electronic structure and an unexpected isotropic superconductivity as reported recently, which challenges the cuprate&#8208;like picture in nickelates. Here, it is shown that strong anisotropic magnetotransport behaviors exist in La&#8208;based nickelate films with enhanced crystallinity and superconductivity (Tconset$T_{\rm{c}}^{{\rm{onset}}}$ = 18.8 K, Tczero$T_{\rm{c}}^{{\rm{zero}}}$ = 16.5 K). The upper critical fields are anisotropic and violate the estimated Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) Pauli limit (HPauli,&#956;=1&#956;B=1.86&#215;Tc,H=0${H}_{\mathrm{Pauli},\mu =1{\mu}_{B}}=1.86\ensuremath{\times{}}{T}_{\mathrm{c},H=0}$) for in&#8208;plane magnetic fields. Moreover, the anisotropic superconductivity is further manifested by the cusp&#8208;like peak of the angle&#8208;dependent Tc and the vortex motion anisotropy under external magnetic fields.

         <title>3d imprinting of Voxel&#8208;Level Structural Colors in Lithium Niobate Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced coloration method is of pivotal importance in science, technology, and engineering. However, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structural colors that are critical for emerging multi&#8208;dimensional information representation and recording are rarely achievable. Here, we&#160;report on a facile voxel&#8208;level programmable 3D structural coloration in the bulk lithium niobate (LiNbO3) crystal. This is achieved by engineering wavelength&#8208;selective interference between ordinary (O) and extraordinary (E) light in the crystal matrix. To induce effective phase contrast between O and E light for establishing the highly localized interference across the visible band, we&#160;revealed the presence of a pulse&#8208;internal&#8208;coupling effect in the single&#8208;pulse ultrafast laser&#8208;crystal interaction and thus developed an ultrafast laser&#8208;induced micro&#8208;amorphization (MA) strategy to manipulate local matrix structure. Consequently, micro&#8208;nano&#8208;scale colorful voxels can be fast inscribed into any spatial position of the crystal matrix in one step. We&#160;demonstrated that the colors can be flexibly manipulated and fast extracted in 3D space. Multi&#8208;dimensional MA&#8208;color data storage with large capacity, high writing and readout speed, long lifetime, and excellent stability under harsh conditions was&#160;achieved. The present principle enables multifunctional 3D structural coloration devices inside high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index transparent dielectrics and can serve as a general platform to innovate next&#8208;generation information optics.

         <title>Title Extreme Polarization Anisotropy in Resonant Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation from Aligned Carbon Nanotube Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal, and optical properties owing to their one&#8208;dimensional character. While their linear optical properties have been extensively studied, nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation for frequency conversion, remain largely unexplored in CNTs, particularly in macroscopic CNT assemblies. In this work, w e synthesized macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) CNTs and studied polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) from the films with fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5&#160;&#956;m. Both films exhibited strongly wavelength&#8208;dependent, intense THG signals, enhanced through exciton resonances, and w e found third&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 2.50 &#215; 10&#8722;19 m2/V2 (semiconducting CNTs) and 1.23 &#215; 10&#8722;19 m2/V2 (metallic CNTs), respectively, for 1.8&#160;&#956;m excitation. Further, through systematic polarization&#8208;dependent THG measurements, w e determined the values of all elements of the susceptibility tensor, verifying the macroscopically one&#8208;dimensional nature of the films. Finally, w e performed polarized THG imaging to demonstrate the nonlinear anisotropy in the large&#8208;size CNT film with good alignment. These findings promise applications of aligned CNT films in mid&#8208;infrared frequency conversion, nonlinear optical switching, polarized pulsed lasers, polarized long&#8208;wave detection, and high&#8208;performance anisotropic nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Trivalent Europium Doped CsCl Quantum Dots for MA&#8208;free Perovskite Solar Cells with Inherent Bandgap through Lattice Strain Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium (Cs&#8208;FA) perovskites have garnered widespread interest owing to their excellent thermal&#8208; and photostability in achieving stable formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, Cs&#8208;FA perovskite typically suffers from Cs+ and FA+ mismatches, affecting the Cs&#8208;FA morphology and lattice distortion, resulting in an enlarged bandgap (Eg). To address these issues, we developed &#8220;upgraded&#8221; CsCl&#8212;Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots (QDs) for FAPbI3 PSCs to solve the key issues in Cs&#8208;FA PSCs and also exploit the advantage of Cs&#8208;FA PSCs on stability. The introduction of Eu3+ promoted the formation of high&#8208;quality Cs&#8208;FA films by adjusting the Pb&#8208;I cluster structure. CsCl:Eu3+ also offsets the local strain and lattice contraction induced by Cs+, which maintains the inherent Eg of FAPbI3 and decreases the trap density. Finally, we obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.10&#160;mA/cm2, which are among the highest in methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free PSCs. The unencapsulated devices showed excellent humidity and storage stability owing to the relieved lattice strain and ligand protection. We achieved an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination of 1.5 G and bias voltage conditions, demonstrating excellent operational stability. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8208;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA&#8208;free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.

         <title>Achieving All Plateau and High Capacity Sodium Insertion in Topological Graphitized Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hard carbon anodes with all&#8208;plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high energy density sodium ion storages, which are holding promises for the future sustainable energy technologies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard carbon anodes with all-plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high energy density sodium ion storages, which are holding promises for the future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions heading off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, we reported a highly cross-linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two-step rapid thermal annealing strategy. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long-range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multi-directional insertions of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at high voltage region. Evidences from advanced technique including &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; XRD, &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; Raman and &lt;i&gt;in-situ/ex-situ&lt;/i&gt; TEM indicate that the sodium ions appear Na cluster formation between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low-voltage plateau capacity of 290 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow via Phosphorescence F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving multicolor organic afterglow materials with narrowband emission and high color purity is important in various optoelectronic fields but remains a great challenge. Here, we&#160;present an efficient strategy to obtain narrowband organic afterglow materials via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donors to narrowband fluorescence acceptors in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The resulting materials exhibit narrowband emission with full width at half maximum (FWHM) as small as 23&#160;nm and the longest lifetime of 721.22&#160;ms. Meanwhile, by pairing the appropriate donors and acceptors, multicolor and high color purity afterglow ranging from green to red with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67.1% are achieved. Moreover, given their long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and flexibility, we&#160;demonstrate the potential applications in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and dynamic and quick information identification in low&#8208;light conditions. This work provides a facile approach for developing multicolor and narrowband afterglow materials as well as expands the features of organic afterglow.

         <title>Overcoming Charge Confinement in Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The small nanoparticle size and long&#8208;chain ligands in colloidal metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) cause charge confinement, which impedes exciton dissociation and carrier extraction in PeQD solar cells, so they have low short&#8208;circuit current density Jsc, which impedes further increases in their power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we develop a re&#8208;assembling process (RP) for perovskite nanocrystalline (PeNC) films made of PeQDs to increase Jsc in PeQD solar cells. RP of PeNC films increases their crystallite size and eliminates long&#8208;chain ligands, and thereby overcomes the charge confinement in PeNC films. These changes facilitate exciton dissociation and increase carrier extraction in PeQD solar cells. By use of this method, the gradient bandgap PeQD solar cells achieve a Jsc = 19.30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising the photo&#8208;voltage, and yielded high PCE = 16.46% with negligible hysteresis and good stability. This work provides a new strategy to process PeNC films and pave a way for high performance PeQD optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation of Poly(vinyl Chloride) into Non&#8208;Toxic Water&#8208;Soluble Products via Sequential Dechlorination, Heterolytic Oxirane Ring&#8208;Opening, and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As one of the most widely used commodity plastics, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is extensively used worldwide, yet is difficult to recycle and is often discarded immediately after use. Its end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment often generates toxic hydrogen chloride and dioxins that pose a critical threat to ecosystems. To address this challenge, we herein present the first mechanochemical degradation of PVC into water&#8208;soluble biocompatible products. Oxirane mechanophores are strategically introduced into the polymeric backbone via sequential dechlorination followed by epoxidation. The oxirane mechanophore in the polymer backbone undergoes a force&#8208;induced heterolytic ring&#8208;opening to carbonyl ylide intermediates, which eventually generates acetals during the course of the reaction. The subsequent hydrolysis of the backbone acetals affords the scission of the polymeric chain into water&#8208;soluble low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fragments. Combined with its low cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity, this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical degradation process offers a green alternative for the degradation of PVC.

         <title>Protonated Organic Semiconductors: Origin of Water&#8208;Induced Charge Trap Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite dramatic improvements in the electronic characteristics of organic semiconductors, the low operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors hinders their direct use in practical applications. Although the literature contains numerous reports on the effects of water on the operational stability of organic field effect transistors, the underlying mechanisms of trap generation induced by water remain unclear. Here, we&#160;propose a protonation&#8208;induced trap generation of organic semiconductors as a possible origin of the operational instability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. Spectroscopic and electronic investigation techniques combined with simulations revealed that the direct protonation of organic semiconductors by water during operation might&#160;be responsible for the trap generation induced by bias stress; this phenomenon is independent of the trap generation at an insulator surface. In addition, the same feature occurred in small&#8208;band&#8208;gap polymers with fused thiophene rings irrespective of their crystalline ordering, implying the generality of protonation induced trap generation in various polymer semiconductors with a small band&#8208;gap. Our&#160;finding of the trap generation process provides new perspectives for achieving greater operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight into the Oxygen Redox of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes and their Related Electronic/Atomic Behaviors Upon Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;rich layered cathodes exhibit anionic redox, which increases their capacity. This specific characteristic originates from their unique honeycomb&#8208;type superstructure leading to the Li&#8211;O&#8211;Li configuration, which produces O 2p NB states. Although there are contradictions in the literature, different strategies have been attempted to suppress cation migration and oxygen release to ensure reversible oxygen redox and solve the practical issues.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathodes are extensively investigated as their energy density is superior to Li stoichiometric cathode materials. In addition to the transition metal redox, this intriguing electrochemical performance originates from the redox reaction of the anionic sublattice. This new redox process, the so&#8208;called anionic redox or, more directly, oxygen redox in the case of oxides, almost doubles the energy density of Li&#8208;rich cathodes compared to conventional cathodes. Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have thoroughly established the current understanding of the oxygen redox of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. However, different reports are occasionally contradictory, indicating that current knowledge remains incomplete. Moreover, several practical issues still hinder the real&#8208;world application of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. As these issues are related to phenomena resulting from the electronic to atomic evolution induced by unstable oxygen redox, a fundamental multiscale understanding is essential for solving the problem. In this review, the current mechanistic understanding of oxygen redox, the origin of the practical problems, and how current studies tackle the issues are summarized.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective method by using the multifunctional additive cadmium acetate (CdAc2) to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films for efficient flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). The resulting FPSCs and TSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.78% and 29.25% (under AM 1.5G illumination), respectively.








Abstract
Polycrystalline perovskite films fabricated on flexible and textured substrates often are highly defective, leading to poor performance of perovskite devices. Finding substrate&#8208;tolerant perovskite fabrication strategies is therefore paramount. Herein, this study shows that adding a small amount of Cadmium Acetate (CdAc2) in the PbI2 precursor solution results in nano&#8208;hole array films and improves the diffusion of organic salts in PbI2 and promotes favorable crystal orientation and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. Polycrystalline perovskite films on the flexible substrate with ultra&#8208;long carrier lifetimes exceeding 6&#160;&#181;s are achieved. Eventually, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.78% is obtained for single&#8208;junction flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). Furthermore, it is found that the strategy is also applicable for textured tandem solar cells. A champion PCE of 29.25% (0.5003&#160;cm2) is demonstrated for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) with CdAc2. Moreover, the un&#8208;encapsulated TSCs maintains 109.78% of its initial efficiency after 300&#160;h operational at 45&#160;&#176;C in a&#160; nitrogen atmosphere. This study provides a facile strategy for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>Strong Tough Thermogalvanic Hydrogel Thermocell With Extraordinarily High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable polyvinyl alcohol thermogalvanic thermocell (SPTC) is prepared by combining stretching&#8208;induced crystallization and thermoelectric effects. The SPTC provides the best comprehensive mechanical and thermoelectric properties among reported quasi&#8208;solid stretchable thermogalvanic hydrogel thermocells. The SPTC&#8208;based systems are demonstrated in energy&#8208;autonomous strain sensors and health monitoring. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device can provide a reference for the design of flexible and robust wearable electronics.








Abstract
Thermocells can continuously convert heat into electricity, and they are widely used to power wearable electronic devices. However, they have a risk of leakage and poor mechanical properties. Although quasi&#8208;solid ionic thermocells can overcome the issue of electrolyte leakage, the trade&#8208;off between their excellent mechanical properties and high thermopower remains a major challenge. In this study, stretching&#8208;induced crystallization and the thermoelectric effect are combined to propose a high&#8208;strength quasi&#8208;solid stretchable polyvinyl alcohol thermogalvanic thermocell (SPTC) with a large tensile strength of 19&#160;MPa and high thermopower of 6.5&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1. The SPTC exhibits a high stretchability of 1300%, ultrahigh toughness of 163.4&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and high specific output power density of 1969&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2. These comprehensive properties are superior to those of previously reported quasi&#8208;solid stretchable thermogalvanic thermocells. The use of SPTC&#8208;based systems in wearable devices for energy&#8208;autonomous strain sensors and health monitoring is demonstrated. This can facilitate the rapid implementation of sustainable wearable electronics in the Internet of Things era.

         <title>Reactive Deposition Versus Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA): A Key to Highly Active Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts in Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive attachment based on hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid is shown to lead directly to single atom configuration with a significantly higher specific H2 evolution activity than achieved with strong electrostatic adsorption &#8211; and this is at a significantly lower Pt loading without any post&#8208;deposition treatment.








Abstract
In recent years, the use of single atoms (SAs) has become of a rapidly increasing significance in photocatalytic H2 generation; here SA&#160;noble metals (mainly Pt SAs) can act as highly effective co&#8208;catalysts. The classic strategy to decorate oxide semiconductor surfaces with maximally dispersed SAs relies on &#8220;strong electrostatic adsorption&#8221; (SEA) of suitable noble metal complexes. In the case of TiO2 &#8211; the classic benchmark photocatalyst &#8211; SEA calls for adsorption of cationic Pt complexes such as [(NH3)4Pt]2+ which then are thermally reacted to surface&#8208;bound SAs. While SEA is widely used in literature, in the present work it is shown by a direct comparison that reactive attachment based on the reductive anchoring of SAs, e.g., from hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid (H2PtCl6)&#160;leads directly to SAs in a configuration with a significantly higher specific activity than SAs deposited with SEA &#8211; and this at a significantly lower Pt loading and without any thermal post&#8208;deposition treatments. Overall, the work demonstrates that the reactive deposition strategy is superior to the classic SEA concept as it provides a direct electronically well&#8208;connected SA&#8208;anchoring and thus leads to highly active single&#8208;atom sites in photocatalysis.

         <title>Bi&#8208;Chiral Nanostructures Featuring Dynamic Optical Rotatory Dispersion for Polychromatic Light Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;chiral liquid crystalline nanostructure is proposed by customizing the transverse and longitudinal configuration of opposite&#8208;handed cholesteric liquid crystals. Thanks to the reflective version of the common optical rotatory dispersion, the spin&#8208;decoupled geometric phase modulation, and their multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness, the dynamic color&#8208;tunable holography is realized desirably. This extremely extends the construction of soft chiral nanostructures and enlightens polychromatic light multiplexing.








Abstract
Chiral nanostructures featuring the unique optical activity have attracted broad interests from scientists. The typical polarization rotation of transmitted light is usually wavelength dependent, namely the optical rotatory dispersion. However, its dynamic tunability and intriguing collaboration with other optical degrees of freedom, especially the highly desired spatial phase, remain elusive. Herein, a bi&#8208;chiral liquid crystalline nanostructure is proposed to induce an effect called reflective optical rotatory dispersion. Thanks to the independent manipulation of opposite&#8208;handed self&#8208;assembled helices, spin&#8208;decoupled geometric phases are induced simultaneously. These naturally unite multi&#8208;dimensions of light and versatile stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of soft matter. Dynamic holography driven by heat and electric field is demonstrated with a fast response. For polychromatic light, the hybrid multiplexed holographic painting is exhibited with fruitful tunable colors. This study extends the ingenious construction of soft chiral superstructures, presents an open&#8208;ended strategy for on&#8208;demand light control, and enlightens advanced applications of display, optical computing, and communication.

         <title>Metallic Powder Promotes Nitridation Kinetics for Facile Synthesis of (Oxy)Nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metallic (oxy)nitrides can be synthesized with reduced nitridation temperature and a shortened nitridation period due to the enhanced nitridation kinetics, benefiting from the nitridation assistance of metallic powder with low work function.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing semiconductors (including metal nitrides, metal oxynitrides, and nitrogen&#8208;doped metal oxides) have been widely researched for their application in energy conversion and environmental purification because of their unique characteristics; however, their synthesis generally encounters significant challenges owing to sluggish nitridation kinetics. Herein, a metallic&#8208;powder&#8208;assisted nitridation method is developed that effectively promotes the kinetics of nitrogen insertion into oxide precursors and exhibits good generality. By employing metallic powders with low work functions as electronic modulators, a series of oxynitrides (i.e., LnTaON2 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd), Zr2ON2, and LaTiO2N) can be prepared at lower nitridation temperatures and shorter nitridation periods to obtain comparable or even lower defect concentrations compared to those of the conventional thermal nitridation method, leading to superior photocatalytic performance. Moreover, some novel nitrogen&#8208;doped oxides (i.e., SrTiO3&#8722;xNy and Y2Zr2O7&#8722;xNy) with visible&#8208;light responses can be exploited. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the nitridation kinetics are enhanced via the effective electron transfer from the metallic powder to the oxide precursors, reducing the activation energy of nitrogen insertion. The modified nitridation route developed in this work&#160;is an alternative method for preparing (oxy)nitride&#8208;based materials for energy/environment&#8208;related heterogeneous catalysis.

&lt;/i&gt;) with visible-light responses can be exploited. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the nitridation kinetics are enhanced via the effective electron transfer from the metallic powder to the oxide precursors, reducing the activation energy of nitrogen insertion. The modified nitridation route developed in this work&#160;is an alternative method for preparing (oxy)nitride-based materials for energy/environment-related heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Solar Cells with Over 19% Efficiency Enabled by a 2D&#8208;Conjugated Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor Featuring Favorable Electronic and Aggregation Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;expansion of phenazine&#8208;fused core on AQx&#8208;18 affords a 2D&#8208;congjugated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor with favorable electronic and aggregation structures. AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based devices exhibit a PCE of 19.1%, which is among the highest value ever reported for organic solar cells (OSCs) with a high Voc of 0.928&#160;V. Such a 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy is promising for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;expansion of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors is a promising method for boosting the organic photovoltaic performance by allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and molecular packing. In this work, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated using a 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy to design new non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Compared with the quinoxaline&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;16, the &#960;&#8208;expanded phenazine&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;18 induce more ordered and compact packing between adjacent molecules, affording an optimized morphology with rational phase separation in the blend film. This facilitates efficient exciton dissociation and inhibited charge recombination. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with simultaneously increasing Voc, Jsc, and fill factor is achieved in the AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based binary OSCs. Significantly, AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based ternary devices fabricated via a two&#8208;in&#8208;one alloy acceptor strategy exhibit a superior PCE of 19.1%, one of the highest values ever reported for OSCs, along with a high Voc of 0.928&#160;V. These results indicate the importance of the 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy for the delicate regulation of the electronic structures and crystalline behaviors of the non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to achieve superior photovoltaic performance, aimed at significantly promoting further development of OSCs.

         <title>Rational Design and Acoustic Assembly of Human Cerebral Cortex&#8208;Like Microtissues from hiPSC&#8208;Derived Neural Progenitors and Neurons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic assembly technique is employed to generate human&#8211;sourced brain&#8208;like cortical tissue models by reverse engineering and bionic design, including the six&#8208;layered neuronal architecture, 400&#8208;&#181;m interlayer distance, synaptic connections between interlayers, and neuroelectrophysiological transmission. Furthermore, these microtissues with herpes simplex virus type I&#160;infection show pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease, including the expression of A&#946;, neuronal loss, and dysfunctional synaptic connections.









Abstract
Development of biologically relevant and clinically relevant human cerebral cortex models is demanded by mechanistic studies of human cerebral cortex&#8208;associated neurological diseases and discovery of preclinical neurological drug candidates. Here, rational design of human&#8211;sourced brain&#8208;like cortical tissue models is demonstrated by reverse engineering and bionic design. To implement this design, the acoustic assembly technique is employed to assemble hiPSC&#8208;derived neural progenitors and neurons separately in a label&#8208;free and contact&#8208;free manner followed by subsequent neural differentiation and culture. The generated microtissues encapsulate the neuronal microanatomy of human cerebral&#8208;cortex tissue that contains six&#8208;layered neuronal architecture, a 400&#8208;&#181;m interlayer distance, synaptic connections between interlayers, and neuroelectrophysiological transmission. Furthermore, these microtissues are infected with herpes simplex virus type I (HSV&#8208;1)&#160;virus, and the HSV&#8208;induced pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease is determined, including neuron loss and the expression of A&#946;. Overall, a high&#8208;fidelity human&#8208;relevant in vitro histotypic model is provided for the&#160;cerebral cortex, which will facilitate wide applications in probing the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and screening the candidates for neuroprotective agents.

         <title>Intense Pulsed Light Thermal Treatment of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3/Metglas Heterostructured Films Resulting in Extreme Magnetoelectric Coupling of over 20&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;Oe&#8722;1</title>

         <dc:description>
The fabrication of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3/Metglas magnetoelectric (ME) film heterostructures with an ultrahigh ME coupling by employing the synergetic approach of combining aerosol deposition and instantaneous thermal treatment based on intense pulsed light radiation, is reported.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric (ME) film composites consisting of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials are promising candidates for application in magnetic field sensors, energy harvesters, and ME antennas. Conventionally, high&#8208;temperature annealing is required to crystallize piezoelectric films, restricting the use of heat&#8208;sensitive magnetostrictive substrates that enhance ME coupling. Herein, a synergetic approach is demonstrated for fabricating ME film composites that combines aerosol deposition and instantaneous thermal treatment based on intense pulsed light (IPL) radiation to form piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thick films on an amorphous Metglas substrate. IPL rapidly anneals PZT films within a few milliseconds without damaging the underlying Metglas. To optimize the IPL irradiation conditions, the temperature distribution inside the PZT/Metglas film is determined using transient photothermal computational simulation. The PZT/Metglas films are annealed using different IPL pulse durations to determine the structure&#8211;property relationship. IPL treatment results in an enhanced crystallinity of the PZT, thus improving the dielectric, piezoelectric, and ME properties of the composite films. An ultrahigh off&#8208;resonance ME coupling (&#8776;20&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;Oe&#8722;1) is obtained for the PZT/Metglas film that is IPL annealed at a pulse width of 0.75&#160;ms (an order of magnitude higher than that reported for other ME films), confirming the potential for next&#8208;generation, miniaturized, and high&#8208;performance ME devices.

         <title>Multifunctionality through Embedding Patterned Nanostructures in High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable spray coating is introduced for controlled deposition of nanomaterials with tailorable patterns. Guided by the droplet's internal currents, amphiphilicity of the nanomaterials grants control over the specific surface area and bonding energy values. Controlling the ring&#8208;disk pattern transition regulates theinterfaces, crack containment, and electrical&#8208;thermal conductivity, which is lacking in conventional manufacturing with the random inclusion of nanoparticles.








Abstract
Despite being a pillar of high&#8208;performance materials in industry, manufacturing carbon fiber composites with simultaneously enhanced multifunctionality and structural properties has remained elusive due to the lack of practical bottom&#8208;up approaches with control over nanoscale interactions. Guided by the droplet's internal currents and amphiphilicity of&#160;nanomaterials, herein, a programmable spray coating is introduced for the deposition of multiple nanomaterials with tailorable patterns in composite.&#160;&#160;It is shown that such patterns regulate&#160;the formation of interfaces, damage containment, and electrical&#8208;thermal conductivity of the composites, which is absent in conventional manufacturing that primarily rely on incorporating nanomaterials to achieve specific functionalities. Molecular dynamics simulations show that increasing the hydrophilicity of the hybrid nanomaterials, which is synchronous with shifting patterns from disk to ring, improves the interactions between the carbon surfaces and epoxy at the interfaces,manifested in enhanced&#160;interlaminar and flexural performance. Transitioning from ring to disk creates a larger interconnected network &#160;leading to improved thermal and electrical properties without penalty in&#160;mechanical properties. This novel approach introduces a new design , where the mechanical and multifunctional performance is controlled by the shape of the deposited patterns, thus&#160;eliminating the trade&#8208;off between properties that are considered paradoxical in today's manufacturing of hierarchical composites.

         <title>Langmuir&#8722;Blodgett&#8208;mediated Formation of Antibacterial Microneedles for Long&#8208;Term Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>

Abstract
Microneedles (MNs) have become versatile platforms for minimally invasive transdermal drug delivery devices. However, there are concerns about MN&#8208;induced skin infections with long&#8208;term transdermal administration. Using the Langmuir&#8722;Blodgett (LB) technique, we&#160;develop a simple method for depositing antibacterial nanoparticles of various shapes, sizes, and compositions onto MNs. This strategy has merits over conventional dip coating techniques, including controlled coating layers, uniform and high coverage, and a straightforward fabrication process. This provides MNs with a fast&#8208;acting and long&#8208;lasting antibacterial effect. Our&#160;study demonstrates that antibacterial MNs achieve superior bacterial elimination in vitro and in vivo without sacrificing payload capacity, drug release, or mechanical strength. We&#160;believe that such functional nanoparticle coating technique offers a platform for the expansion of MNs function, especially in long&#8208;term transdermal drug delivery fields.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles&#8208;Derived Hybrid Nanoplatforms for Amplified CD47 Blockade&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Immunomodulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) into tumor&#8208;inhibiting M1&#8208;like phenotype is a promising but challenging strategy. Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re&#8208;education of TAMs into &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we report that hybrid nanovehicles (hEL&#8208;RS17) derived from extracellular vesicles of M1 macrophages and decorated with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, can actively target tumor cells and remodel TAM phenotypes. Consequently, more M1&#8208;like TAMs infiltrate into tumor tissue to phagocytize more tumor cells due to CD47 blockade. By further co&#8208;encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent shikonin, photosensitizer IR820 and immunomodulator polymetformin in hEL&#8208;RS17, an enhanced antitumor effect is obtained due to the combinational treatment modality and close synergy among each component. Upon laser irradiation, the designed SPI@hEL&#8208;RS17 nanoparticles exert potent antitumor efficacy against both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, which not only suppresses primary tumor growth, but also inhibits lung metastasis and prevents tumor recurrence, exhibiting great potential in boosting CD47 blockade&#8208;based antitumor immunotherapy.

Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re-education of TAMs into &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47-SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Regulating The Lithium Ions&#8217; Local Coordination Environment Through Designing Cof with Single Atomic Co Site to Achieve Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The detrimental lithium dendrites growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) inhibit the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we explore atomically dispersed cobalt coordinate conjugated bipyridine&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (sp2c&#8208;COF) as an artificial SEI on the surface of Li metal anode to resolve these issues. The single Co atoms confined in the structure of COF enhance the number of active sites and promote electron transfer to COF. The Co&#8208;N coordination and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group synergistic effects can maximum adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li nucleation behavior. Furthermore, the in&#8208;situ technology and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co inducing Li uniform deposition and promoting Li+ rapid migration. Based on these advantages, the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co modified Li anode exhibits a low Li nucleation barrier of 8&#160;mV, and excellent cycling stability of 6000&#160;h.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Adaptable Polyimide Hybrid Dielectric Films with Superior Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyimides (PIs) used in advanced electrical and electronic devices can be electrically/mechanically damaged, resulting in a significant waste of resources. Closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling may prolong the service life of synthetic polymers. However, the design of dynamic covalent bonds for preparing chemically recyclable crosslinked PIs remains a challenging task. Herein, new crosslinked PI films containing a PI oligomer, chain extender, and crosslinker are reported. They exhibit superior recyclability and excellent self&#8208;healable ability owing to the synergistic effect of the chain extender and crosslinker. The produced films can be completely depolymerized in an acidic solution at ambient temperature, leading to efficient monomer recovery. The recovered monomers may be used to remanufacture crosslinked PIs without deteriorating their original performance. In particular, the designed films can serve as corona&#8208;resistant films with a recovery rate of approximately 100%. Furthermore, carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs) with PI matrices are suitable for harsh environments and can be recycled multiple times at a non&#8208;destructive recycling rate up to 100%. The preparation of high&#8208;strength dynamic covalent adaptable PI hybrid films from simple PI oligomers, chain extenders, and crosslinkers may provide a solid basis for sustainable development in the electrical and electronic fields.

         <title>Application of Conductive MOF in Zinc&#8208;based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The use of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) in zinc&#8208;based batteries has been a popular research direction. Zinc&#8208;based batteries are widely used with the advantages of high specific capacity and safety and stability, but they also face many problems. c&#8208;MOFs have excellent conductivity compared with other primitive MOFs, and therefore have better applications in zinc&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, we discuss the transfer mechanisms of the unique charges of c&#8208;MOFs: hop transport and band transport respectively, and further address the way of electron transport. Then, it is introduced that c&#8208;MOFs can be prepared in various ways, among which solvothermal, interfacial synthesis and post&#8208;processing methods are widely used. In addition, the applications of c&#8208;MOFs are discussed in terms of their role and performance in different types of zinc&#8208;based batteries. Finally, the current problems of c&#8208;MOFs and the prospects for their future development are presented.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8764; 4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) were prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kilohertz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 megavolts per centimeter, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

         <title>Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Carbon Dots for Solvent&#8208;free Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the major advances of nanolights with extensive exploration of nano&#8208;luminescent materials like carbon dots (CDs). However, solvent&#8208;free processing of these materials remains a formidable challenge, impeding endeavors to develop advanced manufacturing techniques. Herein, in response to this challenge, liquid crystallization is demonstrated as a versatile and robust approach by deliberately anchoring flexible alkyl chains on the CDs surface. Alkyl chain grafting on the CDs surface is observed to substantially depress the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, and results in a shift of self&#8208;assembly structure from the crystalline phase to smectic liquid crystalline phase. The liquid crystalline phase transition temperature is ready to adjust by varying the alkyl chain length, endowing low temperature (&lt; 50&#160;&#176;C) melt&#8208;processing capabilities. Consequently, the first case of direct ink writing (DIW) with liquid crystal (LC) carbon dots is demonstrated, giving rise to highly emissive objects with blue, green and red color fluorescence, respectively. Another unexpected finding is that the DIW with LC inks dramatically outperforms the DIW with isotropic inks, further highlighting the significance of LC processing. The reported approach herein not only exhibits a fundamental advance by imparting LC functions to CDs, but also promises technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.

         <title>Combining Pedot:Pss Polymer Coating with Metallic 3d Nanowires Electrodes to Achieve High Electrochemical Performances for Neuronal Interfacing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrophysiology studies facilitate the understanding of mechanisms involved in neuronal networks. Latest advances consist of integrating 3D&#8208;nanostructures to microelectrodes arrays technologies to increase the electrodes surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, which leads to a higher affinity with cells, enables subcellular interactions and high neuronal signal resolution. However, due to their small effective area, such devices suffer from their high interface impedance and limited charge transfer capacity. These performances can be improved by optimizing the properties of the interface material at the nanoscale. Conductive polymer coatings are ideal candidates to overcome these limitations, as they are biocompatible, have the potential to reduce the mechanical mismatch at the electrode/cell interface and possess remarkable electrochemical performances. Here, we&#160;propose to combine metallic 3D nanowires&#8208;based electrodes (NWs), made of platinum silicide, whose design encourage optimal cell engulfment, with the remarkable properties of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) coating. We&#160;demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to deposit with a very high selectivity, ultra&#8208;thin layers of conductive polymer (&lt;50&#160;nm) onto metallic electrodes using electrodeposition. We&#160;first studied the impact of the PEDOT:PSS coating on planar electrodes of diameters down to 5&#160;&#956;m, used for surface scaling investigation, then on high aspect ratio vertical nanostructures. These polymer&#8208;coated electrodes have been fully characterized, both electrochemically and morphologically, in order to establish a direct relationship between the synthesis conditions, the morphology and the conductive features. Results show that PEDOT&#8208;coated electrodes exhibit drastic thickness&#8208;dependent improved stimulation and recording performances, which offers new perspectives for neuronal interfacing with optimal cell engulfment. This should enable the study of neuronal activity with acute spatial and signal resolution at the sub&#8208;cellular level.

         <title>Mechanically&#8208;compliant Bioelectronic Interfaces through Fatigue&#8208;resistant Conducting Polymer Hydrogel Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Because of their distinct electrochemical and mechanical properties, conducting polymer hydrogels have been widely exploited as soft, wet, and conducting coatings for conventional metallic electrodes, providing mechanically compliant interfaces and mitigating foreign body responses. However, the long&#8208;term viability of these hydrogel coatings has been hindered by concerns regarding fatigue crack propagation and/or delamination caused by repetitive volumetric expansion/shrinkage during long&#8208;term electrical interfacing. Here, we report a general yet reliable approach to achieving a fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes by engineering nanocrystalline domains at the interface between the hydrogel and metallic substrates. We demonstrate the efficacy of this robust, biocompatible, and fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating in cardiac pacing, showcasing its ability to effectively reduce the pacing threshold voltage and enhance the long&#8208;term reliability of electric stimulation. Our findings highlight the potential of our approach as a promising design and fabrication strategy for the next generation of seamless bioelectronic&#160;interfaces.

         <title>Exploiting Unique Features of Microneedles to Modulate Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microneedle arrays (MNAs) are small patches containing hundreds of short projections that deliver signals directly to dermal layers without causing pain. These technologies are of special interest for immunotherapy and vaccine delivery because they directly target immune cells concentrated in the skin. The targeting abilities of MNAs result in efficient immune responses&#8212;often more protective or therapeutic&#8212;compared to conventional needle delivery. MNAs also offer logistical benefits, such as self&#8208;administration and transportation without refrigeration. Thus, numerous preclinical and clinical studies are exploring these technologies. Here we discuss the unique advantages of MNA, as well as critical challenges &#8211; such as manufacturing and sterility issues &#8211; the field faces to enable widespread deployment. We explain how MNA design parameters can be exploited for controlled release of vaccines and immunotherapies, and the application to preclinical models of infection, cancer, autoimmunity, and allergies. We also discuss specific strategies to reduce off&#8208;target effects compared to conventional vaccine delivery routes, and novel chemical and manufacturing controls that enable cargo stability in MNAs across flexible intervals and temperatures. We then examine clinical research using MNAs. We conclude with drawbacks of MNAs and the implications, and emerging opportunities to exploit MNAs for immune engineering and clinical use.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Oxides&#8208;Based Memristor: Outstanding Resistive Switching Performances And Mechanisms in Atomic Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The application of high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEO) has attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their unique structural characteristics, such as excellent electrochemical properties and long&#8208;term cycling stability. However, the application of resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) has not been extensively studied, and the switching mechanism of HEO&#8208;based RRAM has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we grew high&#8208;entropy oxide (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)3O4 with a spinel structure on a Nb: STO conductive substrate epitaxially and deposited Pt metal as the top electrode. After the resistive switching operation, some regions of the spinel structure were transformed into a rock&#8208;salt structure and analyzed using advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). From the results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), only specific elements would change their valence state, which results in excellent resistive&#8208;switching properties with a high on/off ratio on the order of 105, outstanding endurance (&gt;4550 cycles), long retention time (&gt;104 s), and high stability, which suggests that HEO is a promising RRAM material.

         <title>Porous, Ultrathin PtAgBiTe Nanosheets for Direct Hydrazine Hydrate Fuel Cell Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their fascinating applications in sustainable and clean&#8208;energy&#8208;related devices, but obtaining ultrathin 2D multimetallic polycrystalline structures with large lateral dimensions remains a challenge. In this study, ultrathin 2D porous PtAgBiTe and PtBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets (PNSs) were obtained via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route. The PtAgBiTe PNSs were assembled by sub&#8208;5&#160;nm grains with widths beyond 700&#160;nm. Strain and ligand effects originating from the porous, curly polycrystalline structure endowed the PtAgBiTe PNSs with robust hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction activity. Theoretical research demonstrated that the modified Pt activated the N&#8208;H bonds in N2H4 during the reaction, and strong hybridization between Pt&#8208;5d and N&#8208;2p facilitated dehydrogenation while reducing energy consumption. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe PNSs in actual hydrazine&#8208;O2/air fuel cell devices were boosted to 532.9/315.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, while those of the commercial Pt/C were 394.7/157.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides a strategy not only for preparing ultrathin multimetallic PNSs but also for finding promising electrocatalysts for actual hydrazine fuel cells.

Theoretical research demonstrated that the modified Pt activated the N-H bonds in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; during the reaction, and strong hybridization between Pt-5d and N-2p facilitated dehydrogenation while reducing energy consumption. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe PNSs in actual hydrazine-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air fuel cell devices were boosted to 532.9/315.9&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while those of the commercial Pt/C were 394.7/157.9&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a strategy not only for preparing ultrathin multimetallic PNSs but also for finding promising electrocatalysts for actual hydrazine fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Eye&#8208;mimicked Neural Network Composed of Photosensitive Neural Spheroids with Human Opsin Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An in vitro model, composed of the short&#8208;wavelength opsins and rhodopsins of human, was created. Two types of photosensitive neural spheroids were transfected for selective reaction under bluish&#8208;purple and green lights. These were employed to two devices with intact neuron and neural&#8208;spheroid to study the interaction. By photostimulation, the photosensitive spheroid initiated photoactivation, and the signal generated from its body was transmitted to adjacent neural networks. Specifically, the signal traveled through the axon bundle in narrow gap from photosensitive spheroid to intact spheroid as an eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain model including optic nerve. The whole process with photosensitive spheroid was monitored by calcium ion detecting fluorescence images. The results of this study can be applied to examine vision restoration and novel photosensitive biological systems with spectral sensitivity.

         <title>3D&#8208;Heterojunction based on Embedded Perovskite Micro&#8208;sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/narrowband Dual&#8208;mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode was implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro&#8208;sized single crystals. Because the single&#8208;crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into the perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and the polymer&#8208;embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radical interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows the photogenerated built&#8208;in electric field in radical direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320&#160;nm to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow&#8208;band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Molecular Dynamics Elucidates the Mechanics of Reinforcement in Graphene&#8208;Based Composites</title>

Abstract
Using very large&#8208;scale classical molecular dynamics we examine the mechanics of nano&#8208;reinforcement of graphene&#8208;based nanocomposites. Our simulations show that significant quantities of large, defect&#8208;free and predominantly flat graphene flakes are required for successful enhancement of materials properties in excellent agreement with experimental and proposed continuum shear&#8208;lag theories. The critical length for enhancement is approximately 500nm and 300nm for graphene and GO respectively. The reduction of Young's modulus in GO results in a much smaller enhancement of the composite's Young's modulus. The simulations reveal that the flakes should be aligned and planar for optimal reinforcement. Undulations substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.

         <title>Amorphous MXene Opens New Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed synthesis methods of amorphous MXene are discussed. The unique structure of amorphous MXenes may possess unexpected properties. The work opens new perspectives on the possibility of MXene amorphization, and their energy conversion, energy storage, and other applications.








Abstract
Recently, novel amorphous nanomaterials formed by introducing atomic irregular arrangement factors have been successfully fabricated, showing superior performance in catalysis, energy storage, and mechanics. Among them, 2D&#160;amorphous nanomaterials are the stars, as they combine the benefits of both 2D structure and amorphous. Up to now, many research studies have been published on the study of 2D amorphous materials. However, as one of the most important parts of 2D materials, the research on MXenes mainly focuses on the crystalline counterpart, while the study of highly disordered forms is much less. This work will provide insight into the possibility of MXenes amorphization, and discusses the application prospect of amorphous MXenes materials.

         <title>A Fully Integrated Miniaturized Optical Biosensor for Fast and Multiplexing Plasmonic Detection of High&#8208; and Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Analytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A miniaturized optical biosensor based on organic optoelectronic and nanoplasmonic components, able to perform fast and multiplex plasmonic detection of analytical targets for milk quality and safety: lactoferrin and streptomycin, is presented. Software&#8208;based data analysis and calibration of the sensor is reported, which shows for lactoferrin a limit of detection of 3.7 &#181;g mL&#8722;1, comparable with a reference benchtop analytical instrument.








Abstract
Optical biosensors based on plasmonic sensing schemes combine high sensitivity and selectivity with label&#8208;free detection. However, the use of bulky optical components is still hampering the possibility of obtaining miniaturized systems required for analysis in real settings. Here, a fully miniaturized optical biosensor prototype based on plasmonic detection is demonstrated, which enables fast and multiplex sensing of analytes with high&#8208; and low molecular weight (80&#8239;000 and 582 Da) as quality and safety parameters for milk: a protein (lactoferrin) and an antibiotic (streptomycin). The optical sensor is based on the smart integration of: i) miniaturized organic optoelectronic devices used as light&#8208;emitting and light&#8208;sensing elements and ii) a functionalized nanostructured plasmonic grating for highly sensitive and specific localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The sensor provides quantitative and linear response reaching a limit of detection of 10&#8722;4 refractive index units once it is calibrated by standard solutions. Analyte&#8208;specific and rapid (15 min long) immunoassay&#8208;based detection is demonstrated for both targets. By using a custom algorithm based on principal&#8208;component analysis, a linear dose&#8211;response curve is constructed which correlates with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 3.7&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 for lactoferrin, thus assessing that the miniaturized optical biosensor is well&#8208;aligned with the chosen reference benchtop SPR method.

         <title>Semiconductor Thermal and Electrical Properties Decoupled by Localized Phonon Resonances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>

The in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of semiconductor membranes is reduced by coupling heat&#8208;carrying phonons with localized phonon resonances in deposited nanopillars. This full&#8208;spectrum resonance&#8208;hybridization mechanism decouples the electrical properties of the membrane from its thermal properties, paving the way for novel thermoelectric materials and device designs. The experimental results are a manifestation of nanophononic metamaterial effects previously shown in molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials convert heat into electricity through thermally driven charge transport in solids or vice versa for cooling. To compete with conventional energy&#8208;conversion technologies, a thermoelectric material must possess the properties of both an electrical conductor and a thermal insulator.&#160;However, these properties are normally mutually exclusive because of the interconnection between scattering mechanisms for charge carriers and phonons. Recent theoretical investigations on sub&#8208;device scales have revealed that nanopillars attached to a membrane exhibit a multitude of local phonon resonances, spanning the full spectrum, that couple with the heat&#8208;carrying phonons in the membrane and cause a reduction in the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, with no expected change in the electrical properties because the nanopillars are outside the pathway of voltage generation and charge transport. Here this effect is demonstrated experimentally for the first time by investigating device&#8208;scale suspended silicon membranes with GaN nanopillars grown on the surface. The nanopillars cause up to 21% reduction in the thermal conductivity while the power factor remains unaffected, thus demonstrating an unprecedented decoupling in the semiconductor's thermoelectric properties.&#160;The measured thermal conductivity behavior for coalesced nanopillars and corresponding lattice&#8208;dynamics calculations provide evidence that the reductions are mechanistically tied to the phonon resonances. This finding paves the way for high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state energy recovery and cooling.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Superspreading&#8208;Boosted High&#8208;Performance Jet&#8208;Flow Boiling for Enhancement of Phase&#8208;Change Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superspreading of organic cooling agents on a designed micro&#8208;/nanostructured Cu surface highly boosts the liquid re&#8208;wetting process, causing a discontinuous solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;vapor contact line and ultralow under&#8208;liquid bubble adhesion. By promoting latent heat exchange based on ultrafast liquid re&#8208;wetting and constant vapor coalescence, a characteristic, enhanced jet&#8208;flow boiling is obtained and optimized, enabling a high&#8208;performance phase&#8208;change cooling for heat management of central processing unit chips.








Abstract
Enhanced boiling heat transfer via surface engineering is a topic of general interest for its great demand in industrial fields. However, as a dynamic interfacial phenomenon, a deep understanding of its process and mechanism, including liquid re&#8208;wetting and vapor departure, is still challenging. Herein, a micro&#8208;/nanostructured Cu surface containing a periodic microgroove/pyramid array with rich nanowrinkles is designed, where superspreading (&lt;134.1&#160;ms) of organic cooling agents highly boosts the liquid re&#8208;wetting process, causing a discontinuous solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;vapor three&#8208;phase contact line and ultralow under&#8208;liquid bubble adhesion force (&#8776;1.3&#160;&#181;N). Therefore, a characteristic, ultrafast jet&#8208;flow boiling (bubbles rapidly ejected in multiple strips) is obtained on this surface, giving a priority to nucleation (superheat &#8776; 1.5&#160;&#176;C) and simultaneously enhancing the critical heat flux and heat&#8208;transfer coefficient by up to 80% and 608%, respectively, compared with a flat surface. In situ observation and analysis of the nucleation, growth, and departure of micro&#8208;sized jet&#8208;flow bubbles reflects that microgrooves/pyramids with nanowrinkles promote the latent heat exchange process by superspreading&#8208;induced ultrafast liquid re&#8208;wetting and constant vapor film coalescing. Based on the designed structures, high&#8208;performance phase&#8208;change cooling for central processing unit heat management in supercomputer centers is accomplished with an ultralow power usage effectiveness (PUE &lt; 1.04).

         <title>Single Quantum Dot Selection and Tailor&#8208;Made Photonic Device Integration using a Nanoscale&#8208;Focus Pinspot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale&#8208;focus pinspot technique reveals a new paradigm for a deterministic integration between quantum emitters and photonic structures. The technique can reduce the luminescent quantum dot density from the high&#8208;density quantum dots (QDs)&#160;without destroying their pristine structures, so that individual QD characterization and tailor&#8208;made photonic structure integration can be done deterministically.








Abstract
Among the diverse platforms of quantum light sources, epitaxially grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the most attractive workhorses for realizing quantum photonic technologies owing to their outstanding brightness and scalability. However, the spatial and spectral randomness of most QDs severely hinders the construction of large&#8208;scale photonic platforms. In this work, a methodology is presented to deterministically integrate single QDs with tailor&#8208;made photonic structures. A nondestructive luminescence picking method termed as nanoscale&#8208;focus pinspot (NFP) is applied using helium&#8208;ion microscopy to reduce the luminous QD density while retaining the surrounding medium. A single QD emission is only extracted out of the high&#8208;density ensemble QDs. Then the tailor&#8208;made photonic structure of a circular Bragg reflector (CBR) is designed and deterministically integrated with the selected QD. Given that the microscopy can image with nanoscale resolution and apply NFP in situ, photonic devices can be deterministically fabricated on target QDs. The extraction efficiency of the NFP&#8208;selected QD emission is improved by 25 times after the CBR integration. Since the NFP method only controls the luminescence without destroying the medium, it is applicable to various photonic structures such as photonic waveguides or photonic crystal cavities regardless of materials.

         <title>Giant Nonlinear Optical Response via Coherent Stacking of&#160;In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectric Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric materials are great candidates for nonlinear optics and electro&#8208;optic modulators. A giant second&#8208;harmonic generation effect is reported in physical vapor&#8208;deposited ferroelectric material, SnSe. Nanoscale in&#8208;plane ferroelectric domains are revealed, those with ferroelectric stacking exhibit &#8776;100 times higher nonlinear optical efficiency than monolayer TMDs, due to a parallel stacking structure where nonlinear dipoles in each vdW ferroelectric layer add constructively.








Abstract
Thin ferroelectric materials hold great promise for compact nonvolatile memory and nonlinear optical and optoelectronic devices. Herein, an ultrathin in&#8208;plane ferroelectric material that exhibits a giant nonlinear optical effect, group&#8208;IV monochalcogenide SnSe, is reported. Nanometer&#8208;scale ferroelectric domains with &#8776;90&#176;/270&#176; twin boundaries or &#8776;180&#176; domain walls are revealed in physical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposited SnSe by lateral piezoresponse force microscopy. Atomic structure characterization reveals both parallel and antiparallel stacking of neighboring van der Waals ferroelectric layers, leading to ferroelectric or antiferroelectric ordering. Ferroelectric domains exhibit giant nonlinear optical activity due to coherent enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic fields and the as&#8208;resulted second&#8208;harmonic generation&#160;was&#160;observed to be 100 times more intense than monolayer WS2. This work demonstrates&#160;in&#8208;plane ferroelectric ordering and giant nonlinear optical activity in SnSe, which paves the way for applications in on&#8208;chip nonlinear optical components and nonvolatile memory devices.

         <title>Zinc Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Regulated Hard Carbons for High&#8208;Rate and Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Zn single&#8208;atom&#8208;regulated hard carbon with unprecedented sodium&#8208;storage performance is reported. The Zn doping can induce a local electric field to enable the fast bulk Na+ transportation and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and fast interfacial Na+ storage kinetics, both of which contribute to the boosted electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Hard carbons, as one of the most commercializable anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have to deal with the trade&#8208;off between the rate capability and specific capacity or initial Columbic efficiency (ICE), and the fast performance decline at low temperature (LT) remains poorly understood. Here, a comprehensive regulation on the interfacial/bulk electrochemistry of hard carbons through atomic Zn doping is reported, which demonstrates a record&#8208;high reversible capacity (546 mAh g&#8722;1), decent ICE (84%), remarkable rate capability (140 mAh g&#8722;1 @ 50 A g&#8722;1), and excellent LT capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 @ &#8722;40 &#176;C), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. This work reveals that the Zn doping can generally induce a local electric field to enable fast bulk Na+ transportation, and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which elaborates the underlying origin of the boosted electrochemical performance. Importantly, distinguished from room temperature, the intrinsic Na+ migration/desolvation ability of the electrolyte is disclosed to be the crucial rate&#8208;determining factors for the SIB performance at LT.

     alt="Zinc Single-Atom-Regulated Hard Carbons for High-Rate and Low-Temperature Sodium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel Zn single-atom-regulated hard carbon with unprecedented sodium-storage performance is reported. The Zn doping can induce a local electric field to enable the fast bulk Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transportation and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to form a robust inorganic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase and fast interfacial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage kinetics, both of which contribute to the boosted electrochemical performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard carbons, as one of the most commercializable anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), have to deal with the trade-off between the rate capability and specific capacity or initial Columbic efficiency (ICE), and the fast performance decline at low temperature (LT) remains poorly understood. Here, a comprehensive regulation on the interfacial/bulk electrochemistry of hard carbons through atomic Zn doping is reported, which demonstrates a record-high reversible capacity (546 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), decent ICE (84%), remarkable rate capability (140 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; @ 50 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and excellent LT capacity (443 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; @ &#8722;40 &#176;C), outperforming the state-of-the-art literature. This work reveals that the Zn doping can generally induce a local electric field to enable fast bulk Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transportation, and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to form a robust inorganic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase, which elaborates the underlying origin of the boosted electrochemical performance. Importantly, distinguished from room temperature, the intrinsic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration/desolvation ability of the electrolyte is disclosed to be the crucial rate-determining factors for the SIB performance at LT. This work provides a fundamental understanding on the charge-storage kinetics at varied temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Formation of Stable Mononuclear Cu(I)Cl Species on Carbon for Low&#8208;Footprint Vinyl Chloride Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;supported copper generates interest as a replacement for noble&#8208;metal&#8208; or mercury&#8208;containing acetylene hydrochlorination catalysts in vinyl chloride production. It is shown that mononuclear Cu(I)Cl species, which form under reaction conditions due to a favorable interaction with oxygen coordination sites, are the main active species, and quantify their potential for improving the sustainability of the process.








Abstract
Copper catalysts are attractive candidates for Hg&#8208;free vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) production via acetylene hydrochlorination due to their non&#8208;toxic nature and high stability. However, the optimal architecture for Cu&#8208;based catalysts at the nanoscale is not yet fully understood. To address this gap, the metal precursor and the annealing temperature are modified to prepare copper nanoparticles or single atoms, either in chlorinated or ligand&#8208;free form, on an unmodified carbon support. Evaluation in the reaction reveals a remarkable convergence of the performance of all materials to the stable VCM productivity of the single&#8208;atom catalyst. In&#8208;depth characterization by advanced microscopy, quasi in situ and operando spectroscopy, and simulations uncover a reaction&#8208;induced formation of low&#8208;valent, single atom Cu(I)Cl site motif, regardless of the initial nanostructure. Various surface oxygen groups promote nanoparticle redispersion by stabilizing single&#8208;atom CuClx species. The anchoring site structure does not strongly influence the acetylene adsorption energy or the crucial role they play in stabilizing key reaction intermediates. A life&#8208;cycle assessment demonstrates the potential environmental benefits of copper catalysts over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art alternatives. This work contributes to a better understanding of optimal metal speciation and highlights the sustainability of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for VCM production.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are realized in a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn, capped with a Pt overlayer via tuning the magnitude of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. Besides, the temperature&#8208;induced novel transition from skyrmions to antiferromagnetic meron&#8208;like spin textures at &#8776;220 K is also observed in the Mn3Sn/Pt samples. This may stimulate the discovery of new topological spin textures in antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Topologically protected magnetic &#8220;whirls&#8221; such as skyrmions in antiferromagnetic materials have recently attracted extensive interest due to their nontrivial band topology and potential application in antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions in natural metallic antiferromagnetic materials with merit of probable convenient electrical manipulation have not been reported. Here, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are realized in a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn, capped with a Pt overlayer. The evolution of spin textures from coplanar inverted triangular structures to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions is achieved via tuning the magnitude of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. Beyond that, the temperature can induce an unconventional transition from skyrmions to antiferromagnetic meron&#8208;like spin textures at &#8776;220 K in the Mn3Sn/Pt samples. Combining with the theoretical calculations, it is found that the transition originates from the temperature dependence of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between kagome sublayers within the Mn3Sn crystalline unit&#8208;cell. These findings open the avenue for the development of topological spin&#8208;swirling&#8208;based antiferromagnetic spintronics.

         <title>Metallic Glass&#8208;Fiber Fabrics: A New Type of Flexible, Super&#8208;Lightweight, and 3D Current Collector for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic glass&#8208;fiber fabrics (MGFs) is a new type of super&#8208;lightweight, strong, flexible, electrochemically and thermally stable, and fire&#8208;resistant current collector. It displays great practical potential in the area of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible batteries. Replacing metal foils with MGFs can not only improve the energy density of lithium batteries by 9&#8211;18%, but also endow lithium batteries with outstanding flexible attributes.








Abstract
Current collectors are indispensable parts that provide electron transport and mechanical support of electrode materials in a battery. Nowadays, thin metal foils made of Cu and Al are used as current collectors of lithium batteries, but they do not contribute to the storage capacity. Therefore, decreasing the weight of current collectors can directly enhance the energy density of a battery. However, limited by the requirements of mechanical strength, it is difficult to reduce the weight of metal foils any further. Herein, a new type of current collectors made of 3D metallic glass&#8208;fiber fabrics (MGFs), which shows advantages of super&#8208;lightweight (2.9&#8211;3.2&#160;mg cm&#8315;2), outstanding electrochemical stability for cathodes and anodes of lithium&#8208;ion and lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), fire resistance, high strength, and flexibility suitable for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll electrode fabrication is reported. The gravimetric energy densities of lithium batteries exhibit improvements of 9&#8211;18% by only replacing the metal foils with the MGFs. In addition, MGFs are suitable for the fabrication of flexible batteries. A high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium battery with an outstanding figure of merit of flexible battery (fbFOM) and flexing stability is demonstrated.

         <title>Multichannel Single&#8208;Photon Emissions with On&#8208;Demand Momentums by Using Anisotropic Quantum Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic metasurface with phase&#8208;independent and phase&#8208;dependent schemes is proposed to freely manipulate single&#8208;photon spin angular momentums (SAMs) and linear momentums. Multichannel single&#8208;photon emissions with independently controlled SAMs are demonstrated to propagate in different directions. The introduction of anisotropic nanoscatterers and anisotropic arrangements of nanoscatterers to construct metasurfaces provides more flexibility to fully shape light fields.








Abstract
Photon momentums and their control are important for carrying quantum information and increasing information capacities. It is a great challenge to freely control multiple momentums of single photons based on only phase&#8208;dependent schemes in isotropic metasurfaces because exact manipulations of interference phases and precise alignments between quantum emitters and metasurfaces are involved. Here, an anisotropic metasurface, in which anisotropic rather than isotropic nanoscatterers are arranged anisotropically, is proposed to freely control multiple momentums of single photons. In the metasurfaces, the phase&#8208;independent and phase&#8208;dependent schemes are used to independently control spin angular momentums (SAMs) and linear momentums (LMs), respectively. The phase&#8208;independent scheme allows robust alignment between quantum emitters and metasurfaces. The anisotropic design amends geometrical phases for oblique emissions, providing larger ranges (up to 53&#176;) for tailoring LMs. In experiments, three&#8208;channel single&#8208;photon emissions with independent SAMs and LMs are demonstrated. The introduction of anisotropic nanoscatterers and anisotropic arrangements of nanoscatterers is a more general design method for metasurfaces, and it could provide more flexibility to freely and efficiently tailor single&#8208;photon emissions.

The anisotropic design amends geometrical phases for oblique emissions, providing larger ranges (up to 53&#176;) for tailoring LMs. In experiments, three-channel single-photon emissions with independent SAMs and LMs are demonstrated. The introduction of anisotropic nanoscatterers and anisotropic arrangements of nanoscatterers is a more general design method for metasurfaces, and it could provide more flexibility to freely and efficiently tailor single-photon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wood&#8208;Derived Continuously Oriented Three&#8208;Phase Interfacial Channels for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wood&#8208;derived cathode with continuously oriented three&#8208;phase interfacial channels is developed for alkaline hybrid zinc batteries without additional gas diffusion layers to achieve a wide operating voltage range, superior specific capacity with a &#8776;370% improvement over a nickel&#8211;zinc battery alone, and an excellent energy density and cycling stability.








Abstract
Although recently developed hybrid zinc (Zn) batteries integrate the benefits of both alkaline Zn and Zn&#8211;air batteries, the kinetics of the electrocatalytic oxygen reaction and mass transfer of the electrolyte, which are limited by the mismatched and disordered multiphase reaction's interfacial transfer channels, considerably inhibit the performance of hybrid Zn batteries. In this work, novel, continuously oriented three&#8208;phase interfacial channels at the cathode derived from the natural structure of pine wood are developed to address these challenges. A pine wood chip is carbonized and asymmetrically loaded with a hydrophilic active material to achieve the creation of a wood&#8208;derived cathode that integrates the active material, current collector, and continuously oriented three&#8208;phase reaction interfacial channels, which allows the reaction dynamics to be accelerated. Consequently, the assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state hybrid battery performs an extra charge&#8211;discharge process beyond that performed by a typical nickel (Ni)&#8211;Zn&#160;battery, resulting in a wide operating voltage range of 0.6&#8211;2.0&#160;V and a superior specific capacity of 656.5 mAh g&#8211;1, in addition to an excellent energy density (644.7&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1) and good durability. The &#8776;370% capacity improvement relative to the Ni&#8211;Zn battery&#160;alone makes the hybrid battery one of the best&#8208;performing alkaline Zn batteries.

         <title>2D Perovskite Mn2+&#8208;Doped Cs2CdBr2Cl2 Scintillator for Low&#8208;Dose High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>

A new 2D perovskite scintillator, Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+, is reported. With near&#8208;unity PLQY and negligible self&#8208;absorption, Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, including high light yield (64 950 photons MeV&#8722;1) and low detection limits (17.82 nGyair s&#8722;1). A flexible scintillator screen combining Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ and PDMS enables low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging with a high spatial resolution of 12.3 line pairs (lp) mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with low detection limits and high light yield are of great importance and are a challenge for low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging in medical diagnosis and industrial detection. In this work, the synthesis of a new 2D perovskite, Cs2CdBr2Cl2, via hydrothermal reaction is reported. By doping Mn2+ into the perovskite, a yellow emission located at 593&#160;nm is obtained, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ perovskite reaches the highest value of 98.52%. The near&#8208;unity PLQY and negligible self&#8208;absorption of Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ enable excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation performance with a high light yield of 64 950 photons MeV&#8722;1 and low detection limit of 17.82 nGyair s&#8722;1. Moreover, combining Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ with poly(dimethylsiloxane) to fabricate a flexible scintillator screen achieves low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging with a high resolution of 12.3 line pairs (lp) mm&#8722;1. The results suggest that Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ is a promising candidate for low&#8208;dose and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. The study presents a new approach to designing high&#8208;performance scintillators through metal&#8208;ion doping.

         <title>Programming 3D Curves with Discretely Constrained Cylindrical Inflatables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse design method is proposed that outputs geometric parameters for patch&#8208;clad cylindrical inflatables such that they match target 3D curves. The approach uses an initial conceptual solution based on curve kinematics to seed a finite element simulation nested within an optimization algorithm, resulting in excellent curve matching. Demonstrations showcase the utility of bespoke 3D inflatables for robotics applications.








Abstract
Programming inflatable systems to deform to desired 3D&#160;shapes opens up multifarious applications in robotics, morphing architecture, and interventional medicine. This work elicits complex deformations by attaching discrete strain limiters to cylindrical hyperelastic inflatables. Using this system, a method is presented to solve the inverse problem of programming myriad 3D centerline curves upon inflation. The method entails two steps: first, a reduced&#8208;order model generates a conceptual solution giving coarse indications of strain limiter placement on the undeformed cylindrical inflatable. This low&#8208;fidelity solution then seeds a finite element simulation nested within an optimization loop to further tune strain limiter parameters.&#160;We&#160;leverage this framework to achieve functionality through a priori programmed deformations of cylindrical inflatables, including 3D curve matching, self&#8208;tying knotting, and manipulation. The results hold broad significance for the emerging computational design of inflatable systems.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With Near&#8208;Unity Internal Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient blue single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are demonstrated, achieving 27.7% external quantum efficiency, low roll&#8208;off, and low operating voltages. The internal quantum efficiency approaches unity, demonstrating that highly simplified single&#8208;layer OLEDs without confinement layers can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, while greatly reducing the complexity of the design, fabrication, and device analysis.








Abstract
Efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) commonly comprise a multilayer stack including charge&#8208;transport and charge&#8208; and exciton&#8208;blocking layers, to confine charge recombination to the emissive layer. Here, a highly simplified single&#8208;layer blue&#8208;emitting OLED is demonstrated based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence with the emitting layer simply sandwiched between ohmic contacts consisting of a polymeric conducting anode and a metal cathode. The single&#8208;layer OLED exhibits an external quantum efficiency of 27.7% with minor roll&#8208;off at high brightness. The internal quantum efficiency approaches unity, demonstrating that highly simplified single&#8208;layer OLEDs without confinement layers can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, while greatly reducing the complexity of the design, fabrication, and device analysis.

         <title>Intramolecular&#8208;Catalyzed Vitrimers with White&#8208;Light Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of intramolecular&#8208;catalyzed vitrimers with white&#8208;light emissions via the synergies between blue and yellow light for light&#8208;emitting diode encapsulations is proposed and developed, where the successful unification of photochemistry and dynamic bond chemistry allows for a rare integration of photoluminescence, dynamic stability, and sustainability in a system.








Abstract
Currently available encapsulating materials for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) have certain limitations, such as the toxicity of phosphors and the non&#8208;recyclable nature of the encapsulating materials. In this study, relatively promising encapsulating materials with two significant advantages are developed. First, the chips can be directly encapsulated without phosphors using luminescent encapsulating materials. Second, the encapsulating materials can be reprocessed for recycling via intramolecular catalysis. To this end, blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting vitrimers (BEVs) are prepared by the reaction of epoxy resin with amines and are found to exhibit strong blue emission and fast stress relaxation via internal catalysis. To obtain white&#8208;light emission, a well&#8208;designed yellow component, perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, is grafted into the BEVs to generate white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting vitrimers (WEVs). A rare synergy of blue&#8208; and yellow&#8208;light emission affords white&#8208;light emission. When the WEV is used as an encapsulating adhesive for 365 nm LED chips without inorganic phosphors, stable white light with CIE coordinates (0.30, 0.32) is successfully achieved, indicating a promising future for WLED encapsulation.

         <title>Unveiling Strong Ion&#8211;Electron&#8211;Lattice Coupling and Electronic Antidoping in Hydrogenated Perovskite Nickelate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;ion intercalation at the atomic scale and the energy band structure in perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 are demonstrated by combining experimental results and theoretical calculations.&#160;The results show extremely enhanced NiO6 octahedra tilting/rotation and giant lattice expansion. Moreover, the electronic antidoping mechansim is found to dominate the metal&#8211;insulator transtion, contrary to the previously proposed redox reaction mechanism from Ni3+ to Ni2+.








Abstract
Despite being highly promising for applications in emergent electronic devices, decoding both the ion&#8211;electron&#8211;lattice coupling in correlated materials at the atomic scale and the electronic band structure remains a big challenge due to the strong and complex correlation among these degrees of freedom. Here, taking an epitaxial thin film of perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 as a model system, hydrogen&#8208;ion&#8208;induced giant lattice distortion and enhanced NiO6 octahedra tilting/rotation are demonstrated, which leads to a new robust hydrogenated HNdNiO3 phase with lattice expansion larger than 10% on a series of substrates. Moreover, under the effect of ion&#8211;electron synergistic doping, it is found that the proposed electronic antidoping, i.e., the doped electrons mainly fill the ground&#8208;state oxygen 2p holes instead of changing the Ni oxidation state from Ni3+ to Ni2+, dominates the metal&#8211;insulator transition. Meanwhile, lattice modification with enhanced Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond tilting or rotation mainly modifies the orbital density of states near the Fermi level. Last, by electric&#8208;field&#8208;controlled hydrogen&#8208;ion intercalation and its strong coupling to the lattice and electron charge, selective micrometer&#8208;scale patterns with distinct structural and electronic states are fabricated. The results provide direct evidence for a strong ion&#8211;electron&#8211;lattice coupling in correlated physics and exhibit its potential applications in designing novel materials and devices.

         <title>Gradient Electrolyte Strategy Achieving Long&#8208;Life Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gradient electrolyte strategy wherein a concentration gradient of zinc ions is constructed from the anode to the separator enables dense and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. The gradient electrolyte plays dual roles in keeping dense deposition on the zinc surface by the high&#8208;concentration electrolyte containing carboxymethylcellulose and avoiding the water&#8208;poor state of the GF separator by the low&#8208;concentration electrolyte.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are plagued by a short lifespan caused by localized dendrites. High&#8208;concentration electrolytes are favorable for dense Zn deposition but have poor performance in batteries with glass&#8208;fiber separators. In contrast, low&#8208;concentration electrolytes can wet the separators well, ensuring the migration of zinc ions, but the dendrites grow rapidly. In this work, we propose an electrolyte gradient strategy wherein a zinc&#8208;ion concentration gradient is established from the anode to the separator, ensuring that the separator keeps a good wettability in low&#8208;concentration areas and the zinc anode achieves dendrite&#8208;free deposition in a high&#8208;concentration area. By using this strategy in a common electrolyte, zinc sulfate, a Zn||Zn symmetric cell achieves 14&#160;000 ultralong cycles (exceeding 8 months) at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. When the current is further increased to 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the symmetric cell could still run for over 10&#160;000 cycles. Assembled Zn||NVO full cells also demonstrate prominent performance. At a high current of 16&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the NVO cathode with high loading (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) still has a capacity of 58% after 1200 cycles. Overall, the gradient electrolyte strategy provides a promising approach for practical long&#8208;life Zn anodes with the advantages of simple operation and low cost.

         <title>Toward a Novel Energy&#8208;Dissipation Metamaterial with Tensegrity Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>A new dissipator with a tensegrity&#8208;based architecture that is highly customizable is presented. It has movement amplification capabilities due to its internal geometry and it is possible to control its stiffness and damping by adjusting the pre&#8208;strain. A 3D&#8208;printed prototype is analyzed and its excellent dissipation abilities are confirmed. Furthermore, this design can serve as a building block for more complex assemblies, like periodic metamaterials with tensegrity architecture.








Abstract
The interest in novel energy&#8208;dissipation devices that offer advanced functionalities for optimal performance in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art engineering applications is growing. In this regard, a highly tunable and innovative dissipator is developed. This dissipator features movement amplification capabilities resulting from the radial replication of a unit&#8208;cell with tensegrity architecture. The kinematic response of the dissipator is analyzed for several layouts, by varying the number of unit&#8208;cells within the device, their internal geometry, and identifying the corresponding locking configurations. A fully operational 3D&#8208;printed prototype is presented, demonstrating its excellent performance in terms of damping capabilities and feasibility. The experimental results are used to validate a numerical model of the flower unit. This model demonstrates the importance of pre&#8208;strain on the overall stiffness and dissipative features of the proposed system. By utilizing these numerical models, it is shown that the proposed device can be used as a building block for more complex assemblies such as periodic metamaterials with tensegrity architecture.

With tailored conjugated ligand design, the 2D/3D heterostructure built in perovskite solar cells enhances the interface adhesion between the polymeric hole&#8208;transporting layer&#8212;PTAA and perovskite, and at the same time, realizes a uniform growth of 2D structure on top of 3D perovskite. Therefore, the as&#8208;fabricated device yields a 23.7% power conversion efficiency, along with excellent stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25% and incorporating polymers as hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) can further enhance the stability of devices toward the goal of commercialization. Among the various polymeric hole&#8208;transporting materials, poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) is one of the promising HTL candidates with good stability; however, the hydrophobicity of PTAA causes problematic interfacial contact with the perovskite, limiting the device performance. Using molecular side&#8208;chain engineering, a uniform 2D perovskite interlayer with conjugated ligands, between 3D perovskites and PTAA is successfully constructed. Further, employing conjugated ligands as cohesive elements, perovskite/PTAA interfacial adhesion is significantly improved. As a result, the thin and lateral extended 2D/3D heterostructure enables as&#8208;fabricated PTAA&#8208;based PSCs to achieve a PCE of 23.7%, improved from the 18% of reference devices. Owing to the increased ion&#8208;migration energy barrier and conformal 2D coating, unencapsulated devices with the new ligands exhibit both superior thermal stability under 60&#160;&#176;C heating and moisture stability in ambient conditions.

         <title>A Novel Ultra&#8208;Wideband Electromagnetic&#8208;Wave&#8208;Absorbing Metastructure Inspired by Bionic Gyroid Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Butterfly wings possess strut&#8208;gyroid structural color, which shows that varying structures can reflect differing wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. This property inspires creation of a sheet&#8208;gyroid metastructure for subwavelength electromagnetic wave absorption. By using additive manufacturing and a dipping process, this metastructure is able to achieve broadband absorption from 2 to 40 GHz, with a high level of radiation incident angle and polarization&#8208;resistance.








Abstract
Traditional honeycomb&#8208;like structural electromagnetic (EM)&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing materials have been widely used in various equipment as multifunctional materials. However, current EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing materials are limited by narrow absorption bandwidths and incidence angles because of their anisotropic structural morphology. The work presented here proposes a novel EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing metastructure with an isotropic morphology inspired by the gyroid microstructures seen in Parides sesostris butterfly wings. A matching redesign methodology between the material and subwavelength scale properties of the gyroid microstructure is proposed, inspired by the interaction mechanism between the microstructure and the material properties on the EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorption performance of the prepared metastructure. The bioinspired metastructure is fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) and subsequent coating through dipping processes, filled with dielectric lossy materials. Based on simulations and experiments, the metastructure designed in this work exhibits an ultrawide absorption bandwidth covering the frequency range of 2&#8211;40&#160;GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 180% at normal incidence. Moreover, the metastructure has a stable frequency response when the incident angle is 60&#176; under transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. Finally, the synergistic mechanism between the microstructure and the material is elucidated, which provides a new paradigm for the design of novel ultra&#8208;broadband EM&#8208;absorbing materials.

         <title>Ionogel&#8208;Electrode for the Study of Protein Tunnel Junctions under Physiologically Relevant Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrode material made of ionogel is used to conduct measurement of charge transport through protein molecules adsorbed on a surface of a self&#8208;assembled monolayer. It is shown that tunneling through a protein junction can operate via temperature&#8208;independent tunneling at solid states, and switch into the temperature&#8208;dependent hopping with hydrated proteins under physiologically relevant conditions.








Abstract
The study of charge transport through proteins is essential for understanding complicated electrochemical processes in biological activities while the reasons for the coexistence of tunneling and hopping phenomena in protein junctions still remain unclear. In this work, a flexible and conductive ionogel electrode is synthesized and is used as a top contact to form highly reproducible protein junctions. The junctions of proteins, including human serum albumin, cytochrome C and hemoglobin, show temperature&#8208;independent electron tunneling characteristics when the junctions are in solid states while with a different mechanism of temperature&#8208;dependent electron hopping when junctions are hydrated under physiologically relevant conditions. It is demonstrated that the solvent reorganization energy plays an important role in the electron&#8208;hopping process and experimentally shown that it requires &#8776;100 meV for electron hopping through one heme group inside a hydrated protein molecule connected between two electrodes.

         <title>Impact of Ti and Zn Dual&#8208;Substitution in P2 Type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 on Ni&#8211;Mn and Na&#8208;Vacancy Ordering and Electrochemical Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;substitution by Ti and Zn for Mn and Ni, respectively, in P2 type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 maintains in&#8208;plane Ni&#8211;Mn ordering but disrupts Na+&#8208;vacancy ordering, resulting in long&#8208;cycling&#8208;life non&#8208;aqueous Na cells with smooth charge&#8211;discharge voltage curves and little structural change from the P2&#8208;type layered structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy layered oxide materials containing various metals that exhibit smooth voltage curves and excellent electrochemical performances have attracted attention in the development of positive electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, a smooth voltage curve can be obtained by suppression of the Na+&#8208;vacancy ordering, and therefore, transition metal slabs do not need to be more multi&#8208;element than necessary. Here, the Na+&#8208;vacancy ordering is found to be disturbed by dual substitution of TiIV for MnIV and ZnII for NiII in P2&#8208;Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2. Dual&#8208;substituted Na2/3[Ni1/4Mn1/2Ti1/6Zn1/12]O2 demonstrates almost non&#8208;step voltage curves with a reversible capacity of 114&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and less structural changes with a high crystalline structure maintained during charging and discharging. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray, neutron, and electron diffraction measurements reveal that dual&#8208;substitution with TiIV and ZnII uniquely promotes in&#8208;plane NiII&#8211;MnIV ordering, which is quite different from the disordered mixing in conventional multiple metal substitution.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional V2C MXene Assembly in Facilitating Sulfur Evolution Kinetics and Li&#8208;Ion Sieving toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scale&#8208;identified V2C MXene spheres can synchronously promote sulfur&#8208;evolution kinetics and sieve Li&#8208;ions, thereby showing an outstanding dual protection effect on the sulfur cathode and lithium anode for practically working lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising candidates to achieve an energy density of 500&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1. However, the challenges of shuttle effect, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and lithium&#8208;dendrite growth severely obstruct their practical implementation. Herein, multiscale V2C MXene (VC) with a spherical confinement structure is designed as a high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional promotor for the evolution of sulfur and lithium species in Li&#8211;S batteries. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography (X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;CT), small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS), and first&#8208;principle calculations, it is revealed that the activity of VC can be maximized by tuning the scale, and the as&#8208;attained functions are conducted as follows: (i) the VC acts as the efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPS) scavenger due to the large number of active sites; (ii) the VC exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic function for the Li2S nucleation and decomposition reaction kinetics owing to the scale effect; and (iii) the VC can regulate the dynamic behavior of Li&#8208;ions and thus stabilize the lithium plating/stripping effectively on account of the unique ion&#8208;sieving effect.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising candidates to achieve an energy density of 500&#160;Wh kg&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the challenges of shuttle effect, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and lithium-dendrite growth severely obstruct their practical implementation. Herein, multiscale V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C MXene (VC) with a spherical confinement structure is designed as a high-efficiency bifunctional promotor for the evolution of sulfur and lithium species in Li&#8211;S batteries. Combining synchrotron X-ray 3D nano-computed tomography (X-ray 3D nano-CT), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and first-principle calculations, it is revealed that the activity of VC can be maximized by tuning the scale, and the as-attained functions are conducted as follows: (i) the VC acts as the efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPS) scavenger due to the large number of active sites; (ii) the VC exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic function for the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nucleation and decomposition reaction kinetics owing to the scale effect; and (iii) the VC can regulate the dynamic behavior of Li-ions and thus stabilize the lithium plating/stripping effectively on account of the unique ion-sieving effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extraordinary Ionic Conductivity Excited by Hierarchical Ion&#8208;Transport Pathways in MOF&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes</title>

The interstices and cracks can play an important role in ion transport of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs). An extraordinarily high ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm&#8722;1) is observed for MOFs QSEs with an optimal hierarchical pore structure. This work redefines the understanding of ion transport in MOF&#8208;based QSEs and breaks the bottleneck of MOF&#8208;based QSEs.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;laden metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LE&#8208;laden MOFs) are promising quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs) for metal&#8208;anode batteries. To achieve a high ionic conductivity, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing continuous and compact LE&#8208;laden MOF layers. Surprisingly, in this work, an extraordinarily high ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm&#8722;1) is observed in an LE&#8208;laden MOF electrolyte with abundant interstices and cracks. Herein, various macroscopic and mesoscopic pore structures of Li&#8208;LE&#8208;laden HKUST&#8208;1 QSEs are prepared via morphology control and different cold&#8208;pressing procedures. Thereinto, Li&#8208;LE&#8208;laden cuboctahedron HKUST&#8208;1 prepared under 150&#160;MPa cold&#8208;pressing with an optimal hierarchical pore structure (Li&#8208;Cuboct&#8208;H) exhibits the highest ambient ionic conductivity (1.02 mS cm&#8722;1). It is found that interstices and cracks in electrolytes construct a set of interconnected Li&#8208;LE networks with innate MOF channels and facilitate Li+ transfer in the hybrid ion&#8208;transport pathways. The Li/LiFePO4 cells based on Li&#8208;Cuboct&#8208;H deliver a splendid capacity retention of 93% over 210 cycles at 1 C. Meanwhile, the high ionic conductivities (higher than 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) can be achieved in different ion conductor systems (Na, Mg, and Al) under the same guideline. This work redefines the understanding of ion transport in MOF&#8208;based QSEs and breaks the bottleneck of MOF&#8208;based QSEs.

         <title>A 2D Soft Covalent Organic Framework Membrane Prepared via&#160;a&#160;Molecular Bridge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soft 2D covalent organic framework membrane with more uniform pores is rapidly formed (&#8776;5&#160;min) based on the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecular channel (just like a molecular highway) constructed at the water/dichloromethane (DCM) interface. The formed COF membrane exhibits superb sieving capability for small molecules, strong chemical stability, and sufficient flexibility.








Abstract
Highly flexible and robust self&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with rapid preparation are important but technically challenging for achieving precise separation. Herein , a novel imine&#8208;based 2D soft covalent organic framework (SCOF) membrane with a large area of 226.9&#160;cm2, via ingeniously selecting an aldehyde flexible linker and a trigonal building block, is reported. The soft 2D covalent organic framework membrane is rapidly formed (&#8776;5&#160;min) based on the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecular channel constructed at the water/dichloromethane (DCM) interface, which is the record&#8208;fast SCOF membrane formation and 72 times faster than that in the reported literature. MD simulation and DFT calculation elucidate that the dynamic, self&#8208;assembled SDS molecular channel facilitates faster and more homogeneous transfer of amine monomers in the bulk, thereby forming a soft 2D self&#8208;standing COF membrane with more uniform pores. The formed SCOF membrane exhibits superb sieving capability for small molecules, robustness in strong alkaline (5&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 NaOH), acid (0.1&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 HCl), and various organic solutions, and sufficient flexibility with a large curvature of 2000&#160;m&#8722;1 for membrane&#8208;based separation science and technology.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Percolated Networks Enabled by Low Loadings of Branched Nanorods for Enhanced H2 Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanorods with suitable aspect ratios are ideal for constructing percolated networks in polymers with low loadings and easiness to fabricate defect&#8208;free membranes, compared with nanoparticles and nanowires. This work demonstrates mixed matrix materials containing Pd&#8208;percolated networks enabled by 3.9&#160;vol% Pd branched nanorods, achieving H2/CO2 separation properties superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane materials and surpassing the upper bound.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) at high loadings are often used in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) to improve gas separation properties, but they can lead to defects and poor processability that impede membrane fabrication. Herein, it is demonstrated that branched nanorods (NRs) with controlled aspect ratios can significantly reduce the required loading to achieve superior gas separation properties while maintaining excellent processability, as demonstrated by the dispersion of palladium (Pd) NRs in polybenzimidazole for H2/CO2 separation. Increasing the aspect ratio from 1 for NPs to 40 for NRs decreases the percolation threshold volume fraction by a factor of 30, from 0.35 to 0.011. An MMM with percolated networks formed by Pd NRs at a volume fraction of 0.039 exhibits H2 permeability of 110&#160;Barrer and H2/CO2 selectivity of 31 when challenged with simulated syngas at 200&#160;&#176;C, surpassing Robeson's upper bound. This work highlights the advantage of NRs over NPs and nanowires and shows that right&#8208;sizing nanofillers in MMMs is critical to construct highly sieving pathways at minimal loadings. This work paves the way for this general feature to be applied across materials systems for a variety of chemical separations.

         <title>Visualizing the Atomic Configuration of Carbonate Groups&#160; in a (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonates (CO32&#8722;) are always known to suppress superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors. By employing integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC), the triangular atomic configuration of carbonates and their alternated spatial arrangement are visualized in (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948;. Combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, a competitive mechanism is unveiled with the decreased number of charge carriers while the improved flatness in CuO2 layers.








Abstract
Carbonates (CO32&#8722;) have always been known as impurities to degrade the superconductivity in cuprate high&#8208;Tc superconductors. Herein, the atomic arrangement of carbonates is directly visualized in (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; via integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The carbon atoms replace Cu atoms in the charge&#8208;reservoir layers, contributing to the formation of carbonates through strong orbital hybridization with the surrounding oxygen atoms. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the spatial configuration of the carbonate groups is confirmed and their influence on the local crystal lattice and electronic states is further investigated. The carbonates not only accommodate distortions by improving the flatness of the outer CuO2 layers but also reduce the density of states at the Fermi level. These two factors play competitive roles to affect the superconductivity. This study provides direct evidence of the presence of CO32&#8722; groups and gains an insight into the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors.

&lt;/sub&gt;. Combined with first-principles calculations, a competitive mechanism is unveiled with the decreased number of charge carriers while the improved flatness in CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbonates (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) have always been known as impurities to degrade the superconductivity in cuprate high-Tc superconductors. Herein, the atomic arrangement of carbonates is directly visualized in (Cu,C)Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11+&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; via integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) combined with state-of-the-art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The carbon atoms replace Cu atoms in the charge-reservoir layers, contributing to the formation of carbonates through strong orbital hybridization with the surrounding oxygen atoms. Using first-principles calculations, the spatial configuration of the carbonate groups is confirmed and their influence on the local crystal lattice and electronic states is further investigated. The carbonates not only accommodate distortions by improving the flatness of the outer CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers but also reduce the density of states at the Fermi level. These two factors play competitive roles to affect the superconductivity. This study provides direct evidence of the presence of CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups and gains an insight into the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hollow Hierarchical Cu2O&#8208;Derived Electrocatalysts Steering CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Chemicals at Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational design of catalyst morphology and elaborate calculations, a heteroseed&#8208;induced crystallization strategy is developed for the synthesis of hollow hierarchical vertex Cu/Cu2O catalysts that can provide intermediate confinement and surface electric field enhancement for CO intermediate dimerization, thereby boosting electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products at low overpotentials.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide&#160;into multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) using renewably generated electricity provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. Various oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) catalysts have been showcased, but still require high overpotential to drive C2+ production owing to sluggish carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation and low CO intermediate (*CO) coverage. Here, the dilemma is circumvented by elaborately devising the OD&#8208;Cu morphology. First, computational studies propose a hollow and hierarchical OD&#8208;Cu microstructure that can generate a core&#8211;shell microenvironment to inhibit CO evolution and accelerate *CO dimerization via intermediate confinement and electric field enhancement, thereby boosting C2+ generation. Experimentally, the designed nanoarchitectures are synthesized through a heteroseed&#8208;induced approach followed by electrochemical activation. In situ spectroscopic studies further elaborate correlation between *CO dimerization and designed architectures. Remarkably, the hierarchical OD&#8208;Cu manifests morphology&#8208;dependent selectivity of CO2 reduction, giving a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 75.6% at a considerably positive potential of &#8722;0.55&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.

         <title>An Isomeric Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells Developed Using a Benzo&#8208;Difuran&#8208;Based Donor Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of benzo&#8208;difuran&#8208;based polymer&#8208;donor&#8208;enabled solar cells is improved a lot in this work thanks to rational material combination and isomeric solid additive type morphology tuning. A series of characterizations, in situ technique, vertical distribution calculation, transient absorption spectra, and GIWAXS/SAXS + RSoXS, reveal the basic mechanism, producing fruitful insights to this work with record efficiency.








Abstract
Currently, nearly all high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic devices use donor polymers based on the benzo&#8208;dithiophene (BDT) unit. To diversify the choices of building blocks for high&#8208;performance donor polymers, the use of benzo&#8208;difuran (BDF) units is explored, which can achieve reduced steric hindrance, stronger molecular packing, and tunable energy levels. In previous research, the performance of BDF&#8208;based devices lagged behind those of BDT&#8208;based devices. In this study, a high efficiency (18.4%) is achieved using a BDF&#8208;based polymer donor, which is the highest efficiency reported for BDF donor materials to date. The high efficiency is enabled by a donor polymer (D18&#8208;Fu) and the aid of a solid additive (2&#8208;chloronaphthalene), which is the isomer of the commonly used additive 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene. These results revealed the significant effect of 2&#8208;chloronaphthalene in optimizing the morphology and enhancing the device parameters. This work not only provides a new building block that can achieve an efficiency comparable to dominant BDT units but also proposes a new solid additive that can replace the widely used 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene additive.

         <title>Clinical Validation of a Wearable Piezoelectric Blood&#8208;Pressure Sensor for Continuous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable piezoelectric blood&#8208;pressure sensor (WPBPS) using an extremely sensitive flexible piezoelectric sensor is demonstrated for continuous and non&#8208;invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring. Its transfer function is designed by a linear regression model, offering a simple solution to convert the sensor signals into BP values. The high accuracy of WPBPS is confirmed through clinical validation with an oscillometric sphygmomanometer as a reference.








Abstract
Wearable blood&#8208;pressure sensors have recently attracted attention as healthcare devices for continuous non&#8208;invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring. However, the accuracy of wearable blood&#8208;pressure (BP) monitoring devices has been controversial due to the low signal quality of sensors, the absence of an accurate transfer function to convert the sensor signals into BP values, and the lack of clinical validation regarding measurement precision. Here, a wearable piezoelectric blood&#8208;pressure sensor (WPBPS) is reported, which achieves a high normalized sensitivity (0.062 kPa&#8722;1), and fast response time (23&#160;ms) for CNAP monitoring. The transfer function of a linear regression model is designed, offering a simple solution to convert the flexible piezoelectric sensor signals into BP values. In order to verify the measurement accuracy of WPBPS, clinical trials are performed on 35 subjects aged from 20 to 80 s after screening. The mean difference between the WPBPS and a commercial sphygmomanometer of 175 BP data pairs is &#8722;0.89 &#177; 6.19 and &#8722;0.32 &#177; 5.28&#160;mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. By building a WPBPS&#8208;embedded wristwatch, the potentially promising use of a convenient, portable, continuous BP monitoring system for cardiovascular disease diagnosis is demonstrated.

         <title>Immobilizing Surface Halide in Perovskite Solar Cells via Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule of calix[4]pyrrole (C[4]P) with unique anion&#8208;bonding capability is demonstrated to enhance the stability of metal halide perovskites by immobilization of the surface halide. It largely suppresses the halide&#8208;diffusion induced electrode corrosion, enabling formamidinium&#8211;cesium&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (efficiency over 23%) with operational and thermal lifetimes over 2000 h.








Abstract
Halide diffusion across the charge&#8208;transporting layer followed by a reaction with metal electrode represents a critical factor limiting the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a supramolecular strategy with surface anion complexation is reported for enhancing the light and thermal stability of perovskite films, as well as devices. Calix[4]pyrrole (C[4]P) is demonstrated as a unique anion&#8208;binding agent for stabilizing the structure of perovskite by anchoring surface halides, which increases the activation energy for halide migration, thus effectively suppressing the halide&#8211;metal electrode reactions. The C[4]P&#8208;stabilized perovskite films preserve their initial morphology after ageing at 85&#160;&#176;C or under 1 sun illumination in humid air over 50 h, significantly outperforming the control samples. This strategy radically tackles the halide outward&#8208;diffusion issue without sacrificing charge extraction. Inverted&#8208;structured PSCs based on C[4]P modified formamidinium&#8211;cesium perovskite exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of over 23%. The lifespans of unsealed PSCs are unprecedentedly prolonged from dozens of hours to over 2000 h under operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1) and 85&#160;&#176;C ageing (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2). When subjected to a harsher protocol of ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 with both light and thermal stresses, the C[4]P&#8208;based PSCs maintain 87% of original efficiency after ageing for 500 h.

Inverted-structured PSCs based on C[4]P modified formamidinium&#8211;cesium perovskite exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of over 23%. The lifespans of unsealed PSCs are unprecedentedly prolonged from dozens of hours to over 2000 h under operation (ISOS-L-1) and 85&#160;&#176;C ageing (ISOS-D-2). When subjected to a harsher protocol of ISOS-L-2 with both light and thermal stresses, the C[4]P-based PSCs maintain 87% of original efficiency after ageing for 500 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Aiming to solve the trade&#8208;off of &#8220;room&#8208;temperature phosphoresence (RTP)&#8211;flexibility&#8221; in principle,&#160;RTP&#160;crystals with plastic/elastic deformation are achieved by self&#8208;partitioned molecular packing, and&#160;adjusted by the controllable distributions of intermolecular interactions from different directions.

Abstract
Aiming to solve the trade&#8208;off of &#8220;room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#8211;flexibility&#8221; in principle, organic RTP crystals with elastic/plastic deformation are realized. These properties are mainly due to the divisional aggregation structures of aromatics and alkoxy chains, and can be modulated by the controllable molecular configurations. The longest RTP lifetime of 972.3&#160;ms is achieved as the highest record for organic flexible crystals. Plastic crystals with persistent RTP are realized, which can be applied into biomedical optical technologies by afterglow delivery. Moreover, the relationship among elastic/plastic deformation, RTP property, and aggregated structures is established. The elastic/plastic deformation is mainly determined by the difference of interaction energies from the aromatics and the alkoxy chains. For the BP&#8208;OR series with twisted configurations, the alkoxy chain with the middle length is favorable for the RTP property, while the strength of the &#960;&#8211;&#960; coupling is the cruical factor to the RTP property of the Xan&#8208;OR series with planar skeletons. A new way to promote the development of flexible RTP crystals, by modulation of aggregated structures as well as rational distribution of intermolecular interactions, is explored.

         <title>Fluorinated Poly(aryl piperidinium) Membranes for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side&#8208;chain fluorination leads to poly(aryl piperidinium) membranes with both high conductivity and high dimensional stability. These membranes are stable over 500&#160;h in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) with a PGM&#8208;free (Co&#8211;Mn spinel) cathode.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a cost&#8208;effective alternative to proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The development of high&#8208;performance and durable AEMFCs requires highly conductive and robust anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs). However, AEMs generally exhibit a trade&#8208;off between conductivity and dimensional stability. Here, a fluorination strategy to create a phase&#8208;separated morphological structure in poly(aryl piperidinium) AEMs is reported. The highly hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl side chains augment phase separation to construct interconnected hydrophilic channels for anion transport. As a result, these fluorinated PAP (FPAP) AEMs simultaneously possess high conductivity (&gt;150&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#160;&#176;C) and high dimensional stability (swelling ratio &lt;20% at 80&#160;&#176;C), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength &gt;80&#160;MPa and elongation at break &gt;40%) and chemical stability (&gt;2000&#160;h in 3&#160;m KOH at 80&#160;&#176;C). AEMFCs with a non&#8208;precious Co&#8211;Mn spinel cathode using the present FPAP AEMs achieve an outstanding peak power density of 1.31&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. The AEMs remain stable over 500&#160;h of fuel cell operation at a constant current density of 0.2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Electronics on Flexible Substrates Using Inorganic Nanowires Grown on High&#8208;Aspect&#8208;Ratio Printed Gold Micropillars</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electronics on flexible substrates are demonstrated by adopting a hybrid approach involving additive manufacturing for achieving high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio printed gold micropillars and a hydrothermal growth method for obtaining zinc oxide nanowires&#160;on gold micropillar electrode arrays. This leads to hierarchical light&#8208;sensitive nanowire&#8208;connected networks, exhibiting favorable ultraviolet sensing and excellent omnidirectional light&#8208;absorption ability.








Abstract
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or&#160;3D&#160;electronics on flexible substrates are an interesting direction that can enable novel solutions such as efficient bioelectricity generation and artificial retina. However, the development of devices with such architectures is limited by the lack of suitable fabrication techniques. Additive manufacturing (AM) can but often fail to provide high&#8208;resolution, sub&#8208;micrometer 3D architectures. Herein, the optimization of a drop&#8208;on&#8208;demand (DoD), high&#8208;resolution electrohydrodynamic (EHD)&#8208;based jet printing method for generating 3D gold (Au) micropillars is reported. Libraries of Au micropillar electrode arrays (MEAs) reaching a maximum height of 196&#160;&#181;m and a maximum aspect ratio of 52 are printed. Further, by combining AM with the hydrothermal growth method, a seedless synthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) on the printed Au MEAs is demonstrated. The developed hybrid approach leads to hierarchical light&#8208;sensitive NW&#8208;connected networks exhibiting favorable ultraviolet (UV) sensing as demonstrated via fabricating flexible photodetectors (PDs). The 3D PDs exhibit an excellent omnidirectional light&#8208;absorption ability and thus, maintain high photocurrents over wide light incidence angles (&#177;90&#176;). Lastly, the PDs are tested under both concave and convex bending at 40&#160;mm, showing excellent mechanical flexibility.

         <title>Optimizing Lipid Nanoparticles for Delivery in Primates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;human primates (NHPs) are regarded as the gold standard for translating preclinical lipid nanoparticle (LNP) data to humans, accurately predicting potency outcomes. By optimizing key LNP attributes and composition, such as particle size and amount of PEGylation, an eightfold increase in protein expression for IV&#8208;administered mRNA&#8208;LNP in NHP is achieved. These findings are significant to the development and clinical translation of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based therapies.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically proven to successfully deliver both small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics and larger mRNA payloads for prophylactic vaccine applications. Non&#8208;human primates (NHPs) are generally considered to be the most predictive of human responses. However, for ethical and economic reasons, LNP compositions have historically been optimized in rodents. It has been difficult to translate LNP potency data from rodents to NHPs for intravenously (IV) administered products in particular. This presents a major challenge for preclinical drug development. An attempt to investigate LNP parameters, which have historically been optimized in rodents, is carried out, and seemingly innocuous changes are found to result in large potency differences between species. For example, the ideal particle size for NHPs (50&#8211;60&#160;nm) is found to be smaller than for rodents (70&#8211;80&#160;nm). Surface chemistry requirements are also different, with almost double the amount of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated lipid needed for maximal potency in NHPs. By optimizing these two parameters, approximately eight&#8208;fold increase in protein expression from intravenously administered messenger RNA (mRNA)&#8208;LNP in NHP is gained. The optimized formulations are well tolerated when administered repeatedly with no loss of potency. This advancement enables the design of optimal LNP products for clinical development.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated High&#8208;Entropy MXenes Nanotherapeutics: NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Enhanced Intrinsic Oxidase Mimic Activity to Combat Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection</title>

Entropy&#8208;mediated high&#8208;entropy MXenes have good photothermal conversion efficiency and strong intrinsic oxidase mimic activity, and can effectively kill methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and quickly remove the biofilm via second&#8208; near&#8208;infrared&#8208;enhanced oxidase mimic activity nanotherapeutics. They are used in the treatment of bacterial keratitis and subcutaneous abscess by generating abundant active oxygen species and local hyperpyrexia strategy.








Abstract
Bacterial infections, such as bacterial keratitis (BK) and subcutaneous abscess, pose significant challenges to global healthcare. Innovative and new antibacterial agents and antibacterial strategies are in demand to control infections in this era of high drug resistance. Nanotechnology is gradually emerging as an economically feasible and effective anti&#8208;infection treatment. High&#8208;entropy MXenes (HE MXenes) are used to confer desirable properties with exposed active sites to high&#8208;entropy atomic layers, whose potential application in the field of biomedicine remains to be explored. Herein, monolayer HE MXenes are fabricated by implementing transition metals with high entropy and low Gibbs free energy to fill the gap in the biocatalytic performance of non&#8208;high&#8208;entropy MXenes. HE MXenes are endowed with extremely strong oxidase mimic activity (Km = 0.227&#160;mm) and photothermal conversion efficiency (65.8%) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) biowindow as entropy increases. Subsequently, HE MXenes realize NIR&#8208;II&#8208;enhanced intrinsic oxidase mimic activity for killing methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and rapidly removing the biofilm. Furthermore, HE MXenes can effectively treat BK and subcutaneous abscess infection induced by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus as nanotherapeutic agents with minuscule side effects. Overall, monolayer HE MXenes demonstrate promising clinical application potential in the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections and promote the healing of infected tissues.

         <title>Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/ReS2 Heterojunction Phototransistor for Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Visual Adaptation Emulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polarization&#8208;sensitive device is demonstrated based on a porous metal&#8211;organic framework/ReS2 heterojunction phototransistor. The most intriguing properties of polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation can be achieved by tuning the bottom&#8208;gate bias and different light environments. It can provide a fascinating opportunity for next generation of artificial visual perception systems.








Abstract
Visual adaptation allows organisms to accurately perceive the external world even in dramatically changing environments, from dim starlight to bright sunlight. In particular, polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation can effectively process the polarized visual information that is ubiquitous in nature. However, such an intriguing characteristic still remains a great challenge in semiconductor devices. Herein, a novel porous metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework phototransistor with anisotropic&#8208;ReS2&#8208;based heterojunction is demonstrated for polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation emulation. The device exhibits intriguing polarized sensitivity and an adaptive ability due to its strong anisotropic and trapping&#8211;detrapping characteristics, respectively. A series of polarization&#8208;sensitive neuromorphic behaviors like polarization&#8208;perceptual excitatory postsynaptic current, multimode adjustable dichroic ratio and reconfigurable sensory adaption, are experimentally demonstrated through this porous heterojunction phototransistor. More importantly, with the polarization&#8211;electricity cooperation strategy, advanced polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation with strong bottom&#8208;gate control and environment dependence is successfully realized. These results represent a significant step toward the new generation of intelligent visual perception systems in autonomous navigation and human&#8211;machine interaction, etc.

         <title>Tailored Electronic Structure of Ir in High Entropy Alloy for Highly Active and Durable Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Water Splitting under an Acidic Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compositional engineering using the high entropy alloy (HEA) platform enables the design of an efficient and durable electrocatalyst. Mn incorporation in ZnNiCoIrMn induces redistribution of electron density around Ir, tailoring the cohesive energy of metal (Ecoh) and adsorption energy of oxygen species (&#8710;EO). The enhanced Ecoh and weakened &#8710;EO of Ir in ZnNiCoIrMn are responsible for the enhanced activity and durability of OER and HER under acidic conditions.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) requires an efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Ir&#8208;based electrocatalyst is designed using the high entropy alloy (HEA) platform of ZnNiCoIrX with two elements (X: Fe and Mn). A facile dealloying in the vacuum system enables the construction of a nanoporous structure with high crystallinity using Zn as a sacrificial element. Especially, Mn incorporation into HEAs tailors the electronic structure of the Ir site, resulting in the d&#8208;band center being far away from the Fermi level. Downshifting of the d&#8208;band center weakens the adsorption energy with reaction intermediates, which is beneficial for catalytic reactions. Despite low Ir content, ZnNiCoIrMn delivers only 50&#160;mV overpotential for HER at &#8722;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 237&#160;mV overpotential for the OER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, ZnNiCoIrMn shows almost constant voltage for the HER and OER for 100&#160;h and a high stability number of 3.4&#160;&#215;&#160;105 nhydrogen nIr&#8722;1 and 2.4&#160;&#215;&#160;105 noxygen nIr&#8722;1, demonstrating the exceptional durability of the HEA platform. The compositional engineering of ZnNiCoIrMn limits the diffusion of elements by high entropy effects and simultaneously tailors the electronic structure of active Ir sites, resulting in the modified cohesive and adsorption energies, all of which can suppress the dissolution of elements.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dual&#8208;Emitting Luminescence of a Spiropyran&#8208;Encapsulating Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Dynamic Information Encryption</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;emitting luminescent material ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP is obtained by encapsulating spiropyran molecules into a cadmium&#8208;based MOF,&#160;ZJU&#8208;128. ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP exhibits a switchable dynamic fluorescent behavior under alternating UV&#8208; and visible&#8208;light irradiation, enabling its good potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multiplexed coding.








Abstract
The development of photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials is essential to address emerging demands in encryption security. Here, a novel photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;emitting luminescent material ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP (SP = spiropyran) is reported, which is obtained by encapsulating spiropyran molecules into a cadmium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), [Cd3(TCPP)2]&#183;4DMF&#183;4H2O (ZJU&#8208;128, H4TCPP = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)pyrazine). This MOF/dye composite ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP exhibits a blue emission from the ligand of ZJU&#8208;128 at 447&#160;nm and a red emission around 650&#160;nm from spiropyran. Utilizing the photoisomerization of spiropyran from ring&#8208;closed to ring&#8208;open form under UV&#8208;light irradiation, significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process between ZJU&#8208;128 and spiropyran is achieved. As a result, the blue emission of ZJU&#8208;128 is gradually decreased while the red emission of spiropyran increases. This dynamic fluorescent&#160;behavior can fully recover to the original state following exposure to visible light (&gt;405&#160;nm). By taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent fluorescence, dynamical anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and multiplexed coding are successfully developed based on ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP film. This work provides an inspiring point for the design of information encryption materials with higher security requirements.

This MOF/dye composite &lt;b&gt;ZJU-128&#8835;SP&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a blue emission from the ligand of &lt;b&gt;ZJU-128&lt;/b&gt; at 447&#160;nm and a red emission around 650&#160;nm from spiropyran. Utilizing the photoisomerization of spiropyran from ring-closed to ring-open form under UV-light irradiation, significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process between &lt;b&gt;ZJU-128&lt;/b&gt; and spiropyran is achieved. As a result, the blue emission of &lt;b&gt;ZJU-128&lt;/b&gt; is gradually decreased while the red emission of spiropyran increases. This dynamic fluorescent&#160;behavior can fully recover to the original state following exposure to visible light (&amp;gt;405&#160;nm). By taking advantage of the time-dependent fluorescence, dynamical anti-counterfeiting patterns and multiplexed coding are successfully developed based on &lt;b&gt;ZJU-128&#8835;SP&lt;/b&gt; film. This work provides an inspiring point for the design of information encryption materials with higher security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bifunctional Carbazide Additive For Durable CsSnI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step annealing process&#160;was&#160;developed for high&#8208;performance CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The carbazide (CBZ) can slow down crystallization for dense coverage at 80&#160;&#176;C. After further annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C, the uncoordinated CBZ reduces Sn4+ to Sn2+ with few deep traps. The efficiency of CsSnI3:CBZ is 11.21%, which is the highest performance for CsSnI3&#8208;based PSCs to date.








Abstract
Inorganic CsSnI3 with low toxicity and a narrow bandgap is a promising photovoltaic material. However, the performance of CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is much lower than that of Pb&#8208;based and hybrid Sn&#8208;based (e.g., CsPbX3 and CH(NH2)2SnX3) PSCs, which may be attributed to its poor film&#8208;forming property and the deep traps induced by Sn4+. Here, a bifunctional additive carbazide (CBZ) is adapted to deposit a pinhole&#8208;free film and remove the deep traps via two&#8208;step annealing. The lone electrons of the &#63743;NH2 and &#63743;CO units in CBZ can coordinate with Sn2+ to form a dense film with large grains during the phase transition at 80&#160;&#176;C. The decomposition of CBZ can reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+ during annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C to remove the deep traps. Compared with the control device (4.12%), the maximum efficiency of the CsSnI3:CBZ PSC reaches 11.21%, which is the highest efficiency of CsSnI3 PSC reported to date. A certified efficiency of 10.90% is obtained by an independent photovoltaic testing laboratory. In addition, the unsealed CsSnI3:CBZ devices maintain initial efficiencies of &#8776;100%, 90%, and 80% under an inert atmosphere (60&#160;days), standard maximum power point tracking (650&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C), and ambient air (100&#160;h), respectively.

         <title>Tunable Interfacial Charge Transfer in a 2D&#8211;2D Composite for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The severe charge&#8208;transfer resistance and slow charge kinetics of pure Bi2MoO6 (BMO) limit the utilization of photogenerated carriers for CO2 conversion. In this work, an Ohmic contact with tunable interfacial resistance is constructed between bismuthene and BMO with oxygen vacancies, which can reduce the CO2 activation energy barrier, establish an efficient catalytic reaction system, and demonstrate unprecedented activity, and stability.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion for hydrocarbon fuel production has been known as one of the most promising strategies for achieving carbon neutrality. Yet, its conversion efficiency remains unsatisfactory mainly due to its severe charge&#8208;transfer resistance and slow charge kinetics. Herein, a tunable interfacial charge transfer on an oxygen&#8208;vacancies&#8208;modified bismuth molybdate nanoflower assembled by 2D nanosheets (BMOVs) and 2D bismuthene composite (Bi/BMOVs) is demonstrated for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Specifically, the meticulous design of the Ohmic contact formed between BMOVs and bismuthene can allow the modulation of the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer resistance. According to density functional theory (DFT) simulations, it is ascertained that such exceptional charge kinetics is attributed to the tunable built&#8208;in electric field (IEF) of the Ohmic contact. As such, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of the optimized Bi/BMOVs (CO and CH4 productions rate of 169.93 and 4.65&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively) is ca. 10 times higher than that of the pristine BMO (CO and CH4 production rates of 16.06 and 0.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively). The tunable interfacial resistance of the Ohmic contact reported in this work can shed some important light on the design of highly efficient photocatalysts for both energy and environmental applications.

         <title>A Liquid Triboelectric Series</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid triboelectric series is first established to describe the triboelectric properties of each liquid when contact electrification occurs with a solid surface. Common chemical groups can be derived that hydroxyl groups enhance, and benzene groups suppress the liquid triboelectric effect. This study may thus provide new perspectives on the applications of the liquid triboelectric effect.








Abstract
The triboelectric series is a generally accepted method for describing the triboelectric effect. It provides a way to control the double face of the ubiquitous triboelectric effect: causes of unpredictable accidents and the resultant surface charge as energy sources. However, previous studies have been biased in solids despite being observed in liquids (liquid&#8208;solid contact electrification). Therefore, a liquid triboelectric series is necessary to be established to manipulate the liquid triboelectric effect according to the appropriate goal. In this study, a liquid triboelectric series is first established to describe the triboelectric properties of each liquid when contact electrification occurs with a solid surface. The liquid triboelectric series covers electrolytes, organic solvents, oxidants, and higher sugar alcohols. Common chemical groups can be derived from the liquid triboelectric series that hydroxyl groups enhance, and benzene groups suppress the liquid triboelectric effect. The results are demonstrated by the amplified efficiency of an energy harvester and particle contamination after surface washing. This study will play a pivotal role in understanding the liquid&#8208;solid contact electrification phenomenon and providing new perspectives on the applications of the liquid triboelectric effect.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Copper Complex Enables Homogeneous Catalysis for High&#8208;Loading Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective catalysis based on metal complexes is proposed for optimizing liquid&#8208;involving reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Through size screening of the ligand, the CuL can selectively accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step of Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S on the premise of the catalytic efficiency of each step, thereby achieving long cycle lifespan under high sulfur loading and high current density.








Abstract
The practical viability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stipulates the use of a high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte. However, under such harsh conditions, the liquid&#8211;solid sulfur redox reaction is much retarded due to the poor sulfur and polysulfides utilization, leading to low capacity and fast fading. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled macrocyclic Cu(II) complex (CuL) is designed as an effective catalyst to homogenize and maximize the liquid&#8208;involving reaction. The Cu(II) ion coordinated with four N atoms features a planar dsp2${\mathrm{d}}_{{\mathrm{sp}}^{2}}$ hybridization, showing a strong bonding affinity toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) along the dz2${\mathrm{d}}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital via steric effects. Such a structure not only lowers the energy barrier of the liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2S4 to Li2S2) but also guides a 3D deposition of Li2S2/Li2S. As such, with a 1&#160;wt% electrolyte additive of CuL, a high initial capacity of 925&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and areal capacity of 9.62&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a low decay of 0.3%/cycle can be achieved under a high sulfur loading of 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L&#160;mgs&#8722;1. This work is expected to inspire the design of homogenous catalysts and accelerate the uptake of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries.

     alt="Self-Assembled Macrocyclic Copper Complex Enables Homogeneous Catalysis for High-Loading Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective catalysis based on metal complexes is proposed for optimizing liquid-involving reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Through size screening of the ligand, the CuL can selectively accelerate the rate-limiting step of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S on the premise of the catalytic efficiency of each step, thereby achieving long cycle lifespan under high sulfur loading and high current density.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical viability of high-energy-density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stipulates the use of a high-loading cathode and lean electrolyte. However, under such harsh conditions, the liquid&#8211;solid sulfur redox reaction is much retarded due to the poor sulfur and polysulfides utilization, leading to low capacity and fast fading. Herein, a self-assembled macrocyclic Cu(II) complex (CuL) is designed as an effective catalyst to homogenize and maximize the liquid-involving reaction. The Cu(II) ion coordinated with four N atoms features a planar dsp2${\mathrm{d}}_{{\mathrm{sp}}^{2}}$ hybridization, showing a strong bonding affinity toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) along the dz2${\mathrm{d}}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital via steric effects. Such a structure not only lowers the energy barrier of the liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) but also guides a 3D deposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. As such, with a 1&#160;wt% electrolyte additive of CuL, a high initial capacity of 925&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and areal capacity of 9.62&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a low decay of 0.3%/cycle can be achieved under a high sulfur loading of 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L&#160;mg&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work is expected to inspire the design of homogenous catalysts and accelerate the uptake of high-energy-density Li&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Soft Composite Network with Unprecedented Crack Propagation Resistance Enabled by a Supramolecular Assembled Lamellar Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catastrophic failure of soft self&#8208;healing materials often derives from its low&#8208;energy primary network structure susceptible to fatigue crack propagation. In this work, a biomimetic strategy of introducing high&#8208;energy preferentially aligned lamellar structure into highly dynamic and superstretchable poly(urea&#8208;urethane) is proposed, successfully surpassing the notorious trade&#8208;off between soft self&#8208;healing, high fracture toughness, and fatigue resistance.








Abstract
Soft self&#8208;healing materials are compelling candidates for stretchable devices because of their excellent compliance, extensibility, and self&#8208;restorability. However, most existing soft self&#8208;healing polymers suffer from crack propagation and irreversible fatigue failure due to easy breakage of their dynamic amorphous, low&#8208;energy polymer networks. Herein, inspired by distinct structure&#8211;property relationship of biological tissues, a supramolecular interfacial assembly strategy of preparing soft self&#8208;healing composites with unprecedented crack propagation resistance is proposed by structurally engineering preferentially aligned lamellar structures within a dynamic and superstretchable poly(urea&#8208;ureathane) matrix (which is elongated to 24 750&#215; its original length). Such a design affords a world&#8208;record fracture energy (501.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), ultrahigh fatigue threshold (4064.1 J m&#8722;2), and outstanding elastic restorability (dimensional recovery from 13 times elongation), and preserving low modulus (1.2&#160;MPa), high stretchability (3200%), and high room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing efficiency (97%). Thereby, the resultant composite represents the best of its kind and even surpasses most biological tissues. The lamellar 2D transition&#8208;metal carbide/carbonitride (MXene) structure also leads to a relatively high in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, enabling composites as stretchable thermoconductive skins applied in joints of robotics to thermal dissipation. The present work illustrates a viable approach how autonomous self&#8208;healing, crack tolerance, and fatigue resistance can be merged in future material design.

         <title>Toughening Double&#8208;Network Hydrogels by Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The employment of the Hoffmeister effect to toughen double&#8208;network hydrogels and broadly tune the mechanical properties using polyelectrolytes is reported. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister&#8208;effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can inhibit hernia formation and accelerate the healing of abdominal wall defects in vivo.








Abstract
The Hoffmeister effect of inorganic salts is verified as a promising way to toughen hydrogels, however, the high concentration of inorganic salts may be accompanied by poor biocompatibility. In this work, it is found that polyelectrolytes can obviously elevate the mechanical performances of hydrogels through the Hoffmeister effect. The introduction of anionic poly(sodium acrylate) into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel induces the aggregation and crystallization of the PVA to boost the mechanical properties of the resulting double&#8208;network hydrogel: elevation of 73, 64, 28, 135, and 19 times in the tensile strength, compressive strength, Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture energy compared with poly(acrylic acid), respectively. It is noteworthy that the mechanical performances of the hydrogels can be flexibly tuned by the variation of polyelectrolyte concentration, ionization degree, relative hydrophobicity of the ionic component, and polyelectrolyte type in a wide range. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister&#8208;effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. Also, the introduction of urea bonds into the polyelectrolyte can further improve the mechanical properties and antiswelling capability of hydrogels. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can efficiently inhibit hernia formation and promote the regeneration of soft tissues in an abdominal wall defect model.

Liquid Triboelectric Series
A triboelectric series is a generally accepted method for describing the triboelectric effect. A liquid triboelectric series is required such that the liquid triboelectric effect can be manipulated. In article 2300699, Dongwhi Choi, Dong Sung Kim, and co&#8208;workers report a liquid triboelectric series to describe the triboelectric properties of each liquid when contact electrification occurs with a solid surface, which covers electrolytes, organic solvents, oxidants, and higher and sugar alcohols. Common chemical groups can be derived where hydroxyl groups enhance, and benzene groups suppress, the liquid triboelectric effect. This study thus provides new perspectives toward applications of the liquid triboelectric effect.

From Random to Deterministic Coupling
In article number 2210667, Minho Choi, Jin Dong Song, Young&#8208;Ho Ko, Yong&#8208;Hoon Cho, and co&#8208;workers use a non&#8208;destructive nanoscale focus pin&#8208;spot method to select an array of single quantum dots from randomly distributed ensembles. Since the selected quantum dots are located at predetermined positions, they can be deterministically coupled with photonic structures and exhibit high collection efficiency.

Soft Robotics
In article number 2300535, Robert Baines, Rebecca Kramer&#8208;Bottiglio, and co&#8208;workers report an inverse design method to realize inflatables that match diverse 3D target curves. The method estimates the geometry and location of stiffer material patches that, when applied to an inflatable's surface, program curvature and torsion along its length. Examples of new and complex robotic manipulation functionality enabled by the inverse method are demonstrated.

Cuprate Superconductors
In article number 2301021, Dongsheng Song, Ning Hao, Binghui Ge, and co&#8208;workers show how the carbon atoms in the oxycarbonate superconductor (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; replace Cu atoms in charge&#8208;reservoir layers, contributing to the formation of triangular carbonates through strong orbital hybridization with the surrounding oxygen. The introduction of carbon atoms not only reduces the number of oxygen atoms and thus decreases the number of charge carriers in the charge&#8208;reservoir layers, but also heavily increases the O&#8211;Cu&#8211;O bond angle and improves the flatness of the superconducting CuO2 layers, revealing an unexpectedly competitive mechanism of superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors.

Phonon&#8208;Engineered Thermoelectricity
In article 2209779, Mahmoud I. Hussein, Kris A. Bertness, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a reduction in the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of semiconductor membranes by coupling heat&#8208;carrying phonons to the localized phonon resonances emerging from deposited nanopillars. This full&#8208;spectrum resonance&#8211;hybridization mechanism decouples the electrical and thermal properties, paving the way for novel thermoelectric materials. The experimental results are a manifestation of nanophononic metamaterial effects previously shown by theory and simulations.

         <title>Surface Optics and Color Effects of Liquid Metal Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals are a kind of low&#8208;melting&#8208;point alloys, usually appearing silvery&#8208;white. Colorful liquid metals can be prepared by different strategies, including the coating and compounding, physical vapor deposition/chemical vapor deposition, structural color, external stimuli, and fluorescence functionalization. The color and fluorescence functionalization of liquid metals have broken through the limitations of the conventional single&#8208;color physical appearance, and opened significant potential for emerging applications in numerous fields owing to their rich colors and unique liquid structure.








Abstract
Liquid metals (LMs) are emerging as new functional materials with rather unique physical or chemical behaviors. They are generally safe and nontoxic, have high boiling points, reflectivities, good thermal and electrical conductivities, flexibility, fluidity, self&#8208;healing capability and remain in liquid state at room temperature. However, the further applications of LMs are limited by their single&#8208;color physical appearance, such as working in the situations with imposed stringent requirements for color and aesthetics. Recently, the color and fluorescence functionalization of LMs have overcome many conventional technical bottlenecks and opened significant potential for emerging applications in numerous fields owing to their rich colors and unique liquid structure. In this review, the recent developments in the optical properties, color and fluorescence effects of LMs are comprehensively investigated. The synthesis, structures, properties, chromogenic mechanisms, and potential photoelectric applications of colorful LMs are systematically analyzed and compared. The effectiveness and characteristics of colorful LMs induced by coating, mixing, compounding, surface modification, external stimuli are provided, aiming to establish a potential system for the synthesis and practices of colorful LMs. Finally, the challenges and prospects in the field have also been identified and explained to preferably guide further scientific and technical research in the coming time.

         <title>Progress of Microfluidic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Scaffolds and Organ&#8208;on&#8208;Chips for the Cartilage Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels are among the most promising options employed for cartilage repair. Subsequent to analyzing different types of hydrogels, microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds are selected due to displaying superior characteristics compared to their counterparts. The application of microfluidic chips, known as organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips, is also investigated in the cartilage tissue engineering.








Abstract
Cartilage degeneration is among the fundamental reasons behind disability and pain across the globe. Numerous approaches have been employed to treat cartilage diseases. Nevertheless, none have shown acceptable outcomes in the long run.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogels are among the most promising options employed for cartilage repair. Subsequent to analyzing different types of hydrogels, microfluidic hydrogel-based scaffolds are selected due to displaying superior characteristics compared to their counterparts. The application of microfluidic chips, known as organ-on-chips, is also investigated in the cartilage tissue engineering.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartilage degeneration is among the fundamental reasons behind disability and pain across the globe. Numerous approaches have been employed to treat cartilage diseases. Nevertheless, none have shown acceptable outcomes in the long run. In this regard, the convergence of tissue engineering and microfabrication principles can allow developing more advanced microfluidic technologies, thus offering attractive alternatives to current treatments and traditional constructs used in tissue engineering applications. Herein, the current developments involving microfluidic hydrogel-based scaffolds, promising structures for cartilage regeneration, ranging from hydrogels with microfluidic channels to hydrogels prepared by the microfluidic devices, that enable therapeutic delivery of cells, drugs, and growth factors, as well as cartilage-related organ-on-chips are reviewed. Thereafter, cartilage anatomy and types of damages, and present treatment options are briefly overviewed. Various hydrogels are introduced, and the advantages of microfluidic hydrogel-based scaffolds over traditional hydrogels are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, available technologies for fabricating microfluidic hydrogel-based scaffolds and microfluidic chips are presented. The preclinical and clinical applications of microfluidic hydrogel-based scaffolds in cartilage regeneration and the development of cartilage-related microfluidic chips over time are further explained.

         <title>Toward Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction: Longstanding Debates and Emerging Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 26, June 28, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intense debates, recent developments, and limitations of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are summarized,&#160;regarding the catalytic mechanism, evaluation criteria, and advanced electrocatalysts. Perspectives on the mechanisms study and electrocatalysts design are also proposed. This review will guide directions for boosting the understanding of catalytic mechanism and exploring efficient electrocatalysts for MOR.








Abstract
The study of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) has lasted around 70 years, since the first investigation in the early 1950s. Though enormous effort has been devoted in this field, it is still far from commercialization. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), as a semi&#8208;reaction of DMFCs, is the bottleneck reaction that restricts the overall performance of DMFCs. To date, there has been&#160;intense debate on the complex six&#8208;electron reaction, but barely any reviews have systematically discussed this topic. To this end, the controversies and progress regarding the electrocatalytic mechanisms, performance evaluations as well as the design science toward MOR electrocatalysts are summarized. This review also provides a comprehensive introduction on the recent development of emerging MOR electrocatalysts with a focus on the innovation of the alloy, core&#8211;shell structure, heterostructure, and single&#8208;atom catalysts. Finally, perspectives on the future outlook toward study of the mechanisms and design of electrocatalysts are provided.

         <title>Ferroelectric Switching at Symmetry&#8208;Broken Interfaces by Local Control of Dislocations Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconducting ferroelectric materials with low energy polarisation switching offer a platform for next&#8208;generation electronics such as ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors. Recently discovered interfacial ferroelectricity in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenide films provide an opportunity to combine the potential of semiconducting ferroelectrics with the design flexibility of two&#8208;dimensional material devices. Here, local control of ferroelectric domains in a marginally twisted WS2 bilayer is demonstrated with a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature, and their observed reversible evolution understood using a string&#8208;like model of the domain wall network (DWN). We identify two characteristic regimes of DWN evolution: (i) elastic bending of partial screw dislocations separating smaller domains with twin stackings due to mutual sliding of monolayers at domain boundaries and (ii) merging of primary domain walls into perfect screw dislocations, which become the seeds for the recovery of the initial domain structure upon reversing electric field. These results open the possibility to achieve full control over atomically thin semiconducting ferroelectric domains using local electric fields, which is a critical step towards their technological use.

         <title>Closed&#8208;loop Error Correction Learning Accelerates Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The exploration of thermoelectric materials is challenging considering the large materials space, combined with added exponential degrees of freedom coming from doping and the diversity of synthetic pathways. Here we seek to incorporate historical data and update it using experimental feedback by employing error&#8208;correction learning (ECL). We thus learn from prior datasets and then adapt the model to differences in synthesis and characterization that are otherwise difficult to parameterize. We then apply this strategy to discovering thermoelectric materials, where we prioritize synthesis at temperatures &lt; 300&#9675;C. We document a previously&#8208;unexplored chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, finding that the best candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power factor more than 2x that of PbSe. The investigations herein reveal that a closed&#8208;loop experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an optimized material by a factor as high as 3x compared to high&#8208;throughput searches powered by state&#8208;of&#8208;art machine learning (ML) models. We also observe that this improvement is dependent on the accuracy of the ML model in a manner that exhibits diminishing returns: once a certain accuracy is reached, factors that are instead associated with experimental pathways begin to dominate trends.

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, like cartilage, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. The controlled combination of supramolecular fibers and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet could provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix in many native tissues. A benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based hydrogelator was developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles, which self&#8208;assembled across multiple length scales to form a fibrillar and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils, we fine&#8208;tuned the mechanical properties such as toughness, stiffness, and strength of the hydrogels by covalent intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;fiber cross&#8208;links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstood up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The norbornene BTA hydrogels were shear&#8208;thinning and could be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and the fabricated structures were further toughened by introducing covalent cross&#8208;linking. These materials enabled the bioprinting of hMSC spheroids and differentiation/maturation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, our findings highlight that the conjunction of self&#8208;assembly and covalent cross&#8208;linking of supramolecular fibers offers a potentially powerful strategy for the bottom&#8208;up design of dynamic, yet tough, synthetic hydrogels and bioinks.

         <title>Overcoming Water Diffusion Limitations in Hydrogels Via Microtubular Graphene Networks for Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap of rigid machines interacting with soft matter. However, while stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can undergo extreme reversible volume changes of up to &#8764;90%, water transport in hydrogel actuators is in general limited by their poroelastic behavior. For poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) the actuation performance is even further compromised by the formation of a dense skin layer. Here we show, that incorporating a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix with a total porosity of only 5.4&#160;% dramatically enhances actuation dynamics by up to &#8764;400&#160;% and actuation stress by &#8764;4000&#160;% without sacrificing the mechanical stability, overcoming the water transport limitations. The graphene network provides both untethered light&#8208;controlled and electrically&#8208;powered actuation. We anticipate that the concept provides a versatile platform for enhancing the functionality of soft matter by combining responsive and two&#8208;dimensional materials, paving the way towards designing soft intelligent matter.

         <title>Unique Chirality Selection in Neural Cells for D&#8208;Matrix Enabling Specific Manipulation of Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manipulating neural cell behaviors is a critical issue to various therapies for neurological diseases and damages, where matrix chirality has long been overlooked despite the proven adhesion and proliferation improvement of multiple non&#8208;neural cells by L&#8208;matrixes. Here we report that the D&#8208;matrix chirality specifically enhances the cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival in four different types of neural cells, contrasting its inhibition in non&#8208;neural cells. This universal impact on neural cells is defined as &#8220;chirality selection for D&#8208;matrix&#8221; and is achieved through the activation of JNK &amp; p38/MAPK signaling pathways by the cellular tension relaxation resulting from the weak interaction between D&#8208;matrix and cytoskeleton proteins, particularly actin. Also, D&#8208;matrix promotes sciatic nerve repair effectively, both with or without non&#8208;neural stem cell implantation, by improving the population, function, and myelination of autologous Schwann cells. D&#8208;matrix chirality, as a simple, safe, and effective microenvironment cue to specifically and universally manipulate neural cell behaviors, holds extensive application potential in addressing neurological issues, such as nerve regeneration, neurodegenerative disease treatment, neural tumor targeting, and neurodevelopment.

         <title>Single&#8208;atom Anchored Curved Carbon Surface for Efficient CO2 Electro&#8208;reduction with Nearly 100% Co Selectivity And Industrially&#8208;relevant Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although single metal atoms on porous carbons (PCs) have been widely used in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, these systems have long relied on flat graphene&#8208;based models, which are far beyond reality because of abundant curved structures in PCs, the effect of curved surface has long been ignored. In addition, the selectivity generally decreases under high current density, which severely limits practical application. Herein, the theoretical calculations reveal that the single&#8208;Ni&#8208;atom on curved surface can simultaneously enhance the total density of states around Fermi level and decrease the energy barrier for *COOH formation, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. We report a rational molten salt approach for preparing PCs with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area of up to 2635 m2 g&#8722;1. As determined by cutting&#8208;edge techniques, single&#8208;Ni&#8208;atom on curved carbon surface is obtained and used as catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The CO selectivity reaches up to 99.8% under industrial&#8208;level current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PC&#8208;based catalysts. Not only this work offers a new method for the rational synthesis of single atom catalysts with strained geometry to host rich active sites, but also provides in&#8208;depth insights for the origin of catalytic activity of curved structure&#8208;enriched PC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Coplanar Conformational Structure of &#928;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hierarchical structure of conjugated polymers is critical to dominating their optoelectronic properties and applications. Compared to non&#8208;planar conformational segments, coplanar conformational segments of conjugated polymers (CPs) demonstrate favorable properties for applications as a semiconductor. Herein, we will summarize recent developments in the coplanar conformational structure of CPs for optoelectronic devices. First, this review comprehensively summarizes the unique properties of planar conformational structures. Second, we emphasize the characteristics of the coplanar conformation in terms of optoelectrical properties and other polymer physics characteristics. Five primary characterization methods for investigating the complanate backbone structures are illustrated, providing a systematical toolbox for studying this specific conformation. Third, internal and external conditions for inducing the coplanar conformational structure are presented, offering guidelines for designing this conformation. Fourth, the optoelectronic applications of this segment, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are briefly summarized. Finally, we provide a conclusion and outlook for the coplanar conformational segment regarding molecular design and applications.

         <title>A Transformable Mucoadhesive Microgel Network for Noninvasive Multimodal Imaging And Radioprotection of A Large Area of The Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The lack of noninvasive imaging and modulation of a large area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract constrains the diagnosis and treatment of many GI&#8208;related diseases. Recent advances use novel mucoadhesive materials to coat a part of the GI tract and then modulate its functions. The high mucoadhesion is the key factor of the partial coating, but also the limitation for not spreading and covering the lower GI tract. Here, we&#160;screened and engineered a bismuth&#8208;pectin organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid complex into a transformable microgel network (Bi&#8208;GLUE) with high flowability and mucoadhesion that can quickly transit through and coat a large area of the GI tract. In murine and porcine models, Bi&#8208;GLUE delivered contrast agents to achieve real&#8208;time, large&#8208;area GI tract imaging under X&#8208;ray or MR modalities and facilitated the non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, Bi&#8208;GLUE, like an intracorporal radiation shield, decreases the radiotoxicity in a whole&#8208;abdomen irradiation rat model. This transformable microgel network offers a new direction that can modulate a large area of the GI tract and may have broad applications for GI&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Photoelectron &#8220;bridge&#8221; in Van Der Waals Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Constructing Van der Waals heterojunction is a crucial strategy to achieve excellent photocatalytic activity. However, in most Van der Walls heterojunctions synthesized by ex&#8208;situ assembly, electron transfer encounters huge hindrances at the interface between the two components due to the large spacing and potential barrier. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;bridged Van der Waals heterojunction of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/tungsten disulfide (WS2) bridged by phosphate (xCoPc&#8208;nPO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2) was designed and prepared by traditional wet chemistry method. By introducing a small phosphate molecule into the interface of CoPc and WS2, creates an electron &#8220;bridge&#8221;, resulting in a compact combination and eliminating the space barrier. Therefore, the phosphate (PO4&#8722;) bridge can serve as an efficient electron transfer channel in heterojunction can high efficiently transmit photoelectrons from WS2 to CoPc under excited states. These excited photoelectrons are captured by the catalytic central Co2+ in CoPc and subsequently convert CO2 molecules into CO and CH4 products, achieving 17&#8208;fold enhancement on the 3CoPc&#8208;0.6PO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2 sample compared to that of pure WS2. Introducing a small molecule &#8220;bridge&#8221; to create an electron transfer channel provides a new perspective in designing efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into valuable products.

         <title>Integrating Enrichment, Reduction And Oxidation Sites in One System for Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging but promising way to realize carbon&#8208;resources recycling utilization. Herein, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation sites was designed for diluted CO2 reduction. A Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF) with oxidation and reductive sites was synthesized, then ionic liquids (ILs) were loaded into the pores. As a result, [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF shows a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 105.88 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere, even superior than most photocatalysts in high concentrations CO2. Moreover, natural sunlight driven diluted CO2 reduction rate also reached 126.51 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1 in 5&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the triazine ring in Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF promotes the activity of H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction sites, and the loaded ILs provide an enriched CO2 atmosphere, realizing the efficient photocatalytic activity in diluted CO2 reduction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging but promising way to realize carbon-resources recycling utilization. Herein, a three-in-one photocatalytic system of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation sites was designed for diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. A Zn-Salen-based covalent organic framework (Zn-S-COF) with oxidation and reductive sites was synthesized, then ionic liquids (ILs) were loaded into the pores. As a result, [Emim]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Zn-S-COF shows a visible-light-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion rate of 105.88 &#956;mol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under diluted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (15%) atmosphere, even superior than most photocatalysts in high concentrations CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Abstract
The prognosis in cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with current treatment modalities is poor owing to the highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8208;doxorubicin nanoparticle system (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) that can be orally administered, is developed for targeted PDAC therapy. Following oral administration in PDAC&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs actively target/transpass microfold cells, overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier, and then undergo subsequent phagocytosis by endogenous macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; transit through the intestinal lymphatic system and enter systemic circulation, ultimately accumulating in the tumor tissue as a result of the tumor&#8208;homing and &#8220;stealth&#8221; properties that are conferred by endogenous M&#981;. Meanwhile, the M&#981; that hitchhike &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs are activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases, destroying the desmoplastic stromal barrier, and differentiated toward the M1&#8208;like phenotype, modulating the TME and recruiting effector T cells, ultimately inducing the apoptosis of the tumor cells. The combination of &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;&#160;and immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits the growth of the primary tumor and suppresses the development of metastasis. It thus represents an appealing approach to targeted PDAC therapy.

         <title>Coal&#8208;Based Carbon Nanomaterials: En Route to Clean Coal Conversion toward Net Zero CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coal has been used for hundreds of years for power and heat generation through combustion, along with the unfortunate release of the huge amount of CO2, SO2, and NO emissions. Nanotechnology may provide an avenue for large&#8208;scale coal use to create new materials, thereby mitigating the need to burn coal.








Abstract
As the world is committed to reach carbon peak by 2030 and net zero by 2050, the use of coal as an energy source is facing unprecedented challenges. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global annual coal demand is estimated to drop from more than 5640 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2021 to 540 Mtce in 2050 under the net zero emission scenario, mostly being replaced by renewable energy such as solar and wind. Therefore, the coal industry is vigorously seeking alternative applications to keep it thriving, and nanotechnology can be one of the contributors. Herein, the challenges to coal&#8208;based carbon nanomaterials syntheses are outlined, along with a path toward commercialization. Coal&#8208;based carbon nanomaterials can be promising contributors to the concept of clean coal conversion, initiating its migration from an energy source to a high&#8208;value&#8208;added carbon source.

         <title>Atomic Insights into the Cu Species Supported on Zeolite for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol via Low&#8208;Damage HAADF&#8208;STEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;damage HAADF&#8208;STEM imaging technique is employed for direct visualization and determination of Cu species in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite frameworks. The structure of the Cu species are revealed based on the microscopy evidence and also proved by the complementary spectroscopy results. The mono&#8208;Cu species stably anchored by Al pairs inside the zeolite channels are identified as the key structure for higher C1 oxygenates yield and methanol selectivity for direct oxidation of methane.








Abstract
Precise determination of the structure&#8208;property relationship of zeolite&#8208;based metal catalysts is critical for the development toward practical applications. However, the scarcity of real&#8208;space imaging of zeolite&#8208;based low&#8208;atomic&#8208;number (LAN) metal materials due to the electron&#8208;beam sensitivity of zeolites has led to continuous debates regarding the exact LAN metal configurations. Here, a low&#8208;damage high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) imaging technique is employed for direct visualization and determination of LAN metal (Cu) species in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite frameworks. The structures of the Cu species are revealed based on the microscopy evidence and also proved by the complementary spectroscopy results. The correlation between the characteristic Cu size in Cu/ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts and their direct oxidation of methane to methanol reaction properties is unveiled. As a result, the mono&#8208;Cu species stably anchored by Al pairs inside the zeolite channels are identified as the key structure for higher C1 oxygenates yield and methanol selectivity for direct oxidation of methane. Meanwhile, the local topological flexibility of the rigid zeolite frameworks induced by the Cu agglomeration in the channels is also revealed. This work exemplifies the combination of microscopy imaging and spectroscopy characterization serves as a complete arsenal for revealing structure&#8208;property relationships of the supported metal&#8208;zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Highly Efficient Inherent Linearly Polarized Electroluminescence from Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient inherent linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diode (LP&#8208;LED) is constructed based on 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) single crystals (SCs) with an in&#8208;plane anisotropic property. The LP&#8208;LED exhibits excellent device performance with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.38% and degree of polarization (DOP) up to 0.74. Further, an interchip polarized optical communication system is demonstrated based on the LP&#8208;LED.








Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule organic single crystals (SCs) with an inherent in&#8208;plane anisotropic nature enable direct linearly polarized light emission without the need for spatially separated polarizers and complex optical structures. However, the device performance is severely restricted by the starvation of appropriate SC emitters and the difficulty in the construction of efficient SC electroluminescence (EL) devices, leading to a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) of usually smaller than 1.5%. Here, highly efficient inherent linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (LP&#8208;LEDs) are demonstrated by exploiting 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) SCs as intrinsically polarized emitters. The LP&#8208;LEDs exhibit a 2.5&#8208;fold enhanced maximum EQE of 3.38%, which approaches the theoretical limit for the DPA SC&#8208;based EL device and is the highest among organic SC&#8208;based LEDs reported thus far. More importantly, a high degree of polarization (DOP) up to 0.74 is achieved for the intrinsically polarized EL emission of the DPA SC&#8208;based LP&#8208;LEDs. By leveraging the highly efficient LP&#8208;LED, an interchip polarized optical communication system consisting of organic SCs is demonstrated for the first time. This work creates a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast new library of small&#8208;molecule organic SCs for LP&#8208;LEDs and carries broad implications for polarized optics and relevant optoelectronic devices.

This work creates a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast new library of small-molecule organic SCs for LP-LEDs and carries broad implications for polarized optics and relevant optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Scale BN&#8208;perovskite Nanocomposite Aerogel Scintillator for Thermal Neutron Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large scale, long time stability, ultra&#8208;low density, and strong radiation hardness BN&#8208;CsPbBr3 nanocomposite aerogel scintillators are obtained with high nanocrystal loading that are highly transparent to visible photons. These nanocomposite scintillating materials provide the new thermal neutron detection mechanism, and offer the weakest X(&#611;)&#8208;ray response and totally different, time&#8208;resolved response pulses.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thermal neutron scintillation detectors rely on rare isotopes for neutron capture, lack stability and scalability of solid&#8208;state scintillation devices, and poorly discriminate between the neutron and gamma rays. The boron nitride (BN)&#8208;CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocomposite aerogel scintillator enables discriminative detection of thermal neutrons, features the largest known size (9&#160;cm across), the lowest density (0.17&#160;g&#160;cm&#8722;3) among the existing scintillation materials, high BN (50%) perovskite (1%) contents, high optical transparency (85%), and excellent radiation stability. The new detection mechanism relies on thermal neutron capture by 10B and effective energy transfer from the charged particles to visible&#8208;range scintillation photons between the densely packed BN and CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Low density minimizes the gamma ray response. The neutrons and gamma rays are discriminated by complete decoupling of the respective single pulses in time and intensity. These outcomes open new avenues for neutron detection in resource exploration, clean energy, environmental, aerospace, and homeland security applications.

         <title>Recruiting T&#8208;Cells toward the Brain for Enhanced Glioblastoma Immunotherapeutic Efficacy by Co&#8208;Delivery of Cytokines and Immune Checkpoint Antibodies with Macrophage&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Nanovesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanovesicles with a macrophage&#8208;mimicking membrane, co&#8208;delivering chemoattractant CXCL10 and immune checkpoint inhibitor aPD&#8208;L1 to orthotopic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are developed to pre&#8208;activate the immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy efficacy. This work provides a paradigm for GBM immunotherapy that enhances brain accumulation of aPD&#8208;L1 and avoids the negative impact of the immunosuppressive microenvironment of malignant tumors.








Abstract
Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) shows promising prospects for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) but with restricted results, mainly attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the limited antibody permeability of the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) in GBM. Here, nanovesicles with a&#160;macrophage&#8208;mimicking membrane are described, that co&#8208;deliver&#160;chemotactic CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), to pre&#8208;activate the immune microenvironment, and anti&#8208;programmed death ligand 1 antibody (aPD&#8208;L1), to interrupt the immune checkpoint, aiming to enhance the effect of GBM immunotherapy. Consequently, the tumor tropism of the macrophage membrane and the receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis of the angiopep&#8208;2 peptide allow&#160;the nanovesicle to effectively cross the BTB and target the GBM region, with 19.75&#8208;fold higher accumulation of antibodies compared to the free aPD&#8208;L1 group. The CPI therapeutic efficacy is greatly enhanced by CXCL10&#8208;induced T&#8208;cells recruitment with significant expansion of CD8+ T&#8208;cells and effector memory T&#8208;cells, leading to the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time, and long&#8208;term immune memory in orthotopic GBM mice. The nanovesicles, that relieve the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by CXCL10 to enhance aPD&#8208;L1 efficacy, may present a promising strategy for brain&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

A hydrophobic all&#8208;organic salt is reported to modify the top surface of large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free halide perovskite layers to achieve an active area efficiency of 19.28% (58.5&#160;cm2) with the retention of &#8776;80% efficiency after 7500&#160;h (313 days).








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is now over 19%, but issues with their stability persist owing to significant intrinsic point defects and a mass of surface imperfections introduced during the fabrication process. Herein, the utilization of a hydrophobic all&#8208;organic salt is reported to modify the top surface of large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free halide perovskite layers. Bearing two molecules, each of which is endowed with anchoring groups capable of exhibiting secondary interactions with the perovskite surfaces, the organic salt acts as a molecular lock by effectively binding to both anion and cation vacancies, substantially enhancing the materials&#8217; intrinsic stability against different stimuli. It not only reduces the ingression of external species such as oxygen and moisture, but also suppresses the egress of volatile organic components during the thermal stability testing. The treated PSCs demonstrate efficiency of 19.28% (active area of 58.5&#160;cm2) and 17.62% (aperture area of 64&#160;cm2) for the corresponding mini&#8208;module. More importantly, unencapsulated slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated mini&#8208;modules incorporating the all&#8208;organic surface modifier show &#8776;80% efficiency retention after 7500&#160;h (313 days) of storage under 30% relative humidity (RH). They also remarkably retain more than 90% of the initial efficiency for over 850&#160;h while being measured continuously.

         <title>Programmably Controllable Delivery of Metastable Ferrous Ions for Multiscale Dynamic Imaging Guided Photothermal Primed Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmably controllable delivery system based on croconium dye (Croc)&#8211;ferrous ion (Fe2+) nanoprobes (CFNPs) is developed for multiscale dynamic imaging guided photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy. The complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe2+ is sketched in a programmably controllable manner, and the domino effect of the tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and chemodynamic therapy is revealed.








Abstract
Metallomodulation cell death strategies are extensively investigated for antitumor therapy, such as cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Undoubtedly, the accurate and specific elevation of metal ions levels in cancer cells is key to boosting their&#160;therapeutic index. Herein, a programmably controllable delivery system based on croconium dye (Croc)&#8211;ferrous ion (Fe2+) nanoprobes (CFNPs) is developed for multiscale dynamic imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The Croc, with kinds of electron&#8208;rich iron&#8208;chelating groups, can form the Croc&#8211;Fe2+ complex with a precise stoichiometry of 1:1 to steadily maintain the valence state of Fe2+. The CFNPs can achieve pH&#8208;responsive visualization and accurate Fe2+ release in cancerous tissues under the coactivation of &#8220;dual&#8208;key&#8221; stimulation of &#8220;acidity and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8221;. The acidic tumor microenvironment actuates NIR fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and photothermal properties of CFNPs. Sequentially, under exogenous NIR light, the CFNPs enable in vivo accurate visualization of Croc&#8211;Fe2+ complex delivery for photothermal primed Fe2+ release, thus achieving CDT of tumors. By leveraging multiscale dynamic imaging technologies, the complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe2+ is sketched in a programmably controllable manner, and the domino effect of tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and CDT is also revealed, endowing customized feedback of the therapeutic panorama within the disease microenvironment.

Sequentially, under exogenous NIR light, the CFNPs enable in vivo accurate visualization of Croc&#8211;Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex delivery for photothermal primed Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release, thus achieving CDT of tumors. By leveraging multiscale dynamic imaging technologies, the complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is sketched in a programmably controllable manner, and the domino effect of tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and CDT is also revealed, endowing customized feedback of the therapeutic panorama within the disease microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Chameleon Carriers for Nucleic Acid Delivery: The Sweet Spot between Lipoplexes and Polyplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double pH&#8208;responsive lipo amino fatty acid carriers consist of cationizable polar aminoethylene motifs and at least two cationizable apolar lipidic units, containing a central tertiary amine that disrupts the hydrophobic character once protonated. The carriers form stable lipopolyplexes and mediate efficient in vitro and in vivo nucleic acid transfer, benefitting from pH&#8208;dependent structural changes for dynamic cargo delivery and release.








Abstract
Taking advantage of effective intracellular delivery mechanisms of both cationizable lipids and polymers, highly potent double pH&#8208;responsive nucleic acid carriers are generated by combining at least two lipo amino fatty acids (LAFs) as hydrophobic cationizable motifs with hydrophilic cationizable aminoethylene units into novel sequence&#8208;defined molecules. The pH&#8208;dependent tunable polarity of the LAF is successfully implemented by inserting a central tertiary amine, which disrupts the hydrophobic character once protonated, resulting in pH&#8208;dependent structural and physical changes. This &#8220;molecular chameleon character&#8221; turns out to be advantageous for dynamic nucleic acid delivery via lipopolyplexes. By screening different topologies (blocks, bundles, T&#8208;shapes, U&#8208;shapes), LAF types, and LAF/aminoethylene ratios, highly potent pDNA, mRNA, and siRNA carriers are identified, which are up to several 100&#8208;fold more efficient than previous carrier generations and characterized by very fast transfection kinetics. mRNA lipopolyplexes maintain high transfection activity in cell culture even in the presence of &#8805;90% serum at an ultra&#8208;low mRNA dose of 3 picogram (&#8776;2 nanoparticles/cell), and thus are comparable in potency to viral nanoparticles. Importantly, they show great in vivo performance with high expression levels especially in spleen, tumor, lungs, and liver upon intravenous administration of 1&#8211;3&#160;&#181;g luciferase&#8208;encoding mRNA in mice.

         <title>Nematic Fibrin Fibers Enabling Vascularized Thrombus Implants Facilitate Scarless Cutaneous Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implantable vascularized thrombi using blood can improve wound healing. By aligning fibrin fibers and activating platelets through microfluidic shear stress, the thrombi create a moderate stiffness microenvironment that promotes endothelial cell maturation and vascularization. In rodent models, they improve wound closure rates, epidermis thickness, collagen deposition, and hair follicle numbers, while also recruiting M2 phenotype macrophages to accelerate healing.








Abstract
Autologous implantable scaffolds that induce vasculogenesis have shown great potential in tissue regeneration; however, previous attempts mainly relied on cell&#8208;laden hydrogel patches using fat tissues or platelet&#8208;rich plasma, which are insufficient for generating a uniform vasculature in a scalable manner. Here, implantable vascularized engineered thrombi (IVETs) are presented using autologous whole blood, which potentiate effective skin wound healing by constructing robust microcapillary vessel networks at the wound site. Microfluidic shear stresses enable the alignment of bundled fibrin fibers along the direction of the blood flow streamlines and the activation of platelets, both of which offer moderate stiffness of the microenvironment optimal for facilitating endothelial cell maturation and vascularization. Rodent dorsal skin wounds patched with IVET present superior wound closure rates (96.08&#160;&#177;&#160;1.58%), epidermis thickness, collagen deposition, hair follicle numbers, and neutrophil infiltration, which are permitted by enhanced microvascular circulation. Moreover, IVET treatment accelerates wound healing by recruiting M2&#160;phenotype macrophages.

         <title>Fabrication of 3D Oriented MOF Micropatterns with Anisotropic Fluorescent Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep X&#8208;ray lithography is used for the fabrication of 3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) micropatterns. MOF films with X&#8208;ray sensitivity are obtained by using a mixed&#8208;linker strategy; the orientation of MOF crystals is achieved via heteroepitaxial growth. Fluorescent guest molecules are immobilized and aligned within spatially controlled and oriented MOF crystals. Such MOF micropatterns show anisotropic optical responses suitable for photonic applications.








Abstract
Micropatterning crystalline materials with oriented pores is necessary for the fabrication of devices with anisotropic properties. Crystalline and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are ideal materials as their chemical and structural mutability enables precise tuning of functional properties for applications ranging from microelectronics to photonics. Herein, a patternable oriented MOF film is designed: by using a photomask under X&#8208;ray exposure, the MOF film decomposes in the irradiated areas, remaining intact in the unexposed regions. The MOF film acts simultaneously as a resist and as functional porous material. While the heteroepitaxial growth from aligned Cu(OH)2 nanobelts is used to deposit oriented MOF films, the sensitivity to radiation is achieved by integrating a brominated dicarboxylate ligand (Br2BDC) into a copper&#8208;based MOF Cu2L2DABCO (DABCO = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; L = BDC/Br2BDC). The lithographed samples act as diffraction gratings upon irradiation with a laser, thus confirming the quality of the extended MOF micropattern. Furthermore, the oriented MOF patterns are functionalized with fluorescent dyes. As a result, by rotating the polarization angle of the laser excitation, the alignment of the dye in the MOF is demonstrated. By controlling the functional response to light, this MOF patterning protocol can be used for the microfabrication of optical components for photonic devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Flux X&#8208;ray Detection by a Solution&#8208;Grown Perovskite CsPbBr3 Single&#8208;Crystal Semiconductor Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 with low defect density and good short&#8208;range order shows a record&#8208;high X&#8208;ray sensitivity of &gt;10 000 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 22 nGyair s&#8722;1. Under ultrahigh flux of synchrotron X&#8208;rays (106 to 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2 at 58.61&#160;keV), a good photocurrent linearity and reproducibility are achieved.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskites are promising for hard X&#8208;ray and gamma&#8208;ray detection, but there are limited reports on their performance under extremely intense X&#8208;rays. Here, a solution&#8208;grown all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal semiconductor detector capable of operating at ultrahigh X&#8208;ray flux of 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2 is reported. High&#8208;quality solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystals are fabricated into detectors with a Schottky diode structure of eutectic gallium indium/CsPbBr3/Au. A high reverse&#8208;bias voltage of 1000&#160;V (435&#160;V mm&#8722;1) can be applied with a small and stable dark current of &#8776;60&#8211;70 nA (&#8776;9&#8211;10 nA mm&#8722;2), which enables a high sensitivity larger than 10 000 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a simultaneous low detection limit of 22 nGyair s&#8722;1. The CsPbBr3 semiconductor detector shows an excellent photocurrent linearity and reproducibility under 58.61&#160;keV synchrotron X&#8208;rays with flux from 106 to 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2. Defect characterization by thermally stimulated current spectroscopy shows a similar low defect density of a synchrotron X&#8208;ray and a lab X&#8208;ray irradiated device. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that the excellent performance of the solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystal may be associated with its good short&#8208;range order, comparable to the spectrometer&#8208;grade melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) can be applied with a small and stable dark current of &#8776;60&#8211;70 nA (&#8776;9&#8211;10 nA mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which enables a high sensitivity larger than 10 000 &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a simultaneous low detection limit of 22 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; semiconductor detector shows an excellent photocurrent linearity and reproducibility under 58.61&#160;keV synchrotron X-rays with flux from 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; photons s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Defect characterization by thermally stimulated current spectroscopy shows a similar low defect density of a synchrotron X-ray and a lab X-ray irradiated device. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that the excellent performance of the solution-grown CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal may be associated with its good short-range order, comparable to the spectrometer-grade melt-grown CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Laser Plasmonic Fabrication of Nanocrystals by Molecule Modulation for Photoresponse Multifunctional Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to assemble Au nanocrystals into interconnected pattern networks based on glue molecule&#8208;assisted laser plasmonic fabrication technique is proposed. It demonstrates that ultrafast laser&#8208;fabricated bridged structures exhibit enhanced photothermal conversion capacity owing to the broad absorption, which can be used for photoresponse functional devices.








Abstract
Nanotechnology has attracted wide research attention in constructing functional devices, including integrated circuits, transparent electrodes, and flexible actuators. Bottom&#8208;up fabrication is an important approach for functional structure manufacture, however, the controllable fabrication of complex architectures for practical applications has long been a challenge. Here, a novel strategy of laser plasmonic fabrication based on glue molecule modulation is proposed that can assemble metal nanocrystals into interconnected pattern networks. The plasmonic response of nanocrystals is adjustable with molecule modulation, which is a benefit for the effective formation of laser&#8208;induced localized oscillating electrons. The further decomposition of molecules and the movement of nanocrystal surface atoms can achieve the coalescence of assembled nanocrystals. It demonstrates that complex architectures can be controllably constructed by molecule level modulation. Through molecule&#8208;assisted laser plasmonic fabrication, the functional nanocrystals with enhanced photothermal capacity can be used for information encryption and soft machinery. This work expands the knowledge of bottom&#8208;up fabrication and provides a method for designing functional nanocrystals for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Direct Observation of Quadrupolar Strain Fields forming a Shear Band in Metallic Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4D&#8208;STEM&#8208;based analysis to directly correlate local strain field and atomic nearest&#8208;neighbor packing at the nanometer scale along shear bands in metallic glasses is developed. The observation unveils residual strain fields with quadrupolar symmetry concentrated at dilated Eshelby inclusions. The strain fields percolate in a vortex&#8208;like manner building up the shear band. This provides a new understanding of the formation of shear bands in metallic glass.








Abstract
For decades, scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) techniques have been employed to analyze shear bands in metallic glasses and understand their formation in order to improve the mechanical properties of metallic glasses. However, due to a lack of direct information in reciprocal space, conventional S/TEM cannot characterize the local strain and atomic structure of amorphous materials, which are key to describe the deformation of glasses. For this work, 4&#8208;dimensional&#8208;STEM (4D&#8208;STEM) is applied to map and directly correlate the local strain and the atomic structure at the nanometer scale in deformed metallic glasses. Residual strain fields are observed with quadrupolar symmetry concentrated at dilated Eshelby inclusions. The strain fields percolate in a vortex&#8208;like manner building up the shear band. This provides a new understanding of the formation of shear bands in metallic glass.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Active Self&#8208;Cleaning Surfaces via Filament&#8208;Like Sweepers Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrodynamic self&#8208;cleaning is an ideal fouling&#8208;release strategy. However, the weak hydrodynamic forces in the viscous sublayer restrict their practical applications. Here, inspired by sweeper tentacles of corals, an active self&#8208;cleaning surface with filament&#8208;like sweepers is reported. The sweepers can penetrate the viscous sublayer by utilizing energy from outer turbulent flows and removing contaminants, which breaks the concept of conventional self&#8208;cleaning.








Abstract
Hydrodynamic forces from moving fluids can be utilized to remove contaminants which is an ideal fouling&#8208;release strategy for underwater surfaces. However, the hydrodynamic forces in the viscous sublayer are greatly reduced owing to the no&#8208;slip condition, which restricts their practical applications. Here, inspired by sweeper tentacles of corals, an active self&#8208;cleaning surface with flexible filament&#8208;like sweepers are reported. The sweepers can penetrate the viscous sublayer by utilizing energy from outer turbulent flows and remove contaminants with adhesion strength of &gt;30&#160;kPa. Under an oscillating flow, the removal rate of the single sweeper can reach up to 99.5% due to dynamic buckling movements. In addition, the sweepers array can completely clean its coverage area within 10 s through coordinated movements as symplectic waves. The active self&#8208;cleaning surface depends on the fluid&#8208;structure coupling between sweepers and flows, which breaks the concept of conventional self&#8208;cleaning.

         <title>A Protophilic MOF Enables Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium&#8208;Battery Stable Cycling in a High Water/Acid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique ionic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that combines ultrahigh surface areas and ionic pore environments is used to selectively and effectively adsorb protic impurities from battery electrolytes, realizing high water/acid tolerant&#160;batteries. Even if H2O is introduced into the batteries and generates hydrofluoric acid (HF), such MOF&#8208;based batteries with a high&#8208;nickel cathode still show high cycling performance.








Abstract
Trace protic impurities, such as water and hydrofluoric acid (HF), can severely degrade the stable and long cycling of lithium batteries. Therefore, the costly water removal process is inevitably needed throughout production of lithium batteries, leaving the paradox that energy&#8208;saving lithium&#8208;battery technology consumes non&#8208;negligible amounts of energy. Herein, a unique ionic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is reported that enables highly destructive H2O/HF&#8208;tolerant lithium batteries. The isolated ionic fluorine sites in the MOF exhibit unusual protophilicity and efficiently capture ppm&#8208;levels H2O/HF from the highly polar electrolyte solvents. The resulting MOF&#8208;based LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2&#9474;Li battery achieves over 300 cycles in the presence of 800&#160;ppm H2O or 1107&#160;ppm acidic impurity. This tenfold longer battery lifespan relative to those for batteries with conventional standard separators demonstrates its excellent electrochemical cycling performance. The results reveal that the rational use of unique nanoporous features of MOFs can provide new possibilities for long&#8208;standing challenges in the lithium&#8208;battery industry.

Er3+ 1.54&#8208;&#181;m electroluminescence based on the CsPbCl3 perovskite films for photonic devices operating in the third telecommunication window is realized through energy transfer from Yb3+activated by CsPbCl3 via a quantum cutting process to Er3+. The obtained peak external quantum efficiency far exceeds that of the Er3+&#8208;based organic light emitting diode by two orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Erbium ions (Er3+, 1.54&#160;&#181;m) electric pumped light sources with excellent optical properties and a simple fabrication process are urgently desired to satisfy the development of silicon&#8208;based integration photonics. The previous Er&#8208;based electroluminescence devices are mainly based on Er&#8208;complexes or Er&#8208;doped oxide compounds, which usually suffer from low external quantum efficiency(EQE)or high applied voltage etc. In this work, a novel type of Er3+/Yb3+ co&#8208;doped lead&#8208;halide perovskite films (Er3+/Yb3+:CsPbCl3) with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 30.12% are prepared by a simple two&#8208;step solution&#8208;coating method and the corresponding light emitting diodes (Er&#8208;PeLEDs) are fabricated, which demonstrate an almost pure 1.54&#8208;&#181;m emission and a peak EQE up to 0.366% at a low applied voltage of 1.4 V. Strong negative thermal quenching effect may help Er&#8208;PeLEDs suppress Joule heating quenching. These excellent LED properties benefit mainly from the outstanding regulatory performance of acetate to perovskite films, the excellent semiconductor behavior and strong ionic property of the perovskite, and the involvement of Yb3+ ions, which can directly and efficiently transfer the exciton energy to Er3+ through a quantum cutting process. Overall, the realization of 1.54&#8208;&#181;m Er&#8208;PeLEDs offers new opportunities for silicon&#8208;based integrated light sources.

         <title>Pyroptosis&#8208;Mediated Synergistic Photodynamic and Photothermal Immunotherapy Enabled by a Tumor&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Targeted Photosensitive Dimer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;targeted photosensitive dimer, which effectively generates type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species in hypoxic tumor tissue for pyroptosis&#8208;mediated photoimmunotherapy, is successfully developed. Its remarkable photothermal properties accelerate the pyroptosis process, increase DNA damage in tumor cells, generate drastic immunogenic cell death and systemic antitumor immune response, and prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis.








Abstract
Overcoming the resistance to apoptosis and immunosuppression of tumor cells is a significant challenge in augmenting the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic programmed cell&#8208;death pathway unlike apoptosis, is considered a type of immunogenic cell death (ICD) that can intensify the ICD process in tumor cells, releasing dramatically increased tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns to promote cancer immunotherapy. Herein, a tumor cell membrane&#8208;targeted aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitive dimer is found to be able to achieve highly efficient ICD under the synergistic effect of photodynamic and photothermal therapy. The photosensitive dimer can efficiently produce type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) by photodynamic therapy in hypoxic tumor tissue, leading to pyroptosis by direct cell membrane damage, which is further reinforced by its photothermal effect. Furthermore, the enhanced ICD effect based on the dimer can completely eliminate the primary tumor on the seventh day of treatment and can also boost systemic antitumor immunity by generating immune memory, which is demonstrated by the superior antitumor therapeutic effects on both solid tumors and metastatic tumors when healing 4T1 tumor mouse models with poor immunogenicity.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Based Concave Metasurfaces for High Performing Plasmonic Optical Filters by Templated Spin&#8208;on&#8208;Sodiophobic&#8208;Glass</title>

This work demonstrates a sodium&#8208;based plasmonic concave metasurface for high&#8208;performing subtractive optical filtering enabled by the template&#8208;induced solidification of liquid metals process. The proposed optical filter enables a minimum linewidth down to &#8776;15 nm, a minimum reflection residual less to &#8776;3% as well as measure&#8208;to&#8208;design spectral match ratio&#160;to &#8776;1500.








Abstract
Optical filters have aroused tremendous excitement in advanced photonic instruments and modern digital displays due to their flexible capability of spectrum manipulation. Plasmonic metasurfaces of narrow bandwidth, high spectral contrast, and robust structure tolerance are highly desired for optical filtration (especially in the visible regime) but rather challenging as large spectral broadening from intrinsic ohmic loss and design/fabrication deviations. Here the high&#8208;performing sodium&#8208;based metasurfaces are demonstrated for optical filtration across 450 to 750&#160;nm by unique structure design of spatially decoupled concave surfaces and precise fabrication through templated solidification of liquid metals. Thanks to the distinct suppression of metallic loss as well as fabrication tolerance of interfacial structures, the as&#8208;prepared concave metasurfaces enable a minimum linewidth of &#8776;15&#160;nm, a maximal optical contrast of &#8776;93%, and a high measure&#8208;to&#8208;design spectral match ratio &#8776;1500. These results have for the first time pushed the operation wavelengths of sodium&#8208;based plasmonic devices from infrared to visible which in turn demonstrates the capability of filling the blank of commercial dielectric optical filters thus far.

         <title>Mixed Matrix Membranes with Surface Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Sieves for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) are successfully fabricated by incorporating metal&#8211;organic framework sieves into the polyimide matrix for efficient propylene/propane separation. A facile surface carbene functionalization strategy affords a greatly improved polymer&#8211;filler interfacial compatibility in MMMs, offering new opportunities in the rational design of novel membranes.








Abstract
Membrane technology, regarded as an environmentally friendly and sustainable approach, offers great potential to address the large energy penalty associated with the energy&#8208;intensive propylene/propane separation. Quest for molecular sieving membranes for this important separation is of tremendous interest. Here, a fluorinated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material, known as KAUST&#8208;7 (KAUST: King Abdullah University of Science and Technology) with well&#8208;defined narrow 1D channels that can effectively discriminate propylene from propane based on a size&#8208;sieving mechanism, is successfully incorporated into a polyimide matrix to fabricate molecular sieving mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Markedly, the surface functionalization of KAUST&#8208;7 nanoparticles with carbene moieties affords the requisite interfacial compatibility, with minimal nonselective defects at polymer&#8211;filler interfaces, for the fabrication of a molecular sieving MMM. The optimal membrane with a high MOF loading (up to 45&#160;wt.%) displays a propylene permeability of &#8776;95 barrer and a mixed propylene/propane selectivity of &#8776;20, far exceeding the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art upper bound limits. Moreover, the resultant membrane exhibits robust structural stability under practical conditions, including high pressures (up to 8&#160;bar) and temperatures (up to 100&#160;&#176;C). The observed outstanding performance attests to the importance of surface engineering for the preparation and plausible deployment of high&#8208;performance MMMs for industrial applications.

         <title>A Unified Therapeutic&#8211;Prophylactic Tissue&#8208;Engineering Scaffold Demonstrated to Prevent Tumor Recurrence and Overcoming Infection toward Bone Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strength hydrogel doped with the photothermal material MoS2 and a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, gadolinium&#8208;complex, is reported. The ingenious design confers a tunable degradation rate of the hydrogel as well as satisfactory weakening of bacterial infection, inhibition of tumor activity, and inducing of in situ bone tissue regeneration in vivo.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma occurs in children and adolescents frequently and leads to a high fatality rate. Although surgical resection is the most common methods in clinic, patients always suffer from tumor metastasis and recurrence and it is difficult for them to self&#8208;repair large bone defects. Furthermore, the postoperative infection from bacteria triggers an inflammatory response and hinders the bone&#8208;repair process. This work demonstrates a gadolinium (Gd)&#8208;complex and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) co&#8208;doped N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA)/gelatin methacrylate (Gel&#8208;MA) multifunctional hydrogel (GMNG). The combination between NAGA and Gel&#8208;MA endows the GMNG with attractive mechanical properties and controllable degradation ability. The MoS2 improves the hydrogel system, which has excellent photothermal ability to kill tumor cells and inhibit bacterial infection both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the Gd&#8208;complex, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect can be used to monitor the position and degradation situation of the hydrogel. Notably, accompanied by the degradation of GMNG hydrogel, the gradually released Gd3+ from the hydrogel exhibits osteogenic property and could promote new bone formation efficiently in vivo. Therefore, this strategy supplies a method to prepare multifunctional bone&#8208;defect&#8208;repair materials and is expected to represent a significant guidance and reference to the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

&lt;p&gt;A high-strength hydrogel doped with the photothermal material MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, gadolinium-complex, is reported. The ingenious design confers a tunable degradation rate of the hydrogel as well as satisfactory weakening of bacterial infection, inhibition of tumor activity, and inducing of in situ bone tissue regeneration in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteosarcoma occurs in children and adolescents frequently and leads to a high fatality rate. Although surgical resection is the most common methods in clinic, patients always suffer from tumor metastasis and recurrence and it is difficult for them to self-repair large bone defects. Furthermore, the postoperative infection from bacteria triggers an inflammatory response and hinders the bone-repair process. This work demonstrates a gadolinium (Gd)-complex and molybdenum sulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) co-doped &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA)/gelatin methacrylate (Gel-MA) multifunctional hydrogel (GMNG). The combination between NAGA and Gel-MA endows the GMNG with attractive mechanical properties and controllable degradation ability. The MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; improves the hydrogel system, which has excellent photothermal ability to kill tumor cells and inhibit bacterial infection both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the Gd-complex, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect can be used to monitor the position and degradation situation of the hydrogel. Notably, accompanied by the degradation of GMNG hydrogel, the gradually released Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; from the hydrogel exhibits osteogenic property and could promote new bone formation efficiently in vivo. Therefore, this strategy supplies a method to prepare multifunctional bone-defect-repair materials and is expected to represent a significant guidance and reference to the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Microfluidics Separation of Colloids by Combining External Flow with Light&#8208;Induced Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for separating colloids distinguished only by slight differences in their surface morphology (e.g., roughness, porosity, or polymer), is reported. It relies on combining the drift by the pressure&#8208;driven shear flow of a photosensitive surfactant solution with a surface&#8208;properties&#8208;dependent positioning of the particles within the shear flow via local active flows induced under suitable illumination.








Abstract
Separation of particles by size, morphology, or material identity is of paramount importance in fields such as filtration or bioanalytics. Up to now separation of particles distinguished solely by surface properties or bulk/surface morphology remains a very challenging process. Here a combination of pressure&#8208;driven microfluidic flow and local self&#8208;phoresis/osmosis are proposed via the light&#8208;induced chemical activity of a photoactive azobenzene&#8208;surfactant solution. This process induces a vertical displacement of the sedimented particles, which depends on their size and surface properties .&#160;Consequently, different colloidal components&#160;experience different regions of the ambient microfluidic shear flow. Accordingly, a simple, versatile method for the&#160;separation of such can be achieved by elution times in a sense of particle chromatography. The concepts are illustrated via experimental studies, complemented by theoretical analysis, which include the separation of bulk&#8208;porous from bulk&#8208;compact colloidal particles and the separation of particles distinguished solely by slight differences in their surface physico&#8208;chemical properties.

         <title>Artificial Lipid Biomembranes for Full&#8208;Length SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Receptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;free membrane protein synthesis system with natural lipid vesicle or nanodisc is constructed, which can effectively improve the membrane protein solubility and assist the active structure formation. In this system, the full&#8208;length SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor of 21 species is successfully synthesized, and differences in functional verification between the full&#8208;length and truncated versions suggest the importance of the transmembrane region.








Abstract
The angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), is essential for assessing potential hosts and treatments. However, many studies are based on its truncated version but not full&#8208;length structure. Indeed, a single transmembrane (TM) helix presents in the full&#8208;length ACE2, influencing its interaction with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Therefore, synthesis of the full&#8208;length ACE2 is an urgent requirement. Here, cell&#8208;free membrane protein synthesis systems (CFMPSs) are constructed for full&#8208;length membrane proteins. MscL is screened as a model among ten membrane proteins based on their expression and solubility. Next, CFMPSs are constructed and optimized based on natural vesicles, vesicles with four membrane proteins removed or two chaperonins added, and 37 types of nanodiscs. They all increase membrane protein solubility to over 50%. Finally, the full&#8208;length ACE2 of 21 species are successfully expressed with yields between 0.4 and 0.9&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. The definite functional differences from the truncated version suggest that the TM region affects ACE2's structure and function. CFMPSs can be extended to more membrane proteins, paving the way for further applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Giant Rashba Spin&#8211;Orbit Coupling at Superconducting KTaO3(110) Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling and light&#8208;induced enhancement are observed in the 5d 2D electron system created at amorphous&#8211;Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/KTaO3(110) superconducting interfaces, which are both potentially promising for topological superconductivity and technologically competitive properties for the development of oxide spintronics.








Abstract
The 2D electron system (2DES) at the KTaO3 surface or heterointerface with 5d orbitals hosts extraordinary physical properties, including a stronger Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling (RSOC), higher superconducting transition temperature, and potential of topological superconductivity. Herein, a huge enhancement of RSOC under light illumination achieved at a superconducting amorphous&#8208;Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/KTaO3(110) heterointerfaces is reported. The superconducting transition is observed with Tc = 0.62 K and the temperature&#8208;dependent upper critical field reveals the interaction between spin&#8211;orbit scattering and superconductivity. A strong RSOC with Bso = 1.9 T is revealed by weak antilocalization in the normal state, which undergoes sevenfold enhancement under light illumination. Furthermore, RSOC strength develops a dome&#8208;shaped dependence of carrier density with the maximum of Bso = 12.6 T achieved near the Lifshitz transition point nc &#8776; 4.1&#160;&#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2. The highly tunable giant RSOC at KTaO3(110)&#8208;based superconducting interfaces show great potential for spintronics.

         <title>Light&#8208;Writing and Projecting Multicolor Fluorescent Hydrogels for On&#8208;Demand Information Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the vertical arrangement of multilayered chromatophores in chameleon skins, a conceptually new type of flexible NIR&#8208;light&#8208;triggered rewritable multicolor hydrogel system is developed. It enables not only the transient light&#8208;writing/self&#8208;erasing/rewriting display of arbitrary information, but also the sustainable light&#8208;projecting display of multicolor patterns, which enriches the diversification of information display and improves visual information interactive experience.








Abstract
Intelligent rewritable display systems have been long expected to reduce the heavy consumption of single&#8208;use or transient devices in the age of Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things. However, it remains challenging to construct such systems with integrated functionality of remote control, rapid activation, multicolor and multimode display. Herein, by learning from the unique multilayer arrangement of chromatophores in chameleon skins, a promising kind of rewritable hydrogel multicolor systems is presented that can combine the merits of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;writing and projecting modes for on&#8208;demand information display. Specifically, the systems have typical multilayer layout consisting of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)&#8208;sealed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film as photothermal control unit and embedded fluorescent hydrogels as multicolor display unit, in which thermoresponsive hydrogel is constrained within non&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Such rational structure design results in the establishment of one promising display mechanism via the cascading &#8220;light trigger&#8211;heat generation&#8211;fluorescence output&#8221; process. On this basis, rapid and reversible hand&#8208;written display of arbitrary information is achieved within 5&#160;s. Also, sustainable light&#8208;projecting display of predesigned multicolor patterns is demonstrated due to the multilayer design that ensures easy patterning of photothermal control or hydrogel display layer. This study brings functional&#8208;integrated merits for novel rewritable display systems and open new possibility to construct high&#8208;end products for information display/transmission.

On this basis, rapid and reversible hand-written display of arbitrary information is achieved within 5&#160;s. Also, sustainable light-projecting display of predesigned multicolor patterns is demonstrated due to the multilayer design that ensures easy patterning of photothermal control or hydrogel display layer. This study brings functional-integrated merits for novel rewritable display systems and open new possibility to construct high-end products for information display/transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noninvasive Photodelamination of van der Waals Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing photodelamination phenomenon that arises from ordered band alignment and resultant energy&#8208;funneling effect is observed in nonuniform van der Waals semiconductors, which holds potential as a noninvasive but convenient atomic&#8208;layer etching strategy for thickness uniformity management in 2D van der Waals semiconductor wafers for electronic applications.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D van der Waals semiconductors are promising candidate materials for post&#8208;silicon electronics. However, it remains challenging to attain completely uniform monolayer semiconductor wafers free of over&#8208;grown islands. Here, the observation of the energy&#8208;funneling effect and ambient photodelamination phenomenon in inhomogeneous few&#8208;layer WS2 flakes under low&#8208;illumination fluencies down to several nW &#181;m&#8722;2 and its potential as a noninvasive atomic&#8208;layer etching strategy for selectively stripping the local excessive overlying islands are reported. Photoluminescent tracking on the photoetching traces reveals relatively fast etching rates of around 0.3&#8211;0.8&#160;&#181;m min&#8722;1 at varied temperatures and an activation energy of 1.7&#160;eV. By using crystallographic and electronic characterization, the noninvasive nature of the low&#8208;power photodelamination and the highly preserved lattice quality are also confirmed in the as&#8208;etched monolayer products, featuring a comparable density of atomic defects (&#8776;4.2 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2) to pristine flakes and a high electron mobility of up to 80 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature. This approach opens a noninvasive postetching route for thickness uniformity management in 2D van der Waals semiconductor wafers for electronic applications.

         <title>Rational Design of PDI&#8208;Based Linear Conjugated Polymers for Highly Effective and Long&#8208;Term Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three PDI&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers are synthesized for highly effective and long&#8208;term photocatalytic oxygen evolution through rational design. Bicarbonyl embedded Oxamide&#8208;PDI exhibits 5110.25&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under full spectrum irradiation without any co&#8208;catalyst exceeding most reported organic polymer photocatalysts, characterization, and DFT calculation reveals the ordered stacking, robust build&#8208;in electric field, and low exciton binding energy contribute greatly.








Abstract
Constructed through relatively weak noncovalent forces, the stability of organic supramolecular materials has shown to be a challenge. Herein, the designing of a linear conjugated polymer is proposed through creating a chain polymer connected via bridging covalent bonds in one direction and retaining &#960;&#8208;stacked aromatic columns in its orthogonal direction. Specifically, three analogs of linear conjugated polymers through tuning the aromatic core and its covalently linked moiety (bridging group) within the building block monomer are prepared. Cooperatively supported by strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions from the extended aromatic core of perylene and favorable dipole&#8211;dipole interactions from the bridging group, the as&#8208;expected high crystallinity, wide light absorption, and increased stability are successfully achieved for Oxamide&#8208;PDI (perylene diimide)&#160;through ordered molecular arrangement, and present a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum oxygen evolution rate of 5110.25&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 without any cocatalyst. Notably, experimental and theoretical studies reveal that large internal dipole moments within Oxamide&#8208;PDI together with its ordered crystalline structure enable a robust built&#8208;in electric field for efficient charge carrier migration and separation. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations also reveal oxidative sites located at carbon atoms next to imide bonds and inner bay positions based on proven spatially separated photogenerated electrons and holes, thus resulting in highly efficient water photolysis into oxygen.

         <title>Bottling Liquid&#8208;Like Minerals for Advanced Materials Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and scalable method to synthesize and isolate liquid&#8208;like mineral precursors is presented. The advantage of liquid&#8208;like precursors for materials synthesis is demonstrated for calcium carbonate minerals, exploring the effects of different organic and inorganic additives on the stability of the precursor phase. The method can be employed for, for example, mineral formation during restoration and conservation applications.








Abstract
Materials synthesis via liquid&#8208;like mineral precursors has been studied since their discovery almost 25 years ago, because their properties offer several advantages, for example, the ability to infiltrate small pores, the production of non&#8208;equilibrium crystal morphologies or mimicking textures from biominerals, resulting in a vast range of possible applications. However, the potential of liquid&#8208;like precursors has never been fully tapped, and they have received limited attention in the materials chemistry community, largely due to the lack of efficient and scalable synthesis protocols. Herein, the &#8220;scalable controlled synthesis and utilization of liquid&#8208;like precursors for technological applications&#8221; (SCULPT) method is presented, allowing the isolation of the precursor phase on a gram scale, and its advantage in the synthesis of crystalline calcium carbonate materials and respective applications is demonstrated. The effects of different organic and inorganic additives, such as magnesium ions and concrete superplasticizers, on the stability of the precursor are investigated and allow optimizing the process for specific demands. The presented method is easily scalable and therefore allows synthesizing and utilizing the precursor on large scales. Thus, it can be employed for mineral formation during restoration and conservation applications but can also open up pathways toward calcium carbonate&#8208;based, CO2&#8208;neutral cements.

         <title>Foldable Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Merging Electronic States between Defective and Perfect Perovskite Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging orbitals between the defect and perfect crystals within perovskites are found in chemosynthetic foldable hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) that convert discrete island trap states to continuous electronic states, and the mini module achieves high efficiency and fill factor.








Abstract
Defective and perfect sites naturally exist within electronic semiconductors, and considerable efforts to reduce defects to improve the performance of electronic devices, especially in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (ABX3), are undertaken. Herein, foldable hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) are developed, and they extend the wavefunctions of A&#8208;site cations of perovskite, which, as hybridized electronic states, link the trap states (defective site) and valence band edge (perfect site) between the naturally defective and perfect sites of the perovskite surface, finally converting the discrete trap states of the perovskite as the continuous valence band to reduce trap recombination. Tailoring the foldability of the HTMs tunes the wavefunctions between defective and perfect surface sites, allowing the power conversion efficiency of a small cell to reach 23.22% and that of a mini&#8208;module (6.5 &#215; 7&#160;cm, active area&#160;=&#160;30.24&#160;cm2) to reach as high as 21.71% with a fill factor of 81%, the highest value reported for non&#8208;spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based perovskite solar modules.

         <title>Electrical Manipulation of Orbital Current Via Oxygen Migration in Ni81Fe19/CuOx/TaN Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sizable orbital current related magnetoresistance effect and spin&#8208;orbit torque are observed in Ni81Fe19/CuOx/TaN heterostructures, and can be substantially modulated through a fine&#8208;tuning of oxygen distribution through ion liquid gating. The TaN prevents the ion exchange between heterostructure and ion liquid, but inspires the internal oxygen ion reconstruction in CuOx, paving an intriguing way for controlling spin&#8208;orbitronic devices.








Abstract
The orbital Hall effect and the interfacial Rashba effect provide new approaches to generate orbital current and spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) efficiently without the use of heavy metals. However, achieving efficient dynamic control of orbital current and SOT in light metal oxides has proven challenging. In this study, it is demonstrated that a sizable magnetoresistance effect related to orbital current and SOT can be observed in Ni81Fe19/CuOx/TaN heterostructures with various CuOx oxidization concentrations. The ionic liquid gating induces the migration of oxygen ions, which modulates the oxygen concentration at the Ni81Fe19/CuOx interface, leading to reversible manipulation of the magnetoresistance effect and SOT. The existence of a thick TaN capping layer allows for sophisticated internal oxygen ion reconstruction in the CuOx layer, rather than conventional external ion exchange. These results provide a method for the reversible and dynamic manipulation of the orbital current and SOT generation efficiency, thereby advancing the development of spin&#8208;orbitronic devices through ionic engineering.

         <title>Highly Ordered Supramolecular Materials of Phase&#8208;Separated Block Molecules for Long&#8208;Range Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials with columns of cores based on carbonyl&#8208;bridged triarylamine trisamides functionalized with oligodimethylsiloxane side chains of discrete length are synthesized and characterized. Within these columns, the well&#8208;defined ordering allows for diffusion lengths of &gt;100&#160;nm and exciton diffusivity values of &#8776;0.05 cm2 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Efficient energy transport over long distances is essential for optoelectronic and light&#8208;harvesting devices. Although self&#8208;assembled nanofibers of organic molecules are shown to exhibit long exciton diffusion lengths, alignment of these nanofibers into films with large, organized domains with similar properties remains a challenge. Here, it is shown how the functionalization of C3&#8208;symmetric carbonyl&#8208;bridged triarylamine trisamide (CBT) with oligodimethylsiloxane (oDMS) side chains of discrete length leads to fully covered surfaces with aligned domains up to 125 &#215; 70 &#181;m2 in which long&#8208;range exciton transport takes place. The nanoscale morphology within the domains consists of highly ordered nanofibers with discrete intercolumnar spacings within a soft amorphous oDMS matrix. The oDMS prevents bundling of the CBT fibers, reducing the number of defects within the CBT columns. As a result, the columns have a high degree of coherence, leading to exciton diffusion lengths of a few hundred nanometers with exciton diffusivities (&#8776;0.05 cm2 s&#8722;1) that are comparable to those of a crystalline tetracene. These findings represent the next step toward fully covered surfaces of highly aligned nanofibers through functionalization with oDMS.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into the Synergy between Platinum Single Atom and Cluster Dual Active Sites Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decoration of atomically dispersed Pt cocatalysts, including single atom (SA) and/or atomic cluster (C), on CdS semiconductors is achieved by ALD. The optimized PtSA+C/CdS photocatalysts with dual active sites and suitable spatial distance present the best photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity due to the conspicuous synergy between Pt SA and cluster.








Abstract
In the energy transition context, the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based photocatalysts with low Pt content and ultrahigh atom&#8208;utilization efficiency for hydrogen production are essential. Herein, a facile approach for decorating atomically dispersed Pt cocatalysts having single&#8208;atom (SA) and atomic cluster (C) dual active sites on CdS nanorods (PtSA+C/CdS) via atomic layer deposition is reported. The size of the cocatalyst and the spatial intimacy of the cocatalyst active sites are precisely engineered at the atomic scale. The PtSA+C/CdS photocatalysts show the optimized photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, achieving a reaction rate of 80.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is 1.6&#8208; and 7.3&#8208;fold higher than those of the PtSA/CdS and PtNP/CdS photocatalysts, respectively. Thorough characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced photocatalytic activity is due to a remarkable synergy between SAs and atomic clusters as dual active sites, which are responsible for water adsorption&#8211;dissociation and hydrogen desorption, respectively. A similar synergetic effect is found in a representative Pt/TiO2 system, indicating the generality of the strategy. This study demonstrates the significance of the synergy between active sites for enhancing the reaction efficiency, opening a new avenue for the rational design of atomically dispersed photocatalysts with high efficiency.

         <title>Geometric and Electronic Engineering of Atomically Dispersed Copper&#8208;Cobalt Diatomic Sites for Synergistic Promotion of Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a strategy to create atomically dispersed copper&#8208;cobalt diatomic sites on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix by geometric and electronic engineering is reported. It presents extraordinary electrocatalytic activity in ORR and OER and demonstrates high efficiency in zinc&#8211;air batteries. DFT calculations reveal that the synergistic effect of Cu and Co dual sites contributes to superior electrocatalytic activity.








Abstract
The development of rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries is heavily dependent on bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to offer exceptional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activities. However, the design of such electrocatalysts with high activity and durability is challenging. Herein, a strategy is proposed to create an electrocatalyst comprised of copper&#8208;cobalt diatomic sites on a highly porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Cu&#8208;Co/NC) with abundantly accessible metal sites and optimal geometric and electronic structures. Experimental findings and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Cu&#8208;Co dual&#8208;metal sites with metal&#8208;N4 coordination induce asymmetric charge distributions with moderate adsorption/desorption behavior with oxygen intermediates. This electrocatalyst exhibits extraordinary bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activities in alkaline media, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 335&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for OER. In addition, it demonstrates exceptional ORR activity in acidic (0.85&#160;V) and neutral (0.74&#160;V) media. When applied to a zinc&#8211;air battery, it achieves extraordinary operational performance and outstanding durability (510&#160;h), ranking it as one of the most efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. This work demonstrates the importance of geometric and electronic engineering of isolated dual&#8208;metal sites for boosting bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in electrochemical energy devices.

         <title>Electrochemical Biomass Upgrading Coupled with Hydrogen Production under Industrial&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary NiVRu&#8208;LDHs nanosheet arrays are prepared by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction (NiVRu&#8208;LDHs NAs/NF), which realize a green, sustainable, and energy&#8208;saving electrochemical route for formic acid and hydrogen co&#8208;production with high Faradaic efficiencies (almost 80% and 96%) and productivities (12.5 and 17.9&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) at an industry&#8208;level current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
As promising hydrogen energy carrier, formic acid (HCOOH) plays an indispensable role in building a complete industry chain of a hydrogen economy. Currently, the biomass upgrading assisted water electrolysis has emerged as an attractive alternative for co&#8208;producing green HCOOH and H2 in a cost&#8208;effective manner, yet simultaneously affording high current density and Faradaic efficiency (FE) still remains a big challenge. Here, the ternary NiVRu&#8208;layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheet arrays for selective glycerol oxidation and hydrogen evolution catalysis are reported, which yield an industry&#8208;level 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at voltage of 1.933&#160;V, meanwhile showing considerable HCOOH and H2 productivities of 12.5 and 17.9&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, with FEs of almost 80% and 96%, respectively. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the introduced Ru atoms can tune the local electronic structure of Ni&#8208;based LDHs, which not only optimizes hydrogen adsorption kinetics for HER, but also reduces the reaction energy barriers for both the conversion of NiII into GOR&#8208;active NiIII and carbon&#63743;carbon (C&#63743;C) bond cleavage. In short, this work highlights the potential of large&#8208;scale H2 and HCOOH productions from integrated electrocatalytic system and provides new insights for designing advanced electrocatalyst for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Designing Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Driven Microswimmers toward Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structurally and texturally distinct covalent organic frameworks (COF)&#8208;based light&#8208;driven microswimmers with different nanopore sizes are designed and studied for potential drug delivery applications as multifunctional organic microswimmers. The real&#8208;time visualization of the drug carrier COF&#8208;based microswimmers enables new insights into the function of porous organic micromachines, which will help to solve various drug delivery problems in biological media.








Abstract
While micromachines with tailored functionalities enable therapeutic applications in biological environments, their controlled motion and targeted drug delivery in biological media require sophisticated designs for practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a new generation of crystalline and nanoporous polymers, offer new perspectives for light&#8208;driven microswimmers in heterogeneous biological environments including intraocular fluids, thus setting the stage for biomedical applications such as retinal drug delivery. Two different types of COFs, uniformly spherical TABP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF sub&#8208;micrometer particles and texturally nanoporous, micrometer&#8208;sized TpAzo&#8208;COF particles are described and compared as light&#8208;driven microrobots. They can be used as highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven drug carriers in aqueous ionic and cellular media. Their absorption ranging down to red light enables phototaxis even in deeper and viscous biological media, while the organic nature of COFs ensures their biocompatibility. Their inherently porous structures with &#8776;2.6&#160; and &#8776;3.4&#160;nm pores, and large surface areas allow for targeted and efficient drug loading even for insoluble drugs, which can be released on demand. Additionally, indocyanine green (ICG) dye loading in the pores enables photoacoustic imaging, optical coherence tomography, and hyperthermia in operando conditions. This real&#8208;time visualization of the drug&#8208;loaded COF microswimmers enables unique insights into the action of photoactive porous drug carriers for therapeutic applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Area&#8208;Selective Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition of SiO2 with Interleaved Small Molecule Inhibitors and Integrated Back&#8208;Etch Correction for Low Defectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) and plasma etching are combined within the same tool for achieving area&#8208;selective spatial atomic layer deposition of SiO2 at high&#8208;throughput. Two SMIs using experimental and Density Functional Theory data are compared and their blocking performance in terms of size, packing density, and chemisorption energy is discussed. Low&#8208;energy ion scattering spectroscopy demonstrates the high&#8208;selectivity of the combined approach.








Abstract
A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind area&#8208;selective deposition process for SiO2&#160;is developed consisting of film deposition with interleaved exposures to small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) and back&#8208;etch correction steps, within the same spatial atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool. The synergy of these&#160;aspects results in selective SiO2&#160;deposition up to&#160;~23&#160;nm with high selectivity and throughput, with SiO2&#160;growth area and ZnO nongrowth area. The selectivity is corroborated by both X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low&#8208;energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS). The selectivity conferred by two different SMIs, ethylbutyric acid, and pivalic acid has been compared experimentally and theoretically. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal that selective surface functionalization using both SMIs is predominantly controlled thermodynamically, while the better selectivity achieved when using trimethylacetic acid can be explained by its higher packing density&#160;compared to ethylbutyric acid. By employing the trimethylacetic acid as SMI on other starting surfaces (Ta2O5, ZrO2,&#160;etc.) and probing the selectivity, a broader use of carboxylic acid inhibitors for different substrates is demonstrated. It is believed that the current results highlight the subtleties in SMI properties such as size, geometry, and packing, as well as interleaved back&#8208;etch steps, which are key in developing ever more effective strategies for highly selective deposition processes.

         <title>A Biocompatible Supercapacitor Diode with Enhanced Rectification Capability toward Ion/Electron&#8208;Coupling Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is developed by employing molybdenum oxide as the working electrode. Benefiting from the size and charge dual ion&#8208;sieving effects of molybdenum oxide electrode, the as&#8208;built CAPode exhibits a record&#8208;high rectification ratio that is 10 times higher than those of reported systems, which enables the constructed CAPode to work well in ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operation circuits.








Abstract
The main challenge faced by the forthcoming human&#8211;computer interaction is that biological systems and electronic devices adopt two different information carriers, i.e., ions and electrons, respectively. To bridge the gap between these two systems, developing ion/electron&#8208;coupling devices for logic operation is a feasible and effective approach. Accordingly, herein a supercapacitor&#8208;based ionic diode (CAPode) that takes electrochemically amorphized molybdenum oxide as the working electrode is developed. Benefiting from its unique size and charge dual ion&#8208;sieving effects, the molybdenum oxide electrode exhibits a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of 136, which is over 10 times higher than those of reported systems. It also delivers an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 448 F g&#8315;1 and an excellent cycling stability of up to 20 000 cycles, greatly outperforming those of previous works. These excellent rectification capability and electrochemical performances allow the as&#8208;built CAPode to work well in AND and OR logic gates, validating great potential in ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations. More attractively, the superior biocompatibilities of molybdenum oxide and relevant constituent materials enable the constructed CAPode to be applied as bioelectronics without regard to biosafety, paving a new way toward forthcoming human&#8211;computer interaction.

         <title>Regulation of Quantum Wells Width Distribution in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum well distribution of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites is effectively narrowed by regulation formation enthalpy of reaction with hydroiodic acid additive due to the construction of new reaction path. The carrier transport properties of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite with the narrow quantum wells are remarkably enhanced, and the resultant photodetector shows much higher performance and humidity stability.








Abstract
Dynamic optimization of the quantum&#8208;well (QW) width distribution in quasi&#8208;2D halide perovskite thin films is an effective approach for tuning the properties of photoelectric devices. Here, that the QWs width distribution in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films can be controlled only by using hydroiodic acid (HI) as an additive is demonstrated. A uniform distribution of the colloidal particle size in the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite precursor solution is achieved through the formation of soluble iodoplumbate coordination complexes, PbI3&#8722; from the reaction of HI with PbI2, resulting in an improved phase purity in the final film. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the ideal n value quasi&#8208;2D perovskite reaction pathway through the PbI3&#8722; complex has a lower enthalpy of formation than the random nucleation pathway without the HI additive. Benefiting from this merit, a high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;2D perovskite film with optimized phase purity delivered a balanced carrier diffusion length and improved carrier mobility. The resultant photodetectors exhibited a light on/off ratio of 50&#160;000, a responsivity of 0.96 A W&#8722;1, and a detectivity of 5.7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 532&#160;nm. In addition, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device maintained more than 80% of its initial photocurrent after 720&#160;h of storage at 30% relative humidity.

         <title>A Novel Potassium Salt Regulated Solvation Chemistry Enabling Excellent Li&#8208;Anode Protection in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicately designed additive of potassium perfluoropinacolatoborate (KFPB) is synthesized, which can dramatically improve the compatibility between lithium (Li) anode and carbonate electrolytes by forming a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Only with a trace amount of KFPB additive (0.03&#160;m) in the electrolyte, Li dendrites&#8217; growth can be totally suppressed, and lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) exhibit superior cycling stability.








Abstract
In lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), the compatibility of Li anode and conventional lithium hexafluorophosphate&#8208;(LiPF6) carbonate electrolyte is poor owing to the severe parasitic reactions. Herein, to resolve this issue, a delicately designed additive of potassium perfluoropinacolatoborate (KFPB) is unprecedentedly synthesized. On the one hand, KFPB additive can regulate the solvation structure of the carbonate electrolyte, promoting the formation of Li+&#63743;FPB&#8722; and K+&#63743;PF6&#8722; ion pairs with lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. On the other hand, FPB&#8722; anion possesses strong adsorption ability on Li anode. Thus, anions can preferentially adsorb and decompose on the Li&#8208;anode surface to form a conductive and robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Only with a trace amount of KFPB additive (0.03&#160;m) in the carbonate electrolyte, Li dendrites&#8217; growth can be totally suppressed, and Li||Cu and Li||Li half cells exhibit excellent Li&#8208;plating/stripping stability upon cycling. Encouragingly, KFPB&#8208;assisted carbonate electrolyte enables high areal capacity LiCoO2||Li, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li, and LiNi0.8Co0.05Al0.15O2 (NCA)||Li LMBs with superior cycling stability, showing its excellent universality. This work reveals the importance of designing novel additives to regulate the solvation structure of carbonate electrolytes in improving its interface compatibility with the Li anode.

         <title>A Biodegradable, Waterproof, and Thermally Processable Cellulosic Bioplastic Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;dynamic covalent network&#8221; reconstruction strategy is proposed for the fabrication of sustainable cellulosic bioplastics. By introducing dynamic linkages between cellulose chains, this cellulosic bioplastic is imparted with good thermo&#8208;processability, competitive mechanical properties, excellent water and solvent resistance, as well as chemical and biological degradability. This approach provides a new route for developing sustainable and degradable bioplastics from resource&#8208;abundant biomass.








Abstract
The growing environmental concern over petrochemical&#8208;based plastics continuously promotes the exploration of green and sustainable substitute materials. Compared with petrochemical products, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of availability, cost, and biodegradability; however, cellulose's dense hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and highly ordered crystalline structure make it hard to be thermoformed. A strategy to realize the partial disassociation of hydrogen bonds in cellulose and the reassembly of cellulose chains via constructing a dynamic covalent network, thereby endowing cellulose with thermal processability as indicated by the observation of a moderate glass transition temperature (Tg&#160;=&#160;240&#160;&#176;C), is proposed. Moreover, the cellulosic bioplastic delivers a high tensile strength of 67&#160;MPa, as well as excellent moisture and solvent resistance, good recyclability, and biodegradability in nature. With these advantageous features, the developed cellulosic bioplastic represents a promising alternative to traditional plastics.

         <title>Nontrivial Topological Surface States in Ru3Sn7 toward Wide pH&#8208;Range Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological material, Ru3Sn7, is prepared, in which topological surface states are accommodated in the {001} crystal family. The Ru3Sn7 is suitable for HER in both acid and alkali, with superior overpotentials of 28 and 27 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, and ultrasmall Tafel slopes of 22 and 40 mV dec&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
Nontrivial topological surface states (TSSs), which possess extraordinary carrier mobility and are protected by the bulk symmetry, have emerged as an innovative platform to search for efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Sn&#8208;based nontrivial metal Ru3Sn7 is prepared using electrical arc melting method. The results indicate that the (001) crystal family of Ru3Sn7 possesses nontrivial TSSs with linear dispersion relation and large nontrivial energy window. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that nontrivial TSSs of Ru3Sn7 can significantly boost charge transfer kinetics and optimize adsorption of hydrogen intermediates due to bulk symmetry&#8208;protected band structures. As expected, nontrivial Ru3Sn7 exhibits superior HER activity to Ru, Pt/C, and trivial counterparts (e.g., Ru2Sn3, IrSn2, and Rh3Sn2) with higher ratios of noble metals. Furthermore, the wide pH&#8208;range activity of topologically nontrivial Ru3Sn7 implies the robustness of its TSSs against pH variation during the HER. These findings provide a promising approach to the rational design of topologically nontrivial metals as highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;templating synthesis method is presented with molten&#8208;salt protection to synthesize high&#8208;quality few&#8208;atoms&#8208;thin Mo2C nanosheets with a low concentration of defects. The fundamental electrochemical properties of the 2D Mo2C nanosheets show that the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Mo2C increases with decreasing thickness.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides (2D TMCs and MXenes) are promising candidates for applications of energy storage and catalysis. However, producing high&#8208;quality, large 2D flakes of Mo2C MXene has been challenging. Here, a new salt&#8208;assisted templating approach is reported that enables the direct synthesis of 2D Mo2C with low defect concentrations. KCl acts as a template to form an intermediate 2D product, facilitating Mo2C formation without coarsening upon melting. The thickness of the flakes produced can range from monolayer (0.36 nm) to 10 layers (4.55 nm), and the electrocatalytical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of 2D Mo2C is inversely proportional to its thickness. The monolayer Mo2C shows remarkable HER performance with a current density of &#8776;6800 mA cm&#8722;2 at 470 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and an ultrahigh turnover frequency of &#8776;17 500 s&#8722;1. This salt&#8208;assisted synthesis approach can also produce WC and V8C7 nanosheets, expanding the family of 2D carbides. The new pathway eliminates the need for layered ceramic precursors, making it a versatile approach to direct synthesis of MXene&#8208;like 2D carbides.

         <title>A New Zinc Salt Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new aqueous Zn salt with an anion group, N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide C12H10N(SO2)2&#8722;,&#160;(BBI&#8722;) is designed and synthesized. The 1 m Zn(BBI)2 electrolyte decreases the decomposition activity of H2O molecules, suppresses the&#160;hydrogen evolution reaction, enables compact and uniform zinc deposition, and improves the cycling and calendar stabilities of aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage solutions with low cost and superior safety, but they suffer from chemical and electrochemical degradations closely related to the electrolyte. Here, a new zinc salt design and a drop&#8208;in solution for long cycle&#8208;life aqueous ZIBs are reported. The salt Zn(BBI)2 with a rationally designed anion group, N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide (BBI&#8722;), has a special amphiphilic molecular structure, which combines the benefits of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups to properly tune the solubility and interfacial condition. This new zinc salt does not contain fluorine and is synthesized via a high&#8208;yield and low&#8208;cost method. It is shown that 1&#160;m Zn(BBI)2 aqueous electrolyte with a widened cathodic stability window effectively stabilizes Zn metal/H2O interface, mitigates chemical and electrochemical degradations, and enables both symmetric and full cells using a&#160;zinc&#8208;metal electrode.

         <title>Multifunctional Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Microcrystalline Engineering and Electromagnetic Response Switching Multi&#8208;Band Devices</title>

A facile one&#8208;step solution processing method is developed to rapidly prepare gram&#8208;scale MAPbX3&#160;microcrystals. Utilizing its intrinsic electromagnetic (EM) properties, a series of EM devices is designed and fabricated, which can be applied in the fields of ultra&#8208;wideband bandpass filters and multi&#8208;band photodetection covering X&#8208;rays, UV, visible light, and microwaves.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency electromagnetic (EM) functional materials are the core building block of high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices, and they are indispensable in various fields ranging from industrial manufacture to daily life, or even from national defense security to space exploration. Searching for high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials and realizing high&#8208;performance EM devices remain&#160;great challenges. Herein, a simple solution&#8208;process is developed to rapidly grow gram&#8208;scale organic&#8211;inorganic (MAPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) perovskite microcrystals. They exhibit excellent EM response in multi bands covering microwaves, visible light, and X&#8208;rays. Among them, outstanding microwave absorption performance with multiple absorption bands can be achieved, and their intrinsic EM properties can be tuned by adjusting polar group. An ultra&#8208;wideband bandpass filter with high suppression level of &#8722;71.8&#160;dB in the stopband in the GHz band, self&#8208;powered photodetectors with tunable broadband or narrowband photoresponse in the visible&#8208;light band, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector with high sensitivity of 3560&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;in the X&#8208;ray band are designed and realized by precisely regulating the physical features of perovskite and designing a novel planar device structure. These findings open a door toward developing high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials for realizing high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices.

         <title>A Liquid Metal Microdroplets Initialized Hemicellulose Composite for 3D Printing Anode Host in Zn&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steady affinity between gallium&#8208;based liquid metals and polyacrylamide is successfully fabricated by a strategy that uses shear mixed EGaIn microdroplets as initiator for free radical polymerization. The resultant polyacrylamide&#8208;hemicellulose/EGaIn microdroplets hydrogel possesses shear thinning, self&#8208;healing capabilities, and electrical conductivity. It is used as a multifunctional ink to 3D&#8208;print self&#8208;standing scaffolds and anode hosts for Zn&#8208;ion batteries which shows high durability.








Abstract
Maintaining a steady affinity between gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LM) and polymer binders, particularly under continuous mechanical deformation, such as extrusion&#8208;based 3D printing or plating/stripping of Zinc ion (Zn2+), is very challenging. Here, an LM&#8208;initialized polyacrylamide&#8208;hemicellulose/EGaIn microdroplets hydrogel is used as a multifunctional ink to 3D&#8208;print self&#8208;standing scaffolds and anode hosts for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The LM microdroplets initiate acrylamide polymerization without additional initiators and cross&#8208;linkers, forming a double&#8208;covalent hydrogen&#8208;bonded network. The hydrogel acts as a framework for stress dissipation, enabling recovery from structural damage due to the cyclic plating/stripping of Zn2+. The LM&#8208;microdroplet&#8208;initialized polymerization with hemicelluloses&#160;can facilitate the production of 3D printable inks for energy storage devices.

Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) possess excellent photophysical properties of perovskites while avoiding the introduction of toxic metal ions and organic solvents, and have been expanded to X&#8208;ray detection. However, iodine&#8208;based high&#8208;performance MFPs are tended to oxidation, corrosion, and uncontrolled ion migration, resulting in poor material stability and device performance. Herein, the strongly electronegative PF6&#8722; pseudohalide is used to fabricate the large&#8208;size MDABCO&#8208;NH4(PF6)3 (MDBACO = methyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) single crystals (SCs) for solving the problems of iodine ions. After the introduction of PF6&#8722; pseudohalides, the Coulomb interaction and hydrogen bonding strength are enhanced to alleviate the ion&#8208;migration and stability problems. Moreover, combined with theoretical calculations, PF6&#8722; pseudohalides increase the ion&#8208;migration barrier, and affect the contribution of its components to the energy band for a broadening bandgap. Meanwhile, the improved physical properties, such as large activation energy of ionic migration, high resistivity, and low current drift, further expand its application in low&#8208;dose and sensitive X&#8208;ray detection. Finally, the X&#8208;ray detector based on MDABCO&#8208;NH4(PF6)3 SCs achieves a sensitivity of 2078 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (highest among metal&#8208;free SCs&#8208;based detectors) and the lowest detectable dose rate (16.3 nGyair s&#8722;1). This work has expanded the selection of MFPs for X&#8208;ray detectors and somewhat advanced the development of high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.2% Efficiency Enabled by Solid Additive</title>

         <dc:description>
The addition of 3,5&#8208;dichlorobromobenzene can effectively tune the phase separation of PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl during film formation, results in a favorable phase separation and a reinforced molecular packing. Consequently, the binary organic solar cells exhibit 19.2% efficiency and superior photostability.








Abstract
Morphology optimization is critical for achieving high efficiency and stable bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, the use of 3,5&#8208;dichlorobromobenzene (DCBB) with high volatility and low cost to manipulate evolution of the BHJ morphology and improve the operability and photostability of OSCs is proposed. Systematic simulations reveal the charge distribution of DCBB and its non&#8208;covalent interaction with the active layer materials. The addition of DCBB can effectively tune the aggregation of PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl during film formation, resulting in a favorable phase separation and a reinforced molecular packing. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 19.2% (certified as 19.0% by the National Institute of Metrology) for DCBB&#8208;processed PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based OSCs, which is the highest reported value for binary OSCs, is obtained. Importantly, the DCBB&#8208;processed devices exhibit superior photostability and have thus considerable application potential in the printing of large&#8208;area devices, demonstrating outstanding universality in various BHJ systems. The study provides a facile approach to control the BHJ morphology and enhances the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Micropatterning
In article number 2211478, Christian Doonan, Paolo Falcaro, and co&#8208;workers describe the fabrication of oriented metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) micropatterns with anisotropic optical properties. A mixed&#8208;linker strategy is used to impart X&#8208;ray sensitivity, while heteroepitaxial growth affords the orientation of MOF crystals. The 3D&#8208;oriented MOF films are patterned by resist&#8208;free X&#8208;ray photolithography. The MOF micropatterns with immobilized guest&#8208;molecules showcase fluorescence anisotropy.

Synergistic Immunotherapy
In article number 2300232, Xu&#8208;Man Chen, Zhiyang Liu, Quan Li, and co&#8208;workers report a membrane&#8208;targeted photosensitive dimer, which is found to exhibit superior antitumor immnotherapy under synergistic photodynamic and photothermal effect. In hypoxic tumor tissue, photodynamic therapy can effectively generate type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species, leading to pyroptosis. The remarkable photothermal properties further reinforce the pyroptosis process, thereby activating the antitumor immune response.

Biosynthesis
A cell&#8208;free membrane protein synthesis system (CFMPS) with natural or artificial lipid biomembranes is constructed, to effectively synthesize full&#8208;length transmembrane proteins by improving the membrane protein solubility and assisting the active structure formation, as described by Yuan Lu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2300575. The CFMPS can be further extended to expand the toolbox of cell&#8208;free biosynthesis, paving the way for its use in basic and applied research of synthetic biology.

&lt;p&gt;A cell-free membrane protein synthesis system (CFMPS) with natural or artificial lipid biomembranes is constructed, to effectively synthesize full-length transmembrane proteins by improving the membrane protein solubility and assisting the active structure formation, as described by Yuan Lu and co-workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202300575"&gt;2300575&lt;/a&gt;. The CFMPS can be further extended to expand the toolbox of cell-free biosynthesis, paving the way for its use in basic and applied research of synthetic biology.

Wound Healing
As reported by Joo H. Kang and co&#8208;workers in article number 2211149, implantable vascularized engineered thrombi (IVET) using autologous blood can improve wound healing by creating robust microcapillary networks. By aligning fibrin fibers and activating platelets through microfluidic shear stress, the engineered thrombi create a moderate stiffness microenvironment that can promote endothelial cell maturation and vascularization. In full&#8208;thickness skin wound models, IVET implantation facilitates rapid and scar&#8208;free wound recovery.

Plasmonic Fabrication
In article number 2211983, Jianfeng Yan and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy to assemble Au nanocrystals into interconnected pattern networks based on glue&#8208;molecule&#8208;assisted laser plasmonic fabrication. It is demonstrated that ultrafast&#8208;laser&#8208;fabricated bridged structures exhibit enhanced photothermal conversion capacity owing to the broad absorption, which can be used for photoresponse functional devices.

         <title>Engineering Stable Lead&#8208;Free Tin Halide Perovskite Solar Cells: Lessons from Materials Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most widely used lead&#8208;free perovskites are based on tin, however shortcomings in their stability prevent further developments of this technology. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art avenues to overcome these shortcomings include composition engineering, additive engineering, and interface engineering. This review reveals a set of design rules for the development of stable tin&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells by collectively analyzing a decade of materials chemistry.








Abstract
Substituting toxic lead with tin (Sn) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the most promising route toward the development of high&#8208;efficiency lead&#8208;free devices. Despite the encouraging efficiencies of Sn&#8208;PSCs, they are still yet to surpass 15% and suffer detrimental oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV). Since their first application in 2014, investigations into the properties of Sn&#8208;PSCs have contributed to a growing understanding of the mechanisms, both detrimental and complementary to their stability. This review summarizes the evolution of Sn&#8208;PSCs, including early developments to the latest state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches benefitting the stability of devices. The degradation pathways associated with Sn&#8208;PSCs are first outlined, followed by describing how composition engineering (A, B site modifications), additive engineering (oxidation prevention), and interface engineering (passivation strategies) can be employed as different avenues to improve the stability of devices. The knowledge about these properties is also not limited to PSCs and also applicable to other types of devices now employing Sn&#8208;based perovskite absorber layers. A detailed analysis of the properties and materials chemistry reveals a clear set of design rules for the development of stable Sn&#8208;PSCs. Applying the design strategies highlighted in this review will be essential to further improve both the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Piezocatalytic Medicine: An Emerging Frontier using Piezoelectric Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The definition of &#8220;piezocatalytic medicine (PCM)&#8221; is introduced to bridge &#8220;piezocatalysis&#8221; and &#8220;therapy&#8221;. Then, focus is placed on the principles of piezoelectric catalysis, the preparation and characterization of piezoelectric catalysts, and the applications in piezocatalytic medicine. Lastly, the opportunities and challenges of piezocatalytic medicine are discussed to drive its development.








Abstract
Emerging piezocatalysts have demonstrated their remarkable application potential in diverse medical fields. In addition to their ultrahigh catalytic activities, their inherent and unique charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;releasing properties can be used to initiate various redox catalytic reactions, displaying bright prospects for future medical applications. Triggered by mechanical energy, piezocatalytic materials can release electrons/holes, catalyze redox reactions of substrates, or intervene in biological processes to promote the production of effector molecules for medical purposes, such as decontamination, sterilization, and therapy. Such a medical application of piezocatalysis is termed as piezocatalytic medicine (PCM) herein. To pioneer novel medical technologies, especially therapeutic modalities, this review provides an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progress in piezocatalytic medicine. First, the principle of piezocatalysis and the preparation methodologies of piezoelectric materials are introduced. Then, a comprehensive summary of the medical applications of piezocatalytic materials in tumor treatment, antisepsis, organic degradation, tissue repair and regeneration, and biosensing is provided. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives in piezocatalytic medicine are discussed and proposed, expecting to fuel the development of this emerging scientific discipline.

         <title>Wetting Effect on Patterned Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet wetting on patterned substrate is addressed by the Cassie&#8211;Wenzel theory (CWT). This review discusses recent applications of CWT and its limitations. Anisotropic wetting effects beyond the scope of CWT are summarized for droplet size comparable to the pattern dimension. An additional focus is placed on the case when droplet partially wets the pore for mechanically patterned substrate.








Abstract
A droplet deposited on a solid substrate leads to the wetting phenomenon. A natural observation is the lotus effect, known for its superhydrophobicity. This special feature is engendered by the structured microstructure of the lotus leaf, namely, surface heterogeneity, as explained by the quintessential Cassie&#8211;Wenzel theory (CWT). In this work, recent designs of functional substrates are overviewed based on the CWT via manipulating the contact area between the liquid and the solid substrate as well as the intrinsic Young's contact angle. Moreover, the limitation of the CWT is discussed. When the droplet size is comparable to the surface heterogeneity, anisotropic wetting morphology often appears, which is beyond the scope of the Cassie&#8211;Wenzel work. In this case, several recent studies addressing the anisotropic wetting effect on chemically and mechanically patterned substrates are elucidated. Surface designs for anisotropic wetting morphologies are summarized with respect to the shape and the arrangement of the surface heterogeneity, the droplet volume, the deposition position of the droplet, as well as the mean curvature of the surface heterogeneity. A thermodynamic interpretation for the wetting effect and the corresponding open questions are presented at the&#160;end.

         <title>Graphdiyne and Its Derivatives as Efficient Charge Reservoirs and Transporters in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 25, June 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne (GDY) is a 2D carbon material with sp&#8208;sp2 conjugated carbon network containing evenly distributed pores, which endows GDY with unique properties in charge storage and transport. The applications of GDY and its derivatives as charge reservoirs and transporters in semiconductor devices, including memories, solar cells, photodetectors, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are summarized and analyzed.








Abstract
2D graphdiyne (GDY), which is composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, is a promising semiconductor material with a unique porous lamellar structure. It has high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, high density of states, and strong electrostatic interaction ability with ions and organic functional units. In recent years, interests in applying GDYs (GDY and its derivatives) in semiconductor devices have been growing rapidly, and great achievements have been made. Attractively, GDYs could act as efficient reservoirs and transporters for both carriers and ions, which endows them with enormous potential in future novel optoelectronics. In this review, the progress in this field is systematically summarized, aiming to bring an in&#8208;depth insight into the GDYs&#8217; intrinsic uniqueness. Particularly, the effects of GDYs on carrier dynamics and ionic interactions in various semiconductor devices are succinctly described, analyzed, and concluded.

         <title>Protocol in Evaluating Capacity of Zn&#8211;Mn Aqueous Batteries: A Clue of pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex energy storage mechanism of Zn&#8211;Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs), accompanied by abnormal capacity fluctuation, has been long debated since 1866. A pH clue to understand the different mechanisms and redesign the criteria to normalize the capacity contribution is proposed. A tunable H+/Zn2+/Mn2+ charge storage system is elaborated for a realistic evaluation of ZMABs.








Abstract
In the literature, Zn&#8211;Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs) confront abnormal capacity behavior, such as capacity fluctuation and diverse &#8220;unprecedented performances.&#8221; Because of the electrolyte additive&#8208;induced complexes, various charge/discharge behaviors associated with different mechanisms are being reported. However, the current performance assessment remains unregulated, and only the electrode or the electrolyte is considered. The lack of a comprehensive and impartial performance evaluation protocol for ZMABs hinders forward research and commercialization. Here, a pH clue (proton&#8208;coupled reaction) to understand different mechanisms is proposed and the capacity contribution is normalized. Then, a series of performance metrics, including rated capacity (Cr) and electrolyte contribution ratio from Mn2+ (CfM), are systematically discussed based on diverse energy storage mechanisms. The relationship between Mn (II) &#8596; Mn (III) &#8596; Mn (IV) conversion chemistry and protons consumption/production is well&#8208;established. Finally, the concrete design concepts of a tunable H+/Zn2+/Mn2+ storage system for customized application scenarios, opening the door for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety and reliable energy storage system, are proposed.

         <title>Molecular Tuning of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Fibrous Hydrogel Enables Control over Viscoelasticity and Creates Tunable ECM&#8208;Mimetic Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining both the mechanical dynamics and the fibrous nanostructure of the native extracellular matrix in a synthetic material remains a challenge. In this study, the molecular tuning of benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide supramolecular structures to create fibrous hydrogels with control over the stress&#8208;relaxation timescale is studied. This enables their use as cell culture matrices and bioinks for 3D bioprinting.








Abstract
Traditional synthetic covalent hydrogels lack the native tissue dynamics and hierarchical fibrous structure found in the extracellular matrix (ECM). These dynamics and fibrous nanostructures are imperative in obtaining the correct cell/material interactions. Consequently, the challenge to engineer functional dynamics in a fibrous hydrogel and recapitulate native ECM properties remains a bottle&#8208;neck to biomimetic hydrogel environments. Here,&#160;the molecular tuning of a supramolecular benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator via simple modulation of hydrophobic substituents is reported. This tuning results in fibrous hydrogels with accessible viscoelasticity over 5 orders of magnitude, while maintaining a constant equilibrium storage modulus. BTA hydrogelators are created with systematic variations in the number of&#160;hydrophobic carbon atoms, and this is observed to control the viscoelasticity and stress&#8208;relaxation timescales in a logarithmic fashion. Some of these&#160;BTA hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, self&#8208;healing, extrudable, and injectable, and can be 3D printed into multiple layers. These hydrogels show high cell viability for chondrocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells, establishing their use in tissue engineering applications. This simple molecular tuning by changing hydrophobicity (with just a few carbon atoms) provides precise control over the viscoelasticity and 3D printability in fibrillar hydrogels and can be ported onto other 1D self&#8208;assembling structures. The molecular control and design of hydrogel network dynamics can push the field of supramolecular chemistry toward&#160;the design of new ECM&#8208;mimicking hydrogelators for numerous cell&#8208;culture and tissue&#8208;engineering applications and give access toward&#160;highly biomimetic bioinks for bioprinting.

         <title>In Situ Grown Silver&#8211;Polymer Framework with Coordination Complexes for Functional Artificial Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF) is proposed, in which silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are in situ grown (for sensing) with simultaneous formation of metal&#8211;ligand coordination complexes (for actuating). The seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification at nano&#8208;/molecular levels in a single homogenous material platform simultaneously imparts multimodal sensation and excellent load&#8208;lifting into soft robots, thus fully mimicking sensory motions (proprio&#8208;/exteroception) of biological organisms.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sensing actuators are critical to artificial robots with biomimetic proprio&#8208;/exteroception properties of biological neuromuscular systems. Existing add&#8208;on approaches, which physically blend heterogeneous sensor/actuator components, fall short of yielding satisfactory solutions, considering their suboptimal interfaces, poor adhesion, and electronic/mechanical property mismatches. Here, a single homogeneous material platform is reported by creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF), thus realizing the seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification. The SPF&#8208;enabled elastomer is highly stretchable (1200%), conductive (0.076&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), and strong (0.76&#160;MPa in&#8208;strength), where the stretchable polymer matrix synthesis and in situ silver nanoparticles reduction are accomplished simultaneously. Benefiting from the multimodal sensing capability from its architecture itself (mechanical and thermal cues), self&#8208;sensing actuation (proprio&#8208;deformations and external stimuli perceptions) is achieved for the SPF&#8208;based pneumatic actuator, alongside an excellent load&#8208;lifting attribute (up to 3700 times its own weight), substantiating its advantage of the unified sensing&#8211;actuation feature in a single homogenous material. In view of its human somatosensitive muscular systems imitative functionality, the reported SPF bodes well for use with next&#8208;generation functional tissues, including artificial skins, human&#8211;machine interfaces, self&#8208;sensing robots, and otherwise dynamic materials.

     alt="In Situ Grown Silver&#8211;Polymer Framework with Coordination Complexes for Functional Artificial Tissues"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF) is proposed, in which silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are in situ grown (for sensing) with simultaneous formation of metal&#8211;ligand coordination complexes (for actuating). The seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification at nano-/molecular levels in a single homogenous material platform simultaneously imparts multimodal sensation and excellent load-lifting into soft robots, thus fully mimicking sensory motions (proprio-/exteroception) of biological organisms.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-sensing actuators are critical to artificial robots with biomimetic proprio-/exteroception properties of biological neuromuscular systems. Existing add-on approaches, which physically blend heterogeneous sensor/actuator components, fall short of yielding satisfactory solutions, considering their suboptimal interfaces, poor adhesion, and electronic/mechanical property mismatches. Here, a single homogeneous material platform is reported by creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF), thus realizing the seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification. The SPF-enabled elastomer is highly stretchable (1200%), conductive (0.076&#160;S&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and strong (0.76&#160;MPa in-strength), where the stretchable polymer matrix synthesis and in situ silver nanoparticles reduction are accomplished simultaneously. Benefiting from the multimodal sensing capability from its architecture itself (mechanical and thermal cues), self-sensing actuation (proprio-deformations and external stimuli perceptions) is achieved for the SPF-based pneumatic actuator, alongside an excellent load-lifting attribute (up to 3700 times its own weight), substantiating its advantage of the unified sensing&#8211;actuation feature in a single homogenous material. In view of its human somatosensitive muscular systems imitative functionality, the reported SPF bodes well for use with next-generation functional tissues, including artificial skins, human&#8211;machine interfaces, self-sensing robots, and otherwise dynamic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Controlled Helical Quantum Sieve Chiral Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;spin&#8208;sensitive&#8208;antenna (MSSA) that is capable of separation, recognition, and selective sensing to acheive spatiotemporal identification of chiral enantiomers is reported. By integrating the MSSA with a decision&#8208;making system based on neuromorphic artificial intelligence, rapid, transportable, and wearable spectrometry can be attained to distinguish and classify chiral molecules, such as butanol, limonene, and xylene isomers, with 95&#8211;98% accuracy.








Abstract
This article reports on a molecular&#8208;spin&#8208;sensitive&#8208;antenna (MSSA) that is based on stacked layers of organically functionalized graphene on a fibrous helical cellulose network for carrying out spatiotemporal identification of chiral enantiomers. The MSSA structures combine three complementary features: (i) chiral separation via a helical quantum sieve for chiral trapping, (ii) chiral recognition by a synthetically implanted spin&#8208;sensitive center in a graphitic lattice; and (iii) chiral selectivity by a chirality&#8208;induced&#8208;spin mechanism that polarizes the local electronic band&#8208;structure in graphene through chiral&#8208;activated Rashba spin&#8211;orbit interaction field. Combining the MSSA structures with decision&#8208;making principles based on neuromorphic artificial intelligence shows fast, portable, and wearable spectrometry for the detection and classification of pure and a mixture of chiral molecules, such as butanol (S and R), limonene (S and R), and xylene isomers, with 95&#8211;98% accuracy. These results can have a broad impact where the MSSA approach is central as a precautionary risk assessment against potential hazards impacting human health and the environment due to chiral molecules; furthermore, it acts as a dynamic monitoring tool of all parts of the chiral molecule life cycles.

         <title>Manipulation of Heterogeneous Surface Electric Potential Promotes Osteogenesis by Strengthening RGD Peptide Binding and Cellular Mechanosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By turning the dimension and aspect ratios of BaTiO3 (BTO) nanofillers,&#160;an anisotropic distribution of surface potential is observed on the BTO nanofibers/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) (BTNF) nanocomposite membrane after polarization. After covering supercritical&#8208;sized calvarial defects in rats, the BTNF composite membrane facilitates improved bone regeneration that leads to almost complete healing after 12 weeks post&#8208;implantation, which is mediated by the heterogeneous electrical&#160;microenvironment. 








Abstract
The heterogeneity of extracellular matrix (ECM) topology, stiffness, and architecture is a key factor modulating cellular behavior and osteogenesis. However, the effects of heterogeneous ECM electric potential at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on osteogenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, the heterogeneous distribution of surface potential&#160;is established by incorporating ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanofibers (BTNF) into poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) matrix based on phase&#8208;field and first&#8208;principles simulation. By optimizing the aspect ratios of BTNF fillers, the anisotropic distribution of surface potential on BTNF/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) nanocomposite membranes can be achieved by strong spontaneous electric polarization of BTNF fillers.&#160;These&#160;results indicate that heterogeneous surface potential distribution leads to a meshwork pattern of fibronectin (FN) aggregation, which increased FN&#8208;III7&#8208;10 (FN fragment) focal flexibility and anchor points as predicted by molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, integrin clustering, focal adhesion formation, cell spreading, and adhesion&#160;are enhanced sequentially. Increased traction of actin fibers amplifies mechanotransduction by promoting nuclear translocation of YAP/Runx2, which enhances osteogenesis in vitro and bone regeneration in vivo. The work thus provides fundamental insights into the biological effects of surface potential heterogeneity at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on osteogenesis, and also develops a new strategy to optimize the performance of electroactive biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.

         <title>Engineering Female Germline Stem Cells with Exocytotic Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots) are utilized for imaging and siRNA delivery in female germline stem cells (FGSCs). Pdots show excellent biocompatibility and minimally disturb the differentiation of FGSCs. Pdots can escape from lysosomes and undergo active exocytosis. Pdot&#8208;siRNA can down&#8208;regulate the expression levels of target genes in both cultured FGSCs and 3D ovarian organoids.








Abstract
Germline stem cells (GSCs) are the only cell population capable of passing genetic information to offspring, making them attractive targets in reproductive biology and fertility research. However, it is generally more difficult to introduce exogenous biomolecules into GSCs than other cell types, impeding the exploration and manipulation of these cells for biomedical purposes. Herein, semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots)&#8208;based nanocomplex Pdot&#8208;siRNA is developed and achieves effective knockdown of target genes in female germline stem cells (FGSCs). Advantage of high fluorescence brightness of Pdots is taken for comprehensive investigation of their cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and exocytosis in FGSCs. Importantly, Pdots show excellent biocompatibility and minimally disturb the differentiation of FGSCs. Intracellular Pdots escape from the lysosomes and undergo active exocytosis, which makes them ideal nanocarriers for bioactive cargos. Moreover, Pdot&#8208;siRNA can penetrate into 3D ovarian organoids derived from FGSCs and down&#8208;regulate the expression levels of target genes. This study investigates the interface between a type of theranostic nanoparticles and FGSCs for the first time and sheds light on the manipulation and medical application of FGSCs.

         <title>Multifunctional Conjugated Molecular Additives for Highly Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional conjugated additives (Fl&#8208;OEGA and Fl&#8208;C8A) are introduced into the perovskite&#8208;emitting layer of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). &#960;&#8208;Conjugated semiconducting additives effectively passivate defects, release residual tensile stress, and decrease the variation in the contact potential difference in perovskites with negligible sacrifice in charge transport, demonstrating highly efficient green&#8208;emitting PeLEDs with a maximum EQE of 21.3%.








Abstract
Further optimization of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is impeded by crystal deformation caused by residual stress and defect formation with subsequent non&#8208;radiative recombination. Molecular additives for defect passivation are widely studied; however, the majority have insulating properties that hinder charge injection and transport. Herein, highly efficient green&#8208;emitting PeLEDs are reported by introducing semiconducting molecular additives (Fl&#8208;OEGA and Fl&#8208;C8A). Transmission electron microscopy shows that conjugated additives exist primarily at the grain boundaries of perovskite, and Kelvin probe force microscopy confirms that the variation in contact potential difference between grain boundaries and perovskite crystal domains is significantly reduced. The residual tensile stress is reduced by 13% and the activation energy for ion migration increases in the Fl&#8208;OEGA&#8208;treated perovskite film, compared to those of the film without additives. Compared to insulating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)diethylamine (EDEA), the introduction of semiconducting additives prevents a significant reduction in the charge&#8208;transport capability. Furthermore, the PeLEDs with Fl&#8208;OEGA show a negligible shift in the turn&#8208;on voltage and a significantly smaller decrease in the current density with increasing Fl&#8208;OEGA compared to the devices with EDEA. Finally, the 3D CsPbBr3&#8211;PeLEDs show the highest external quantum efficiency of 21.3% by the incorporation of semiconducting Fl&#8208;OEGA as a new multifunctional additive.

         <title>Unraveling Thermal Transport Correlated with Atomistic Structures in Amorphous Gallium Oxide via Machine Learning Combined with Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based models and experimental observations leads to a deep understanding of atomistic structures, thermal transport properties, and structure&#8211;thermal property correlations for disordered materials. A physics&#8208;inspired structural descriptor, namely the structural similarity factor, is proposed for disordered phases, with which the underlying relationship between structures and thermal conductivities is predicted in a linear form.








Abstract
Thermal transport properties of amorphous materials are crucial for their emerging applications in energy and electronic devices. However, understanding and controlling thermal transport in disordered materials remains an outstanding challenge, owing to the intrinsic limitations of computational techniques and the lack of physically intuitive descriptors for complex atomistic structures. Here, it is shown how combining machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based models and experimental observations can help to accurately describe realistic structures, thermal transport properties, and structure&#8211;property maps for disordered materials, which is illustrated by a practical application on gallium oxide. First, the experimental evidence is reported to demonstrate that machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials, generated in a self&#8208;guided fashion with minimum quantum&#8208;mechanical computations, enable the accurate modeling of amorphous gallium oxide and its thermal transport properties. The atomistic simulations then reveal the microscopic changes in the short&#8208;range and medium&#8208;range order with density and elucidate how these changes can reduce localization modes and enhance coherences&#8217; contribution to heat transport. Finally, a physics&#8208;inspired structural descriptor for disordered phases is proposed, with which the underlying relationship between structures and thermal conductivities is predicted in a linear form. This work may shed light on the future accelerated exploration of thermal transport properties and mechanisms in disordered functional materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Recruitment of Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Precise Tumor Vascular Disruption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel VDA&#8208;free biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNP) that consists of a photothermal semiconducting polymer agent camouflaged with a platelet membrane is developed. SPNP exhibits a photothermally controlled recruitment behavior that augments targeting and accumulation of SPNP specifically around injured tumor vessels, achieving precise tumor vascular disruption, inhibition of splenomegaly, and reversion of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through two&#8208;stage light manipulation.








Abstract
Tumor vascular disrupting therapy has offered promising opportunities to treat cancer in clinical practice, whereas the overall therapeutic efficacy is notably limited due to the off&#8208;target effects and repeated dose toxicity of vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). To tackle this problem, a VDA&#8208;free biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNP) is herein reported for precise tumor vascular disruption through two&#8208;stage light manipulation. SPNP consists of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle as the photothermal agent camouflaged with platelet membranes that specifically target disrupted vasculature. Upon the first photoirradiation, SPNP administered in vivo generates mild hyperthermia to trigger tumor vascular hemorrhage, which activates the coagulation cascade and recruits more SPNP to injured blood vessels. Such enhanced tumor vascular targeting of photothermal agents enables intense hyperthermia to destroy the tumor vasculature during the second photoirradiation, leading to complete tumor eradication and efficient metastasis inhibition. Intriguingly, the mechanism study reveals that this vascular disruption strategy alleviates splenomegaly and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells. Therefore, this study not only illustrates a light&#8208;driven self&#8208;recruitment strategy to enhance tumor vascular disruption via a single dose of biomimetic therapeutics but also deciphers the immunotherapeutic role of vascular disruption therapy that is conducive to clinical studies.

         <title>Photoallosteric Polymersomes toward On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery and Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoallosteric polymersome undergoes an ultrafast conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix under near&#8208;infrared light illumination, because of the assembly&#8208;catalyzed photo&#8208;oxidation of the polymers in the nanoconfined vesicular membrane with minimized steric hindrance and energy barriers. The photoinduced allosteric behavior specifically enhances cell penetration and drug release properties for excellent cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Allosteric transitions can modulate the self&#8208;assembly and biological function of proteins. It remains, however, tremendously challenging to design synthetic allosteric polymeric assemblies with spatiotemporally switchable hierarchical structures and functionalities. Here, a photoallosteric polymersome is constructed that undergoes a rapid conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. In addition to improving nanoparticle cell penetration and lysosome escape, photoinduced allosteric behavior reconstructs the vesicular membrane structure, which stimulates the release of hydrophilic cytolytic peptide melittin and hydrophobic kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Combining on&#8208;demand delivery of multiple therapeutics with phototherapy results in apoptosis and immunogenic death of tumor cells, remold the immune microenvironment and achieve an excellent synergistic anticancer efficacy in vivo without tumor recurrence and metastasis. Such a light&#8208;modulated allosteric transition in non&#8208;photosensitive polymers provides new insight into the development of smart nanomaterials for biosensing and drug delivery applications.

         <title>Efficient Nanoscale Exciton Transport in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells Enables Reduced Bimolecular Recombination of Free Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed&#8208;photoluminescence quantum yield is used to evaluate the domain size of bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;based organic solar cells. It is found that efficient exciton dynamics are correlated with highly reduced bimolecular recombination.








Abstract
The highest&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV)&#8208;based solar cells, made from blends of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting organic semiconductors, are often characterized by strongly reduced (non&#8208;Langevin) bimolecular recombination. Although the origins of the reduced recombination are debated, mechanisms related to the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state and free&#8208;carrier encounter dynamics controlled by the size of donor and acceptor domains are proposed as underlying factors. Here,&#160;a novel photoluminescence&#8208;based probe is reported to accurately quantify the donor&#8211;acceptor domain size in OPV blends. Specifically, the domain size is measured in high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) systems and a comparative conventional fullerene system. It is found that the NFA&#8208;based blends form larger domains but that the expected reductions in bimolecular recombination attributed to the enhanced domain sizes are too small to account for the observed reduction factors. Further, it is shown that the reduction of bimolecular recombination is correlated to enhanced exciton dynamics within the NFA domains. This indicates that the processes responsible for efficient exciton transport also enable strongly non&#8208;Langevin recombination in high&#8208;efficiency NFA&#8208;based solar cells with low&#8208;energy offsets.

         <title>Electrochemical Healing of Fractured Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Empowered by a quantitative predictive framework, room&#8208;temperature area&#8208;selective nickel electrodeposition with a single commonly used electrolyte enables 100% restoration of tensile strength in a variety of fractured metals, including &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys and a 3D&#8208;printed complex structure. This framework could potentially enable a universal approach to repair fractured metals of various compositions, geometries, and length scales.








Abstract
Repairing fractured metals to extend their useful lifetimes advances sustainability and mitigates carbon emissions from metal mining and processing. While high&#8208;temperature techniques are being used to repair metals, the increasing ubiquity of digital manufacturing and &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys, as well as the integration of metals with polymers and electronics, call for radically different repair approaches.

     alt="Electrochemical Healing of Fractured Metals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empowered by a quantitative predictive framework, room-temperature area-selective nickel electrodeposition with a single commonly used electrolyte enables 100% restoration of tensile strength in a variety of fractured metals, including &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys and a 3D-printed complex structure. This framework could potentially enable a universal approach to repair fractured metals of various compositions, geometries, and length scales.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repairing fractured metals to extend their useful lifetimes advances sustainability and mitigates carbon emissions from metal mining and processing. While high-temperature techniques are being used to repair metals, the increasing ubiquity of digital manufacturing and &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys, as well as the integration of metals with polymers and electronics, call for radically different repair approaches. Herein, a framework for effective room-temperature repair of fractured metals using an area-selective nickel electrodeposition process refered to as electrochemical healing is presented. Based on a model that links geometric, mechanical, and electrochemical parameters to the recovery of tensile strength, this framework enables 100% recovery of tensile strength in nickel, low-carbon steel, two &#8220;unweldable&#8221; aluminum alloys, and a 3D-printed difficult-to-weld shellular structure using a single common electrolyte. Through a distinct energy-dissipation mechanism, this framework also enables up to 136% recovery of toughness in an aluminum alloy. To facilitate practical adoption, this work reveals scaling laws for the energetic, financial, and time costs of healing, and demonstrates the restoration of a functional level of strength in a fractured standard steel wrench. Empowered with this framework, room-temperature electrochemical healing can open exciting possibilities for the effective, scalable repair of metals in diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Manganese Atoms Stabilized on Ceria for Nitrous Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese atoms stabilized on ceria is the first highly active, selective, and stable material for ammonia oxidation to nitrous oxide. Atomic dispersion is achieved by simple impregnation and preserved over 70&#160;h on stream. Low&#8208;valent manganese species, complemented by the oxygen transfer ability of ceria, facilitate the supply of active oxygen species for the reaction, leading to the outstanding catalytic performance.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide, N2O, exhibits unique reactivity in oxidation catalysis, but the high manufacturing costs limit its prospective uses. Direct oxidation of ammonia, NH3, to N2O can ameliorate this issue but its implementation is thwarted by suboptimal catalyst selectivity and stability, and the lack of established structure&#8211;performance relationships. Systematic and controlled material nanostructuring offers an innovative approach for advancement in catalyst design. Herein low&#8208;valent manganese atoms stabilized on ceria, CeO2, are discovered as the first stable catalyst for NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two&#8208;fold higher productivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Detailed mechanistic, computational and kinetic studies reveal CeO2 as the mediator of oxygen supply, while undercoordinated manganese species activate O2 and facilitate N2O evolution via N&#63743;N bond formation between nitroxyl, HNO, intermediates. Synthesis via simple impregnation of a small metal quantity (1&#160;wt%) predominantly generates isolated manganese sites, while full atomic dispersion is achieved upon redispersion of sporadic oxide nanoparticles during reaction, as confirmed by advanced microscopic analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, manganese speciation is maintained, and no deactivation is observed over 70&#160;h on stream. CeO2&#8208;supported isolated transition metals emerge as a novel class of materials for N2O production, encouraging future studies to evaluate their potential in selective catalytic oxidations at large.

         <title>Reprogramming Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages by Nanoglycoclusters for Boosted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in hypoxic regions represent a promising target but are difficult for therapeutic intervention. A hypoxia&#8208;activated nanoglycocluster that orchestrates the size switch, affinity shift, and assembly efficiency change enables deep tumor penetration and efficient repolarization of hypoxic TAMs, facilitating the overall TAMs reprogramming effects. The tumor&#8208;penetrating nanoglycocluster can &#8220;warm&#8221; tumor immune microenvironment to inhibit tumor progression.








Abstract
The tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in intratumoral hypoxic regions are key drivers of immune escape. Reprogramming the hypoxic TAMs to antitumor phenotype holds great therapeutic benefits but remains challenging for current drugs. Here, an in situ activated nanoglycocluster is reported to realize effective tumor penetration and potent repolarization of hypoxic TAMs. Triggered by the hypoxia&#8208;upregulated matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2), the nanoglycocluster is self&#8208;assembled from the administered mannose&#8208;containing precursor glycopeptides and presents densely&#8208;arrayed mannoses to multivalently engage with mannose receptors on M2&#8208;like TAMs for efficient phenotype switch. By virtue of the high diffusivity of precursor glycopeptides due to their low molecular mass and weak affinity with TAMs in perivascular regions, the nanoglycoclusters are capable of substantially accumulating in hypoxic areas to strongly interact with local TAMs. This enables the efficient repolarization of overall TAMs with a higher rate than the small&#8208;molecule drug R848 and CD40 antibody, and beneficial therapeutic effects in mouse tumor models especially when combining with PD&#8208;1 antibody. This on&#8208;demand activated immunoagent is endowed with tumor&#8208;penetrating properties and inspires the design of diverse intelligent nanomedicines for hypoxia&#8208;related cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Quad&#8208;Nanopore Array for High&#8208;Resolution Single&#8208;Molecule Analysis and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quad&#8208;nanopore arrays are demonstrated to improve the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state nanopore&#8208;based sensing. The four closely arranged nanopores finely made by helium ion microscope alter the electric field distribution in the access region of the solid&#8208;state nanopores, creating regions that have a &#8220;retarding effect&#8221; for a single charged molecule, as proved by experiments and simulations.








Abstract
The ability to detect and distinguish biomolecules at the single&#8208;molecule level is at the forefront of today's biomedicine and analytical chemistry research. Increasing the dwell time of individual biomolecules in the sensing spot can greatly enhance the sensitivity of single&#8208;molecule methods. This is particularly important in solid&#8208;state nanopore sensing, where the detection of small molecules is often limited by the transit dwell time and insufficient temporal resolution. Here, a quad&#8208;nanopore is introduced, a square array of four nanopores (with a space interval of 30&#8211;50&#160;nm) to improve the detection sensitivity through electric field manipulation in the access region. It is shown that dwell times of short DNA strands (200&#160;bp) are prolonged in quad&#8208;nanopores as compared to single nanopores of the same diameter. The dependence of dwell times on the quad&#8208;pore spacing is investigated and it is found that the &#8220;retarding effect&#8221; increases with decreasing space intervals. Furthermore, ultra&#8208;short DNA (50&#160;bp) detection is demonstrated using a 10&#160;nm diameter quad&#8208;nanopore array, which is hardly detected by a single nanopore. Finally, the general utility of quad&#8208;nanopores has been verified by successful discrimination of two kinds of small molecules, metal&#8208;organic cage and bovine serum albumin (BSA).

         <title>TexSe1&#8211;x Photodiode Shortwave Infrared Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;stability, and low&#8208;cost Te0.7Se0.3 infrared photodiode is fabricated throughcomplementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible&#160;low&#8208;temperature thermal evaporation. The device achieves the fastest response among Te&#8208;based photodiodes, a low&#160;dark current density , the ability of matter identification, and superior electrical and thermal stabilities. This work paves a new way for CMOS&#8208;compatible infrared imagers.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared detectors&#160;are increasingly important in the fields of autonomous driving, food safety, disease diagnosis, and scientific research. However, mature short&#8208;wave infrared cameras such as InGaAs have the disadvantage of complex heterogeneous integration with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) readout circuits, leading to high cost and low imaging resolution. Herein, a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and high&#8208;stability TexSe1&#8211;x short&#8208;wave infrared photodiode detector is reported. The TexSe1&#8211;x thin film is fabricated through CMOS&#8208;compatible low&#8208;temperature evaporation and post&#8208;annealing process, showcasing the potential of direct integration on the readout circuit. The device demonstrates a broad&#8208;spectrum response of 300&#8211;1600&#160;nm, a room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity of 1.0 &#215; 1010 Jones, a &#8722;3&#160;dB bandwidth up to 116&#160;kHz, and a linear dynamic range of over 55&#160;dB, achieving the fastest response among Te&#8208;based photodiode devices and a dark current density 7 orders of magnitude smaller than Te&#8208;based photoconductive and field&#8208;effect transistor devices. With a simple Si3N4 packaging, the detector shows high electric stability and thermal stability, meeting the requirements for vehicular applications. Based on the optimized TexSe1&#8211;x photodiode detector, the applications in material identification and masking imaging is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;A high-performance, high-stability, and low-cost Te&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt; infrared photodiode is fabricated throughcomplementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible&#160;low-temperature thermal evaporation. The device achieves the fastest response among Te-based photodiodes, a low&#160;dark current density , the ability of matter identification, and superior electrical and thermal stabilities. This work paves a new way for CMOS-compatible infrared imagers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-wave infrared detectors&#160;are increasingly important in the fields of autonomous driving, food safety, disease diagnosis, and scientific research. However, mature short-wave infrared cameras such as InGaAs have the disadvantage of complex heterogeneous integration with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) readout circuits, leading to high cost and low imaging resolution. Herein, a low-cost, high-performance, and high-stability Te&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; short-wave infrared photodiode detector is reported. The Te&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; thin film is fabricated through CMOS-compatible low-temperature evaporation and post-annealing process, showcasing the potential of direct integration on the readout circuit. The device demonstrates a broad-spectrum response of 300&#8211;1600&#160;nm, a room-temperature specific detectivity of 1.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, a &#8722;3&#160;dB bandwidth up to 116&#160;kHz, and a linear dynamic range of over 55&#160;dB, achieving the fastest response among Te-based photodiode devices and a dark current density 7 orders of magnitude smaller than Te-based photoconductive and field-effect transistor devices. With a simple Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; packaging, the detector shows high electric stability and thermal stability, meeting the requirements for vehicular applications. Based on the optimized Te&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; photodiode detector, the applications in material identification and masking imaging is demonstrated. This work paves a new way for CMOS-compatible infrared imaging chips.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterosynaptic MoS2 Memtransistors Emulating Biological Neuromodulation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterosynaptic MoS2 memtransistors are developed to enable tunable synaptic plasticity by applying paired voltage pulses at the drain and gate terminals serving as presynaptic neurons and neuromodulators, respectively, for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic electronics. Consequently, a SET voltage of 2.0&#160;V and sub&#8208;1 fJ energy consumption are achieved, which are the best recorded values for three&#8208;terminal synaptic devices reported so far.








Abstract
Heterosynaptic neuromodulation is a key enabler for energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;level biological neural processing. However, such manifold synaptic modulation cannot be emulated using conventional memristors and synaptic transistors. Thus, reported herein is a three&#8208;terminal heterosynaptic memtransistor using an intentional&#8208;defect&#8208;generated molybdenum disulfide channel. Particularly, the defect&#8208;mediated space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited conduction in the ultrathin channel results in memristive switching characteristics between the source and drain terminals, which are further modulated using a gate terminal according to the gate&#8208;tuned filling of trap states. The device acts as an artificial synapse controlled by sub&#8208;femtojoule impulses from both the source and gate terminals, consuming lower energy than its biological counterpart. In particular, electrostatic gate modulation, corresponding to biological neuromodulation, additionally regulates the dynamic range and tuning rate of the synaptic weight, independent of the programming (source) impulses. Notably, this heterosynaptic modulation not only improves the learning accuracy and efficiency but also reduces energy consumption in the pattern recognition. Thus, the study presents a new route leading toward the realization of highly networked and energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic electronics.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate on Amorphous Graphene with Near 100% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous graphene that consists of disordered and strained pentagons, heptagons, and hexagons can catalyze the formation of&#160;ammonia at a&#160;high Faraday efficiency of &#8776;100% over a wide potential window, and crop yields are boosted when plants are cultivated with the electroreduced nitrate solution.








Abstract
Ammonia is an indispensable commodity in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. Direct nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroreduction is a decentralized route yet challenged by competing side reactions. Most catalysts are metal&#8208;based, and metal&#8208;free catalysts with high nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion activity are rarely reported. Herein, it is shown that amorphous graphene synthesized by laser induction and comprising strained and disordered pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons can electrocatalyze the eight&#8208;electron reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 with a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;100% and an ammonia production rate of 2859 &#181;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.93 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. X&#8208;ray pair&#8208;distribution function analysis and electron microscopy reveal the unique molecular features of amorphous graphene that facilitate NO3&#8722; reduction. In situ Fourier&#160;transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations establish the critical role of these features in stabilizing the&#160;reaction intermediates via structural relaxation. The enhanced catalytic activity enables the implementation of flow electrolysis for the on&#8208;demand synthesis and release of ammonia with &gt;70% selectivity, resulting in significantly increased yields and survival rates when applied to plant cultivation. The results of this study show significant promise for remediating nitrate&#8208;polluted water and completing the NOx cycle.

         <title>Centrifuge&#8208;Free Separation of Solution&#8208;Exfoliated 2D Nanosheets via Cross&#8208;Flow Filtration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polydisperse nature of graphene dispersions following liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation poses major manufacturing challenges since incumbent separation schemes rely on centrifugation, which is highly energy&#8208;intensive and possesses limited scalability. Here, cross&#8208;flow filtration is introduced as a centrifuge&#8208;free processing method that improves the throughput of graphene separation by two orders of magnitude in addition to substantially reducing environmental impact via inline recycling.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed graphene is a promising material for numerous high&#8208;volume applications including structural composites, batteries, sensors, and printed electronics. However, the polydisperse nature of graphene dispersions following liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation poses major manufacturing challenges, as incompletely exfoliated graphite flakes must be removed to achieve optimal properties and downstream performance. Incumbent separation schemes rely on centrifugation, which is highly energy&#8208;intensive and limits scalable manufacturing. Here, cross&#8208;flow filtration (CFF) is introduced as a centrifuge&#8208;free processing method that improves the throughput of graphene separation by two orders of magnitude. By tuning membrane pore sizes between microfiltration and ultrafiltration length scales, CFF can also be used for efficient recovery of solvents and stabilizing polymers. In this manner, life cycle assessment and techno&#8208;economic analysis reveal that CFF reduces greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy usage, water consumption, and specific production costs of graphene manufacturing by 57%, 56%, 63%, and 72%, respectively. To confirm that CFF produces electronic&#8208;grade graphene, CFF&#8208;processed graphene nanosheets are formulated into printable inks, leading to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thin&#8208;film conductivities exceeding 104 S m&#8722;1. This CFF methodology can likely be generalized to other van der Waals layered solids, thus enabling sustainable manufacturing of the diverse set of applications currently being pursued for 2D materials.

         <title>Robust Thermal Neutron Detection by LiInP2Se6 Bulk Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality, centimeter&#8208;sized LiInP2Se6 single crystals are successfully grown by the Bridgman method for the first time. The detailed and comprehensive crystal growth behaviors, microstructure features, electrical, and &#945;&#8208;particle/&#947;&#8208;ray/thermal neutron detection properties, defect mechanisms as well as radiation resistance are studied using a range of experimental and computational methods.








Abstract
Direct neutron detection based on semiconductor crystals holds promise to transform current neutron detector technologies and further boosts their widespread applications. It is, however, long impeded by the dearth of suitable materials in the form of sizeable bulk crystals. Here, high&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;sized LiInP2Se6 single crystals are developed using the Bridgman method and their structure and property characteristics are systematically investigated. The prototype detectors fabricated from the crystals demonstrate an energy resolution of 53.7% in response to &#945;&#8208;particles generated from an 241Am source and robust, well&#8208;defined response spectra to thermal neutrons that exhibit no polarization or degradation effects under prolonged neutron/&#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The primary mechanisms of Se&#8208;vacancy and InLi antisite defects in the carrier trapping process are also identified. Such insights are critical for further enhancing the energy resolution of LiInP2Se6 bulk crystals toward the intrinsic level (&#8776;8.6% as indicated by the chemical vapor transport&#8208;grown thin crystals).

&lt;p&gt;High-quality, centimeter-sized LiInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals are successfully grown by the Bridgman method for the first time. The detailed and comprehensive crystal growth behaviors, microstructure features, electrical, and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-particle/&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-ray/thermal neutron detection properties, defect mechanisms as well as radiation resistance are studied using a range of experimental and computational methods.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct neutron detection based on semiconductor crystals holds promise to transform current neutron detector technologies and further boosts their widespread applications. It is, however, long impeded by the dearth of suitable materials in the form of sizeable bulk crystals. Here, high-quality centimeter-sized LiInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals are developed using the Bridgman method and their structure and property characteristics are systematically investigated. The prototype detectors fabricated from the crystals demonstrate an energy resolution of 53.7% in response to &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-particles generated from an &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am source and robust, well-defined response spectra to thermal neutrons that exhibit no polarization or degradation effects under prolonged neutron/&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-ray irradiation. The primary mechanisms of Se-vacancy and In&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt; antisite defects in the carrier trapping process are also identified. Such insights are critical for further enhancing the energy resolution of LiInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; bulk crystals toward the intrinsic level (&#8776;8.6% as indicated by the chemical vapor transport-grown thin crystals). These results pave the way for practically adopting LiInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals in new-generation solid-state neutron detectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preventing Vanishing Gradient Problem of Hardware Neuromorphic System by Implementing Imidazole&#8208;Based Memristive ReLU Activation Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly compact and energy&#8208;efficient rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation neuron is demonstrated using a 2T1R structure with a hybrid memristor using a copolymer/inorganic bilayer to emulate volatile and gradual conductance modulation. It is confirmed that memristor&#8208;based ReLU (mReLU) can effectively reduce the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. Furthermore, an mReLU&#8208;based fully analog neuromorphic system is proposed.








Abstract
With advances in artificial intelligent services, brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic systems with synaptic devices are recently attracting significant interest to circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck. However, the increasing trend of deep neural network parameters causes huge power consumption and large area overhead of a nonlinear neuron electronic circuit, and it incurs a vanishing gradient problem. Here, a memristor&#8208;based compact and energy&#8208;efficient neuron device is presented to implement a rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation function. To emulate the volatile and gradual switching of the ReLU function, a copolymer memristor with a hybrid structure is proposed using a copolymer/inorganic bilayer. The functional copolymer film developed by introducing imidazole functional groups enables the formation of nanocluster&#8208;type pseudo&#8208;conductive filaments by boosting the nucleation of Cu nanoclusters, causing gradual switching. The ReLU neuron device is successfully demonstrated by integrating the memristor with amorphous InGaZnO thin&#8208;film transistors, and achieves 0.5&#160;pJ of energy consumption based on sub&#8208;10&#160;&#181;A operation current and high&#8208;speed switching of 650&#160;ns. Furthermore, device&#8208;to&#8208;system&#8208;level simulation using neuron devices on the MNIST dataset demonstrates that the vanishing gradient problem is effectively resolved by five&#8208;layer deep neural networks. The proposed neuron device will enable the implementation of high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient hardware neuromorphic systems.

         <title>In Situ STING&#8208;Activating Nanovaccination with TIGIT Blockade for Enhanced Immunotherapy of Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1&#8208;Resistant Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanoplatform with spatiotemporally releasing of T&#8208;cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine&#8208;based inhibitory motif domain &#65288;TIGIT&#65289; block peptide in the tumor environment and cascade activating chemoagents inside tumor cells is constructed. Through blocking the TIGIT checkpoint and in situ activating stimulator of interferon genes signaling pathway, the nanoplatform&#160;enables efficient antitumor immune response to inhibit tumor growth of anti&#8208;programmed&#8208;cell&#8208;death&#8208;protein&#8208;1&#8208;resistant tumors.








Abstract
Immunotherapies comprising programmed cell death protein 1/PD ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective cancer treatments. However, the low response rate and immunoresistance resulting from alternative immune checkpoint upregulation and inefficient immune stimulation by T cells are problematic. The present report describes a biomimetic nanoplatform that simultaneously blocks the alternative T&#8208;cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine&#8208;based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT) checkpoint and activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway in situ for enhanced antitumor immunity. The nanoplatform is engineered by fusing a red blood cell membrane with glutathione&#8208;responsive liposome&#8208;encapsulated cascade&#8208;activating chemoagents (&#946;&#8208;lapachone and tirapazamine), and anchoring them with a detachable TIGIT block peptide (named as RTLT). In the tumor environment, the peptide is spatiotemporally released to reverse T&#8208;cell exhaustion and restore antitumor immunity. The cascade activation of chemotherapeutic agents causes DNA damage and inhibits the repair of double&#8208;stranded DNA, which induces robust in situ STING activation for an efficient immune response. The RTLT inhibits anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1&#8208;resistant tumor growth, and prevents tumor metastasis and recurrence in vivo by inducing antigen&#8208;specific immune memory. This biomimetic nanoplatform thus provides a promising strategy for in situ cancer vaccination.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Inspired Bacterial Cellulose/Mica Nanopaper with Excellent Mechanical and Electrical Insulating Properties by Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nacre&#8208;inspired nanopaper is fabricated through an aerosol&#8208;assisted biosynthesis (AABS) strategy. Based on the AABS strategy and biomimetic structure design, the nanopaper has excellent mechanical properties, high dielectric strength, and ultralong corona resistance time. The dielectric&#8208;mechanical comprehensive performance of the nanopaper is far beyond that of various commercial mica papers.








Abstract
The exploration of extreme environments has become necessary for understanding and changing nature. However, the development of functional materials suitable for extreme conditions is still insufficient. Herein, a kind of nacre&#8208;inspired bacterial cellulose (BC)/synthetic mica (S&#8208;Mica) nanopaper with excellent mechanical and electrical insulating properties that has excellent tolerance to extreme conditions is reported. Benefited from the nacre&#8208;inspired structure and the 3D network of BC, the nanopaper exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including high tensile strength (375&#160;MPa), outstanding foldability, and bending fatigue resistance. In addition, S&#8208;Mica arranged in layers endows the nanopaper with remarkable dielectric strength (145.7 kV&#160;mm&#8722;1) and ultralong corona resistance life. Moreover, the nanopaper is highly resistant to alternating high and low temperatures, UV light, and atomic oxygen, making it an ideal candidate for extreme environment&#8208;resistant materials.

         <title>Bionic Tactile&#8208;Gustatory Receptor for Object Identification Based on All&#8208;Polymer Electrochemical Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iontronic tactile&#8208;gustatory receptors are designed using all&#8208;polymer electrochemical transistors, such that a single device can accurately recognize various objects perceived by the human tactile and gustatory system. Additionally, by combining device design and microfabrication innovation, an unprecedented device density of 104 167&#160;transistors&#160;cm&#8722;2 (yield of 97%) is realized, 1 to 5 orders higher than reported values.








Abstract
Human sensory receptors enable the real world to be perceived effortlessly. Hence, massive efforts have been devoted to the development of bionic receptors capable of identifying objects. Unfortunately, most of the existing devices are limited to single sensory emulation and are established on solid&#8208;state electronic technologies, which are incompatible with the biological reactions occurring in electrolyte media. Here, an iontronic tactile&#8208;gustatory receptor using an all&#8208;polymer electrochemical transistor (AECT) is presented. The sensor is biocompatible with the operation voltage of 0.1&#160;V, which is 1 to 2 orders lower than those of reported values. By this study, one receptor is able to accurately recognize various objects perceived by the human tactile and gustatory system without complex circuitry. Additionally, to promote its further application, flexible AECT arrays with channel length of 2&#160;&#181;m and density of 104 167&#160;transistors&#160;cm&#8722;2 (yield of 97%) are fabricated, 1 to 5 orders higher than those of related works. Finally, a flexible integrated network for electrocardiogram recording is successfully constructed. This study moves a step forward toward state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bionic sensors.

Additionally, to promote its further application, flexible AECT arrays with channel length of 2&#160;&#181;m and density of 104 167&#160;transistors&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (yield of 97%) are fabricated, 1 to 5 orders higher than those of related works. Finally, a flexible integrated network for electrocardiogram recording is successfully constructed. This study moves a step forward toward state-of-the-art bionic sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Performance, Serially Stackable, Breeze Driven Triboelectric Generator via Ambient Air Ionizing Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated charge&#8208;polarization&#8208;based flutter&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator (CPF&#8208;TENG) that can generate high electrical output by utilizing ambient air ionizing channel (AAIC) is fabricated. Even with low velocity wind input, CPF&#8208;TENG with AAIC can generate high electrical output so the stacked device can completely harvest unidirectional wind energy. Consequently, the device can turn on several electronics and produce 342.3&#160;&#181;L&#160;h&#8722;1 of hydrogen.








Abstract
Currently, wind energy harvesting is in the limelight. However, with the existing electromagnetic wind generators, it is difficult to harvest multifariously&#8208;wasted breezes. To harvest energy from winds at a wide range of speeds, wind&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are studied. However, a critical limitation of general wind&#8208;driven TENGs is that their power output is low. Therefore, an innovative strategy is necessary to generate high output power even from breeze. Herein, an approach to test a charge&#8208;polarization&#8208;based flutter&#8208;driven TENG (CPF&#8208;TENG) with ambient air ionizing channel (AAIC) is reported. Owing to AAIC, the device generates peak voltage and current outputs of 2000&#160;V and 4&#160;A, respectively. Moreover, because the proposed CPF&#8208;TENG can generate power from breeze, it can be stacked in series to completely harvest wind energy. The stacked CPF&#8208;TENG is demonstrated to operate 3000 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and 12 hygrometers, separately, and produce hydrogen at a rate of 342.3&#160;&#181;L&#160;h&#8722;1 with the electrolysis cell.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reconfigured, Dual&#8208;Layered Artificial Interphase Toward High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spontaneously reconfigured, dual&#8208;layered artificial interphase of LiF/LiBO&#8211;Ag is proposed to stabilize Li anode at high current densities. The LiF/LiBO top layer guarantees fast Li&#8208;ion transition, and the lithiophilic Li&#8211;Ag bottom layer enables uniform Li deposition. Benefiting from the well&#8208;orchestrated interphase design, the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries demonstrate a high practical specific energy (448.7&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1), superior high&#8208;rate performances, and high safety.








Abstract
The uncontrollable dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have long plagued the practical application of Li metal batteries. Herein, a dual&#8208;layered artificial interphase LiF/LiBO&#8211;Ag is demonstrated that is simultaneously reconfigured via an electrochemical process to stabilize the lithium anode. This dual&#8208;layered interphase consists of a heterogeneous LiF/LiBO glassy top layer with ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conductivity and lithiophilic Li&#8211;Ag alloy bottom layer, which synergistically regulates the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, even at high current densities. As a result, Li||Li symmetric cells with LiF/LiBO&#8211;Ag interphase achieve an ultralong lifespan (4500&#160;h) at an ultrahigh current density and area capacity (20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 20&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2). LiF/LiBO&#8211;Ag@Li anodes are successfully applied in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, showing excellent cycling performances in symmetric cells (8&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, 5000&#160;h) and full cells. Furthermore, a practical quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell coupling with a high&#8208;nickel cathode exhibits stable cycling with a capacity retention of over 91% after 60 cycles at 0.5&#160;C, which is comparable or even better than that in liquid&#8208;state pouch cells. Additionally, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell (10.75&#160;Ah, 448.7&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) is successfully accomplished. This well&#8208;orchestrated interphase design provides new guidance in engineering highly stable interphase toward practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Bifunctional Gas Diffusion Electrode Enables In Situ Separation and Conversion of CO2 to Ethylene from Dilute Stream</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional gas diffusion electrode is reported for integrated CO2 separation and electrochemical conversion to ethylene from low concentration CO2 stream (10&#160;vol%), bypassing the prerequisite of energy&#8208;intensive incumbent CO2 capture and regeneration, compression, and transportation steps.








Abstract
The requirement of concentrated carbon dioxide (CO2) feedstock significantly limits the economic feasibility of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) which often involves multiple intermediate processes, including CO2 capture, energy&#8208;intensive regeneration, compression, and transportation. Herein, a bifunctional gas diffusion electrode (BGDE) for separation and eCO2R from a low&#8208;concentration CO2 stream is reported. The BGDE is demonstrated for the selective production of ethylene (C2H4) by combining high&#8208;density&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;derived porous carbon (HPC) as a physisorbent with polycrystalline copper as a conversion catalyst. The BGDE shows substantial tolerance to 10 vol% CO2 exhibiting a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;45% toward C2H4 at a current density of 80 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previous reports that utilized such partial pressure (PCO2 = 0.1 atm and above) and unaltered polycrystalline copper. Molecular dynamics simulation and mixed gas permeability assessment reveal that such selective performance is ensured by high CO2 uptake of the microporous HPC as well as continuous desorption owing to the molecular diffusion and concentration gradient created by the binary flow of CO2 and nitrogen (CO2|N2) within the sorbent boundary. Based on detailed techno&#8208;economic analysis, it is concluded that this in situ process can be economically compelling by precluding the C2H4 production cost associated with the energy&#8208;intensive intermediate steps of the conventional decoupled process.

         <title>Amorphous Copper&#8208;Based Nanoparticles with Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Phosphorescence for Ultrasensing 2,4,6&#8208;Trinitrotoluene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel amorphous copper&#8208;based nanoparticles with ideal microstructure and abundant recongition sites, that are able to facilitate the electron transfer, are designed&#160;and prepared for phosphorescence&#8208;off detection of airborne 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene microparticulates with excellent specificity, instantaneous response time, and ultralow detection limit, which not only deepens the insights of photochemistry but also stretches metal&#8208;based nanostructures to new limits.








Abstract
Amorphous metal&#8208;based nanostructures have attracted great attention recently due to their facilitative electron transfer and abundant reactive sites, whereas it remains enigmatic as to whether amorphous copper&#8208;based nanoparticles (CuNPs) can be achieved. Here, for synthesizing amorphous CuNPs, glutathione is adopted as a ligand to inhibit the nucleation and crystallization process via its electrostatic repulsion. By subtly tailoring the solvent polarity, not only can amorphous glutathione&#8208;functionalized CuNPs (GSH&#8208;CuNPs) with phosphorescent performance be achieved after transferring the non&#8208;conjugation of GSH ligand to through&#8208;space conjugation, namely clusterization&#8208;triggered emission, but also the phosphorescence&#8208;off of GSH&#8208;CuNPs toward 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT) can be realized by the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer process through the hydrogen bond channel, which is established between carboxyl and amino groups of GSH&#8208;CuNPs with the nitryl group of TNT.

&lt;p&gt;Novel amorphous copper-based nanoparticles with ideal microstructure and abundant recongition sites, that are able to facilitate the electron transfer, are designed&#160;and prepared for phosphorescence-off detection of airborne 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene microparticulates with excellent specificity, instantaneous response time, and ultralow detection limit, which not only deepens the insights of photochemistry but also stretches metal-based nanostructures to new limits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous metal-based nanostructures have attracted great attention recently due to their facilitative electron transfer and abundant reactive sites, whereas it remains enigmatic as to whether amorphous copper-based nanoparticles (CuNPs) can be achieved. Here, for synthesizing amorphous CuNPs, glutathione is adopted as a ligand to inhibit the nucleation and crystallization process via its electrostatic repulsion. By subtly tailoring the solvent polarity, not only can amorphous glutathione-functionalized CuNPs (GSH-CuNPs) with phosphorescent performance be achieved after transferring the non-conjugation of GSH ligand to through-space conjugation, namely clusterization-triggered emission, but also the phosphorescence-off of GSH-CuNPs toward 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) can be realized by the photoinduced electron-transfer process through the hydrogen bond channel, which is established between carboxyl and amino groups of GSH-CuNPs with the nitryl group of TNT. Benefitting from the intrinsic superiorities of the amorphous CuNPs, desired phosphorescence and detection performances of GSH-CuNPs toward airborne TNT microparticulates are undoubtedly realized, including high quantum yield (13.22%), excellent specificity in 33 potential interferents, instantaneous response, and ultralow detection limit (1.56 pg).

         <title>1D Electronic Flat Bands in Untwisted Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a strategy to create 1D&#8208;EFBs in untwisted heterostructures and experimentally realize it by van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy. The idea is that, the atomic relaxations of the anisotropic rectangular vdW layers introduce 1D buckling reversal regions, where electronic states are isolated in one direction and are localised in 1D extended states along the orthogonal direction. Therefore, 1D&#8208;EFBs are naturally emergent.








Abstract
After the preparation of 2D electronic flat band (EFB) in van der Waals (vdW) superlattices, recent measurements suggest the existence of 1D electronic flat bands (1D&#8208;EFBs) in twisted vdW bilayers. However, the realization of 1D&#8208;EFBs is experimentally elusive in untwisted 2D layers, which is desired considering their fabrication and scalability. Herein, the discovery of 1D&#8208;EFBs is reported in an untwisted in situ&#8208;grown two atomic&#8208;layer Bi(110) superlattice self&#8208;aligned on an SnSe(001) substrate using scanning probe microscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. While the Bi&#8211;Bi dimers of Bi zigzag (ZZ) chains are buckled, the epitaxial lattice mismatch between the Bi and SnSe layers induces two 1D buckling reversal regions (BRRs) extending along the ZZ direction in each Bi(110)&#8208;11&#160;&#215;&#160;11 supercell. A series of 1D&#8208;EFBs arises spatially following BRRs that isolate electronic states along the armchair (AC) direction and localize electrons in 1D extended states along ZZ due to quantum interference at a topological node. This work provides a generalized strategy for engineering 1D&#8208;EFBs in utilizing lattice mismatch between untwisted rectangular vdW layers.

         <title>Tailoring the Plasticity of Topologically Close&#8208;Packed Phases via the Crystals&#8217; Fundamental Building Blocks</title>

A strategy to understand and tailor the deformability of brittle topologically close&#8208;packed precipitates in advanced alloys using the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase as a model material is presented. The plasticity of the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase is controlled by the Laves phase building block in its unit cell, leading to changes in hardness and stiffness, as well as a shift in the slip mechanism. The results provide opportunities for tailoring the plasticity of these phases by manipulating the interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the crystal building blocks in their unit cells.








Abstract
Brittle topologically close&#8208;packed precipitates form in many advanced alloys. Due to their complex structures, little is known about their plasticity. Here, a strategy is presented to understand and tailor the deformability of these complex phases by considering the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase as an archetypal material. The plasticity of the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase is controlled by the Laves phase building block that forms parts of its unit cell. It is found that between the bulk C15&#8211;NbCo2 Laves and Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phases, the interplanar spacing and local stiffness of the Laves phase building block change, leading to a strong reduction in hardness and stiffness, as well as a transition from synchroshear to crystallographic slip. Furthermore, as the composition changes from Nb6Co7 to Nb7Co6, the Co atoms in the triple layer are substituted such that the triple layer of the Laves phase building block becomes a slab of pure Nb, resulting in inhomogeneous changes in elasticity and a transition from crystallographic slip to a glide&#8208;and&#8208;shuffle mechanism. These findings open opportunities to purposefully tailor the plasticity of these topologically close&#8208;packed phases in the bulk by manipulating the interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the fundamental crystal building blocks at the atomic scale.

         <title>Coacervation&#8208;Mediated Cytocompatible Formation of Supramolecular Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Evolving Macropores for 3D Multicellular Spheroid Culture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a new synthetic strategy to engineer macroporous hydrogels (MPH) via the coacervation process of supramolecular assemblies crosslinked by host&#8211;guest complexation between &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anthracene dimer. The excellent structural dynamics and the cytocompatible void&#8208;forming process of MPH can better accommodate the dramatic volumetric expansion associated with the colony growth of encapsulated cells, thereby facilitating their cellular functions.








Abstract
Coacervation driven liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of biopolymers has aroused considerable attention for diverse applications, especially for the construction of microstructured polymeric materials. Herein, a coacervate&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogel transition strategy is developed to create macroporous hydrogels (MPH), which&#160;are formed via the coacervation process of supramolecular assemblies (SA) built by the host&#8211;guest complexation between &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anthracene dimer. The weak and reversible supramolecular crosslinks endow the SA with liquid&#8208;like rheological properties, which facilitate the formation of SA&#8208;derived macroporous coacervates and the subsequent transition to MPH (pore size &#8776; 100&#160;&#181;m). The excellent structural dynamics (derived from SA) and the cytocompatible void&#8208;forming process of MPH can better accommodate the dramatic volumetric expansion associated with colony growth of encapsulated multicellular spheroids compared with the non&#8208;porous static hydrogel with similar initial mechanical properties. The findings of this work not only provide valuable guidance to the design of biomaterials with self&#8208;evolving structures but also present a promising strategy for 3D multicellular spheroid culture and other diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Thermally Latent Bases in Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks and their Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally latent ammonium salt is synthesized and its on&#8208;demand release of a strong base is exploited for the selective activation of bond&#8208;exchange reactions in covalently crosslinked polymers. The thermally triggered (and local) change from a creep resistant behavior to a highly dynamic polymer network is demonstrated and applied for the reshaping/welding of 3D&#8208;printed objects and various composite structures.








Abstract
A novel strategy allowing temporal control of dynamic bond exchange in covalently crosslinked polymer networks via latent transesterification catalysts is introduced. Obtained by a straightforward air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant synthesis, the latent catalyst is designed for an irreversible temperature&#8208;mediated release of a strong organic base. Its long&#8208;term inactivity at temperatures below 50 &#176;C provides the unique opportunity to equip dynamic covalent networks with creep resistance and high bond&#8208;exchange rates, once activated. The presented thermally latent base catalyst is conveniently introducible in readily available building blocks and, as proof of concept, applied in a radically polymerized thiol&#8211;ene network. Light&#8208;mediated curing is used for 3D&#8208;printing functional objects, on which the possibility of spatially controlled reshaping and welding based on dynamic transesterification is illustrated. Since the catalyst is thermally activated, limitations regarding sample geometry and optical transparency do not apply, which facilitates a transfer to well&#8208;established industrial technologies. Consequently, fiber&#8208;reinforced and highly filled magneto&#8208;active thiol&#8211;ene polymer composites are fabricated by a thermal curing approach. The on&#8208;demand activation of dynamic transesterification is demonstrated by (magneto&#8208;assisted) reshaping experiments, highlighting a wide range of potential future applications offered by the presented concept.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy allowing temporal control of dynamic bond exchange in covalently crosslinked polymer networks via latent transesterification catalysts is introduced. Obtained by a straightforward air- and water-tolerant synthesis, the latent catalyst is designed for an irreversible temperature-mediated release of a strong organic base. Its long-term inactivity at temperatures below 50 &#176;C provides the unique opportunity to equip dynamic covalent networks with creep resistance and high bond-exchange rates, once activated. The presented thermally latent base catalyst is conveniently introducible in readily available building blocks and, as proof of concept, applied in a radically polymerized thiol&#8211;ene network. Light-mediated curing is used for 3D-printing functional objects, on which the possibility of spatially controlled reshaping and welding based on dynamic transesterification is illustrated. Since the catalyst is thermally activated, limitations regarding sample geometry and optical transparency do not apply, which facilitates a transfer to well-established industrial technologies. Consequently, fiber-reinforced and highly filled magneto-active thiol&#8211;ene polymer composites are fabricated by a thermal curing approach. The on-demand activation of dynamic transesterification is demonstrated by (magneto-assisted) reshaping experiments, highlighting a wide range of potential future applications offered by the presented concept.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolytes with Solvating Inner Sheath Engineering for Practical Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new category of electrolyte solvation structure is presented by engineering the solvating inner sheath for sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In a localized saturated electrolyte with 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, the saturated inner sheath features increased Na+&#8208;anion complex and decreased Na+&#8208;solvent distance, providing a durable Na anode interface and a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;solid sulfur conversion.








Abstract
Sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries with durable Na&#8208;metal stability, shuttle&#8208;free cyclability, and long lifespan are promising to large&#8208;scale energy storages. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses huge challenges with the existing electrolytes. Herein, a localized saturated electrolyte (LSE) is proposed with 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) as an inner sheath solvent, which represents a new category of electrolyte for Na&#8211;S system. Unlike the traditional high concentration electrolytes, the LSE is realized with a low salt&#8208;to&#8208;solvent ratio and low diluent&#8208;to&#8208;solvent ratio, which pushes the limit of localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE). The appropriate molecular structure and solvation ability of MeTHF regulate a saturated inner sheath, which features a reinforced coordination of Na+ to anions, enlarged Na+&#8208;solvent distance, and weakened anion&#8208;diluent interaction. Such electrolyte configuration is found to be the key to build a sustainable interphase and a quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;solid sulfur redox process, making a dendrite&#8208;inhibited and shuttle&#8208;free Na&#8211;S battery possible. With this electrolyte, pouch cells with decent cycling performance under rather demanding conditions are demonstrated.

         <title>Skeletal Network Enabling New&#8208;Generation Thermoplastic Vulcanizates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new design concept of a skeletal network is pioneered to realize the upcycling of conventional vulcanizates. The resultant materials, integrated with the superior strength/elasticity of conventional vulcanizates and the extrudable reprocessability of thermoplastics, can exploit a feasible alternative toward a new generation of thermoplastic vulcanizates.








Abstract
Upcycling of cross&#8208;linked rubbers is pressing. The introduction of dynamic covalent bonds into the networks is a popular tactic for recycling thermosetting polymers, but it is very challenging to integrate engineering performance and continuous yet stable reprocessability. Based on traditional rubber formulations, herein, a straightforward strategy is presented for constructing a skeletal network (SN) through interfacial crosslinking and percolation of rubbery granules in a rubber matrix. Rapid exchange reactions involving dynamic interfacial sulfides realize repeated &#8220;fragmentation and healing&#8221; in the solid&#8208;state and consequent reconfiguration of the SN topology of the elastomer, thus endowing the resultant SN elastomer with continuous yet stable re&#8208;extrudability. These SN elastomers with hierarchical structures exhibit high gel contents, high resilience, low creep, and reinforcibility competitive to traditional vulcanizates. Specifically, SN elastomers exhibit better overall performance than commercial thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) materials. Overall, a new concept of thermoplastic vulcanizates is proposed, which will promote the sustainable development of rubbers.

         <title>Solvation Structure Modulation of High&#8208;Voltage Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance K&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the tetramethylene sulfone (TMS):dimethyl carbonate (DMC) binary electrolyte system, carbonate molecules and anions with better solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase forming capability are more likely to enter the solvation shell of K+, while sulfone molecules get close to the anions. As a result, both the storage of K+ at the graphite anode and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) at the graphite cathode are enhanced.








Abstract
Due to the advantages of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) and abundant resources, potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;carbon batteries (K&#8208;DCBs) have wide application prospects. However, conventional carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolyte systems have obvious drawbacks such as poor oxidation resistance and difficulty in sustaining the anion intercalation process at high voltages, which seriously affect the capacity and cycle performance of K&#8208;DCBs. Therefore, a rational design of more efficient novel electrolyte systems is urgently required to realize high&#8208;performance K&#8208;DCBs. Herein, a solvation structure modulation strategy for the K&#8208;DCB electrolyte systems is reported. Consequently, substantial K+ ion storage improvement at the graphite anode and enhanced bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) intercalation capacity at the graphite cathode are successfully realized simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the assembled K&#8208;DCB exhibited a discharge capacity of 103.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and after 400 cycles, &#8776;90% capacity retention is observed. Moreover, the energy density of the K&#8208;DCB full cell reached 157.6&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, which is the best performance in reported K&#8208;DCBs till date. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of solvation modulation in improving the performance of K&#8208;DCBs.

         <title>Role of Interfacial Defects on Electro&#8211;Chemo&#8211;Mechanical Failure of Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte induced by interfacial defects is revealed by multiphysics simulation, through visualization of stress distribution, relative damage, and crack formation. It is found that the geometry of defect and aspect ratio are the dominating factors for the failure process of solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This work shows promising guidelines for suppressing failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte.








Abstract
High&#8208;stress field generated by electroplating of lithium (Li) in pre&#8208;existing defects is the main reason for mechanical failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte because it drives crack propagation in electrolyte, followed by Li filament growth inside and even internal short&#8208;circuit if the filament reaches another electrode. To understand the role of interfacial defects on mechanical failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte, an electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical model is built to visualize distribution of stress, relative damage, and crack formation during electrochemical plating of Li in defects. Geometry of interfacial defect is found as dominating factor for concentration of local stress field while semi&#8208;sphere defect delivers less accumulation of damage at initial stage and the longest failure time for disintegration of electrolyte. Aspect ratio, as a key geometric parameter of defect, is investigated to reveal its impact on failure of electrolyte. Pyramidic defect with low aspect ratio of 0.2&#8211;0.5 shows branched region of damage near interface, probably causing surface pulverization of solid&#8208;state electrolyte, whereas high aspect ratio over 3.0 will trigger accumulation of damage in bulk electrolyte. The correction between interfacial defect and electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte is expected to provide insightful guidelines for interface design in high&#8208;power&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Confined Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Mediated Cation Diffusion through Layered Membranes for High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Ion transport in random stacked laminar graphene oxide (GO) membrane suffers from limited mass transport brought by insufficient wetting. The pre&#8208;addition of ionic liquids (ILs) in the layer spacing provides a continuous medium for fast ion transport, greatly solving this problem. Meanwhile, nanoconfinement between the charged GO nanosheets promotes the dissociation of ILs and rearrangement, bringing in additional space charges for the osmotic energy conversion.








Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes act as the core components in osmotic energy harvesting, but remain with deficiencies such as low ion selectivity and a tendency to swell. 2D nanofluidic membranes as competitive candidates are still subjected to limited mass transport brought by insufficient wetting and poor stability in water. Here, an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused graphene oxide (GO@IL) membrane with ultrafast ion transport ability is reported, and how the confined ionic liquid mediates selective cation diffusion is revealed. The infusion of ionic liquids endows the 2D membrane with excellent mechanical strength, anti&#8208;swelling properties, and good stability in aqueous electrolytes. Importantly, immiscible ionic liquids also provide a medium, allowing partial dehydration for ultrafast ion transport. Through molecular dynamics simulation and finite element modeling, that GO nanosheets induce ionic liquids to rearrange, bringing in additional space charges, which can be coupled with GO synergistically, is proved. By mixing 0.5/0.01&#160;m NaCl solution, the power density can achieve a record value of &#8776;6.7&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;art GO&#8208;based membranes. This work opens up a new route for boosting nanofluidic energy conversion because of the diversity of the ILs and 2D materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Bidirectional Optoelectronic Synapses based on 2D Molecular Crystal Heterojunctions for Motion Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bidirectional (excitatory and inhibitory) optoelectronic synapses are successfully prepared by using 2D molecular crystal heterojunctions. Superior contrast ratios (CR) of 1.53 &#215; 103 are demonstrated, transcending previous optoelectronic synapses, and the devices are applied for motion detection with an accuracy exceeding 90%.








Abstract
Light&#8208;stimulated optoelectronic synaptic devices are fundamental compositions of the neuromorphic vision system. However, there are still huge challenges to achieving both bidirectional synaptic behaviors under light stimuli and high performance. Herein, a bilayer 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) p&#8208;n heterojunction is developed to achieve high&#8208;performance bidirectional synaptic behaviors. The 2DMC heterojunction&#8208;based field effect transistor (FET) devices exhibit typical ambipolar properties and remarkable responsivity (R) of 3.58&#215;104 A W&#8722;1 under weak light as low as 0.008&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic behaviors are successfully realized by the same light stimuli under different gate voltages. Moreover, a superior contrast ratio (CR) of 1.53&#215;103 is demonstrated by the ultrathin and high&#8208;quality 2DMC heterojunction, which transcends previous optoelectronic synapses and enables application for the motion detection of the pendulum. Furthermore, a motion detection network based on the device is developed to detect and recognize classic motion vehicles in road traffic with an accuracy exceeding 90%. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;contrast bidirectional optoelectronic synapses and shows great potential in the intelligent bionic device and future artificial vision.

         <title>Multistep Dissolution of Lamellar Crystals Generates Superthin Amorphous Ni(OH)2 Catalyst for UOR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superthin amorphous nickel hydroxide (ANH) is synthesized as an efficient catalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). This is achieved via a multistep dissolution of NiMO4&#183;H2O as confirmed by in situ Raman and cryogenic electron tomography (CryoET). The work provides an effective strategy for the preparation of highly active superthin amorphous catalysts.








Abstract
Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an ideal replacement of the conventional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for efficient hydrogen production due to the favorable thermodynamics. However, the UOR activity is severely limited by the high oxidation potential of Ni&#8208;based catalysts to form Ni3+, which is considered as the active site for UOR. Herein, by using in situ cryoTEM, cryo&#8208;electron tomography, and in situ Raman, combined with theoretical calculations, a multistep dissolution process of nickel molybdate hydrate is reported, whereby NiMoO4&#183;xH2O nanosheets exfoliate from the bulk NiMoO4&#183;H2O nanorods due to the dissolution of Mo species and crystalline water, and further dissolution results in superthin and amorphous nickel (II) hydroxide (ANH) flocculus catalyst. Owing to the superthin and amorphous structure, the ANH catalyst can be oxidized to NiOOH at a much lower potential than conventional Ni(OH)2 and finally exhibits more than an order of magnitude higher current density (640&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), 30 times higher mass activity, 27 times higher TOF than those of Ni(OH)2 catalyst. The multistep dissolution mechanism provides an effective methodology for the preparation of highly active amorphous catalysts.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Standing, Self&#8208;Floating 3D Solar Evaporators Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off between Salt Cycle and Heat Localization for Continuous Seawater Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by water hyacinth, a self&#8208;standing and self&#8208;floating 3D solar evaporator with adiabatic foam particles and aligned water channels is built through a continuous directional freeze&#8208;casting technique. The solar evaporator can cut off the heat transfer from the top photothermal area to the bulk water without affecting the water supply, breaking the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between the salt cycle and heat localization.








Abstract
Facing the global water shortage challenge, solar&#8208;driven desalination is considered a sustainable technology to obtain freshwater from seawater. However, the trade&#8208;off between the salt cycle and heat localization of existing solar evaporators (SE) hinders its further practical applications. Here, inspired by water hyacinth, a self&#8208;standing and self&#8208;floating 3D SE with adiabatic foam particles and aligned water channels is built through a continuous directional freeze&#8208;casting technique. With the help of the heat insulation effect of foam particles and the efficient water transport of aligned water channels, this new SE can cut off the heat transfer from the top photothermal area to the bulk water without affecting the water supply, breaking the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between salt cycle and heat localization of traditional SEs. Additionally, its self&#8208;standing and self&#8208;floating features can reduce human maintenance. Its large exposure height can increase evaporation area and collect environmental energy, breaking the long&#8208;standing limitation of solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of conventional SEs. With the novel structure employed, an evaporation flux of 2.25&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and apparent solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 136.7% are achieved under 1&#160;sun illumination. This work demonstrates a new evaporator structure, and also provides a key insight into the structural design of next&#8208;generation salt&#8208;tolerant and high&#8208;efficiency SEs.

Abstract
Organic nonfullerene solar cells (ONSCs) have made unprecedented progress; however, morphology optimization of ONSCs is proven to be particularly challenging relative to classical fullerene&#8208;based devices. Here, a novel volatile solid additive (VSA), 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone (2&#8208;HM), is reported for achieving high&#8208;efficiency ONSCs. 2&#8208;HM functions as a universal morphology&#8208;directing agent for several well&#8208;known PM6:Y6 series nonfullerene blends, viz. PM6:Y6, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, PM6:L8&#8208;BO, leading to a best efficiency of 18.85% at the forefront of reported binary ONSCs. VSAs have recently emerged, while the intrinsic kinetics is still unclear. Herein, a set of in situ and ex situ characterizations is employed to first illustrate the molecule&#8208;aggregate&#8208;domain transition dynamic process assisted by the VSA. More specifically, the role of 2&#8208;HM in individual donor PM6 and acceptor Y6 systems is unlocked, and the function of 2&#8208;HM in altering the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction blends is further revealed for enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is believed that the achievement brings not only a deep insight into emerging volatile solid additive, but also a new hope to further improve the molecular ordering, film microstructure, and relevant performance of ONSCs.

         <title>Arming Ru with Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched RuO2 Sub&#8208;Nanometer Skin Activates Superior Bifunctionality for pH&#8208;Universal Overall Water Splitting</title>

The Ru@V&#8208;RuO2/C HMS core&#8211;shell heterostructure is explored by thermally controlled oxidation of the Ru/C hybrid microsheet to arm the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched RuO2 sub&#8208;nanometer skin on Ru core, &#8211; displaying ultrasmall overpotentials of 176/201&#160;mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 46/6&#160;mV toward the hydrogen evolution reaction&#160;at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4/1.0&#160;m KOH, respectively.








Abstract
Water electrolysis has been expected to assimilate the renewable yet intermediate energy&#8208;derived electricity for green H2 production. However, current benchmark anodic catalysts of Ir/Ru&#8208;based compounds suffer severely from poor dissolution resistance. Herein, an effective modification strategy is proposed by arming a sub&#8208;nanometer RuO2 skin with abundant oxygen vacancies to the interconnected Ru clusters/carbon hybrid microsheet (denoted as Ru@V&#8208;RuO2/C HMS), which can not only inherit the high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the Ru, but more importantly, activate the superior activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acid and alkaline conditions. Outstandingly, it can achieve an ultralow overpotential of 176/201&#160;mV for OER and 46/6&#160;mV for the HER to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline solution, respectively. Inspiringly, the overall water splitting can be driven with an ultrasmall cell voltage of 1.467/1.437&#160;V for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4/1.0&#160;m KOH, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that armoring the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched RuO2 exoskeleton can cooperatively alter the interfacial electronic structure and make the adsorption behavior of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates much close to the ideal level, thus simultaneously speeding up the hydrogen evolution kinetics and decreasing the energy barrier of oxygen release.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Transfer Engineering via Janus Hydrogels Enables Ultrahigh Performance and Salt&#8208;Resistant Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel evaporator enabling cation&#8211;anion reverse diffusion away from the evaporation surfaces is reported. It stably removes salt throughout seven days via diffusion and electromigration, different from the current water&#8208;governed salt&#8208;resistant strategies, significantly lowering the heat loss and reaching a record&#8208;high evaporation rate of 6.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in 15&#160;wt% brine.








Abstract
Emerging solar interfacial evaporation offers the most promising response to the severe freshwater crisis. However, the most challenging bottleneck is the conflict between resisting salt accumulation and maintaining high evaporation performance since conventional salt&#8208;resistant evaporators enhance water flow to remove salt, leading to tremendous heat loss. Herein, an ion&#8208;transfer engineering is proposed via a Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel that enables ion&#8208;electromigration salt removal, breaking the historical dependence on water convection, and significantly lowering the heat loss. The hydrogels drive cations downward and anions upward, away from the evaporation surfaces. An electrical potential is thus established inside the evaporator and salt in 15&#160;wt% brine is removed stably for seven days. A record&#8208;high evaporation rate of 6.86 kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in 15&#160;wt% brine, 2.5&#160;times the previously reported works, is achieved. With the from&#8208;scratch salt&#8208;resistant route, comprehensive water&#8208;thermal analysis, and record&#8208;high performance, this work holds great potential for the future salt&#8208;resistant evaporators.

         <title>Poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;block&#8208;PM6 Polymer Donors for High&#8208;Performance and Mechanically Robust Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with high&#8208;performance and &#8208;stretchability are developed by designing block copolymer donors comprising PM6 and elastomeric PDMS blocks (PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS). High power conversion efficiency (PCE &#8776; 18%) and stretchability (crack onset point &gt; 18%) are demonstrated for the PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k&#8208;based PSC. The PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k&#8208;based intrinsically stretchable PSCs show superior mechanical stability (PCE retention &gt; 80% at 32% strain) than the PM6&#8208;based and PM6:PDMS&#8208;blend&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stretchability are the dual requirements for the wearable application of polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, most efficient photoactive films are mechanically brittle. In this work, highly efficient (PCE = 18%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) = 18%) PSCs are acheived by designing block copolymer (BCP) donors, PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMSx (x = 5k, 12k, and 19k). In these BCP donors, stretchable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) blocks are covalently linked with the PM6 blocks to effectively increase the stretchability. The stretchability of the BCP donors increases with a longer PDMS block, and PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k:L8&#8208;BO PSC exhibits a high PCE (18%) and 9&#8208;times higher COS value (18%) compared to that (COS = 2%) of the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based PSC. However, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:PDMS12k ternary blend shows inferior PCE (5%) and COS (1%) due to the macrophase separation between PDMS and active components. In the intrinsically stretchable PSC, the PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k:L8&#8208;BO blend exhibits significantly greater mechanical stability PCE80% ((80% of the initial PCE) at 36% strain) than those of the PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend (PCE80% at 12% strain) and the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:PDMS ternary blend (PCE80% at 4% strain). This study suggests an effective design strategy of BCP PD to achieve stretchable and efficient PSCs.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Induced, Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Switching and Adjustable Dielectric Tunability in Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during film deposition causes &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching (although the films retain the antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase). This is correlated with low&#8208;pressure bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes that pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase&#8208;transition boundaries. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of PbZrO3 can be adjusted.








Abstract
Antiferroelectrics, which undergo a field&#8208;induced phase transition to ferroelectric order that manifests as double&#8208;hysteresis polarization switching, exhibit great potential for dielectric, electromechanical, and electrothermal applications. Compared to their ferroelectric cousins, however, considerably fewer efforts have been made to understand and control antiferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated that the polarization switching behavior of an antiferroelectric can be strongly influenced and effectively regulated by point defects. In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during deposition (and thus increasing adatom kinetic energy) causes unexpected &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching although the films remain in the expected antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase. This &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; switching is correlated with the creation of bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes which pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase boundaries, and thus effectively delay the phase transition under changing field. The effective pinning energy is extracted via temperature&#8208;dependent switching&#8208;kinetics studies. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of the PbZrO3 can be adjusted, including being able to convert between &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability near zero field. This work reveals the important role and strong capability of defects to engineer antiferroelectrics for new performance and functionalities.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Large&#8208;Sized Yttrium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
d&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient elements like Y, typically Fenton&#8208;inactive, are activated into a Pt&#8208;like oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst through dynamic coordinative regulation. The experimental results validate that the as&#8208;designed YN4&#8208;Cl catalyst has good ORR activity and durability, rivalling the commercial Pt/C counterparts. This work provides a reliable and universal strategy for the design of d&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient single&#8208;atom catalysts with Pt&#8208;like ORR activity and Fenton&#8208;inactive character.








Abstract
Although being transition metals, the Fenton&#8208;inactive group 3&#8211;4 elements (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, and Hf) can easily lose all the outermost s and d electrons, leaving behind ionic sites with nearly empty outermost orbitals that are stable but inactive for oxygen involved catalysis. Here, it is demonstrated that the dynamic coordination network can turn these commonly inactive ionic sites into platinum&#8208;like catalytic centers for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Using density functional theory calculations, a macrocyclic ligand coordinated yttrium single&#8208;atom (YN4) moiety is identified, which is originally ORR inactive because of the too strong binding of hydroxyl intermediate, while it can be activated by an axial ligand X through the covalency competition between Y&#63743;X and Y&#63743;OH bonds. Strikingly, it is also found that the binding force of the axially coordinated ligand is an effective descriptor, and the chlorine ligand is screened out with an optimal binding force that behaves self&#8208;adaptively to facilitate each ORR intermediate steps by dynamically changing its Y&#63743;Cl covalency. These experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed YN4&#8208;Cl moieties embedded within the carbon framework exhibit a high half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.85&#160;V) in alkaline media, the same as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst .

Solar Desalination
In article number 2300189, Lin Li and co&#8208;workers present a Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel interfacial evaporator, which enables ion&#8208;electromigration salt removal. The from&#8208;scratch salt&#8208;removal route breaks the limitations of the conventional water&#8208;convection enhanced routes, and significantly lowers heat loss, achieving a record&#8208;high evaporation rate and holding great promise for future solar interfacial evaporation applying desalination.

Memristive Neuron Devices
It is essential to introduce an appropriate activation function for the training of the deep neural networks. In article number 2300023, Byung Chul Jang, Sung&#8208;Yool Choi, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate memristive rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation neurons for hardware neuromorphic systems by introducing imidazole&#8208;based memristors. The proposed memristive ReLU neurons will enable highly integrated hardware neural networks by connecting adjacent layers, with prevented performance degradation due to the vanishing gradient problem.

Identification of Chiral Enantiomers
In article number 2209125, Hossam Haick and co&#8208;workers report a molecular&#8208;spin&#8208;sensitive&#8208;antenna (MSSA) made up of organically functionalized graphene layers on a fibrous helical cellulose network. The MSSA structure combines relativistic spin&#8211;orbit interaction coupled with organic spin&#8208;coherence and offers spatiotemporal chiral molecule separation, recognition, and selective identification of enantiomers. Coupled with neuromorphic artificial intelligence, it enables rapid classification of chiral molecules, resulting in portable spin&#8208;controlled spectrometry.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identification of Chiral Enantiomers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202209125"&gt;2209125&lt;/a&gt;, Hossam Haick and co-workers report a molecular-spin-sensitive-antenna (MSSA) made up of organically functionalized graphene layers on a fibrous helical cellulose network. The MSSA structure combines relativistic spin&#8211;orbit interaction coupled with organic spin-coherence and offers spatiotemporal chiral molecule separation, recognition, and selective identification of enantiomers. Coupled with neuromorphic artificial intelligence, it enables rapid classification of chiral molecules, resulting in portable spin-controlled spectrometry.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2210986, Mingming Ding and co&#8208;workers construct a photoallosteric polymersome (PAP) that undergoes a rapid conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Photoinduced allosteric behavior specifically enhances cell penetration and lysosome escape and reconstructs the vesicular membrane structure for on&#8208;demand release of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, thus remolding the immune microenvironment and achieving excellent synergistic anticancer efficacy in vivo without tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <dc:description>
Plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) is a general term for vesicle&#8208;like nanostructure particles isolated from plants, which can be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers for their low immunogenicity and wide availability. PDVLNs have promising potential in human health and disease treatments. It is necessary to further develop standard operating procedures to promote the clinical application of PDVLNs.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous, phospholipid bilayer&#8208;enclosed biological particles that regulate cell communication by molecular cargo delivery and surface signaling. EVs are secreted by almost all living cells, including plant cells. Plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) is a generic term referring to vesicle&#8208;like nanostructure particles isolated from plants. Their low immunogenicity and wide availability make PDVLNs safer and more economical to be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers. Accumulating evidence indicates the key roles of PDVLNs in regulating interkingdom crosstalk between humans and plants. PDVLNs are capable of entering the human&#8208;body systemand delivering effector molecules to cells that modulate cell&#8208;signaling pathways. PDVLNs released by or obtained from plants thus have great influenceon human health and diseases. In this review, the biogenesis, detailed preparation methods, various physical and biochemical characteristics, biosafety, and preservation of PDVLNs are introduced, along with how these characteristics pertain to their biosafety and preservability. The potential applications of PDVLNs on different plant and mammalian diseases and PDVLN research standardization are then systematically discussed.

A new concept of atomic aerogel materials (or single&#8208;atom aerogels) is proposed for materials science and catalysis science; and their scientific significances, synthetic breakthrough, and potential applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
The concept of &#8220;single&#8208;atom catalysis&#8221; is&#160;first proposed by Tao Zhang, Jun Li, and Jingyue Liu in 2011. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have a very high catalytic activity and greatly improved atom utilization ratio. At present, SACs have become frontier materials in the field of catalysis. Aerogels are highly porous materials with extremely low density and extremely high porosity. These pores play a key role in determining their surface reactivity and mechanical stability. The alliance of SACs and aerogels can fully reflect their structural advantages and lead to new enhancement effects. Herein, a general concept of &#8220;atomic aerogel materials&#8221; (AAMs) (or single&#8208;atom aerogels (SAAs)) is proposed to describe this interesting new paradigm in both material and catalysis fields. Based on the basic units of &#8220;gel,&#8221; the AAMs can be divided into two categories: carrier&#8208;level AAMs (with micro&#8208;, nano&#8208;, or sub&#8208;nanometer pore structures) and atomic&#8208;level AAMs (with atomic&#8208;defective or oxygen&#8208;bridged sub&#8208;nanopore structures). The basic unit of the former (i.e., single&#8208;atom&#8208;functionalized aerogels) is the carrier materials in nanostructures, and the latter (i.e., single&#8208;atom&#8208;built aerogels) is the single metal atoms in atomic structures. The atomic&#8208;defective or oxygen&#8208;bridged AAMs will be important development directions in versatile heterogeneous catalytic or noncatalytic fields. The design proposals, latent challenges, and coping strategies of this new &#8220;atomic nanosystem&#8221; in&#160;applications&#160;are pointed out as&#160;well.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Use of Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogenous Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development of pristine, functionalized, and hybrid covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for photocatalytic organic transformations is presented, arranged in a clear order that states the types of bonds in COFs that can be used in photocatalysis and the photocatalytic mechanisms behind these COFs which influence the performance of the applications.








Abstract
Organic photochemistry&#160;is&#160;intensely developed in the 1980s, in which the nature of excited electronic states and the energy and electron transfer processes are&#160;thoroughly studied and finally well&#8208;understood. This knowledge from molecular organic photochemistry can be transferred to the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. COFs constitute a new class of crystalline porous materials with substantial application potentials. Featured with outstanding structural tunability, large porosity, high surface area, excellent stability, and unique photoelectronic properties, COFs are studied as potential candidates in various research areas (e.g., photocatalysis). This review aims to provide the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art insights into the design of COF photocatalysts (pristine, functionalized, and hybrid COFs) for organic transformations. The catalytic reaction mechanism of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and the influence of dimensionality and crystallinity on heterogenous photocatalysis performance are also discussed, followed by perspectives and prospects on the main challenges and opportunities in future research of COFs and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Principles of Design and Synthesis of Metal Derivatives from MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have complex structures and can be made using low&#8208;cost methods, but their low electrical conductivity and instability limit their use. Metal&#8208;based derivatives of MOFs (MDs) may be a solution, retaining the complexity of MOFs while having improved stability and conductivity. This review covers various types of MDs including oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, transition metals, carbides, and more.








Abstract
Materials derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated exceptional structural variety and complexity and can be synthesized using low&#8208;cost scalable methods. Although the inherent instability and low electrical conductivity of MOFs are largely responsible for their low uptake for catalysis and energy storage, a superior alternative is MOF&#8208;derived metal&#8208;based derivatives (MDs) as these can retain the complex nanostructures of MOFs while exhibiting stability and electrical conductivities of several orders of magnitude higher. The present work comprehensively reviews MDs in terms of synthesis and their nanostructural design, including oxides, sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, carbides, transition metals, and other minor species. The focal point of the approach is the identification and rationalization of the design parameters that lead to the generation of optimal compositions, structures, nanostructures, and resultant performance parameters. The aim of this approach is to provide an inclusive platform for the strategies to design and process these materials for specific applications. This work is complemented by detailed figures that both summarize the design and processing approaches that have been reported and indicate potential trajectories for development. The work is also supported by comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date tabular coverage of the reported studies.

         <title>Localized Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of miR&#8208;29b Normalizes the Dysregulation of Bone Homeostasis Caused by Osteosarcoma whilst Simultaneously Inhibiting Tumor Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles is developed that is delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy and to study the potential of attenuating tumor growth whilst normalizing bone homeostasis. It is found that when miR&#8208;29b is delivered, compared to chemotherapy alone, the therapy provided a significant decrease in tumor burden, an increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis caused by the tumor.








Abstract
Patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma undergo extensive surgical intervention and chemotherapy resulting in dismal prognosis and compromised quality of life owing to poor bone regeneration, which is further compromised with chemotherapy delivery. This study aims to investigate if localized delivery of miR&#8208;29b&#8212;which is shown to promote bone formation by inducing osteoblast differentiation and also to suppress prostate and cervical&#160;tumor growth&#8212;can suppress osteosarcoma tumors whilst simultaneously normalizing the dysregulation of bone homeostasis caused by osteosarcoma. Thus, the therapeutic potential of microRNA (miR)&#8208;29b is studied to promote bone remodeling in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma (rather than in bone defect models using healthy mice), and in the context of chemotherapy, that is clinically relevant. A formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles are developed that are delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy and to study the potential of attenuating tumor growth whilst normalizing bone homeostasis. It is found that when miR&#8208;29b is delivered along with systemic chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone, the therapy provided a significant decrease in tumor burden, an increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis thereby normalizing the dysregulation of bone lysis activity caused by the tumor.

         <title>Emergent Ferroelectric Switching Behavior from Polar Vortex Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the polar vortex lattice, low&#8208;field metastable switching events are demonstrated in coexistence with classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability. By changing the poled state of the vortex lattice one can tune the anisotropy of these low&#8208;field hysteresis loops, allowing for a novel method of non&#8208;destructive readout of the poled state with a simple in&#8208;plane capacitor.








Abstract
Topologically protected polar textures have provided a rich playground for the exploration of novel, emergent phenomena. Recent discoveries indicate that ferroelectric vortices and skyrmions not only host properties markedly different from traditional ferroelectrics, but also that these properties can be harnessed for unique memory devices. Using a combination of capacitor&#8208;based capacitance measurements and computational models, it is demonstrated that polar vortices in dielectric&#8211;ferroelectric&#8211;dielectric trilayers exhibit classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability together with the existence of low&#8208;field metastable polarization states. This behavior is directly tied to the in&#8208;plane vortex ordering, and it is shown that it can be used as a new method of non&#8208;destructive readout&#8208;out of the poled state.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Scale Structure Engineering of ZnSnO3 for Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of multi&#8208;scale (electronic&#8208;crystal&#8208;geometric) structure design is proposed to develop the hollow amorphous ZnSnO3 cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. The as&#8208;prepared HZTO@Zn with high hydrogen evolution barrier, abundant zincophilic sites, and rapid Zn2+ migration can achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and ultra&#8208;long cycling over 6900 h.








Abstract
Suppressing the severe water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) metal anodes is crucial for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries to achieve ultra&#8208;long cyclic lifespans and promote their practical applications. Herein, a concept of multi&#8208;scale (electronic&#8208;crystal&#8208;geometric) structure design is proposed to precisely construct the hollow amorphous ZnSnO3 cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. In situ gas chromatography demonstrates that Zn anodes modified by HZTO (HZTO@Zn) can effectively inhibit the undesired hydrogen evolution. The pH stabilization and corrosion suppression mechanisms are revealed via operando pH detection and in situ Raman analysis. Moreover, comprehensive experimental and theoretical results prove that the amorphous structure and hollow architecture endow the protective HZTO layer with strong Zn affinity and rapid Zn2+ diffusion, which are beneficial for achieving the ideal dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Accordingly, excellent electrochemical performances for the HZTO@Zn symmetric battery (6900&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;times longer than that of bare Zn), HZTO@Zn||V2O5 full battery (99.3% capacity retention after 1100&#160;cycles), and HZTO@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell (120.6 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1) are achieved. This work with multi&#8208;scale structure design provides significant guidance to rationally develop advanced protective layers for other ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life metal batteries.

         <title>Generation of 13.9&#8208;mJ Terahertz Radiation from Lithium Niobate Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme terahertz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to terahertz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength&#160;was&#160;estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Extremely strong&#8208;field terahertz (THz) radiation in free space has compelling applications in nonequilibrium condensed matter state regulation, all&#8208;optical THz electron acceleration and manipulation, THz biological effects, etc. However, these practical applications are constrained by the absence of high&#8208;intensity, high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;beam&#8208;quality, and stable solid&#8208;state THz light sources. Here, the generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme THz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and a 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to THz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse&#8208;front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength is estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1. A record of 1.1&#8208;mJ THz single&#8208;pulse energy at a 450 mJ pump at room temperature is produced and observed that the self&#8208;phase modulation of the optical pump can induce THz saturation behavior from the crystals in the substantially nonlinear pump regime. This study lays the foundation for the generation of sub&#8208;Joule THz radiation from lithium niobate crystals and will inspire more innovations in extreme THz science and applications.

         <title>Monolithic Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Energy&#8208;Efficient Water Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (UiO&#8208;66, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Zr&#8208;fumarate) with high density and exceptional water sorption capacity are developed to replace traditional refrigeration systems with energy&#8208;efficient alternatives. The adsorption characteristics of monolithic materials have been predicted using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and lattice&#8208;gas models. Unlike traditional MOFs, these monolithic MOFs have overcome processing issues, making them suitable for real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Space cooling and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) accounts for roughly 10% of global electricity use and are responsible for ca. 1.13 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions annually. Adsorbent&#8208;based HVAC technologies have long been touted as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional refrigeration systems. However, thus far, no suitable adsorbents have been developed which overcome the drawbacks associated with traditional sorbent materials such as silica gels and zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvements in water adsorption and regeneration energy requirements. However, the deployment of MOFs in HVAC applications has been hampered by issues related to MOF powder processing. Herein, three high&#8208;density, shaped, monolithic MOFs (UiO&#8208;66, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, and Zr&#8208;fumarate) with exceptional volumetric gas/vapor uptake are developed&#8212;solving previous issues in MOF&#8208;HVAC deployment. The monolithic structures across the mesoporous range are visualized using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and lattice&#8208;gas models, giving accurate predictions of adsorption characteristics of the monolithic materials. It is also demonstrated that a fragile MOF such as Zr&#8208;fumarate can be synthesized in monolithic form with a bulk density of 0.76 gcm&#8722;3 without losing any adsorption performance, having a coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.71 with a low regeneration temperature (&#8804; 100 &#176;C).

         <title>Bi&#8208;Deficiency Leading to High&#8208;Performance in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation and tuning of complex defects can effectively enhance the thermoelectric performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This work proposes an approach to mitigate the negative scattering effect of Mg vacancies by Bi deficiency. The heterovalent vacancies provide a strong phonon scattering, leading to a significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity and a superior zT.








Abstract
Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 is a potential nearly&#8208;room temperature thermoelectric compound composed of earth&#8208;abundant elements. However, complex defect tuning and exceptional microstructural control are required. Prior studies have confirmed the detrimental effect of Mg vacancies (VMg) in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This study proposes an approach to mitigating the negative scattering effect of VMg by Bi deficiency, synergistically modulating the electrical and thermal transport properties to enhance the thermoelectric performance. Positron annihilation spectrometry and Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that the VMg tends to coalesce due to the introduced Bi vacancies (VBi). The defects created by Bi deficiency effectively weaken the scattering of electrons from the intrinsic VMg and enhance phonon scattering. A peak zT of 1.82 at 773 K and high conversion efficiency of 11.3% at &#8710;T = 473 K are achieved in the optimized composition of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 by tuning the defect combination. This work demonstrates a feasible and effective approach to improving the performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 as an emerging thermoelectric material.

The defects created by Bi deficiency effectively weaken the scattering of electrons from the intrinsic V&lt;sub&gt;Mg&lt;/sub&gt; and enhance phonon scattering. A peak &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.82 at 773 K and high conversion efficiency of 11.3% at &#8710;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; = 473 K are achieved in the optimized composition of Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb,Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by tuning the defect combination. This work demonstrates a feasible and effective approach to improving the performance of Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Sb,Bi)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an emerging thermoelectric material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymeric Memristor Based Artificial Synapses with Ultra&#8208;Wide Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic polymeric memristive device using MDMO&#8208;PPV is demonstrated. The unencapsulated devices maintain reliable memristive switching behavior under an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (77&#8211;573 K). XPS and ToF&#8208;SIMS depth profiling techniques are utilized to visualize the kinetic process of ion migration in the device. This work may allow the use of organic memristors as robust artificial synapses in ultra&#8208;wide temperature range for future neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Neuromorphic electronics, being inspired by how the brain works, hold great promise to the successful implementation of smart artificial systems. Among several neuromorphic hardware issues, a robust device functionality under extreme temperature is of particular importance for practical applications. Given that the organic memristors for artificial synapse applications are demonstrated under room temperature, achieving a robust device performance at extremely low or high temperature is still utterly challenging. In this work, the temperature issue is addressed by tuning the functionality of the solution&#8208;based organic polymeric memristor. The optimized memristor demonstrates a reliable performance under both the cryogenic and high&#8208;temperature environments. The unencapsulated organic polymeric memristor shows a robust memristive response under test temperature ranging from 77 to 573&#160;K. Utilizing X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) depth profiling, the device working mechanism is unveiled by comparing the compositional profiles of the fresh and written organic polymeric memristors. A reversible ion migration induced by an applied voltage contributes to the characteristic switching behavior of the memristor. Herein, both the robust memristive response achieved at extreme temperatures and the verified device working mechanism will remarkably accelerate the development of memristors in neuromorphic systems.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Proton Pseudocapacitor with Ultrahigh Mass Loading and Areal Energy Density for Fast Energy Storage at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;architectured high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading proton pseudocapacitors with cross&#8208;scale, high energy density, and oriented toward harsh environments are rationally designed via 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitors can deliver a high energy density of 0.514 mWh cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability at the ultralow temperature of &#8722;60&#176;C.








Abstract
The sluggish ionic transport in thick electrodes and freezing electrolytes has limited electrochemical energy storage devices in lots of harsh environments for practical applications. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed proton pseudocapacitor based on high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading 3D&#8208;printed WO3 anodes, Prussian blue analog cathodes, and anti&#8208;freezing electrolytes is developed, which can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance at low temperatures. Benefiting from the cross&#8208;scale 3D electrode structure using a 3D printing direct ink writing technique, the 3D&#8208;printed cathode realizes an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.39&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a high areal mass loading of 23.51&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 3.44 F&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent areal energy density (1.08 mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2). Owing to the fast ion kinetics in 3D electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of the hybrid electrolyte, the 3D&#8208;printed supercapacitor delivers 61.3% of the room&#8208;temperature capacitance even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical applications of energy storage devices with complex physical structure at extreme temperatures.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Engineering with 2,2&#8208;Azodi(2&#8208;Methylbutyronitrile)&#160;for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique intermediate phase engineering strategy is developed to overcome the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 film with organic ammonium salts by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;azodi(2&#8208;methylbutyronitrile) to both PbI2 precursor solution and organic ammonium salts. This helps to achieve perovskite solar cells with efficiency &gt;25% and good stability of remaining 96% initial efficiency in the maximum power point tracking measurement after 1000 h.








Abstract
Sequential deposition has been widely employed to modulate the crystallization of perovskite solar cells because it can avoid the formation of nucleation centers and even initial crystallization in the precursor solution. However, challenges remain in overcoming the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 films with organic ammonium salts. Herein, a unique intermediate phase engineering strategy has been developed by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;azodi(2&#8208;methylbutyronitrile) (AMBN) to both PbI2 and ammonium salt solutions to regulate perovskite crystallization. AMBN not only coordinates with PbI2 to form a favorably mesoporous PbI2 film due to the coordination between Pb2+ and the cyano group (C&#8801;N), but also suppresses the vigorous activity of FA+ ions by interacting with FAI, leading to the full PbI2 transformation with the preferred orientation. Therefore, perovskites with favorable facet orientations are obtained, and the defects are largely suppressed owing to the passivation of uncoordinated Pb2+ and FA+. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency over 25% with a stabilized efficiency of 24.8% is achieved. Moreover, the device exhibits an improved operational stability, retaining 96% of initial power conversion efficiency under 1000 h continuous white&#8208;light illumination with an intensity of 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C in N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Hierarchical Serpentine&#8208;Helix Combination for 3D Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural design of hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combination, with repeating units winding in a helical manner, can enable large mechanical forces transferred down to a smaller scale with the dissipation of potentially damaging stresses by microscale buckling, endowing electronic devices made from hard&#8208;to&#8208;stretch materials with large stretchability in x&#8208;, y&#8208;, or z&#8208;axis direction, high structural stability, and extraordinary electromechanical performance.








Abstract
3D stretchable electronics attract growing interest due to their new and more complex functionalities compared to 1D or 2D counterparts. Among all 3D configuration designs, a 3D helical structure is commonly used as it can be designed to achieve outstanding stretching ratios as well as highly robust mechanical performance. However, the stretching ratio that mainly focuses on the axis direction hinders its applications. Inspired by hierarchies in a tendon, a novel structural design of hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combination is proposed. The structural design constructed by a sequence with repeating small units winding in a helical manner around the axis can enable large mechanical forces transferred down to a smaller scale with the dissipation of potentially damaging stresses by microscale buckling, thereby endowing the electronic components made from high&#8208;performance but hard&#8208;to&#8208;stretch materials with large stretchability (&#8805;200%) in x&#8208;, y&#8208;, or z&#8208;axis direction, high structural stability, and extraordinary electromechanical performance. Two applications including a wireless charging patch and an epidermal electronic system are demonstrated. The epidermal electronic system made of several hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combinations allows for high&#8208;fidelity monitoring of electrophysiological signals, galvanic skin response, and finger&#8208;movement&#8208;induced electrical signals, which can achieve good tactile pattern recognition when combined with an artificial neural network.

The structural design constructed by a sequence with repeating small units winding in a helical manner around the axis can enable large mechanical forces transferred down to a smaller scale with the dissipation of potentially damaging stresses by microscale buckling, thereby endowing the electronic components made from high-performance but hard-to-stretch materials with large stretchability (&#8805;200%) in &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;-, or &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-axis direction, high structural stability, and extraordinary electromechanical performance. Two applications including a wireless charging patch and an epidermal electronic system are demonstrated. The epidermal electronic system made of several hierarchical 3D serpentine-helix combinations allows for high-fidelity monitoring of electrophysiological signals, galvanic skin response, and finger-movement-induced electrical signals, which can achieve good tactile pattern recognition when combined with an artificial neural network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>siRNA Delivery against Myocardial Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Mediated by Reversibly Camouflaged Biomimetic Nanocomplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomplexes (NCs) based on membrane&#8208;penetrating helical polypeptide and reversible, platelet&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) cloaking are developed for efficient siSav1 delivery against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. HM coating drives the targeted accumulation of NCs in the injured myocardium, and acid&#8208;triggered membrane shedding allows efficient delivery of siSav1 into cardiomyocytes, which suppresses the Hippo pathway and induces cardiomyocyte regeneration.








Abstract
siRNA&#8208;mediated management of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is greatly hampered by the inefficient myocardial enrichment and cardiomyocyte transfection. Herein, nanocomplexes (NCs) reversibly camouflaged with a platelet&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) are developed to efficiently deliver Sav1 siRNA (siSav1) into cardiomyocytes, suppressing the Hippo pathway and inducing cardiomyocyte regeneration. The biomimetic BSPC@HM NCs consist of a cationic nanocore assembled from a membrane&#8208;penetrating helical polypeptide (P&#8208;Ben) and siSav1, a charge&#8208;reversal intermediate layer of poly(l&#8208;lysine)&#8208;cis&#8208;aconitic acid (PC), and an outer shell of HM. Due to HM&#8208;mediated inflammation homing and microthrombus targeting, intravenously injected BSPC@HM NCs can efficiently accumulate in the IR&#8208;injured myocardium, where the acidic inflammatory microenvironment triggers charge reversal of PC to shed off both HM and PC layers and allow the penetration of the exposed P&#8208;Ben/siSav1 NCs into cardiomyocytes. In rats and pigs, BSPC@HM NCs remarkably downregulates Sav1 in IR&#8208;injured myocardium, promotes myocardium regeneration, suppresses myocardial apoptosis, and recovers cardiac functions. This study reports a bioinspired strategy to overcome the multiple systemic barriers against myocardial siRNA delivery, and holds profound potential for gene therapy against cardiac injuries.

         <title>Bioinspired Adaptable Indwelling Microneedles for Treatment of Diabetic Ulcers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the adaptive and self&#8208;regulating abilities of creatures in nature, indwelling microneedles are presented that can adjust their mechanical strengths to accommodate to surrounding tissues and release exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells. As the delivered exosomes can activate endogenous cells and regulate topical microenvironments, such indwelling microneedles demonstrate values in treating hard&#8208;healing wounds.








Abstract
Microneedles provide an effective strategy for transdermal drug delivery. Many endeavors have been devoted to developing smart microneedles that can respond to and interact with pathophysiological environments. Here, novel bioinspired adaptable indwelling microneedles with therapeutic exosome encapsulation are presented for diabetic wound healing by a combined fabrication strategy of template replication and 3D&#160;transfer printing. Such microneedles are composed of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#8208;exosomes&#8208;encapsulated adjustable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel needle tips and detachable 3M medical tape supporting substrate. As the mechanical strength of the PVA hydrogel is ionically responsive due to Hofmeister effects, the hardness of the resultant microneedle tips can be upregulated by sulfate ions to ensure skin penetration and be softened by nitrate ions after tip&#8211;substrate detachment to adapt to the surrounding tissue and release exosomes. Because the MSC&#8208;exosomes can effectively activate fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and macrophages, the indwelling microneedles are demonstrated with the function of promoting tissue regeneration and diabetic wound healing in full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wounds of diabetic rat models. These features indicate that the bioinspired adaptable indwelling microneedles are with practical values and clinical prospects in tissue and wound regeneration.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Electrochemical Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental role played by the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of few layers graphene (FLG)&#8208;electrodes, in rising the electrical power output of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs, 530 mW m&#8722;2) is unveiled. Highly capacitive FLG electrodes are obtained by integrating electrolyte gel composites based on 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides. This work introduces a novel design concept leading to sustainable electrochemical&#8208;TENGs.








Abstract
The integration of 2D materials in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is known to increase the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical power conversion efficiency. 2D materials are used in TENGs with multiple roles as triboelectric material, charge&#8208;trapping fillers, or as electrodes. Here, novel TENGs based on few&#8208;layers graphene (FLG) electrodes and stable gel electrolytes composed of liquid phase exfoliated 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides and polyvinyl alcohol are developed. TENGs embedding FLG and gel composites show competitive open&#8208;circuit voltage (&#8776; 300 V), instant peak power (530 mW m&#8722;2), and stability (&gt; 11 months). These values correspond to a seven&#8208;fold higher electrical output compared to TENGs embedding bare FLG electrodes. It is demonstrated that such a significant improvement depends on the high electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of FLG electrodes functionalized with the gel composites. The wet encapsulation of the TENGs is shown to be an effective strategy to increase their power output further highlighting the EDLC role. It is also shown that the EDLC is dependent upon the transition metal (W vs Mo) rather than the relative abundance of 1T or 2H phases. Overall, this work lays down the roots for novel sustainable electrochemical&#8208;(e)&#8208;TENGs developed exploiting strategies typically used in electrochemical capacitors.

         <title>Programmed Self&#8208;Assembly of Single Colloidal Gyroids for Chiral Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;gyroid structure&#8212;despite supporting a complete photonic bandgap&#8212;has thus far been overlooked for programming colloidal self&#8208;assembly, presumably due to its structural complexity. In this work, two distinct routes are demonstrated in silico for programmed self&#8208;assembly of single colloidal gyroids from synthetically feasible chiral patchy colloidal spheres, paving the way for realizing 3D chiral photonic crystals at optical frequencies.








Abstract
Gyroid structures are of extensive interest because they provide a rich platform for chiroptics as well as topological photonics. While the double&#8208;gyroid morphology as a bicontinuous structure is not uncommon in self&#8208;assembled soft materials, direct self&#8208;assembly of single&#8208;network gyroids has proven elusive. Here, an enantiomorphic pair of single&#8208;gyroid crystals comprising colloidal spheres is presented, and two distinct routes are demonstrated for programmed self&#8208;assembly of each single colloidal gyroid enantiomorph from rationally designed patchy spheres. The designer colloidal patchy spheres, which closely hew to their synthetic feasibility, are chiral, having either two staggered rectangular patches at opposite poles or four circular patches arranged in a well&#8208;defined geometry. The single colloidal gyroid, as well as its inverse structure, is shown to support a wide complete photonic bandgap in addition to exhibiting rich chiroptical properties, making them attractive chiral photonic crystals. The versatility of this single colloidal gyroid, the bottom&#8208;up routes devised here in silico, and the robustness of the design space for the chiral colloidal patchy spheres together make a strong case for single colloidal gyroids to supersede colloidal diamond, as a target for programmed self&#8208;assembly, in the quest for photonic crystals operating at optical&#160;frequencies.

         <title>Coupling Probiotics with 2D CoCuMo&#8208;LDH Nanosheets as a Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Platform for Precise NIR&#8208;II Photodynamic Therapy</title>

A probiotics&#8208;based tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive platform is designed to remodel the TME to in situ activate CoCuMo layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets as effective photosensitizers for precise NIR&#8208;II PDT, which can effectively induce cell apoptosis and tumor eradication under 1270 nm laser irradiation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising cancer treatment approach with superior advantages. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive photosensitizers (PSs) for tumor&#8208;targeting precise PDT. Herein, the coupling Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) probiotics with 2D CoCuMo layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (LA&amp;LDH) is reported as a TME&#8208;responsive platform for precise NIR&#8208;II PDT. The CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets loaded on LA can be transformed from crystalline into amorphous through etching by the LA&#8208;metabolite&#8208;enabled low pH and overexpressed glutathione. The TME&#8208;induced in situ amorphization of CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets can boost its photodynamic activity for singlet oxygen (1O2) generation under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation with relative 1O2 quantum yield of 1.06, which is the highest among previously reported NIR&#8208;excited PSs. In vitro and in vivo assays prove that the LA&amp;LDH can effectively achieve complete cell apoptosis and tumor eradication under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation. This study proves that the probiotics can be used as a tumor&#8208;targeting platform for highly efficient precise NIR&#8208;II PDT.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organization of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticles into Complex Multicompartment Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeS2 NPs self&#8208;assemble into biomimetic supraparticles with multiple interconnected compartments. High complexity of the particles manifests in their functionality. They successfully encapsulate nucleic acid cargo, deliver it inside the cells, and protect it against degradation in the environment.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled compartments from nanoscale components are found in all life forms. Their characteristic dimensions are in 50&#8211;1000&#160;nm scale, typically assembled from a variety of bioorganic &#8220;building blocks&#8221;. Among the various functions that these mesoscale compartments carry out, protection of the content from the environment is central. Finding synthetic pathways to similarly complex and functional particles from technologically friendly inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is needed for a multitude of biomedical, biochemical, and biotechnological processes. Here, it is shown that FeS2 NPs stabilized by l&#8208;cysteine self&#8208;assemble into multicompartment supraparticles (mSPs). The NPs initially produce &#8776;55&#160;nm concave assemblies that reconfigure into &#8776;75&#160;nm closed mSPs with &#8776;340 interconnected compartments with an average size of &#8776;5&#160;nm. The intercompartmental partitions and mSP surface are formed primarily from FeS2 and Fe2O3 NPs, respectively. The intermediate formation of cup&#8208;like particles enables encapsulation of biological cargo. This capability is demonstrated by loading mSPs with DNA and subsequent transfection of mammalian cells. Also it is found&#160;that the temperature stability of the DNA cargo is enhanced compared to the traditional delivery vehicles. These findings demonstrate that biomimetic compartmentalized particles can be used to successfully encapsulate and enhance temperature stability of the nucleic acid cargo for a variety of bioapplications.

         <title>Activatable Graphene Quantum&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based Nanotransformers for Long&#8208;Period Tumor Imaging and Repeated Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanovehicle, a quantum dot nanotransformes, smartly transforms its shape in tumor acidic microenvironment to prolong the tumor retention, and then disassembles and releases the encapsulated photosensitizers to &#8220;turn on&#8221; the imaging contrast. The total drug dose in repeated photodynamic therapy is reduced because one injection is enough for four times of light irradiation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as an emerging therapeutic modality against cancer with high spatiotemporal selectivity because the utilized photosensitizers (PSs) are only active and toxic upon light irradiation. To maximize its effectiveness, PDT is usually applied repetitively for ablating various tumors. However, the total overdose of PSs from repeated administrations causes severe side effects. Herein, acidity&#8208;activated graphene quantum dots&#8208;based nanotransformers (GQD NT) are developed as PS vehicles for long&#8208;period tumor imaging and repeated PDT. Under the guidance of Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp peptide, GQD NT targets to tumor tissues actively, and then loosens and enlarges in tumor acidity, thus promising long tumor retention. Afterwards, GQD NT transforms into small pieces for better penetration in tumor. Upon laser irradiation, GQD NT generates mild hyperthermia that enhances cell membrane permeability and further promotes the PSs uptake. Most intriguingly, the as&#8208;prepared GQD NT not only &#8220;turns&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence/magnetic resonance signals, but also achieves efficient repeated PDT. Notably, the total PSs dose is reduced to 3.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1, which is 10&#8211;30&#160;times lower than that of other reported works. Overall, this study exploits a smart vehicle to enhance accumulation, retention, and release of PSs in tumors through programmed deformation, thus overcoming the overdose obstacle in repeated PDT.

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Strategy to Reverse NK Cell Exhaustion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cetuximab can target EGFR, and then induce the decrease of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) content, accompanied by the inhibition of MTHFD2 activity by LY345899, leading to the boosting of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The generated ROS can oxidize C5SeSeC5 into seleninic acid, which can inhibit the expression of human leukocyte antigen E, further reverse the exhaustion of natural killer cells in conjunction with the antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity effect mediated by cetuximab.








Abstract
As a specialized immune effector cell, natural killer (NK) cells play a very important role in immunotherapy, but tumor immunosuppression caused by abnormal expression of cancer cells seriously weakens its therapeutic effect and leads to exhaustion. Here, self&#8208;assembled selenium&#8208;containing nanoparticles (NPs) composed of cetuximab, C5SeSeC5, and inhibitor LY345899 are developed to reverse NK cell exhaustion. The obtained NPs can target epidermal growth factor receptor on the surface of cancer cells and locate it in mitochondria. The released LY345899 can inhibit the activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 and produce excessive reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation of seleninic acid, further reducing the expression of human leukocyte antigen E , which is responsible for the NKG2A&#8208;related NK cell inhibition. As a result, the enhanced NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy in conjunction with the cetuximab&#8208;mediated antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity effect can not only effectively inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors, but also significantly suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect. This work, the combination of seleninic acid, LY345899, and cetuximab, provides a new strategy for reversing NK cell exhaustion and has great potential for use in the treatment of metastatic tumors.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of In&#8208;Memory Computing in a Ferrofluid System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;based ferrofluid system can implement a liquid in&#8208;memory computer when it is stimulated in direct current and its internal state is read in radio frequency mode. The liquid can recognize digits using either a custom pixel serialization scheme or reservoir computing with an ad&#8208;hoc read&#8208;out neural network layer.








Abstract
Magnetic fluids are excellent candidates for several important research fields including energy harvesting, biomedical applications, soft robotics, and exploration.

&lt;p&gt;A water-based ferrofluid system can implement a liquid in-memory computer when it is stimulated in direct current and its internal state is read in radio frequency mode. The liquid can recognize digits using either a custom pixel serialization scheme or reservoir computing with an ad-hoc read-out neural network layer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic fluids are excellent candidates for several important research fields including energy harvesting, biomedical applications, soft robotics, and exploration. However, notwithstanding relevant advancements such as shape reconfigurability, that have been demonstrated, there is no evidence for their computing capability, including the emulation of synaptic functions, which requires complex non-linear dynamics. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that a Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; water-based ferrofluid (FF) can perform electrical analogue computing and be programmed using quasi direct current (DC) signals and read at radio frequency (RF) mode.

         <title>Bridging Synthesis and Controllable Doping of Monolayer 4 in. Length Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides Single Crystals with High Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;assisted epitaxial strategy to synthesize 4 in. length transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on c&#8208;plane sapphire is designed, ultrahigh mobility and remarkable on/off current ratio are discovered due to the ultralow contact resistance. The introduction of Fe decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment of TMDCs domains.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth and controllable doping of wafer&#8208;scale atomically thin semiconductor single crystals are two central tasks to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Despite considerable efforts are devoted, addressing such crucial issues simultaneously under 2D confinement is yet to be realized. Here, an ingenious strategy to synthesize record&#8208;breaking 4 in. length Fe&#8208;doped transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on industry&#8208;compatible c&#8208;plane sapphire without special miscut angle is designed. Atomically thin transistors with high electron mobility (&#8776;146 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and remarkable on/off current ratio (&#8776;109) are fabricated based on 4 in. length Fe&#8208;MoS2 single crystals, due to the ultralow contact resistance (&#8776;489 &#937; &#181;m). In&#8208;depth characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Fe significantly decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment TMDCs domains (&gt;99%). This work represents a substantial leap in terms of bridging synthesis and doping of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.

         <title>Brightening Blue Photoluminescence in Nonemission MOF&#8208;2 by Pressure Treatment Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Initially nonemission MOF&#8208;2 shows a conspicuous pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) with bright blue&#8208;light within 7.0&#160;GPa, and the excellent PIE is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4%. The hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect effectively elevates the rotational barrier of the linker rotors by pressure treatment engineering, which turns on the photoluminescence in MOF&#8208;2.








Abstract
As equally essential as the synthesis of new materials, maneuvering new structure configurations can endow the brand&#8208;new functional properties to existing materials, which is also one of the core goals in the synthesis community. In this respect, pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) that triggers photoluminescence (PL) in nonemission materials is an emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials technology. In the PIE paradigms, harvesting bright PL at ambient conditions, however, has remained elusive. Herein, a remarkable PIE phenomenon is reported in initially nonemission Zn(BDC)(DMF)(H2O) (MOF&#8208;2), which shows bright blue&#8208;emission at 455&#160;nm under pressure. Intriguingly, the bright blue PL with an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4% is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions upon decompression from 16.2&#160;GPa. The detailed structural analyses combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect elevates powerfully the rotational barrier of the linker rotor to 3.87&#160;eV mol&#8722;1 from initial 0.91&#160;eV mol&#8722;1 through pressure treatment. The downgrade rotational freedom turns on PL of MOF&#8208;2 after releasing pressure completely. This is the first case of harvesting PIE to ambient conditions. These findings offer a new platform for the creation of promising alternatives to high&#8208;performance PL materials based on initially nonemission counterparts.

         <title>An Organic Chiroptical Detector Favoring Circularly Polarized Light Detection from Near&#8208;Infrared to Ultraviolet and Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Amplifying Dissymmetry in Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized light detection has attracted growing attention due to the great applications in optical communication and biological detection. Organic chiroptical detectors with circularly polarized light detection ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared are fabricated successfully. Furthermore, the external magnetic field can increase the factor of dissymmetry in electric current from 0.18 to 0.23 at room temperature.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light detection has attracted growing attention because of its unique application in security surveillance and quantum optics. Here, through designing a chiral polymer as a donor, a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized light detector is fabricated, successfully enabling detection from ultraviolet (300&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1100&#160;nm). The chiroptical detector presents an excellent ability to distinguish right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light, where dissymmetries in detectivity, responsivity, and electric current are obtained and then optimized. The dissymmetry in electric current can be increased from 0.18 to 0.23 once an external magnetic field is applied. This is a very rare report on the dissymmetry tunability by an external field in chiroptical detectors. Moreover, the chirality&#8208;generated orbital angular momentum is one of the key factors determining the performance of the circularly polarized light detection. Overall, the organic chiroptical detector presents excellent stability in detection, which provides great potential for future flexible and compact integrated platforms.

         <title>Full Site&#8208;Specific Addressability in DNA Origami&#8208;Templated Silica Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami&#8208;templated silica nanostructures combine the excellent properties of both materials resulting in a new type of nanostructure with the precise programmability of DNA origami and the mechanical and structural resilience of silica. It is here shown that these structures also retain one of the most attractive features of DNA origami: complete site&#8208;specific addressability for guest molecule placement after silicification.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology allows for the fabrication of nanometer&#8208;sized objects with high precision and selective addressability as a result of the programmable hybridization of complementary DNA strands. Such structures can template the formation of other materials, including metals and complex silica nanostructures, where the silica shell simultaneously acts to protect the DNA from external detrimental factors. However, the formation of silica nanostructures with site&#8208;specific addressability has thus far not been explored. Here, it is shown that silica nanostructures templated by DNA origami remain addressable for post silicification modification with guest molecules even if the silica shell measures several nm in thickness. The conjugation of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides is used to different silicified DNA origami structures carrying a complementary ssDNA handle as well as DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution imaging to show that ssDNA handles remain unsilicified and thus ensure retained addressability. It is also demonstrated that not only handles, but also ssDNA scaffold segments within a DNA origami nanostructure remain accessible, allowing for the formation of dynamic silica nanostructures. Finally, the power of this approach is demonstrated by forming 3D DNA origami crystals from silicified monomers. These results thus present a fully site&#8208;specifically addressable silica nanostructure with complete control over size and shape.

These results thus present a fully site-specifically addressable silica nanostructure with complete control over size and shape.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterologous Assembly of Pleomorphic Bacterial Microcompartment Shell Architectures Spanning the Nano&#8208; to Microscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling shell proteins derived from bacterial microcompartments are a promising new biomaterial with applications in drug delivery, metabolic engineering, cell&#8208;free synthesis, and bioelectronics. A synthetic platform produces pleomorphic shells spanning the nano&#8208; to microscale that are rapidly purified. Geometric models of new morphologies suggest shared design principles with asymmetric carbon and viral protein analogs.








Abstract
Many bacteria use protein&#8208;based organelles known as bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) to organize and sequester sequential enzymatic reactions. Regardless of their specialized metabolic function, all BMCs are delimited by a shell made of multiple structurally redundant, yet functionally diverse, hexameric (BMC&#8208;H), pseudohexameric/trimeric (BMC&#8208;T), or pentameric (BMC&#8208;P) shell protein paralogs. When expressed without their native cargo, shell proteins have been shown to self&#8208;assemble into 2D sheets, open&#8208;ended nanotubes, and closed shells of &#8776;40&#160;nm diameter that are being developed as scaffolds and nanocontainers for applications in biotechnology. Here, by leveraging a strategy for affinity&#8208;based purification, it is demonstrated that a wide range of empty synthetic shells, many differing in end&#8208;cap structures, can be derived from a glycyl radical enzyme&#8208;associated microcompartment. The range of pleomorphic shells observed, which span &#8776;2 orders of magnitude in size from &#8776;25&#160;nm to &#8776;1.8&#160;&#181;m, reveal the remarkable plasticity of BMC&#8208;based biomaterials. In addition, new capped nanotube and nanocone morphologies are observed that are consistent with a multicomponent geometric model in which architectural principles are shared among asymmetric carbon, viral protein, and BMC&#8208;based structures.

         <title>A Nitroxide Radical Conjugated Polymer as an Additive to Reduce Nonradiative Energy Loss in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitroxide radical side chain substituted conjugated polymer, GDTA, employed as a solid additive to generally boost the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells from a broad range of photovoltaic material systems, especially for the nonfullerene acceptor&#8208;based cells, is reported.








Abstract
Nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells (NFA&#8208;OSCs) are now set off to the 20% power conversion efficiency milestone. To achieve this, minimizing all loss channels, including nonradiative photovoltage losses, seems a necessity. Nonradiative recombination, to a great extent, is known to be an inherent material property due to vibrationally induced decay of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states or their back electron transfer to the triplet excitons. Herein, it is shown that the use of a new conjugated nitroxide radical polymer with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl piperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl side groups (GDTA) as an additive results in an improvement of the photovoltaic performance of NFA&#8208;OSCs based on different active layer materials. Upon the addition of GDTA, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) improve simultaneously. This approach is applied to several material systems including state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art donor/acceptor pairs showing improvement from 15.8% to 17.6% (in the case of PM6:Y6) and from 17.5% to 18.3% (for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9). Then, the possible reasons behind the observed improvements are discussed. The results point toward the suppression of the CT state to triplet excitons loss channel. This work presents a facile, promising, and generic approach to further improve the performance of NFA&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>A Conformable Ultrasound Patch for Cavitation&#8208;Enhanced Transdermal Cosmeceutical Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, conformable embodiment of a wearable ultrasound patch for transdermal delivery of cosmeceuticals to the skin is reported. The patch comprises a 2D array of bulk piezoelectric transducers embedded in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate. The patch demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in the delivery of niacinamide to porcine skin in vitro with 10 min ultrasound application.








Abstract
Increased consumer interest in healthy&#8208;looking skin demands a safe and effective method to increase transdermal absorption of innovative therapeutic cosmeceuticals. However, permeation of small&#8208;molecule drugs is limited by the innate barrier function of the stratum corneum. Here, a conformable ultrasound patch (cUSP) that enhances transdermal transport of niacinamide by inducing intermediate&#8208;frequency sonophoresis in the fluid coupling medium between the patch and the skin is reported. The cUSP consists of piezoelectric transducers embedded in a soft elastomer to create localized cavitation pockets (0.8 cm2, 1&#160;mm deep) over larger areas of conformal contact (20 cm2). Multiphysics simulation models, acoustic spectrum analysis, and high&#8208;speed videography are used to characterize transducer deflection, acoustic pressure fields, and resulting cavitation bubble dynamics in the coupling medium. The final system demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in niacinamide transport in a porcine model in vitro with a 10 min ultrasound application, demonstrating the suitability of the device for short&#8208;exposure, large&#8208;area application of sonophoresis for patients and consumers suffering from skin conditions and premature skin aging.

         <title>Colorful Electrochromic Displays with High Visual Quality Based on Porous Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy that is structured around a new type of porous metamaterial is developed to circumvent the critical problem in electrochromic displays, which offers personalized devices that exhibit non&#8208;iridescent and large viewable angles, fast switching responses, excellent cycling performance, and extremely low power consumption.








Abstract
The introduction of metamaterials into electrochromic (EC) displays has recently inspired a great breakthrough in the EC field, as this can offer a variety of new attractive features, from a very wide gamut of colors to very fast switching times. However, such metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays still face significant constraints when developing from single electrodes to full devices, because other supportive&#160;components in devices, such as counter electrodes and electrolytes, significantly affect light propagation and the subsequent perceived color quality in metamaterial&#8208;based EC devices. Herein, a new, cost&#8208;effective device design structured around a new type of porous metamaterial is reported to circumvent the critical problem in metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays. Owing to its unique design, the metamaterial&#8208;based EC device achieves good color quality with no drop in brightness or shift in color chromaticity when compared with a single electrode. Moreover, the porous&#8208;metamaterial&#8208;based EC device can exhibit non&#8208;iridescence and be viewed from a wide range of angles (5&#176;&#8211;85&#176;) and has fast switching response (2.4 and 2.5 s for coloration and bleaching, respectively), excellent cycling performance (at least 2000 cycles), and extremely low power consumption (4.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic microrobots, composed of halloysite nanotubes (backbone), iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (magnetic actuators), and coated with polyethylenimine in order to load ampicillin, exhibit multimodal and reconfigurable motion. These magnetic microrobots are used to kill and remove efficiently Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration.








Abstract
Modern micro/nanorobots can perform multiple tasks for biomedical and environmental applications. Particularly, magnetic microrobots can be completely controlled by a rotating magnetic field and their motion powered and controlled without the use of toxic fuels, which makes them most promising for biomedical application. Moreover, they are able to form swarms, allowing them to perform specific tasks at a larger scale than a single microrobot. In this work, they developed magnetic microrobots composed of halloysite nanotubes as backbone and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles as magnetic material allowing magnetic propulsion and covered these with polyethylenimine to load ampicillin and prevent the microrobots from disassembling. These microrobots exhibit multimodal motion as single robots as well as in swarms. In addition, they can transform from tumbling to spinning motion and vice&#8208;versa, and when in swarm mode they can change their motion from vortex to ribbon and back again. Finally, the vortex motion mode is used to penetrate and disrupt the extracellular matrix of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration, which improves the effect of the antibiotic's activity. Such magnetic microrobots for biofilm removal from medical implants could reduce implant rejection and improve patients&#8217; well&#8208;being.

         <title>Highly Efficient Mixed Conduction in a Fused Oligomer n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductor Enabled by 3D Transport Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fused and highly electron&#8208;deficient oligomeric organic semiconductor bridging the small&#8208;molecule and polymeric semiconductor domains is presented. By careful control of side&#8208;chain motifs, a highly efficient mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor is obtained. The high performance is ascribed to favorable interactions between semiconductor and aqueous electrolyte that result in a molecular packing with oblique orientation enabling 3D transport pathways.








Abstract
Tailoring organic semiconductors to facilitate mixed conduction of ionic and electronic charges when interfaced with an aqueous media has spurred many recent advances in organic bioelectronics. The field is still restricted, however, by very few n&#8208;type (electron&#8208;transporting) organic semiconductors with adequate performance metrics. Here, a new electron&#8208;deficient, fused polycyclic aromatic system, TNR, is reported with excellent n&#8208;type mixed conduction properties including a &#181;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value exceeding 30 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for the best performing derivative. Comprising three naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin moieties, this new molecular design builds on successful small&#8208;molecule mixed conductors; by extending the molecular scaffold into the oligomer domain, good film&#8208;forming properties, strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and consequently excellent charge&#8208;transport properties are obtained. Through judicious optimization of the side chains, the linear oligoether and branched alkyl chain derivative bgTNR is obtained which shows superior mixed conduction in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration including an electron mobility around 0.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. By optimizing the side chains, the dominant molecular packing can be changed from a preferential edge&#8208;on orientation (with high charge&#8208;transport anisotropy) to an oblique orientation that can support 3D transport pathways which in turn ensure highly efficient mixed conduction properties across the bulk semiconductor film.

         <title>Horizontal and Vertical Coalescent Microrobotic Collectives Using Ferrofluid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed coalescent collective system exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal and vertical collectives. Under a&#160;time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns, to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. The reconfigurability of these droplet collectives significantly extends the functionality of ferrofluid&#8208;based soft robots.








Abstract
Many artificial miniature robotic collectives have been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of inadequate individual capabilities. However, the basic building blocks of the reported collectives are mainly in the solid state, where the morphological boundaries of internal individuals are clear and cannot genuinely merge. Miniature robotic collectives based on liquid units still need to be explored; such on&#8208;demand mergeable swarm systems are advantageous for adapting to the changing external environment. Here, a strategy to achieve a coalescent collective system we&#160;presented that exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal multimodal and vertical gravity&#8208;resistant collectives and unveil pattern&#8208;enabled robotic functionalities. When subjected to a time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from horizontal collectives, including vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. Using experiments and simulations, the formation and transformation of different morphological collectives are shown and their robust environmental adaptability are demonstrated. Potential applications of the multimodal droplet collectives are presented, including exploring an unknown environment, targeted object delivery, and fluid flow filtration in a lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. This work may facilitate the design of microrobotic swarm systems and expand the range of materials for miniature robots.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Small Molecule Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Symmetric&#8208;Asymmetric Alloy Acceptor with a Broad Composition Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and stable ternary system by introducing a new asymmetric electron acceptor SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system is developed, which exhibits a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.02% and demonstrates better operational stability as compared to the host system.








Abstract
Using a combinatory blending strategy is demonstrated as a promising path for designing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by boosting the short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;small molecule OSC (all&#8208;SMOSCs) using a narrow&#8208;bandgap alloy acceptor containing symmetric and asymmetric molecules (BTP&#8208;eC9 and SSe&#8208;NIC) and a wide&#8208;bandgap small molecule donor MPhS&#8208;C2 is reported. Introducing the synthesized SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system can broaden the absorption spectrum, modulate energy offsets, and optimize the molecular packing of the host materials. After systematically optimizing the weight ratio of MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9:SSe&#8208;NIC, a champion efficiency of 18.02% is achieved. Impressively, the ternary system not only delivered a broad composition tolerance with device efficiencies over 17% throughout the whole blend ratios, but also exhibited less non&#8208;geminate recombination and energy loss, and better&#8208;light&#8208;soaking stability than the corresponding binary systems. This work promotes the development of high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;SMOSCs and heralds their brighter application prospects.

         <title>Impairing Tumor Metabolic Plasticity via a Stable Metal&#8208;Phenolic&#8208;Based Polymeric Nanomedicine to Suppress Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP with favorable stability and enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting ability simultaneously inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in CT26 cells, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis, which induces severe energy crisis and avoids single&#8208;targeting therapeutic tolerance due to metabolic plasticity, thus potently suppressing colorectal cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models.








Abstract
Targeting metabolic vulnerability of tumor cells is a promising anticancer strategy. However, the therapeutic efficacy of existing metabolism&#8208;regulating agents is often compromised due to tolerance resulting from tumor metabolic plasticity, as well as their poor bioavailability and tumor&#8208;targetability. Inspired by the inhibitive effect of N&#8208;ethylmaleimide on the mitochondrial function, a dendronized&#8208;polymer&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;phenolic nanomedicine (pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP) encapsulating maleimide&#8208;modified doxorubicin (Mal&#8208;DOX) is developed to enable improvement in the overall delivery efficiency and inhibition of the tumor metabolism via multiple pathways. It is observed that Mal&#8208;DOX and its derived nanomedicine induces energy depletion of CT26 colorectal cancer cells more efficiently than doxorubicin, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis. Notably, pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP simultaneously inhibits cellular oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, thus potently suppressing cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models. Overall, the study provides a promising dendronized&#8208;polymer&#8208;derived nanoplatform for the treatment of cancers through impairing metabolic plasticity.

     alt="Impairing Tumor Metabolic Plasticity via a Stable Metal-Phenolic-Based Polymeric Nanomedicine to Suppress Colorectal Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pOEG-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-D-SH@NP with favorable stability and enhanced tumor-targeting ability simultaneously inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in CT26 cells, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis, which induces severe energy crisis and avoids single-targeting therapeutic tolerance due to metabolic plasticity, thus potently suppressing colorectal cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting metabolic vulnerability of tumor cells is a promising anticancer strategy. However, the therapeutic efficacy of existing metabolism-regulating agents is often compromised due to tolerance resulting from tumor metabolic plasticity, as well as their poor bioavailability and tumor-targetability. Inspired by the inhibitive effect of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethylmaleimide on the mitochondrial function, a dendronized-polymer-functionalized metal-phenolic nanomedicine (pOEG-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-D-SH@NP) encapsulating maleimide-modified doxorubicin (Mal-DOX) is developed to enable improvement in the overall delivery efficiency and inhibition of the tumor metabolism via multiple pathways. It is observed that Mal-DOX and its derived nanomedicine induces energy depletion of CT26 colorectal cancer cells more efficiently than doxorubicin, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis. Notably, pOEG-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-D-SH@NP simultaneously inhibits cellular oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, thus potently suppressing cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models. Overall, the study provides a promising dendronized-polymer-derived nanoplatform for the treatment of cancers through impairing metabolic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Target&#8208;Driven Design of Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Materials via Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target&#8208;driven materials design framework combining high&#8208;throughput calculations, crystal structure prediction, and machine learning is proposed to accelerate the discovery of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. The machine learning regression model for predicting birefringence is developed for the first time. As&#160;an application, eight compounds with promising NLO&#8208;related properties which show potential applications in the deep&#8208;UV region are identified.








Abstract
The development of a data&#8208;driven science paradigm is greatly revolutionizing the process of materials discovery. Particularly, exploring novel nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with the birefringent phase&#8208;matching ability to deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) region is of vital significance for the field of laser technologies. Herein, a target&#8208;driven materials design framework combining high&#8208;throughput calculations (HTC), crystal structure prediction, and interpretable machine learning (ML) is proposed to accelerate the discovery of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. Using a dataset generated from HTC, an ML regression model for predicting birefringence is developed for the first time, which exhibits a possibility of achieving fast and accurate prediction. Essentially, crystal structures are adopted as the only known input of this model to establish a close structure&#8208;property relationship mapping birefringence. Utilizing the ML&#8208;predicted birefringence which can affect the shortest phase&#8208;matching wavelength, a full list of potential chemical compositions based on an efficient screening strategy is identified. Further, eight structures with good stability are discovered to show potential applications in the deep&#8208;UV region, owing to their promising NLO&#8208;related properties. This study provides a new insight into the discovery of NLO materials and this design framework can identify desired materials with high performances in the broad chemical space at a low computational cost.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Doped Heterointerfaced Ru/RuSe2 Nanosheets with Optimized H and H2O Adsorption Boost Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is designed and synthesized. The superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterogeneous interface structure and Cu doping, which leads to the optimized H and H2O adsorption to boost hydrogen evolution catalysis.








Abstract
Ruthenium chalcogenide is a highly promising catalytic system as a Pt alternative for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, well&#8208;studied ruthenium selenide (RuSe2) still exhibits sluggish HER kinetics in alkaline media due to the inappropriate adsorption strength of H and H2O. Herein, xx report a new design of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets (NSs) with optimized H and H2O adsorption strength for highly efficient HER catalysis in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterointerfaced structure and Cu doping, which not only optimizes the electronic structure with a suitable d&#8208;band center to suppress proton overbinding but also alleviates the energy barrier with enhanced H2O adsorption. As a result, Cu&#8208;doped heterogeneous Ru/RuSe2 NSs exhibit a small overpotential of 23&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 58.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.88 s&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mV for HER in alkaline media, which is among the best catalysts in noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward HER. The present Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 NSs interface catalyst is very stable for HER by showing no activity decay after 5000&#8208;cycle potential sweeps. This work heralds that heterogeneous interface modulation opens up a new strategy for the designing of more efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Metal Ion Strategy for Carbon Materials Derived from Cobalt Benzimidazole Frameworks with High Desalination Performance in Simulated Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metal ions (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) with different valence states are confined in the quasi&#8208;microcube shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks (CoZIF9) using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. A series of derived carbon materials with limited metal ions are obtained through high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis and applied in capacitive deionization.








Abstract
Various metal ions with different valence states (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) are successfully confined in quasi&#8208;microcube shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. More importantly, a series of derived carbon materials that confine metal ions are obtained by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Interestingly, the derived carbon materials exhibited electric double&#8208;layer and pseudocapacitance properties because of the presence of metal ions with various valence states. Moreover, the presence of additional metal ions within carbon materials may create new phases, which can accelerate Na+ insertion/extraction and thus increase electrochemical adsorption. Density functional theory results showed that carbon materials in which Ti ions are confined exhibit enhanced insertion/extraction of Na+ resulting from the presence of the characteristic anatase crystalline phases of TiO2. The Ti&#8208;containing materials have an impressive desalination capacity (62.8&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) in capacitive deionization (CDI) applications with high cycling stability. This work provides a facile synthetic strategy for the confinement of metal ions in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and thus supports the further development of derived carbon materials for seawater desalination by CDI.

         <title>Module&#8208;Assembled Elastomer Showing Large Strain Stiffening Capability and High Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastomer with controlled polymer network structure is synthesized via the module&#8208;assembly strategy. The elastomer shows not only a high mechanical strength, stretchability, and damage tolerance, but also unprecedented strain&#8208;stiffening capability, where the apparent stiffness increases by &#8776;2000&#8208;fold upon stretching. This unusual strain stiffening is caused by strain&#8208;induced ordering of network chains.








Abstract
Elastomers are indispensable materials due to their flexible, stretchable, and elastic nature. However, the polymer network structure constituting an elastomer is generally inhomogeneous, limiting the performance of the material. Here, a highly stretchable elastomer with unprecedented strain&#8208;stiffening capability is developed based on a highly homogeneous network structure enabled by a module assembly strategy. The elastomer is synthesized by efficient end&#8208;linking of a star&#8208;shaped aliphatic polyester precursor with a narrow molecular&#8208;weight distribution. The resulting product shows high strength (&#8776;26&#160;MPa) and remarkable stretchability (stretch ratio at break &#8776;1900%), as well as good fatigue resistance and notch insensitivity. Moreover, it shows extraordinary strain&#8208;stiffening capability (&gt;2000&#8208;fold increase in the apparent stiffness) that exceeds the performance of any existing soft material. These unique properties are due to strain&#8208;induced ordering of the polymer chains in a uniformly stretched network, as revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray scattering analyses. The utility of this great strain&#8208;stiffening capability is demonstrated by realizing a simple variable stiffness actuator for soft robotics.

This unusual strain stiffening is caused by strain-induced ordering of network chains.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elastomers are indispensable materials due to their flexible, stretchable, and elastic nature. However, the polymer network structure constituting an elastomer is generally inhomogeneous, limiting the performance of the material. Here, a highly stretchable elastomer with unprecedented strain-stiffening capability is developed based on a highly homogeneous network structure enabled by a module assembly strategy. The elastomer is synthesized by efficient end-linking of a star-shaped aliphatic polyester precursor with a narrow molecular-weight distribution. The resulting product shows high strength (&#8776;26&#160;MPa) and remarkable stretchability (stretch ratio at break &#8776;1900%), as well as good fatigue resistance and notch insensitivity. Moreover, it shows extraordinary strain-stiffening capability (&amp;gt;2000-fold increase in the apparent stiffness) that exceeds the performance of any existing soft material. These unique properties are due to strain-induced ordering of the polymer chains in a uniformly stretched network, as revealed by in situ X-ray scattering analyses. The utility of this great strain-stiffening capability is demonstrated by realizing a simple variable stiffness actuator for soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fill in the Blank: Transferrable Deep Learning Approaches to Recover Missing Physical Field Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tackling with engineering problems requires filling in missing information and translation from limited data input to understand complex material behaviors. This study provides a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based method to complete mechanical fields given part of the domain, further identify the internal composite microstructures, and solve the inverse problem in an efficient way, which overcomes the difficulty conventional approaches are faced with.








Abstract
Solving materials engineering tasks is often hindered by limited information, such as in inverse problems with only boundary data information or design tasks with a simple objective but a vast search space. To address these challenges, multiple deep learning (DL) architectures are leveraged to predict missing mechanical information given limited known data in part of the domain, and further characterize the composite geometries from the recovered mechanical fields for 2D and 3D complex microstructures. In 2D, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is utilized to complete partially masked field maps and predict the composite geometry with convolutional models with great accuracy and generality by making precise predictions on field data with mixed stress/strain components, hierarchical geometries, distinct materials properties and various types of microstructures including ill&#8208;posed inverse problems. In 3D, a Transformer&#8208;based architecture is implemented to predict complete 3D mechanical fields from input field snapshots. The model manifests excellent performance regardless of microstructural complexity and recovers the entire bulk field even from a single surface field image, allowing internal structural characterization from only boundary measurements. The whole frameworks provide efficient ways for analysis and design with incomplete information and allow the direct inverse translation from properties back to materials structures.

         <title>Bifunctional Ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;Alloy Nanowire Electrocatalysts for Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowire electrocatalysts are designed and synthesized via a facile solvothermal method, demonstrating excellent performance for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and offering an attractive electrocatalyst system for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis without ammonia as a byproduct.








Abstract
Hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers a feasible path for low&#8208;voltage green hydrogen production. Herein, the design and synthesis of ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowires as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. It is shown that the RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowires can achieve complete electrooxidation of hydrazine with a low overpotential and high mass activity, as well as improved performance for the HER. The resulting RhRu0.5 bifunctional electrocatalysts enable, high performance hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis delivering a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow cell voltage of 54 mV and a high current density of 853&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The RhRu0.5&#160;electrocatalysts further demonstrate a stable operation at a high current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 80 hours of testing period with little irreversible degradation. The overall performance greatly&#160;exceeds that of the previously reported hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolyzers, offering a pathway for efficiently converting hazardous hydrazine into molecular hydrogen.

         <title>Molecular Sensitization Enabled High Performance Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new material design concept is developed for the preparation of high performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillation materials via low&#8208;temperature processes. With metal halides as X&#8208;ray sensitizer and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) organic cations as emitter, a single crystalline 0D organic metal halide hybrid ((TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4) is discovered to exhibit radioluminescence with an absolute light yield of 14,700 &#177; 800 Photons/MeV and a short decay lifetime of 9.96&#160;ns.








Abstract
Scintillators, one of the essential components in medical imaging and security checking devices, rely heavily on rare&#8208;earth&#8208;containing inorganic materials. Here, a new type of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillators containing earth abundant elements that can be prepared via low&#8208;temperature processes is reported. With room temperature co&#8208;crystallization of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) organic halide, 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino) phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(propyl)&#8208;pyrindin&#8208;1ium bromide (TPA&#8208;PBr), and a metal halide, zinc bromide (ZnBr2), a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D)&#160;organic metal halide hybrid (TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4 with a yellowish&#8208;green emission peaked at 550&#160;nm has been developed. In this hybrid material, dramatically enhanced X&#8208;ray scintillation of TPA&#8208;P+ is achieved via the sensitization by ZnBr42&#8722;. The absolute light yield (14,700&#160;&#177;&#160;800 Photons/MeV) of (TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4 is found to be higher than that of anthracene (&#8776;13,500 Photons/MeV), a well&#8208;known organic scintillator, while its X&#8208;ray absorption is comparable to those of inorganic scintillators. With TPA&#8208;P+ as an emitting center, short photoluminescence and radioluminescence decay lifetimes of 3.56 and 9.96&#160;ns have been achieved. Taking the advantages of high X&#8208;ray absorption of metal halides and efficient radioluminescence with short decay lifetimes of organic cations, the material design paves a new pathway to address the issues of low X&#8208;ray absorption of organic scintillators and long decay lifetimes of inorganic scintillators simultaneously.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles: Efficient Nanozyme for Enhancing Tumor Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;small PtPdRuRhIr high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (US&#8208;HEANPs) are fabricated by the universal metal&#8208;ligand cross&#8208;linking strategy. This strategy takes advantage of simplicity, scalability, and genericity. The developed US&#8208;HEANPs exhibit excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and possess a high photothermal conversion effect. Under the synergistic effects of peroxidase&#8208;like activity and photothermal action, the US&#8208;HEANPs can effectively ablate cancer cells and treat tumors.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys nanoparticles (HEANPs) are receiving extensive attention due to their broad compositional tunability and unlimited potential in bioapplication. However, developing new methods to prepare ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (US&#8208;HEANPs) faces severe challenges owing to their intrinsic thermodynamic instability. Furthermore, there are few reports on studying the effect of HEANPs in tumor therapy. Herein, the fabricated PtPdRuRhIr US&#8208;HEANPs act as bifunctional nanoplatforms for the highly efficient treatment of tumors. The US&#8208;HEANPs are engineered by the universal metal&#8208;ligand cross&#8208;linking strategy. This simple and scalable strategy is based on the aldol condensation of organometallics to form the target US&#8208;HEANPs. The synthesized US&#8208;HEANPs exhibit excellent peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activity and can catalyze the endogenous hydrogen peroxide to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the US&#8208;HEANPs possess a high photothermal conversion effect for converting 808&#160;nm near&#8208;infrared light into heat energy. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that under the synergistic effect of POD&#8208;like activity and photothermal action, the US&#8208;HEANPs can effectively ablate cancer cells and treat tumors. It is believed that this work not only provides a new perspective for the fabrication of HEANPs, but also opens the high&#8208;entropy nanozymes research direction and their biomedical application.

The US-HEANPs are engineered by the universal metal-ligand cross-linking strategy. This simple and scalable strategy is based on the aldol condensation of organometallics to form the target US-HEANPs. The synthesized US-HEANPs exhibit excellent peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity and can catalyze the endogenous hydrogen peroxide to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the US-HEANPs possess a high photothermal conversion effect for converting 808&#160;nm near-infrared light into heat energy. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that under the synergistic effect of POD-like activity and photothermal action, the US-HEANPs can effectively ablate cancer cells and treat tumors. It is believed that this work not only provides a new perspective for the fabrication of HEANPs, but also opens the high-entropy nanozymes research direction and their biomedical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetrically Coordinated CoB1N3 Moieties for Selective Generation of High&#8208;Valence Co&#8208;Oxo Species via Coupled Electron&#8211;Proton Transfer in Fenton&#8208;like Reactions</title>

Asymmetrically coordinated CoB1N3 offers an external electric field for the cleavage of O&#63743;H bond to boost the selective conversion of high&#8208;valence Co&#8208;Oxo species in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, upon which the rational design of tunable active sites at atomic level in triggering efficient Fenton&#8208;like reactions is expected.








Abstract
High&#8208;valence metal species generated in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes are promising candidates for selective degradation of contaminants in water, the formation of which necessitates the cleavage of O&#63743;H and O&#63743;O bonds as well as efficient electron transfer. However, the high dissociation energy of O&#63743;H bond makes its cleavage quite challenging, largely hampering the selective generation of reactive oxygen species. Herein, an asymmetrical configuration characterized by a single cobalt atom coordinated with boron and nitrogen (CoB1N3) is established to offer a strong local electric field, upon which the cleavage of O&#63743;H bond is thermodynamically favored via a promoted coupled electron&#8211;proton transfer process, which serves an essential step to further allow O&#63743;O bond cleavage and efficient electron transfer. Accordingly, the selective formation of Co(IV)&#63742;O in a single&#8208;atom Co/PMS system enables highly efficient removal performance toward various organic pollutants. The proposed strategy also holds true in other heteroatom doping systems to configure asymmetric coordination, thus paving alternative pathways for specific reactive species conversion by rationalized design of catalysts at atomic level toward environmental applications and more.

         <title>Atomic Displacements Enabling the Observation of the Anomalous Hall Effect in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows that in thin films of some non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets the magnetic atoms can be displaced away from high&#8208;symmetry positions. The resulting spin canting allows for control of domain structure. In Mn3SnN this allows for the observation of an unusual temperature&#8208;dependent anomalous Hall effect that indicates the presence of a coherent spin&#8208;rotational non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnetic phase.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with non&#8208;collinear spin structures display various properties that make them attractive for spintronic devices. Some of the most interesting examples are an anomalous Hall effect despite negligible magnetization and a spin Hall effect with unusual spin polarization directions. However, these effects can only be observed when the sample is set predominantly into a single antiferromagnetic domain state. This can only be achieved when the compensated spin structure is perturbed and displays weak moments due to spin canting that allows for external domain control. In thin films of cubic non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets, this imbalance is previously assumed to require tetragonal distortions induced by substrate strain. Here, it is shown that in Mn3SnN and Mn3GaN, spin canting is due to structural symmetry lowering induced by large displacements of the magnetic manganese atoms away from high&#8208;symmetry positions. These displacements remain hidden in X&#8208;ray diffraction when only probing the lattice metric and require measurement of a large set of scattering vectors to resolve the local atomic positions. In Mn3SnN, the induced net moments enable the observation of the anomalous Hall effect with an unusual temperature dependence, which is conjectured to result from a bulk&#8208;like temperature&#8208;dependent coherent spin rotation within the kagome&#160;plane.

         <title>An Integrally Formed Janus Hydrogel for Robust Wet&#8208;Tissue Adhesive and Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrally formed asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel is fabricated by controlling the interfacial distribution of free &#8211;COOH groups via simply adjusting the stirring speed. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two sides of one hydrogel, which attains one&#8208;sided robust adhesion to the wet tissue, simultaneously preventing the postoperative adhesion for the opposite side.








Abstract
Facile fabrication of asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel with robust wet tissue adhesion simultaneously with effective anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion still remains a great challenge. In this work, an integrally formed Janus hydrogel is facilely fabricated in one step by controlling the interfacial distribution of free carboxyl groups on the two sides of hydrogels. At a lower stirring speed, the generated bigger sized emulsion droplets mainly occupy the top surface of hydrogel, which effectively hinders the exposition of carboxyl groups on the top surface, driving them to be more distributed on the bottom surface, ultimately resulting in the poor adhesion of top surface but robust adhesion of bottom surface to various wet tissue even underwater. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two surfaces. In vivo rabbit experiment outcomes clearly validate that the bottom surface of hydrogel firmly adheres to the stomach defect, and the other opposite surface can efficiently address the postoperative adhesion problem. Besides, this hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical toughness and conductivity which has been used as a highly adhesive strain sensor to real&#8208;time monitor the beating heart in vivo. This simple yet effective strategy provides a much more feasible approach for creating Janus hydrogels bioadhesives.

A new series of hydrophobic conducting polymers containing pyrrolopyrrole (PPr) and thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) moieties is designed and synthesized to serve as hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells to attain a power conversion efficiency of 7.6% with shelf&#8208;storage stability over 6000 h, which opens a new avenue for future development of non&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) HTMs with great performance and stability.








Abstract
A new set of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based (PPr) polymers incorporated with thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) is synthesized and explored as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) for Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Three bithiophenyl spacers bearing the thioalkylated hexyl (SBT&#8208;6), thioalkylated tetradecyl (SBT&#8208;14), and tetradecyl (BT&#8208;14) chains are utilized to examine the effect of the alkyl chain lengths. Among them, the TPSCs are fabricated using PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 as HTMs through a two&#8208;step approach by attaining a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.6% with a remarkable long&#8208;term stability beyond 6000 h, which has not been reported elsewhere for a non&#8208;PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based TPSC. The PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device is stable under light irradiation for 5 h in air (50% relative humidity) at the maximum power point (MPP). The highly planar structure, strong intramolecular S(alkyl)&#183;&#183;&#183;S(thiophene) interactions, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of SBT enable the PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device to outperform the standard poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene,&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl (P3HT) and other devices. The longer thio&#8208;tetradecyl chain in SBT&#8208;14 restricts molecular rotation and strongly affects the molecular conformation, solubility, and film wettability over other polymers. Thus, the present study makes a promising dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTM model for the future design of highly efficient and stable TPSCs.

         <title>Managing Interfacial Defects and Carriers by Synergistic Modulation of Functional Groups and Spatial Conformation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics Based on Vacuum Flash Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective interfacial defect and carrier management strategy is developed by synergistically modulating organic functional groups and spatial conformation of organic ammonium salt modification molecules. The 3&#8208;ammonium propionic acid iodide&#8208;modified device based on vacuum flash technology achieves an alluring peak efficiency of 24.72% (certified 23.68%), which is among highly efficient devices fabricated without antisolvents.








Abstract
Interfacial nonradiative recombination loss is a huge barrier to advance the photovoltaic performance. Here, one effective interfacial defect and carrier dynamics management strategy by synergistic modulation of functional groups and spatial conformation of ammonium salt molecules is proposed. The surface treatment with 3&#8208;ammonium propionic acid iodide (3&#8208;APAI) does not form 2D perovskite passivation layer while the propylammonium ions and 5&#8208;aminopentanoic acid hydroiodide post&#8208;treatment lead to the formation of 2D perovskite passivation layers. Due to appropriate alkyl chain length, theoretical and experimental results manifest that &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH3+ groups in 3&#8208;APAI molecules can form coordination bonding with undercoordinated Pb2+ and ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding with octahedron PbI64&#8722;, respectively, which makes both groups be simultaneously firmly anchored on the surface of perovskite films. This will strengthen defect passivation effect and improve interfacial carrier transport and transfer. The synergistic effect of functional groups and spatial conformation confers 3&#8208;APAI better defect passivation effect than 2D perovskite layers. The 3&#8208;APAI&#8208;modified device based on vacuum flash technology achieves an alluring peak efficiency of 24.72% (certified 23.68%), which is among highly efficient devices fabricated without antisolvents. Furthermore, the encapsulated 3&#8208;APAI&#8208;modified device degrades by less than 4% after 1400&#160;h of continuous one sun illumination.

&lt;p&gt;Interfacial nonradiative recombination loss is a huge barrier to advance the photovoltaic performance. Here, one effective interfacial defect and carrier dynamics management strategy by synergistic modulation of functional groups and spatial conformation of ammonium salt molecules is proposed. The surface treatment with 3-ammonium propionic acid iodide (3-APAI) does not form 2D perovskite passivation layer while the propylammonium ions and 5-aminopentanoic acid hydroiodide post-treatment lead to the formation of 2D perovskite passivation layers. Due to appropriate alkyl chain length, theoretical and experimental results manifest that &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;COOH and &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Transdermal Drug Delivery
In article 2300066, Canan Dagdeviren and co&#8208;workers report a soft, conformable embodiment of a wearable ultrasound patch for transdermal delivery of cosmeceuticals to the skin. The patch comprises a 2D array of bulk piezoelectric transducers embedded in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate. The patch demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in the delivery of niacinamide to porcine skin in vitro with 10 min ultrasound application.

Hydrogel Bioadhesive
In article number 2300394, Tao Liu, Zhenzhen Liu, and co&#8208;workers propose a facile strategy to construct an asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel bioadhesive in one&#8208;step. The difference in adhesive strength achieved is as high as 20 times that between the two sides of one hydrogel, attaining one&#8208;sided robust adhesion to wet tissue, simultaneously preventing post&#8208;operative adhesion for the opposite side.

Artificial Intelligence
The search for new advanced materials has been a slow process, in which testing numerous compositions, morphologies etc. for their properties slows down discovery. High&#8208;throughput screening methods can greatly benefit from incorporating artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, techniques. These two routes combine in a cycle of materials science and technology progress reviewed by Cefe L&#243;pez in article number 2208683.

Colloidal Self Assembly
In article number 2211197, Dwaipayan Chakrabarti and co&#8208;workers report on the self&#8208;assembly of enantiomorphic single colloidal gyroid crystals in silico from designer chiral patchy spheres. Each of these crystals is shown to support a complete photonic bandgap, whilst also exhibiting rich chiroptical properties. This computational study introduces single colloidal gyroids as attractive targets for chiral photonic crystals operating at optical frequencies. Image credit: Wesley Flavell.

In&#8208;Memory Computing
In article number 2211406, Alessandro Chiolerio and co&#8208;workers report that an Fe3O4 water&#8208;based ferrofluid can perform electrical analogue computing and can be programmed using quasi&#8208;direct&#8208;current (DC) signals and read at radio&#8208;frequency (RF) mode.

Multicompartment Supraparticles
In article number 2211244, J. Scott VanEpps, Nicholas A. Kotov, and co&#8208;workers report how l&#8208;cysteine&#8208;stabilized FeS2 nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble into supraparticles with multiple interconnected compartments. Their structure can be described by graph theoretical representations that show similar organization and complexity to those of viruses. Similarly to the latter, the inorganic supraparticles pack the nucleic acid cargo for intracellular delivery while protecting it against environmental factors, such as temperature.

Circular Polarized Light Detection
In article number 2211935, Renjie Hu, Wei Qin, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how a chiral polymer PCDTPT can achieve clear resolution of circularly polarized light (CPL) from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions based on the optimized device structures. The chirality&#8208;generated orbital angular momentum is one of the key factors determining the performance of circularly polarized light detection. Moreover, a magnetic field can enhance circularly polarized light detection, which provides a new perspective for the subsequent development of polarized light detectors.

         <title>Convective Thermal Metamaterials: Exploring High&#8208;Efficiency, Directional, and Wave&#8208;Like Heat Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Providing a new knob for controlling heat transfer, convective effects have gained significant interest in the design of thermal metamaterials. With the introduced efficient, directional, and wave&#8208;like heat transfer, many novel phenomena are observed in dissipative regime. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in this emerging field are brought under the same umbrella, and a future perspective on promising directions is provided.








Abstract
Convective thermal metamaterials are artificial structures where convection dominates in the thermal process. Due to the field coupling between velocity and temperature, convection provides a new knob for controlling heat transfer beyond pure conduction, thus allowing active and robust thermal modulations. With the introduced convective effects, the original parabolic Fourier heat equation for pure conduction can be transformed to hyperbolic. Therefore, the hybrid diffusive system can be interpreted in a wave&#8208;like fashion, reviving many wave phenomena in dissipative diffusion. Here, recent advancements in convective thermal metamaterials are reviewed and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art discoveries are classified into the following four aspects, enhancing heat transfer, porous&#8208;media&#8208;based thermal effects, nonreciprocal heat transfer, and non&#8208;Hermitian phenomena. Finally, a prospect is cast on convective thermal metamaterials from two aspects. One is to utilize the convective parameter space to explore topological thermal effects. The other is to further broaden the convective parameter space with spatiotemporal modulation and multi&#8208;physical effects.

         <title>Graphene Spin Valves&#160;for Spin Logic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of spin logic devices and spin&#8208;FETs in graphene marks an important step for the future development of spin&#8208;based computing technology. Their low on/off switching energy, low Joule heating losses, and scalability are attractive features from a device perspective. The non&#8208;volatile nature of graphene spin logic devices can be exploited for logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory applications for neuromorphic computing architectures.








Abstract
An alternative to charge&#8208;based electronics identifies the spin degree of freedom for information communication and processing. The long spin&#8208;diffusion length in graphene at room temperature demonstrates its ability for highly scalable spintronics. The development of the graphene spin valve (SV) has inspired spin devices in graphene including spin field&#8208;effect transistors and spin majority logic gates. A comprehensive picture of spin transport in graphene SVs is required for further development of spin logic. This review examines the advances in graphene SVs and their role in the development of spin logic devices. Different transport and scattering mechanisms in charge and spin are discussed. Furthermore, the on/off switching energy between graphene SVs and charge&#8208;based FETs is compared to highlight their prospects for low&#8208;power devices. The challenges and perspectives that need to be addressed for the future development of spin logic devices are then outlined.

         <title>Intrinsic Optical Properties and Emerging Applications of Gold Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in nanoscience and technology have been promoted to reveal the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures with consideration of size, shape, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning. The perspectives on the future developments, challenges, and opportunities of gold nanostructures are discussed to provide insights for improving their optical properties and performance in various applications.








Abstract
The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli&#8208;responsive changes in optical properties, metal&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase&#8208;dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full&#8208;color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.

         <dc:description>
Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning in particular are gaining ever more importance in science and technology. In materials science, they are taking over tedious screening tasks and helping design and discover materials based on both explicit and tacit previous knowledge possessed by the scientist. Social and humanistic aspects are acquiring tremendous importance, as power and explainability seem to grow at the expense of each other.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining strength, and materials science can both contribute to and profit from it. In a simultaneous progress race, new materials, systems, and processes can be devised and optimized thanks to machine learning (ML) techniques, and such progress can be turned into innovative computing platforms. Future materials scientists will profit from understanding how ML can boost the conception of advanced materials. This review covers aspects of computation from the fundamentals to directions taken and repercussions produced by computation to account for the origins, procedures, and applications of AI. ML and its methods are reviewed to provide basic knowledge of its implementation and its potential. The materials and systems used to implement AI with electric charges are finding serious competition from other information&#8208;carrying and processing agents. The impact these techniques have on the inception of new advanced materials is so deep that a new paradigm is developing where implicit knowledge is being mined to conceive materials and systems for functions instead of finding applications to found materials. How far this trend can be carried is hard to fathom, as exemplified by the power to discover unheard of materials or physical laws buried in data.

         <title>Recent Advances in 4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit attractive stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, showing great application potential in soft robotics, biomedicine, optics, etc. The advent of 4D printing opens a new door for the design and fabrication of LCEs with programmable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties and 3D geometries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both mechanisms and potential applications.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are renowned for their large, reversible, and anisotropic shape change in response to various external stimuli due to their lightly cross&#8208;linked polymer networks with an oriented mesogen direction, thus showing great potential for applications in robotics, bio&#8208;medics, electronics, optics, and energy. To fully take advantage of the anisotropic stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of LCEs, it is preferable to achieve a locally controlled mesogen alignment into monodomain orientations. In recent years, the application of 4D printing to LCEs opens new doors for simultaneously programming the mesogen alignment and the 3D geometry, offering more opportunities and higher feasibility for the fabrication of 4D&#8208;printed LCE objects with desirable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both the mechanisms and potential applications. First, the fundamental properties of LCEs and the working principles of the representative 4D printing techniques are briefly introduced. Then, the fabrication of LCEs by 4D printing techniques and the advantages over conventional manufacturing methods are demonstrated. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends toward the 4D printing of LCEs are discussed, which may shed light on future research directions in this new field.

         <title>Unconventional Giant &#8220;Magnetoresistance&#8221; in Bosonic Semiconducting Diamond Nanorings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale &#8220;diamond rings&#8221; provide unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; for the development of new quantum devices. The unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; caused by the trapping of Cooper pairs within the heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond nanorings, distinguishes itself from the conventional giant magnetoresistance originating from spin&#8208;dependent scattering of single electrons in layered magnetic materials.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in doped insulators such as cuprates and pnictides coincides with their doping&#8208;driven insulator&#8211;metal transitions. Above the critical doping threshold, a metallic state sets in at high temperatures, while superconductivity sets in at low temperatures. An unanswered question is whether the formation of Cooper pairsin a well&#8208;established metal will inevitably transform the host material into a superconductor, as manifested by a resistance drop. Here, this question is addressed by investigating the electrical transport in nanoscale rings (full loops) and half loops manufactured from heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond. It is shown that in contrast to the diamond half&#8208;loops (DHLs) exhibiting a metal&#8211;superconductor transition, the diamond nanorings (DNRs) demonstrate a sharp resistance increase up to 430% and a giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; below the superconducting transition temperature of the starting material. The finding of the unconventional giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221;, as distinct from existing categories of magnetoresistance, that is, the conventional giant magnetoresistance&#160;in magnetic multilayers, the colossal magnetoresistance&#160;in perovskites, and the geometric magnetoresistance in semiconductor&#8211;metal hybrids, reveals the transformation of the DNRs from metals to bosonic semiconductors upon the formation of Cooper pairs. DNRs like these could be used to manipulate Cooper pairs in superconducting quantum devices.

         <title>Expanding Embedded 3D Bioprinting Capability for Engineering Complex Organs with Freeform Vascular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro replication of the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures simultaneously remains one of the greatest challenges in the biofabrication field. This study introduces a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT) to address this limitation. Moreover, the SPIRIT technique significantly reduces the printing time compared to conventional bioprinting strategies.








Abstract
Creating functional tissues and organs in vitro on demand is a major goal in biofabrication, but the ability to replicate the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures such as blood vessels simultaneously remains one of the greatest impediments. Here, this limitation is addressed by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). It is demonstrated that this microgel&#8208;based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing behavior. When encapsulating human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cells, the MB bioink is 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enables the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. This SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which will accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.

         <title>Stacking Faults Inducing Oxygen Anion Activities in Li2MnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking faults can promote the properties of materials in Li2MnO3. In this paper, the role and reasons for stacking faults in Li2MnO3&#160;are explored, revealing the importance of the O local environment. It is found that the longer Li&#63743;O bonds and smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles induced by stacking faults promote O activities and Li ion migration.








Abstract
Controllable anionic redox for a transformational increase in the energy density is the pursuit of next generation Li&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Its activation mechanism is coupled with the local coordination environment around O, which posts experimental challenges for control. Here, the tuning capability of anionic redox is shown by varying O local environment via experimentally controlling the density of stacking faults in Li2MnO3, the parent compound of Li&#8208;rich oxides. By combining computational analysis and spectroscopic study, it is quantitatively revealed that more stacking faults can trigger smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles and larger Li&#63743;O bond distance in local Li&#8208;rich environments and subsequently activate oxygen redox reactivity, which in turn enhances the reactivity of Mn upon the following reduction process. This study highlights the critical role of local structure environment in tuning the anionic reactivity, which provides guidance in designing high&#8208;capacity layered cathodes by appropriately adjusting stacking faults.

         <title>Ablation of Gap Junction Protein Improves the Efficiency of Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Catalytic/Starvation/Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
FePGOGA&#160;nanozymes are constructed by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization, and co&#8208;loaded with GOx and Cx43 blockade peptides GAP19. The FePGOGAs exhibit excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently generate ROS and prevent ROS efflux through Cx43 degradation. The good synergistic effects of the catalytic/starvation/mildPTT therapies are confirmed in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor catalytic therapy is typically hindered by gap junction proteins that form cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell channels to remove cytotoxic ROS, thereby protecting tumor cells from oxidative damage. In this work, a multifunctional nanozyme, FePGOGA, is designed and prepared by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization (FeP), followed by glucose oxidase (GOx) and GAP19 peptides co&#8208;loading through electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The FePGOGA nanozyme exhibits excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and glutathione&#8208;oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently catalyze hydrogen peroxide conversion to hydroxyl radicals and convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide. The loaded GOx starves the tumors and aggravates tumor oxidative stress through glucose decomposition, while GAP19 peptides block the hemichannels by inducing degradation of Cx43, thus increasing the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and decreasing the transport of intracellular glucose. Furthermore, the ROS reacts with primary amines of heat shock proteins to destroy their structure and function, enabling tumor photothermal therapy at the widely sought&#8208;after mild temperature (mildPTT, &#8804;45&#160;&#176;C). In vivo experiments demonstrate the significant antitumor effectof FePGOGA on cal27 xenograft tumors under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. This study demonstrates the successful ablation of gap junction proteins to overcome resistance to ROS&#8208;mediated therapy, providing a regulator to suppress tumor self&#8208;preservation during tumor starvation, catalytic therapy, and mildPTT.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Tailored 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskites for Reconfigurable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive mechanistic study of reconfigurable optoelectronic properties based on a nontrivial library of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites with diamino group ligands by exposing/removing moisture is presented. The key to the moisture&#8208;controlled reconfigurable properties lies in the formation of hydrogen bonding between the diamino group and water molecules, preventing their escape.








Abstract
Humidity&#8208; and moisture&#8208;induced degradation has been a longstanding problem in perovskite materials, affecting their long&#8208;term stability during applications. Counterintuitively, the moisture is leveraged to tailor the reversible hydrochromic behaviors of a new series of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites for reconfigurable optoelectronics. In particular, the hydrogen bonds between organic cations and water molecules can be dynamically modulated via moisture removal/exposure. Remarkably, such modulation confines the movement of the organic cations close to the original position, preventing their escape from crystal lattices. Furthermore, this mechanism is elucidated by theoretical analysis using first&#8208;principles calculations and confirmed with the experimental characterizations. The reversible fluorescent transition 2D DJ perovskites show excellent cyclical properties, presenting untapped opportunities for reconfigurable optoelectronic applications. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting display is shown based on patterned reversible 2D DJ perovskites. The results represent a new avenue of reconfigurable optoelectronic application with 2D DJ perovskites for humidity detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and other emerging photoelectric intelligent technologies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Thin Lithium Silicide Interlayer for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous lithium silicide&#8208;based interlayer, acting as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor, is proposed for high energy and safe all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries using lithium anode. The interlayer not only regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping but also serves as a 3D scaffold for Li ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at solid&#8208;state electrolyte/LiBCC interface.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with metallic lithium (LiBCC) anode and solid electrolyte (SE) are under active development. However, an unstable SE/LiBCC interface due to electrochemical and mechanical instabilities hinders their operation. Herein, an ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC) interlayer (&#8776;3.25 &#181;m), which regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping, serving as a 3D scaffold for Li0 ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at SE/LiBCC interface is demonstrated. Consisting of lithium silicide and carbon nanotubes, the MIEC interlayer is thermodynamically stable against LiBCC and highly lithiophilic. Moreover, its nanopores (&lt;100 nm) confine the deposited LiBCC to the size regime where LiBCC exhibits &#8220;smaller is much softer&#8221; size&#8208;dependent plasticity governed by diffusive deformation mechanisms. The LiBCC thus remains soft enough not to mechanically penetrate SE in contact. Upon further plating, LiBCC grows in between the current collector and the MIEC interlayer, not directly contacting the SE. As a result, a full&#8208;cell having Li3.75Si&#8208;CNT/LiBCC foil as an anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a cathode displays a high specific capacity of 207.8 mAh g&#8722;1, 92.0% initial Coulombic efficiency, 88.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles (Coulombic efficiency reaches 99.9% after tens of cycles), and excellent rate capability (76% at 5 C).

         <title>Monolayer Superconductivity and Tunable Topological Electronic Structure at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45 is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity but the inhomogeneity from doping raises doubts about the existence of Majorana modes. This work explores thin films of FeTe1&#8208;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 that reveal superconductivity at the monolayer limit. Control over the interfacial electronic structure is demonstrated to maintain the spin&#8208;momentum locking necessary for topological superconductivity with significantly less doping.








Abstract
The interface between 2D topological Dirac states and an s&#8208;wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana&#8208;bound states (MBS) that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin&#8208;orbit coupling to achieve spin&#8208;momentum&#8208;locked topological interface states (TIS) which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of MBS have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping make these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here superconductivity is reported in monolayer (ML) FeTe1&#8211;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) directly resolve the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. For y&#160;= 0.25, the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure is found to overlap with the Bi2Te3 TIS and the desired spin&#8208;momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for y&#160;= 0.1, reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin&#8208;momentum locking in the topological states are found. Hence, it is demonstrated that the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing MBS where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

         <title>Controlled Interfacial Polymer Self&#8208;Assembly Coordinates Ultrahigh Drug Loading and Zero&#8208;Order Release in Particles Prepared under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled interfacial polymer self&#8208;assembly enables the engineering of a microparticle that simultaneously features efficient protein and peptide encapsulation (up to 99.9%), ultrahigh mass fraction of therapeutics (up to 49.9%), and zero&#8208;order release of payloads. The developed strategy sets a new paradigm to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological performances of water&#8208;soluble therapeutics.








Abstract
Microparticles are successfully engineered through controlled interfacial self&#8208;assembly of polymers to harmonize ultrahigh drug loading with zero&#8208;order release of protein payloads. To address their poor miscibility with carrier materials, protein molecules are transformed into nanoparticles, whose surfaces are covered with polymer molecules. This polymer layer hinders the transfer of cargo nanoparticles from oil to water, achieving superior encapsulation efficiency (up to 99.9%). To control payload release, the polymer density at the oil&#8211;water interface is enhanced, forming a compact shell for microparticles. The resultant microparticles can harvest up to 49.9% mass fraction of proteins with zero&#8208;order release kinetics in vivo, enabling an efficient glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the precise control of engineering process offered through continuous flow results in high batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and, ultimately, excellent scale&#8208;up feasibility.

         <title>Orbital Symmetry Engineering in Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics toward Extremely Narrowband Green Emissions with an FWHM of 13&#160;nm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular orbital interactions are demonstrated to be crucial to the energy gap and spectral bandwidth of multi&#8208;resonance emitters. Correspondingly, the first indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole embedded green fluorophore is developed with the smallest full width at half maximum of 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV), accompanied by high external quantum efficiency of 30.9% and significantly alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR) molecules generally face spectral broadening issues with redshifted emissions. Thus, green emitters with full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of &lt;20&#160;nm are rarely reported, despite being highly desired. Herein, by properly fusing indolo(3,2,1&#8208;jk)carbazole (ICZ) and naphthalene moieties, green MR emitters are reported, which have FWHMs of merely 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV) and 14&#160;nm (0.069&#160;eV) in dichloromethane, accompanied by high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;95%, which represent not only the smallest FWHMs among all green MR emitters but also the first green emitters based on ICZ MR derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that the orbital interactions between the antisymmetric sites of the segments play an important role in extending the conjugation length in the fusion architectures while simultaneously maintaining a small FWHM. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit green emission peaks at 508&#8211;509&#160;nm and the first green electroluminescence FWHM of &lt;20&#160;nm ever reported. Benefiting from the preferential horizontal dipole orientation, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 30.9% is obtained, which remains at 28.9% and 23.2% under luminances of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming most reported green devices based on narrowband emitters.

         <title>Hygrothermic Wood Actuated Robotic Hand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity is developed, which generates stretching and bending responses to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. Multiple advantages are realized, including good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility. A robotic hand and grippers are designed for dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions and fire rescue scenarios.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8211;responsive actuators play a vital role in the new generation of intelligent systems. However, poor mechanical performance, complicated fabrication processes, and the inability to complex deformation limit their practical applications. Herein, these challenges are overcome via designing a strong hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity. The actuator is readily constructed by sandwiching polypyrrole&#8208;coated wood with a Ni complex hygroscopic gel top layer for moisture absorption and a polyimide bottom layer as the water barrier. The resulting hygrothermic wood spontaneously stretches and bends itself in response to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. A robotic hand and a series of grippers made of hygrothermic wood demonstrate dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions during grasping and holding, while the reversible hygrothermic property allows the actuator to be potentially applied in fire rescue scenarios to rescue trapped objects. A combination of good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility are simultaneously realized by one device. It is thus believed that such a strong wood actuator will open up a new avenue for building intelligent robotic hand systems.

         <title>Efficient Inorganic Vapor&#8208;Assisted Defects Passivation for Perovskite Solar Module</title>

A CS2 vapor passivation strategy is proposed to reduce defects in FAPbI3 films. It is revealed that the CS2 can strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to facilitate the carrier transport, resulting in remarkably enhance efficiency of the devices (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2).








Abstract
Surface trap as intrinsic defects&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative charge recombination is a major obstacle to achieving the reliable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics. Here a CS2 vapor&#8208;assisted passivation strategy is proposed for perovskite solar module, aiming to passivate the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ caused by ion migration. Significantly, this method can avoid the disadvantages of inhomogeneity film caused by spin&#8208;coating&#8208;assisted passivation and reconstruction of perovskite surface from solvent. The CS2 vapor passivated perovskite device presents a higher defect formation energy (0.54&#160;eV) of iodine vacancy than the pristine (0.37&#160;eV), while uncoordinated Pb2+ is bonded with CS2. The shallow level defect passivation of iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ has obviously enhanced the device efficiencies (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2) and the stability, exhibiting an average T80&#8208;lifetime of 1040&#160;h working at the maximum power point, and maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h at RH&#160;=&#160;30% and 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Humidity Range Applicable, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Healable Zwitterionic Hydrogels for Ion&#8208;Leakage&#8208;Free Iontronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solketal, outperforming the commonly used solvent glycerol, endows healable zwitterionic hydrogels with wide&#8208;humidity range applicability and freeze resistance. The optimized zwitterionic hydrogel satisfactorily serves as a dielectric layer to construct iontronic sensors with no ionic leakage, high sensitivity, and environmental stability. A whole&#8208;body healable, stretchable, and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor based on the zwitterionic hydrogels and composites is demonstrated.








Abstract
Hydrogels have entered the spotlight for applications in soft electronics. It is essential and challenging to obtain hydrogels that can function properly under varying environmental circumstances, that is, 30&#8211;90% relative humidity (RH) and &#8722;20 to 40&#160;&#176;C due to their intrinsic nature to lose and absorb water upon variations in humidity and temperature. In this work, a green solvent, solketal, is introduced into poly 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208;enoyloxy)ethyl azaniumyl propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (poly(DMAPS)) zwitterionic hydrogels. Compared to glycerol, solketal endows hydrogels with greater possibility for further modification as well as improved water content and mechanical performance consistency over 30&#8211;90% RH. Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non&#8208;leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&#8722;1), wide humidity, and temperature range applicability. A wide&#8208;humidity range healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag paste. A&#160;full&#8208;device healable and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor is developed. This study is a pioneering work that tackles the broad humidity range applicability issue of hydrogels, and demonstrates the ion&#8208;leakage&#8208;free ionic skins with zwitterionic dielectrics. The outcomes of the study will considerably promote advancements in the fields of hydrogel electronics and iontronic sensors.

         <title>Extremely Tough, Stretchable Gel Electrolytes with Strong Interpolymer Hydrogen Bonding Prepared Using Concentrated Electrolytes to Stabilize Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>

Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes are prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used as an artificial protective layer for lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel&#8208;coated Li&#8208;metal anode considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell as well as a Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NMC622) full cell.








Abstract
Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes, which can be prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated lithium (Li)&#8208;salt electrolytes, are reported. These electrolytes can be realized by optimizing the competitive hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between polymer chains, solvent molecules, Li cations, and counteranions. Free polar solvent molecules, which typically impede interpolymer hydrogen bonding, are scarce in concentrated electrolytes; this feature can be exploited to prepare hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel electrolytes with unprecedented toughness. In contrast, free solvent molecules are abundant in electrolytes with typical concentrations, yielding considerably weaker gel electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used an artificial protective layer for Li&#8208;metal anodes, as it considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell through uniform Li deposition/dissolution. Additionally, employing the gel electrolyte as the protecting layer significantly improves the cycling performance of the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 full cell.

         <title>Ti3C2Tx MXene van der Waals Gate Contact for GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as gate contacts, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The Schottky gate GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Gate controllability is a key factor that determines the performance of GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). However, at the traditional metal&#8208;GaN interface, direct chemical interaction between metal and GaN can result in fixed charges and traps, which can significantly deteriorate the gate controllability. In this study, Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN HEMTs as the gate contact, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit an extremely low off&#8208;state current (IOFF) of 10&#8722;7 mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 (which is six orders of magnitude higher than conventional Ni/Au contact), a high off&#8208;state drain breakdown voltage of 1085&#160;V, and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work shows the great potential of MXene films as gate electrodes in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor devices.

         <title>Unusual Temperature Dependence of Water Sorption in Semicrystalline Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials typically lose their water sorption capability with increasing temperature. Can this temperature effect be reversed? By leveraging the phase transformation of semicrystalline hydrogels, an unusual water sorption behavior is demonstrated where the water uptake can be doubled with an increased temperature of 25&#160;&#176;C. This finding will enable a new degree of freedom to harness moisture and heat.








Abstract
Water vapor sorption is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and plays an important role in various applications, including humidity regulation, energy storage, thermal management, and water harvesting. In particular, capturing moisture at elevated temperatures is highly desirable to prevent dehydration and to enlarge the tunability of water uptake. However, owing to the thermodynamic limit of conventional materials, sorbents inevitably tend to capture less water vapor at higher temperatures, impeding their broad applications. Here, an inverse temperature dependence of water sorption in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, where their water uptake can be doubled with increasing temperature from 25 to 50&#160;&#176;C, is reported. With mechanistic modeling of water&#8211;polymer interactions, this unusual water sorption is attributed to the first&#8208;order phase transformation of PEG structures, and the key parameters for a more generalized strategy in materials development are identified. This work elucidates a new regime of water sorption with an unusual temperature dependence, enabling a promising engineering space for harnessing moisture and heat.

         <title>Artificial Tendrils Mimicking Plant Movements by Mismatching Modulus and Strain in Core and Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological principles of tendril movement and coiling in plants are studied and used as design criteria to implement coiling movements in an artificial multimaterial fiber (MMFs) system. The MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core and an elastic shell, such that the core enables the implementation of strain displacement in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible coiling movement.








Abstract
Motile organs have evolved in climbing plants enabling them to find a support and, after secure attachment, to reach for sunlight without investing in a self&#8208;supporting stem. Searching movements, the twining of stems, and the coiling of tendrils are involved in successful plant attachment. Such coiling movements have great potential in robotic applications, especially if they are reversible. Here, the underlying mechanism of tendril movement based on contractile fibers is reported, as illustrated by a function&#8211;morphological analysis of tendrils in several liana species and the encoding of such a principle in a core&#8211;shell multimaterial fiber (MMF) system. MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core fiber (SMCF) and an elastic shell. The shape&#8208;memory effect of the core fibers enables the implementation of strain mismatch in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible motion. The produced MMFs show coiling and/or uncoiling behavior, with a high reversible actuation magnitude of &#8776;400%, which is almost 20 times higher compared with similar stimuli for sensitive soft actuators. The movements in these MMFs rely on the crystallization/melting behavior of oriented macromolecules of SMCF.

         <title>Diagnosing and Correcting the Failure of the Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte for Enhancing Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; polysulfides on the electrode interface in a diffusion&#8208;restricted solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) is identified as a critical failure cause of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries, which can be addressed by applying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis to tailor the chemical environment in the SPE.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attract great interest in developing high&#8208;performance yet reliable solid&#8208;state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of the SPE and SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation is identified as a critical failure cause of SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8211;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8211;S redox in solid&#8208;state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion&#8208;restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8211;S redox failure in the SPE. It enables Ah&#8208;level solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom&#8208;up improvement of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Graphene Biointerface for Cardiac Arrhythmia Diagnosis and Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of graphene biointerfaces for cardiac electrophysiology is presented. The devices feature effective electrochemical properties: low impedance and high charge storage and injection capacities. The transparency of graphene allows for simultaneous optical mapping and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. This report indicates that graphene biointerfaces are fundamental for future diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
Heart rhythm disorders, known as arrhythmias, cause significant morbidity and are one of the leading causes of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are frequently treated by implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, or by ablation therapy guided by electroanatomical mapping. Both implantable and ablation therapies require sophisticated biointerfaces for electrophysiological measurements of electrograms and delivery of therapeutic stimulation or ablation energy. In this work, a graphene biointerface for in vivo cardiac electrophysiology is reported for the first time. Leveraging sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thick tissue&#8208;conformable graphene arrays, sensing and stimulation of the open mammalian heart are demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the graphene biointerface treatment of atrioventricular block (the kind of arrhythmia where the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is interrupted) is demonstrated. The graphene arrays show effective electrochemical properties, namely interface impedance down to 40&#160;&#937;&#8201;cm2 at 1&#160;kHz, charge storage capacity up to 63.7&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2, and charge injection capacity up to 704&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2. Transparency of the graphene structures allows for simultaneous optical mapping of cardiac action potentials, calcium transients, and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. The report presents evidence of the significant potential of graphene biointerfaces for advanced cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia therapy.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Stable Hyperfluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Improved Color Purities and Ultrahigh Power Efficiencies Based on Low&#8208;Polar Sensitizing Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is created, based on which low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems with small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are achieved for hyperfluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high color purity, record&#8208;high electroluminescence efficiencies and long operational lifetime.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;definition displays because of their narrow emission spectra. However, the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and spectra of MR&#8208;TADF molecules are highly sensitive to hosts and sensitizers when applied to organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the highly polar environments in devices often lead to significantly broadened EL spectra. In this study, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF sensitizer (BTDMAC&#8208;XT) with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is constructed, which acts as a good emitter in doped and non&#8208;doped OLEDs with high external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 26.7% and 29.3%, respectively. By combining BTDMAC&#8208;XT with conventional low&#8208;polarity hosts, low&#8208;polarity sensitizing systems with a small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are constructed for the MR&#8208;TADF molecule BN2. Hyperfluorescence (HF) OLEDs employing the low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems successfully improve the color quality of BN2 and afford an excellent &#951;ext of 34.4%, a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 166.3&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and a long operational lifetime (LT50&#160;=&#160;40309&#160;h) at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. These results provide instructive guidance for the sensitizer design and device optimization for energy&#8208;efficient and stable HF&#8208;OLEDs with high&#8208;quality light.

&lt;p&gt;A proof-of-concept thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration-quenching free feature is created, based on which low-polar sensitizing systems with small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are achieved for hyperfluorescence organic light-emitting diodes, providing high color purity, record-high electroluminescence efficiencies and long operational lifetime.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-resonance (MR) molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are emerging as promising candidates for high-definition displays because of their narrow emission spectra. However, the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and spectra of MR-TADF molecules are highly sensitive to hosts and sensitizers when applied to organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the highly polar environments in devices often lead to significantly broadened EL spectra. In this study, a proof-of-concept TADF sensitizer (BTDMAC-XT) with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration-quenching free feature is constructed, which acts as a good emitter in doped and non-doped OLEDs with high external quantum efficiencies (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;s) of 26.7% and 29.3%, respectively. By combining BTDMAC-XT with conventional low-polarity hosts, low-polarity sensitizing systems with a small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are constructed for the MR-TADF molecule BN2. Hyperfluorescence (HF) OLEDs employing the low-polar sensitizing systems successfully improve the color quality of BN2 and afford an excellent &#951;&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; of 34.4%, a record-high power efficiency of 166.3&#160;lm&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a long operational lifetime (&lt;i&gt;LT&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;40309&#160;h) at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These results provide instructive guidance for the sensitizer design and device optimization for energy-efficient and stable HF-OLEDs with high-quality light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconfigurable Multilevel Optical PUF by Spatiotemporally Programmed Crystallization of Supersaturated Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of reconfigurable multilevel optical physical unclonable function (PUF) based on the stochastic crystallization of supersaturated solution, intended for a hierarchical identification process with recyclable tokens, is presented. The global parameters introduced in this study act as prefixes to classify PUFs into subgroups, which allows for a fast authentication process.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are&#160;emerging as an alternative to information security by providing an advanced level of cryptographic keys with non&#8208;replicable characteristics, yet the cryptographic keys of conventional PUFs are not reconfigurable from the ones assigned at the manufacturing stage and the overall authentication process slows down as the number of entities in the dataset or the length of cryptographic key increases. Herein, a supersaturated solution&#8208;based PUF (S&#8208;PUF) is presented that utilizes stochastic crystallization of a supersaturated sodium acetate solution to allow a time&#8208;efficient, hierarchical authentication process together with on&#8208;demand rewritability of cryptographic keys. By controlling the orientation and the average grain size of the sodium acetate crystals via a spatiotemporally programmed temperature profile, the S&#8208;PUF now includes two global parameters, that is, angle of rotation and divergence of the diffracted beam, in addition to the speckle pattern to produce multilevel cryptographic keys, and these parameters function as prefixes for the classification of each entity for a fast authentication process. At the same time, the reversible phase change of sodium acetate enables repeated reconfiguration of the cryptographic key, which is expected to offer new possibilities for a next&#8208;generation, recyclable anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.

         <title>Vertical Array of Graphite Oxide Liquid Crystal by Microwire Shearing for Highly Thermally Conductive Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) is realized by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a record high through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 15% higher than that of pure Indium foil (81.8&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1).








Abstract
Excellent through&#8208;plane thermally conductive composites are highly demanded for efficient heat dissipation. Giant sheets have large crystalline domain and significantly reduce interface phonon scattering, making them promising to build highly thermally conductive composites. However, realizing vertical orientation of giant sheets remains challenging due to their enormous mass and huge hydrodynamic drag force. Here,&#160;we&#160;achieve highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a recorded through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Microscale shearing fields induced by vertical motion of microwires conquer huge hydrodynamic energy barrier and vertically reorient giant sheets. The resulting liquid crystals exhibit extremely retarded relaxation and impart large&#8208;scale vertical array with bidirectional ordering degree as high as 0.82. The graphite array&#8208;based composites demonstrate an ultrahigh thermal enhancement efficiency of over 35 times per unit volume. Furthermore, the composites improve cooling efficiency by 93% for thermal management tests compared to commercial thermal interface materials. This work offers a novel methodology to precisely manipulate the orientation of giant particles and promote large&#8208;scale fabrication of vertical array with advanced functionalities.

         <title>Novel Organic Superbase Dopants for Ultraefficient N&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of two organic superbase dopants as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the dopants lead to record&#8208;high conductivity in doped N2200 and PC61BM films, and exhibit particularly high polaron generation efficiency and doping efficiency. A possible deprotonation&#8208;induced nucleophilic&#8208;attack n&#8208;doping mechanism is suggested for the organic superbase dopants.








Abstract
Doping is a powerful technique for engineering the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs), yet efficient n&#8208;doping of OSCs remains a central challenge. Herein, the discovery of two organic superbase dopants, namely P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu and P4&#8208;t&#8208;Bu as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. Typical n&#8208;type semiconductors such as N2200 and PC61BM are shown to experience a significant increase of conductivity upon doping by the two dopants. In particular, the optimized electrical conductivity of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped PC61BM reaches a record&#8208;high value of 2.64&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The polaron generation efficiency of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped in PC61BM is found to be over 35%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of benchmark n&#8208;dopant N&#8208;DMBI. In addition, a deprotonation&#8208;initiated, nucleophilic&#8208;attack&#8208;based n&#8208;doping mechanism is proposed for the organic superbases, which involves the deprotonation of OSC molecules, the nucleophilic attack of the resulting carbanions on the OSC's &#960;&#8208;bonds, and the subsequent n&#8208;doping through single electron transfer process between the anionized and neutral OSCs. This work highlights organic superbases as promising n&#8208;dopants for OSCs and opens up opportunities to explore and develop highly efficient n&#8208;dopants.

         <title>Achieving High Quantum Efficiency Broadband NIR Mg4Ta2O9:Cr3+ Phosphor Through Lithium&#8208;Ion Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped&#160;Mg4Ta2O9phosphor is explored, and 61.25% of the record EQE detected at 450&#160;nm excitation&#160;is&#160;achieved through lithium&#8208;ion compensation. As a key and efficient broadband NIR transmitter, it can achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. It provides a new option&#160;for the next&#8208;generation&#160;compact NIR light source and can be utilized to improve the current detection sensitivity based on intelligent NIR spectroscopy technology.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;efficient broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) are urgently needed to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution of current smart NIR spectroscopy&#8208;based techniques. Nonetheless, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LED has severely limited owing to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) bottleneck of NIR light&#8208;emitting materials. Herein, a blue LED excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped tetramagnesium ditantalate (Mg4Ta2O9, MT) phosphor is advantageously modified through lithium ion as a key efficient broadband NIR emitter to achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. The emission spectrum encompasses the 700&#8211;1300&#160;nm electromagnetic spectrum of first biological window (&#955;max&#160;= 842&#160;nm) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of &#8776;2280 cm&#8722;1 (&#8776;167&#160;nm), and achieves a record EQE of 61.25% detected at 450&#160;nm excitation through Li&#8208;ion compensation. A prototype NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with MT:Cr3+, Li+ to evaluate its potential practical application, which reveals an NIR output power of 53.22&#160;mW at a driving current of 100&#160;mA, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 25.09% at 10&#160;mA. This work provides an ultra&#8208;efficient broadband NIR luminescent material, which shows great promise in practical applications and presents a novel option for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power compact NIR light sources.

&lt;p&gt;A blue light excitable Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped&#160;Mg&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;phosphor is explored, and 61.25% of the record EQE detected at 450&#160;nm excitation&#160;is&#160;achieved through lithium-ion compensation. As a key and efficient broadband NIR transmitter, it can achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. It provides a new option&#160;for the next-generation&#160;compact NIR light source and can be utilized to improve the current detection sensitivity based on intelligent NIR spectroscopy technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-efficient broadband near-infrared (NIR) phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (pc-LEDs) are urgently needed to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution of current smart NIR spectroscopy-based techniques. Nonetheless, the performance of NIR pc-LED has severely limited owing to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) bottleneck of NIR light-emitting materials. Herein, a blue LED excitable Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped tetramagnesium ditantalate (Mg&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, MT) phosphor is advantageously modified through lithium ion as a key efficient broadband NIR emitter to achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. The emission spectrum encompasses the 700&#8211;1300&#160;nm electromagnetic spectrum of first biological window (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 842&#160;nm) with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of &#8776;2280 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8776;167&#160;nm), and achieves a record EQE of 61.25% detected at 450&#160;nm excitation through Li-ion compensation. A prototype NIR pc-LED is fabricated with MT:Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to evaluate its potential practical application, which reveals an NIR output power of 53.22&#160;mW at a driving current of 100&#160;mA, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 25.09% at 10&#160;mA. This work provides an ultra-efficient broadband NIR luminescent material, which shows great promise in practical applications and presents a novel option for the next-generation high-power compact NIR light sources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two Functions from a Single Photoresist: Tuning Microstructure Degradability from Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one photoresist for 3D direct laser writing applications is introduced, which allows the degradation properties of the printed structure to be carefully tuned by simply altering the laser intensity during the fabrication process. The unique ability to fabricate 3D microstructures consisting of both degradable and nondegradable segments from a single photoresist is a critical advancement in photoresist technology.








Abstract
A photoresist&#8212;based on a light&#8208;stabilized dynamic material driven by an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium photo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of triazolinediones with naphthalenes&#8212;whose ability to intrinsically degrade postprinting can be tuned by a simple adjustment of laser intensity during 3D laser lithography is introduced. The resist's ability to form stable networks under green light irradiation that degrade in the dark is transformed into a tunable degradable 3D printing material platform. In&#8208;depth characterization of the printed microstructures via atomic force microscopy before and during degradation reveals the high dependency of the final structures&#8217; properties on the writing parameters. Upon identifying the ideal writing parameters and their effect on the network structure, it is possible to selectively toggle between stable and fully degradable structures. This simplifies the direct laser writing manufacturing process of multifunctional materials significantly, which typically requires the use of separate resists and consecutive writing efforts to achieve degradable and nondegradable material sections.

         <title>A Scalable Platform for Fabricating Biodegradable Microparticles with Pulsatile Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is a high&#8208;throughput method for fabricating biodegradable microparticles that release drug in a discrete pulse after a tunable delay. The PULSED encapsulation technique is compatible with crystalline and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers, and is gentle enough to preserve the bioactivity of proteins.








Abstract
Pulsatile drug delivery systems have the potential to improve patient adherence and therapeutic efficacy by providing a sequence of doses in a single injection. Herein, a novel platform, termed Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is developed, which enables the high&#8208;throughput fabrication of microparticles exhibiting pulsatile release. In PULSED, biodegradable polymeric microstructures with an open cavity are formed using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing and soft lithography, filled with drug, and sealed using a contactless heating step in which the polymer flows over the orifice to form a complete shell around a drug&#8208;loaded core. Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) particles with this structure can rapidly release encapsulated material after delays of 10 &#177; 1, 15 &#177; 1, 17 &#177; 2, or 36 &#177; 1 days in vivo, depending on polymer molecular weight and end group. The system is even compatible with biologics, releasing over 90% of bevacizumab in its bioactive form after a two&#8208;week delay in vitro. The PULSED system is highly versatile, offering compatibility with crystalline and amorphous polymers, easily injectable particle sizes, and compatibility with several newly developed drug loading methods. Together, these results suggest that PULSED is a promising platform for creating long&#8208;acting drug formulations that improve patient outcomes due to its simplicity, low cost, and scalability.

         <title>High Energy Harvesting Performances Silicone Elastomer via Filling Soft Dielectric with Stretching Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft dielectric with good interfacial interaction, dielectric enhancement, and deformability is developed and used as novel filler for dielectric elastomer, significantly improving the stretched breakdown strength of nanocomposite under 800% plane strain. Dielectric elastomer generator based on this soft filler shows high power generation energy density (130.5 mJ g&#8722;1) and record electromechanical conversion efficiency (44.5%).








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) with high generated energy density and high conversion efficiency are of great interest. Among several dielectric elastomers (DEs), silicone elastomer filled with ceramic fillers have been extensively studied for their high elasticity, insulation, and permittivity. However, the stretched breakdown strength (Ebs) of such composites decreases significantly under large strain, thus sharply reduces its energy harvesting performances. In this study, a polar rubber&#8208;based dielectric (GNBR) is synthetized and creatively used as &#8220;soft filler&#8221; for silicone elastomer. Benefiting from the deformability under stretching and its inherent strong interface bonding with silicone elastomer, this soft filler effectively avoids the formation of weak interface under large strain and reduces the local field strength of interface area. As expected, the composite filled with soft filler (GNBR/PMVS) shows enhanced Ebs of 2.8 times that of composite with traditional hard filler (TiO2/PMVS) under equibiaxial strain of 200%. As a result, GNBR/PMVS composite exhibits maximum energy density of 130.5 mJ g&#8722;1 with up&#8208;to&#8208;date highest power conversion efficiency of reported DEG (44.5%). The findings will provide new insights in the rational design of DE composites characterized by high stretched breakdown strength for advanced energy harvesting system.

         <title>Launching and Manipulation of Higher&#8208;Order In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Low&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly confined, directionally dependent in&#8208;plane hyperbolic light propagation is demonstrated in a heterostructure composed of a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire on &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flake. Such low&#8208;dimensional heterostructure showcases the efficient and precise manipulation of the extremely anisotropic light&#8208;matter interactions at the deeply subwavelength scale, opening opportunities for a wide range of IR applications.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) are stimulated by coupling infrared (IR) photons with the polar lattice vibrations. Such HPhPs offer low&#8208;loss, highly confined light propagation at subwavelength scales with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or in&#8208;plane hyperbolic wavefronts. For HPhPs, while a hyperbolic dispersion implies multiple propagating modes with a distribution of wavevectors at a given frequency, so far it has been challenging to experimentally launch and probe the higher&#8208;order modes that offer stronger wavelength compression, especially for in&#8208;plane HPhPs. In this work, the experimental observation of higher&#8208;order in&#8208;plane HPhP modes stimulated on a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire (NW)/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is reported where leveraging both the low&#8208;dimensionality and low&#8208;loss nature of the polar NWs, higher&#8208;order HPhPs modes within 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal are launched by the 1D 3C&#8208;SiC NW. The launching mechanism is further studied and the requirements for efficiently launching of such higher&#8208;order modes are determined. In addition, by altering the geometric orientation between the 3C&#8208;SiC NW and &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal, the manipulation of higher&#8208;order HPhP dispersions as a method of tuning is demonstrated. This work illustrates an extremely anisotropic low dimensional heterostructure platform to confine and configure electromagnetic waves at the deep&#8208;subwavelength scales for a range of IR applications including sensing, nano&#8208;imaging, and on&#8208;chip photonics.

In this work, the experimental observation of higher-order in-plane HPhP modes stimulated on a 3C-SiC nanowire (NW)/&#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure is reported where leveraging both the low-dimensionality and low-loss nature of the polar NWs, higher-order HPhPs modes within 2D &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal are launched by the 1D 3C-SiC NW. The launching mechanism is further studied and the requirements for efficiently launching of such higher-order modes are determined. In addition, by altering the geometric orientation between the 3C-SiC NW and &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystal, the manipulation of higher-order HPhP dispersions as a method of tuning is demonstrated. This work illustrates an extremely anisotropic low dimensional heterostructure platform to confine and configure electromagnetic waves at the deep-subwavelength scales for a range of IR applications including sensing, nano-imaging, and on-chip photonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Carrier Management via a Multifunctional Modifier for High&#8208;Quality Low&#8208;Bandgap Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites and Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and excellent contacts at the perovskite/C60 interface are developed by introducing a one&#8208;in&#8208;all modifier. The introduction of cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) to Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites restrains non&#8208;radiative recombination and facilitates electron transfer. Consequently, the CysHCl&#8208;processed devices achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.15% for low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) and 26.16% for all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) hold great promise in terms of ultrahigh efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility, stepping forward to the next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. However, their further development is hampered by the relatively low performance of low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Improving the carrier management, including suppressing trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination and promoting carrier transfer, is of great significance to enhance the performance of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. Herein, a carrier management strategy is reported for using cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) simultaneously as a bulky passivator and a surface anchoring agent for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite. CysHCl processing effectively reduces trap density and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, enabling the growth of high&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite with greatly improved carrier diffusion length of &gt;8&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the electron transfer at the perovskite/C60 interface is accelerated due to the formation of surface dipoles and favorable energy band bending. As a result, these advances enable the demonstration of champion efficiency of 22.15% for CysHCl&#8208;processed LBG Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with remarkable enhancement in both open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor. When paired with a wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite subcell, a certified 25.7%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem device is further demonstrated.

         <title>Trans&#8208;Reflective Structural Color Filters Assisting Multifunctional&#8208;Integrated Semitransparent Photovoltaic Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multifunctional STOPVs for smart windows are presented, based on strong resonance effect of asymmetrical MIM microcavities. These devices present a recorded QUE of 80%, flowery trans&#8208;reflective structural colors scanning visible region, superior UV&#8208;blocking (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) of 95%, and IR&#8208;rejection (700&#8211;1400&#160;nm) of 100%, of which, the rear two performances are individually better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial optical films for solar window.








Abstract
Multifunction&#8208;integrated semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (STOPVs), with high power generation, colorful transmittance/reflectance, excellent&#160;ultraviolet (UV) protection, and thermal insulation, are fully in line with the concept of architectural aesthetics and photoprotection characteristics for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic&#8208;window. For the indelible rainbow color photovoltaic window, one crucial issue is to realize the integration of these photons&#8208; and photoelectric&#8208;related multifunction. Herein, dynamic transmissive and reflective structural color controllable filters, with asymmetrical metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) configurations (20&#160;nm&#8208;Ag&#8208;HATCN&#8208;30&#160;nm&#8208;Ag) through machine learning, are deliberately designed for colorful STOPV devices. This endows the resultant integrated devices with &#8776;5% enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the bare&#8208;STOPVs, gifted UV (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) blocking rates as high as 93.5, 94.1, 90.2, and 94.5%, as well as a superior&#160;infrared radiation (IR) (700&#8208;1400&#160;nm) rejection approaching 100% for transparent purple&#8208;, blue&#8208;, green&#8208; and red&#8208;STOPV cells, respectively. Most importantly, benefiting from the photonic recycling effect beyond microcavity resonance wavelength, a reported quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) as high as 80%, is first presented for the transparent&#8208;green&#8208;STOPVs with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV. These asymmetrical Febry&#8208;P&#233;rot transmissive and reflective structural color filters can also be extended to silicon&#8208; and perovskite&#8208;based optoelectric devices and make it possible to integrate additional target optical functions for multi&#8208;purpose optoelectric devices.

         <title>Superlattice Nanofilm on a Touchscreen for Photoexcited Bacteria and Virus Killing by Tuning Electronic Defects in the Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering electronic defects in ZnO&#8211;Fe2O3 superlattice heterointerfaces is applied for smartphone&#8208;/solar&#8208;triggered bactericidal and virucidal touchscreens, even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen exhibits excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.








Abstract
Currently, the global COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has significantly increased the public attention toward the spread of pathogenic viruses and bacteria on various high&#8208;frequency touch surfaces. Developing a self&#8208;disinfecting coating on a touchscreen is an urgent and meaningful task. Superlattice materials are among the most promising photocatalysts owing to their efficient charge transfer in abundant heterointerfaces. However, excess electronic defects at the heterointerfaces result in the loss of substantial amounts of photogenerated charge carrier. In this study, a ZnO&#63743;Fe2O3 superlattice nanofilm is designed via atomic layer deposition for photocatalytic bactericidal and virucidal touchscreen. Additionally, electronic defects in the superlattice heterointerface are engineered. Photogenerated electrons and holes will be rapidly separated and transferred into ZnO and Fe2O3 across the heterointerfaces owing to the formation of Zn&#63743;O, Fe&#63743;O, and Zn&#63743;Fe covalent bonds at the heterointerfaces, where ZnO and Fe2O3 function as electronic donors and receptors, respectively. The high generation capacity of reactive oxygen species results in a high antibacterial and antiviral efficacy (&gt;90%) even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen shows excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.

         <title>Move Aside Pentacene: Diazapentacene&#8208;Doped para&#8208;Terphenyl, a Zero&#8208;Field Room&#8208;Temperature Maser with Strong Coupling for Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl is discovered to act as a maser, the microwave analogue of lasers. As&#160;only the second material ever discovered to mase at room&#8208;temperature and zero external magnetic&#8208;field,&#160;optical and paramagnetic characterizations of this new material, to spearhead studies of maser materials for quantum sensors, magnetic spintronics, and tailored organic materials in optoelectronics, are presented.








Abstract
Masers can deliver ultralow&#8208;noise amplification of microwave signals in medical imaging and deep&#8208;space communication, with recent research being rekindled through the discovery of gain media operating at room&#8208;temperature, eschewing bulky cryogenics that hindered their use.

         <title>Achieving Ferroelectricity in a Centrosymmetric High&#8208;Performance Semiconductor by Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>In a high&#8208;performance semiconductor Bi2O2Se, a strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric transition is demonstrated by the appearance of butterfly loops and 180&#176; phase switching in the piezoelectric force microscopy measurements, together with the evolution of optical second&#8208;harmonic generation. Materials with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and ferroelectrics under strain are rare.








Abstract
Phase engineering by strain in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for a variety of applications. Here, a study of the strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric (FE) transition in bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se) films, a high&#8208;performance (HP) semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, is presented. Bi2O2Se is not FE at ambient pressure. At a loading force of &#8819;400 nN, the piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops in magnitude and 180&#176; phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors, these features are attributed to a transition to the FE phase. The transition is further supported by the appearance of a sharp peak in optical second&#8208;harmonic generation under uniaxial strain. In general, solids with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and FE under strain are rare. The FE transition is discussed using first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts and serves as the basis for a memristor with a huge on/off current ratio of 106. This work adds a new degree of freedom to HP electronic/optoelectronic semiconductors, and the integration of FE and HP semiconductivity paves the way for many exciting functionalities, including HP neuromorphic computing and bulk&#160;piezophotovoltaics.

         <title>5&#160;nm Ultrathin Crystalline Ferroelectric P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;Brush Tuned for Hysteresis&#8208;Free Sub 60&#160;mV dec&#8722;1&#160;Negative&#8208;Capacitance Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrathin crystalline ferroelectric polymer based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) is developed on AlOX to realize negative&#8208;capacitance metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MOSFETs) with a MoS2 channel. Systematic adjustment of the thickness ratio between the polymer and dielectric AlOX achieves a hysteresis&#8208;free FET with a minimum subthreshold swing of 28 mV dec&#8722;1, operating at less than 2 V.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics (FE), which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer is developed based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) to achieve the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of NC&#8208;FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8211;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) is prepared on AlOX by a newly developed brush method, which enables an FE/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC&#8208;FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at a thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis&#8208;free operation with an SS of 28&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 at &#8776;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. This P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC&#8208;FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low&#8208;power devices.

         <title>Ultrafast, High&#8208;Strain, and Strong Uniaxial Hydrogel Actuators from Recyclable Nanofibril Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators benefit from high actuation strain and mechanical properties that mimic biological tissues but suffer from low actuation rates and limited controllability. It is shown that the performance of hydrogel actuators can be improved by orders of magnitude using uniaxial fibrillar hydrogels that focus the entire swelling in the actuation direction&#8211;a significant advancement toward hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.








Abstract
Polymer hydrogels mimic biological tissues and are suitable for future lifelike machines. However, their actuation is isotropic, so they must be crosslinked or placed in a turgor membrane to achieve high actuation pressures, severely impeding their performance. Here, it is shown that organizing cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) in anisotropic hydrogel sheets leads to mechanical in&#8208;plane reinforcement that generates a uniaxial, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane strain with performance far surpassing polymer hydrogels. These fibrillar hydrogel actuators expand uniaxially by 250 times with an initial rate of 100&#8211;130%&#160;s&#8722;1, compared to &lt;10 times and &lt;1%&#160;s&#8722;1 in directional strain rate for isotropic hydrogels, respectively. The blocking pressure reaches 0.9&#160;MPa, similar to turgor actuators, while the time to reach 90% of the maximum&#160;pressure is 1&#8211;2&#160;min, compared to 10&#160;min to hours for polymer hydrogel actuators. Uniaxial actuators that lift objects 120&#160;000 times their weight and soft grippers are showcased. In addition, the hydrogels can be recycled without a loss in performance. The uniaxial swelling allows adding channels through the gel for local solvent delivery, further increasing the actuation rate and cyclability. Thus, fibrillar networks can overcome the major drawbacks of hydrogel actuators and is a significant advancement towards hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.

The prepared 2D MOF with enhanced electro&#8208;conductivity and modified electronic structure demonstrates superior activity and robust stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which paves the way to design MOFs at a molecular level.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, a molecularly engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan&#8211;metal links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF) is designed. The crystal structure is solved from microcrystals by a continuous&#8208;rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique. Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF due to the Ni&#8211;S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand for enhancing electroconductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that (DMBD)&#8208;MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over non&#8208;thiol (e.g., 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog (BDC)&#8208;MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate&#8208;limiting *O intermediate formation step. Iron&#8208;substituted NiFe(DMBD)&#8208;MOF achieves a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at a small overpotential of 280&#160;mV, indicating a new MOF platform for efficient OER catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Membranes Enabled High Energy Density in PEI&#8208;Based Composites for High&#8208;Temperature Electrostatic Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sandwich structured BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT)/polyetherimide&#8211;boron nitride composites are prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique with water&#8208;dissolvent transfer method and hot&#8208;pressing process. By inserting the single&#8208;crystalline BZT membranes as the inner layer, the composites exhibit good dielectric&#8208;temperature stability and ultra&#8208;high energy&#8208;density. This study paves a scalable way to develop novel high&#8208;temperature dielectric materials and capacitors with superior energy storage performance.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are promising for high power energy storage, but their breakdown strength (Eb) and energy density (Ue) usually degrade rapidly at high temperatures. Adding boron nitride (BN) nanosheets can improve the Eb and high&#8208;temperature endurance but with a limited Ue due to its low dielectric constant. Here, freestanding single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT) membranes with high dielectric constant are fabricated, and introduced into BN doped polyetherimide (PEI) to obtain laminated PEI&#8211;BN/BZT/PEI&#8211;BN composites. At room temperature, the composite shows a maximum Ue of 17.94&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at 730&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1, which is more than two times the pure PEI. Particularly, the composites exhibit excellent dielectric&#8208;temperature stability between 25&#160;and 150&#160;&#176;C. An outstanding Ue&#160;=&#160;7.90&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;is obtained at a relatively large electric field of 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;under 150&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to the most high&#8208;temperature dielectric capacitors reported so far. Phase&#8208;field simulation reveals that the depolarization electric field generated at the BZT/PEI&#8211;BN interfaces can effectively reduce carrier mobility, leading to the remarkable enhancement of the Eb and Ue over a wide temperature range. This work provides a promising and scalable route to develop sandwich&#8208;structured composites with prominent energy storage performances for high&#8208;temperature capacitive applications.

         <title>A Microbial Community Cultured in Gradient Hydrogel for Investigating Gut Microbiome&#8208;Drug Interaction and Guiding Therapeutic Decisions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient hydrogel&#8208;based microbial community is presented to simulate the real intestinal microbiome for bridging microbiome&#8208;drug interaction research and treatment decision. This model reveals three mechanisms of drug&#8208;microbiota interaction: immunological effect, bio&#8208;accumulation, and drug metabolism, which provide innovative regulatory approaches for improving the anti&#8208;cancer effect of drugs.








Abstract
Despite the recognition that the gut microbiota acts a clinically significant role in cancer chemotherapy, both mechanistic understanding and translational research are still limited. Maximizing drug efficacy requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the microbiota contributes to therapeutic responses, while microbiota modulation is hindered by the complexity of the human body. To address this issue, a 3D experimental model named engineered microbiota (EM) is reported for bridging microbiota&#8208;drug interaction research and therapeutic decision&#8208;making. EM can be manipulated in vitro and faithfully recapitulate the human gut microbiota at the genus/species level while allowing co&#8208;culture with cells, organoids, and isolated tissues for testing drug responses. Examination of various clinical and experimental drugs by EM reveales that the gut microbiota affects drug efficacy through three pathways: immunological effects, bioaccumulation, and drug metabolism. Guided by discovered mechanisms, custom&#8208;tailored strategies are adopted to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of drugs on orthotopic tumor models with patient&#8208;derived gut microbiota. These strategies include immune synergy, nanoparticle encapsulation, and host&#8211;guest complex formation, respectively. Given the important role of the gut microbiota in influencing drug efficacy, EM will likely become an indispensable tool to guide drug translation and clinical decision&#8208;making.

A fully composited benzo[b]naphtho[2',3':5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone/reduced graphene oxide (BNDTH/RGO)&#160;is designed to simultaneously conquer the low utilization of active sites, intrinsic poor conductivity, and strong solubility of organic electrode materials, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with record&#8208;high cycling stability. This work brings new opportunities for the exploration of ultra&#8208;stable organic cathode materials for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Organic materials have attracted much attention in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their sustainability and structure&#8208;designable, but their further development is hindered by the high solubility, poor conductivity, and low utilization of active groups, resulting in poor cycling stability, terrible rate capability, and low capacity. In order to solve these three major obstacles, a novel organic host, benzo[b]naphtho[2&#8217;,3&#8217;:5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone (BNDTH), with abundant electroactive groups and stable extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure is synthesized and composited with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a solvent exchange composition method to act as the cathode material for AZIBs. The well&#8208;designed BNDTH/RGO composite exhibits a high capacity of 296&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (nearly a full utilization of the active groups), superior rate capability of 120&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a long lifetime of 58&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 65% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the ingenious structural design of the active molecule, as well as the unique solvent exchange composition strategy that enables effective dispersion of excess charge on the active molecule during discharge/charge process. This work provides important insights for the rational design of organic cathode materials and has significant guidance for realizing ideal high performance in AZIBs.

         <title>Tuning 2D Magnetism in Cobalt Monoxide Nanosheets Via In Situ Nickel&#8208;Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide (Ni&#8208;doped CoO) nanosheets with a high substitution doping concentration is proposed for the first time. 2D Ni&#8208;doped CoO exhibits obvious ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K, in sharp contrast to the pristine non&#8208;ferromagnetic 2D CoO, opening up a prospective way for tuning the magnetism of 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.








Abstract
Element doping has become an effective strategy to engineer the magnetic properties of two&#8208;dimensional&#160;(2D) materials and is widely explored in van der Waals layered transition metal dichalcogenides. However, the high&#8208;concentration substitution doping of 2D nonlayered metal oxides, which can preserve the original crystal texture and guarantee the homogeneity of doping distribution, is still a critical challenge due to the isotropic bonding of closed&#8208;packed structures. In this work, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D nonlayered nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide nanosheets via in situ atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition method is reported. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that nickel atoms are doped at the intrinsic cobalt atom sites. The nickel doping concentration is stable at &#8776;15%, superior to most magnetic dopants doping in 2D materials and metal oxides. Magnetic measurements showed that pristine cobalt monoxide is nonferromagnetic, whereas nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide exhibits robust ferromagnetic behavior with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that nickel atoms can improve the internal ferromagnetic correlation, giving rise to significant ferromagnetic performance of cobalt monoxide nanosheets. These results provide a valuable case for tuning the competing correlated states and magnetic ordering by substitution doping in 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Maximum Emission Peak Over 1500&#160;nm of Organic Assembly for Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing NIR&#8208;IIb Phototheranostics of Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic assembly with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm is prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 for blood&#8211;brain barrier&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic glioblastoma.








Abstract
The development of blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing phototheranostic agents in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), especially in the range of 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), affords great opportunities for glioblastoma (GBM) management. Herein, an organic assembly (denoted as LET&#8208;12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 is designed and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogs. The LET&#8208;12 can effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline&#8208;like receptors&#8208;mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8776;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue signal ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively). Owing to its good photothermal conversion ability, the LET&#8208;12 also can serve as a photothermal conversion agent, achieving obvious tumor repression of orthotopic murine GBM model after once treatment. The findings indicate that the LET&#8208;12 holds great potential for BBB&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic GBM. This self&#8208;assembly strategy of organic small molecules opens a new avenue for the construction of NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Determination of the Global Zero&#8208;Temperature Phase Diagram of Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining crystal graph attention networks with a newly created dataset, a compound space spanning 1 billion materials is scanned for new stable materials. As a result, the number of known theoretically synthesizable materials is increased by 30%. The resulting materials are then studied for extreme values of several properties.








Abstract
Crystal&#8208;graph attention neural networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools for the prediction of thermodynamic stability. The efficacy of their learning capabilities and their reliability is however subject to the quantity and quality of the data they are fed. Previous networks exhibit strong biases due to the inhomogeneity of the training data. Here a high&#8208;quality dataset is engineered to provide a better balance across chemical and crystal&#8208;symmetry space. Crystal&#8208;graph neural networks trained with this dataset show unprecedented generalization accuracy. Such networks are applied to perform machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput searches of stable materials, spanning 1 billion candidates. In this way, the number of vertices of the global T&#160;= 0&#160;K phase diagram is increased by 30% and find more than &#8776;150&#160;000 compounds with a distance to the convex hull of stability of less than 50&#160;meV&#160;atom&#8722;1. The discovered materials are then accessed for applications, identifying compounds with extreme values of a few properties, such as superconductivity, superhardness, and giant gap&#8208;deformation potentials.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Wall Engineering Enables Thermal Modulation in PMN&#8211;PT Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity modulation in PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals is demonstrated with a maximum enhancement of more than 20% at the intermediate poling state (intermediate d33). The enhancement is attributed to the reduction in domain wall density due to alternating current poling. The thermal conductivity decreases at optimized poling (maximum d33) due to increasing domain size inhomogeneity.








Abstract
Acting like thermal resistances, ferroelectric domain walls can be manipulated to realize dynamic modulation of thermal conductivity (k), which is essential for developing novel phononic circuits. Despite the interest, little attention has been paid to achieving room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in bulk materials due to challenges in obtaining a high thermal conductivity switching ratio (khigh/klow), particularly in commercially viable materials. Here, room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in 2.5&#160;mm&#8208;thick Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;xPbTiO3 (PMN&#8211;xPT) single crystals is demonstrated. With the use of advanced poling conditions, assisted by the systematic study on composition and orientation dependence of PMN&#8211;xPT, a range of thermal conductivity switching ratios with a maximum of &#8776;1.27 is observed. Simultaneous measurements of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) to characterize the poling state, domain wall density using polarized light microscopy (PLM), and birefringence change using quantitative PLM&#160;reveal that compared to the unpoled state, the domain wall density at intermediate poling states (0&lt; d33&lt;d33,max) is lower due to the enlargement in domain size. At optimized poling conditions (d33,max), the domain sizes show increased inhomogeneity that leads to enhancement in the domain wall density. This work highlights the potential of commercially available PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals among other relaxor&#8208;ferroelectrics for achieving temperature control in solid&#8208;state devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 at 4.7&#160;V by Interface Stabilization and Band Structure Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modified&#160;LCO has a gradient doping of Mg, uniform doping of Ni in Li layers, and uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating. The doping and coating simultaneously modify the band structure to improve the oxygen redox reversibility during cycles. Therefore, the modified LCO shows excellent cycling performance both at 4.6 V and 4.7 V.








Abstract
Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) is widely used in Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric energy density, which is generally charged to 4.3 V. Lifting the cut&#8208;off voltage of LCO from 4.3 V to 4.7 V will increase the specific capacity from 150 to 230 mAh g&#8208;1 with a significant improvement of 53%. However, LCO suffers serious problems of H1&#8208;3/O1 phase transformation, unstable interface between cathode and electrolyte, and irreversible oxygen redox reaction at 4.7 V. Herein, interface stabilization and band structure modification are proposed to strengthen the crystal structure of LCO for stable cycling of LCO at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.7 V. Gradient distribution of magnesium and uniform doping of nickel in Li layers inhibit the harmful phase transitions of LCO, while uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating stabilizes the LCO&#8208;electrolyte interface during cycles. Moreover, the modified band structure improves the oxygen redox reaction reversibility and electrochemical performance of the modified LCO. As a result, the modified LCO has a high capacity retention of 78% after 200 cycles at 4.7 V in the half cell and 63% after 500 cycles at 4.6 V in the full cell. This work makes the capacity of LCO one step closer to its theoretical specific capacity.

         <title>Walking Ferroelectric Liquid Droplets with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of ferroelectric liquid dropletson a ferroelectric solid substrate is controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on which side of the ferroelectric substrate is exposed to light. Moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate.








Abstract
The motion of ferroelectric liquid sessile droplets deposited on a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal, in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate. This behavior is understood as due to the coupling between the polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

         <title>Cuproptosis Induced by ROS Responsive Nanoparticles with Elesclomol and Copper Combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2212267, Nianzeng Xing, Haihua Xiao, and co&#8208;workers provides a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by ROS&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new cell death that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells, which induces cell death. However, existing Cu ionophores are small molecules with a short blood half&#8208;life making it hard to transport enough Cu into cancer cells. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer (PHPM) is designed, which is used to co&#8208;encapsulate elesclomol (ES) and Cu to form nanoparticles (NP@ESCu). After entering cancer cells, ES and Cu, triggered by excessive intracellular ROS, are readily released. ES and Cu work in a concerted way to not only kill cancer cells by cuproptosis, but also induce immune responses. In vitro, the ability of NP@ESCu to efficiently transport Cu and induce cuproptosis is investigated. In addition, the change in the transcriptomes of cancer cells treated with NP@ESCu is explored by RNA&#8208;Seq. In vivo, NP@ESCu is found to induce cuproptosis in the mice model with subcutaneous bladder cancer, reprograming the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, NP@ESCu is further combined with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand&#8208;1&#160;antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). This study provides the first report of combining nanomedicine that can induce cuproptosis with &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#160;for enhanced cancer therapy, thereby providing a novel strategy for future cancer therapy.

Immunotherapy
In article 2212267, Haihua Xiao, Nianzeng Xing, and co&#8208;workers present a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.

Perovskite Solar Modules
In article number 2211593, Yang Wang, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy of vapor&#8208;assisted defect passivation to manage defects in perovskite solar modules. CS2 can strongly coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, resulting in remarkable enhancement of the device efficiency (25.20% for 0.08 cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6 cm2).

In article number 2300084, Huan Wei, Zebing Zeng, Yugang Bai, Yuanyuan Hu, and co&#8208;workers report the discovery of organic superbases as ultraefficient n&#8208;dopants for organic semiconductors. The dopants result in record&#8208;high conductivity in typical n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, showing doping efficiency three times higher than the benchmark n&#8208;dopant N&#8208;DMBI. The image illustrates n&#8208;doping of P61CBM by the dopants.

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, proteins perform various recognition&#8208;mediated molecular functions relying on the principle of molecular complementarity. This review introduces how diverse synthesizable and modifiable materials with elaborate structural and molecular designs can achieve the molecular complementarity in mediating complex protein&#8208;like functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions, expanding the landscape of their proteomimetic applications.








Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique 3D structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on the understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of nanogap electrode fabrication protocols according to new classification principles is provided. How to integrate molecules into nanogap electrodes to form molecular junctions and highlight recent efforts toward the commercialization of molecular circuits are summarized, eventually overcoming the Achilles&#8217; heel of molecular electronics as a whole.








Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with the desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing, and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit are comprehensively grouped into three categories: 1) directly bridging one&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode component with another electrode, 2) physically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components, and 3) chemically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components. Finally, the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization is discussed and perspectives are provided, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulations in superconductors are summarized comprehensively, which includes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and those established methods. The significance of modulations in exploring the superconductivity is highlighted by applications into several newly discovered superconductors. Three directions for development of modulations are also outlined.








Abstract
The importance of modulations is elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, have been utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which can stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations toward a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <title>Ferroelectric Transistors for Memory and Neuromorphic Device Applications</title>

Recent developments in hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and their applications are comprehensively reviewed, with an in&#8208;depth analysis of ferroelectric transistors and their array structures. The relevant technological issues and their solutions are also discussed. This review provides a roadmap for the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memory and neuromorphic devices based on ferroelectric transistors.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials have been intensively investigated for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory devices in the past decades, owing to their nonvolatile polarization characteristics. Ferroelectric memory devices are expected to exhibit lower power consumption and higher speed than conventional memory devices. However, non&#8208;complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and degradation due to fatigue of traditional perovskite&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have hindered the development of high&#8208;density and high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memories in the past. The recently developed hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have attracted immense attention in the development of advanced semiconductor devices. Because hafnia is typically used in CMOS processes, it can be directly incorporated into current semiconductor technologies. Additionally, hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectrics show high scalability and large coercive fields that are advantageous for high&#8208;density memory devices. This review summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectric devices, especially ferroelectric transistors, for next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications. First, the types of ferroelectric memories and their operation mechanisms are reviewed. Then, issues limiting the realization of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric transistors and possible solutions are discussed. The experimental demonstration of ferroelectric transistor arrays, including 3D ferroelectric NAND and its operation characteristics, are also reviewed. Finally, challenges and strategies toward the development of next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications based on ferroelectric transistors are outlined.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of proton exchange membrane based electrolyzers is highly dependent on the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. The recent progress on the design of acidic OER electrocatalysts is reviewed, along with theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, some unresolved but urgent questions and the perspectives regarding future research for acidic OER electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency, and higher gas purity. However, PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized, classified, and discussed. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. Some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.
