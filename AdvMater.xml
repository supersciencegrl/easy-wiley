         <title>Organic Bilayer Heterostructures with Built&#8208;in Exciton Conversion for 2D Photonic Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic multilayer heterostructures with accurate spatial organization demonstrate strong light&#8208;matter interaction from excitonic responses and efficient carrier transfer across heterojunction interfaces, which are considered as promising candidates towards advanced optoelectronics. However, the precise regulation of the heterojunction surface area for finely adjusting exciton conversion and energy transfer is still formidable. Herein, we designed and synthesized organic bilayer heterostructures (OBHs) with controlled face&#8208;to&#8208;face heterojunction via a stepwise seeded growth strategy, which is favorable for efficient exciton propagation and conversion of optical interconnects. Notably, the relative position and overlap length ratio of component microwires (LDSA/LBPEA = 0.39&#8764;1.15) in OBHs were accurately regulated by modulating the crystallization time of seeded crystals, resulting into a tailored heterojunction surface area (R = Loverlap/LBPEA = 37.6%&#8764;65.3%). These as&#8208;prepared OBHs present the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide behaviors for optical outcoupling characteristics with tunable emission colors and intensities, which were applied into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) photonic barcodes. Our strategy opens a versatile avenue to purposely design OBHs with tailored heterojunctions for efficient energy transfer and exciton conversion, facilitating the application possibilities of advanced integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>3D Imprinting of Voxel&#8208;Level Structural Colors in Lithium Niobate Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced coloration methods are of pivotal importance in science, technology, and engineering. In this work, a facile voxel&#8208;level programmable 3D structural coloration in bulk lithium niobate crystals is achieved. Micro&#8211;nanoscale colorful voxels can be fast inscribed into any spatial position of the matrix. The present principle is anticipated to boost the applications of structural coloration in 3D displays, encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and data storage.








Abstract
Advanced coloration methods are of pivotal importance in science, technology, and engineering. However, 3D structural colors that are critical for emerging multidimensional information representation and recording are rarely achievable. Here, a facile voxel&#8208;level programmable 3D structural coloration in the bulk lithium niobate (LiNbO3) crystal is reported. This is achieved by engineering wavelength&#8208;selective interference between ordinary (O) and extraordinary (E) light in the crystal matrix. To induce effective phase contrast between O and E light for establishing the highly localized interference across the visible band, the presence of a pulse&#8208;internal&#8208;coupling effect is revealed in the single&#8208;pulse ultrafast laser&#8211;crystal interaction and an ultrafast&#8208;laser&#8208;induced micro&#8208;amorphization (MA) strategy is thus developed to manipulate local matrix structure. Consequently, micro&#8211;nanoscale colorful voxels can be fast inscribed into any spatial position of the crystal matrix in one step. It is demonstrated that the colors can be flexibly manipulated and quickly extracted in 3D space. Multidimensional MA&#8208;color data storage with large capacity, high writing and readout speed, long lifetime, and excellent stability under harsh conditions is achieved. The present principle enables multifunctional 3D structural coloration devices inside high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index transparent dielectrics and can serve as a general platform to innovate next&#8208;generation information optics.

         <title>Regulating isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated state phosphorescence for multi&#8208;color afterglow by photo&#8208;activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years. Herein, a new type of flexible films was fabricated by doping amphipathic pyrene tetra sulfonic acid sodium salts into amorphous poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix, which enabled the realization of color&#8208;tunable UOP spanning from orange&#8208;red to green after excitation light switched off. Interestingly, we demonstrated precise control of the proportion of isolated&#8208;molecular and aggregated state phosphorescence for colorful afterglow using photo&#8208;activation. A 2.19&#8208;fold increase in the dynamic phosphorescence lifetime of isolated molecules was observedfrom 752.94 to 1650.46 ms following an 8&#8208;minute irradiation under ambient conditions. This flexible and processable film exhibited versatile applications in multi&#8208;color afterglow displays, ultraviolet detection, multilevel information encryption, etc. Our study not only provides a strategy for the rational regulation of UOP colors but also expands the application potential of color&#8208;tunable UOP materials.

         <title>Compact Micropatterned Chip Empowers Undisturbed and Programmable Drug Addition in High&#8208;Throughput Cell Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Simultaneously adding multiple drugs and other chemical reagents to individual droplets at specific time points presents a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with tiny droplets in high&#8208;throughput screening applications. In this study, we develop a micropatterned polymer chip as a miniaturized platform for light&#8208;induced programmable drug addition in cell&#8208;based screening. This chip incorporates a porous superhydrophobic polymer film with atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) reactivity, facilitating the efficient grafting of azobenzene methacrylate, a photo&#8208;conformationally changeable group, onto the hydrophilic regions of polymer matrix at targeted locations and with precise densities. By employing light irradiation, the cyclodextrin&#8208;azobenzene host&#8208;guest complexes formed on the polymer chip can switch from an &#8220;associated&#8221; to a &#8220;dissociated&#8221; state, granting precise photochemical control over the supramolecular coding system and its surface patterning ability. Significantly, the exceptional spatial and temporal control offered by these chemical transitions empowers us to utilize Digital Light Processing (DLP) systems for simultaneous regulation and release of cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs across numerous droplets containing suspended or adhered cells. This approach minimizes mechanical disruption while achieving precise control over the timing of addition, dosage, and integration varieties of released drugs in high&#8208;throughput screening, all programmable to meet specific requirements.

         <title>Highly Robust Conductive Organo&#8208;hydrogels with Powerful Sensing Capabilities Under Large Mechanical Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The low mechanical strength of conductive hydrogels (&lt;1&#160;MPa) has been a significant hurdle in their practical application, as they are prone to fracturing under complex conditions, limiting their effectiveness. Here, we fabricated a strong and tough conductive hierarchical PEDOT:PSS/PVA organo&#8208;hydrogel (PPS organo&#8208;hydrogel) via a facile combining strategy of self&#8208;assembly and stretch training. With PVA/PEDOT:PSS microlayers and aligned PVA/PEDOT:PSS nanofibers, PVA and PEDOT:PSS nanocrystalline domains, and semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks, PPS organo&#8208;hydrogels displayed outstanding mechanical performances (strength: 54.8&#160;MPa, toughness: 153.97&#160;MJ/m3). Additionally, PPS organo&#8208;hydrogels also exhibited powerful sensing capabilities (Gauge Factor: 983) due to the aligned hierarchical structures and organic liquid phase of DMSO. Notably, with the synergy of such mechanical and sensing properties, organo&#8208;hydrogels can even detect objects as light as 1 gram, despite bearing a tensile strength of &#8764;23&#160;MPa. By incorporating these materials into human&#8208;machine interfaces, such as controlling artificial arms for grabbing objects and monitoring sport behaviors in soccer training, we have unlocked a new realm of possibilities for these high&#8208;performance hierarchical organo&#8208;hydrogels. This approach to designing hierarchical structures has the potential to lead to even more high&#8208;performance hydrogels in the future.

Abstract
Tin perovskites have emerged as a promising alternative material to address the toxicity of lead perovskites and the low bandgap of around 1.1&#160;eV is also compatible with tandem solar cell applications. Nevertheless, the optoelectronic performance of solution&#8208;processed tin perovskite single&#8208;crystal counterparts still lags behind because of the tin instability under ambient conditions during crystal growth and limited reductants to protect the Sn2+ ions from oxidation. Here we study the reductant engineering to grow high&#8208;quality tin perovskite single crystals under ambient conditions. Oxalic acid (H2C2O4) serves as an excellent reductant and sacrificial agent to protect Sn2+ ions in methanol due to its suitable redox potential of &#8208;0.49&#160;V, and the CO2 as the oxidation product in the gas state can be easily separated from the solution. The FPEA2SnI4 single crystal grown by this strategy exhibits low trap density perovskite surface by constructing an FPEA2PbI4&#8208;FPEA2SnI4 single crystal heterojunction for X&#8208;ray detection. An improved X&#8208;ray sensitivity of 1.7&#215;105 &#956;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is realized in the heterojunction device, outperforming the control FPEA2PbI4 counterpart.

Nevertheless, the optoelectronic performance of solution-processed tin perovskite single-crystal counterparts still lags behind because of the tin instability under ambient conditions during crystal growth and limited reductants to protect the Sn2+ ions from oxidation. Here we study the reductant engineering to grow high-quality tin perovskite single crystals under ambient conditions. Oxalic acid (H2C2O4) serves as an excellent reductant and sacrificial agent to protect Sn2+ ions in methanol due to its suitable redox potential of -0.49&#160;V, and the CO2 as the oxidation product in the gas state can be easily separated from the solution. The FPEA2SnI4 single crystal grown by this strategy exhibits low trap density perovskite surface by constructing an FPEA2PbI4-FPEA2SnI4 single crystal heterojunction for X-ray detection.

         <title>An A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;Type Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Intrinsic Yellow Emission Realizing Record&#8208;High Red/Nir OLEDs upon Modulating Intermolecular Aggregations</title>

Abstract
Realizing efficient red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electroluminescence (EL) by precisely modulating molecular aggregations of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is an attractive pathway, yet the molecular designs are elusive. Here, we propose a new approach to manage molecular aggregation via a mild&#8208;twist acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#8208;type molecular design. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF molecule, QCN&#8208;PhSAC&#8208;QCN, was developed that furnishes a fast radiative rate and obvious aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature. Its emission bands can be facilely shifted from intrinsic yellow to the red/NIR region via fine&#8208;tuning doping levels and molecular aggregates while maintaining elegant photoluminescence quantum yields benefiting from suppressed exciton annihilation processes. As a result, a QCN&#8208;PhSAC&#8208;QCN&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibits a record&#8208;setting external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 39.1% at a doping ratio of 10&#160;wt.%, peaking at 620&#160;nm. Moreover, its nondoped NIR OLED affords a champion EQE of 14.3% at 711&#160;nm and retains outstanding EQEs as high as 5.40% and 2.35% at high current densities of 10 and 100 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, which are the highest values among all NIR&#8208;TADF OLEDs at similar density levels. This work validates the feasibility of such mild&#8208;twist A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type molecular design for precisely controlling molecular aggregation while maintaining high efficiency, thus providing a promising pathway for high&#8208;performance red/NIR TADF OLEDs.

         <title>Physiological Barriers and Strategies of Lipid&#8208;based Nanoparticles for Nucleic Acid Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles (LBNPs) are currently the most promising vehicles for nucleic acid drug (NAD) delivery. Although their clinical applications have achieved success, the NAD delivery efficiency and safety are still unsatisfactory, which are, to a large extent, due to the existence of multi&#8208;level physiological barriers in vivo. It is important to elucidate the interactions between these barriers and LBNPs, which will guide more rational design of efficient NAD vehicles with low adverse effects and facilitate broader applications of nucleic acid therapeutics. In this review, we describe the obstacles and challenges of biological barriers to NAD delivery at systemic, organ, sub&#8208;organ, cellular and subcellular levels. We comprehensively review the strategies to overcome these barriers, mainly including physically/chemically engineering LBNPs and directly modifying physiological barriers by auxiliary treatments. We then discuss the potentials and challenges for successful translation of these preclinical studies into the clinic. In the end, we address a forward look at the strategies on manipulating protein corona (PC), which may pull off the trick of overcoming those physiological barriers and significantly improve the efficacy and safety of LBNP&#8208;based NADs delivery.

         <title>An Emerging Era: Conformable Ultrasound Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conformable electronics are regarded as the next generation of personal healthcare monitoring and remote diagnosis devices. In recent years, piezoelectric based conformable ultrasound electronics (cUSE) have been intensively studied due to their unique capabilities, including no&#8208;radiative monitoring, soft tissue imaging, deep signal decoding, wireless power transfer, portability, and compatibility. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of cUSE for use in biomedical and healthcare monitoring systems and a summary of their recent advancements. Following an introduction to the fundamentals of piezoelectrics and ultrasound transducers, the critical parameters for transducer design are discussed. Next, five types of cUSE with their advantages and limitations are highlighted, and the fabrication of cUSE using advanced technologies is discussed. In addition, the working function, acoustic performance, and accomplishments in various applications are thoroughly summarized. We note that application considerations must be given to the tradeoffs between material selection, manufacturing processes, acoustic performance, mechanical integrity, and the entire integrated system. Finally, we highlight current challenges and directions for the development of cUSE, and provide research flow as the roadmap for future research. In conclusion, these advances in the fields of piezoelectric materials, ultrasound transducers, and conformable electronics spark an emerging era of biomedicine and personal healthcare.

         <title>An Activatable Prodrug Nanosystem for Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Multimodal Tumor Therapy And Metastasis Inhibition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultrasound, featuring deep tissue penetration and noninvasiveness, offers a new opportunity to activate functional materials in a tumor&#8208;selective manner. However, very few direct ultrasound&#8208;responsive redox systems are applicable under medical condition (1&#160;M Hz, 1&#8211;2&#160;W). Herein, we report our investigations on nanoprodrug of DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE, which exhibits glutathione&#8208;activated release of dihydroethidium (DHE) in tumor cells. DHE is stable with good biosafety and is transformed into cytotoxic ethidium to induce DNA damage under medical ultrasound irradiation, accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Further, DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE could effectively induce ferroptosis through glutathione depletion, lipid peroxide accumulation, and downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. In vivo studies confirmed that DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE nanoparticles effectively inhibit both the growth of solid tumors and the expression of metastasis&#8208;related proteins in mice, thus effectively inhibiting lung metastasis. This DHE&#8208;based prodrug nanosystem could lay a foundation for the design of ultrasound&#8208;driven therapeutic agents.

         <title>Mechanical Signal&#8208;Tailored Hydrogel Microspheres Recruit and Train Stem Cells for Precise Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed an enhanced endogenous regeneration strategy to direct stem cell differentiation via mechanotransduction. Microfluidic hydrogel microspheres with the independently tunable elastic modulus and ECM ligand density are fabricated and demonstrated to recruit intervertebral disc progenitor/stem cells and train them to differentiate into nucleus pulposus&#8208;like cells for repairing intervertebral disc degeneration.








Abstract
The aberrant mechanical microenvironment in degenerated tissues induces misdirection of cell fate, making it challenging to achieve efficient endogenous regeneration. Herein, a hydrogel microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with integrated cell recruitment and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction is constructed . Through the incorporation of microfluidics and photo&#8208;polymerization strategies, fibronectin (Fn) modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) microspheres are prepared with the independently tunable elastic modulus (1&#8211;10Kpa) and ligand density (2 and 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1), allowing a wide range of cytoskeleton modulation to trigger the corresponding mechanobiological signaling. The combination of the soft matrix (2Kpa) and low ligand density (2&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1) can support the nucleus pulposus (NP)&#8208;like differentiation of intervertebral disc (IVD) progenitor/stem cells by translocating Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP), without the addition of inducible biochemical factors. Meanwhile, platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) is loaded onto Fn&#8208;GelMA microspheres (PDGF@Fn&#8208;GelMA) via the heparin&#8208;binding domain of Fn to initiate endogenous cell recruitment. In in vivo experiments, hydrogel microsphere&#8208;niche maintained the IVD structure and stimulated matrix synthesis. Overall, this synthetic niche with cell recruiting and mechanical training capabilities offered a promising strategy for endogenous tissue regeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aberrant mechanical microenvironment in degenerated tissues induces misdirection of cell fate, making it challenging to achieve efficient endogenous regeneration. Herein, a hydrogel microsphere-based synthetic niche with integrated cell recruitment and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction is constructed . Through the incorporation of microfluidics and photo-polymerization strategies, fibronectin (Fn) modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) microspheres are prepared with the independently tunable elastic modulus (1&#8211;10Kpa) and ligand density (2 and 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), allowing a wide range of cytoskeleton modulation to trigger the corresponding mechanobiological signaling. The combination of the soft matrix (2Kpa) and low ligand density (2&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) can support the nucleus pulposus (NP)-like differentiation of intervertebral disc (IVD) progenitor/stem cells by translocating Yes-associated protein (YAP), without the addition of inducible biochemical factors. Meanwhile, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is loaded onto Fn-GelMA microspheres (PDGF@Fn-GelMA) via the heparin-binding domain of Fn to initiate endogenous cell recruitment. In in vivo experiments, hydrogel microsphere-niche maintained the IVD structure and stimulated matrix synthesis. Overall, this synthetic niche with cell recruiting and mechanical training capabilities offered a promising strategy for endogenous tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanotargeted Delivery of Immune Therapeutics in Type 1 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted delivery platform for type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment using high endothelial venule (HEV)&#8208;targeted nanoparticles is developed. The HEV&#8208;targeting nanoplatform delivers anti&#8208;CD3 antibodies simultaneously to pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreata, thereby suppressing effector T cells and prolonging the reversal of T1D in a nonobese diabetic mouse model.








Abstract
Immune therapeutics holds great promise in the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Nonetheless, their progress is hampered by limited efficacy, equipoise, or issues of safety. To address this, a novel and specific nanodelivery platform for T1D that targets high endothelial venules (HEVs) presented in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) and pancreas is developed. Data indicate that the pancreata of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and patients with T1D are unique in their expression of newly formed HEVs. Anti&#8208;CD3 mAb is encapsulated in poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles (NPs), the surfaces of which are conjugated with MECA79 mAb that recognizes HEVs. Targeted delivery of these NPs improves accumulation of anti&#8208;CD3 mAb in both the PLNs and pancreata of NOD mice. Treatment of hyperglycemic NOD mice with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs results in significant reversal of T1D compared to those that are untreated, treated with empty NPs, or provided free anti&#8208;CD3. This effect is associated with a significant reduction of T effector cell populations in the PLNs and a decreased production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine in the mice treated with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs. In summary, HEV&#8208;targeted therapeutics may be used as a means by which immune therapeutics can be delivered to PLNs and pancreata to suppress autoimmune diabetes effectively.

         <title>Erasable, Rewritable, and Reprogrammable Dual Information Encryption Based on Photoluminescent Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Recognition and Hydrogel Shape Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating the fluorescence of a well&#8208;designed self&#8208;inclusion supramolecular fluorescent ink immobilized in a polymer brush on a hydrogel surface through host&#8211;guest recognition. This supramolecular recognition is combined with the shape&#8208;memory effect of responsive hydrogel to achieve dual&#8208;encryption.








Abstract
Information encryption technologies are very important for security, health, commodity, and communications, etc. Novel information encryption mechanisms and materials are desired to achieve multimode and reprogrammable encryption. Here, a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating fluorescence. A butyl&#8208;naphthalimide with flexible ethylenediamine functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (N&#8208;CD) is utilized as a fluorescent responsive ink for printing or patterning information on polymer brushes with dangling adamantane group grafted on responsive hydrogels. The photoluminescent naphthalimide moiety is bonded to &#946;&#8208;CD and entrapped in the cavity. Its fluorescence is highly weakened in &#946;&#8208;CD cavity and recovers after being expelled from the cavity by a competing guest molecule to emit bright green photoluminescence under UV. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and ICT as the primary mechanism for the naphthalimides assembly and fluorescence, which can be quenched through insertion of conjugated molecules and recover by removing the insert. Such reversible quenching and recovering are used to achieve repeated writing, erasing, and re&#8208;writing of information. Supramolecular recognition and hydrogel shape memory are further combined to achieve reversible dual&#8208;encryption. This study provides a novel strategy to develop smart materials with improved information security for broad applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Subpicosecond Magnetization of a 2D Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sub&#8208;ps (&#8776;600&#160;fs) magnetization process in a ferromagnetic quantum well is successfully demonstrated, which utilizes the high carrier coherency and a rapid photo&#8208;Demba field effect, using pump&#8208;and&#8208;probe measurements with an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser. This hopefully opens a new way to ultrafast magnetic storage and information processing.








Abstract
Strong spin&#8208;charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub&#8208;ps) magnetization of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin&#8208;based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetization has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the d or f orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to implement by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub&#8208;ps magnetization manipulation called wavefunction engineering, in which only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons is controlled and no change is required in the total carrier density. Using&#160;a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), instant enhancement, as fast as 600&#160;fs, of the magnetization is observed upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. Theoretical&#160;analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetization is induced when the 2D electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo&#8208;Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers. Because this WF engineering method can be equivalently implemented by applying a gate electric field, these results open a new way to realize ultrafast magnetic storage and spin&#8208;based information processing in present electronic systems.

         <title>Organic Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), which integrate electroluminescence, current switching, and polarized emission into one device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization of 0.97. The high polarization characteristics of the OPLETs are assigned to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of molecular properties. High&#8208;contrast optical imaging and modern anti&#8208;counterfeit security based on OPLETs are demonstrated, establishing a new direction for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Electrically driven polarized light&#8208;emitting sources are central to various applications including quantum computers, optical communication, and 3D displays, but serious challenges remain due to the inevitable incorporation of complex optical elements in conventional devices. Here, organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), a kind of novel device that integrates the functions of organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and polarizers into one unique device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization (DOP) as high as 0.97, which is comparable to completely linearly polarized light (DOP = 1). Under the modulation of gate voltage, robust and efficient polarization emission is proven, ascribed to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of the molecular transition dipole moment in organic semiconductors and the open&#8208;ended feature of OPLETs instead of other factors. As a result, high&#8208;contrast optical imaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting security are successfully demonstrated based on OPLETs, establishing a new direction for photonic and electronic integration toward on&#8208;chip miniaturized optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Nanodisc&#8208;Paved Biobridge Facilitates Stem Cell Membrane Fusogenicity for Intracerebral Shuttling and Bystander Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane fusogenicity technology using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides is designed to functionalize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through a lipid raft&#8208;mediated membrane fusion pathway. For Alzheimer's disease therapy, 4F&#8211;VBP (HDL) is assembled for MSC4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) fabrication. After systemic infusion, MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) recognize pathological vascular clues for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing, achieving bystander effects on neurons and microglia.








Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies experience steadfast clinical advances but are still hindered by inefficient site&#8208;specific migration. An adaptable MSC membrane fusogenicity technology is conceptualized for lipid raft&#8208;mediated targeting ligand embedding by using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides. According to the pathological clues of brain diseases, the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 specialized VBP peptide is fused with 4F to assemble 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL), which acts as a biobridge and transfers VBP onto the living cell membrane via lipid rafts for surface engineering of MSCs in suspension. When compared with the membrane&#8208;modifying strategies of PEGylated phospholipids, 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL) provides a 3.86 higher linkage efficiency to obtain MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL), which can recognize and adhere to the inflammatory endothelium for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing and brain accumulation. In APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the transcriptomic analysis reveals that systemic administration of MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) can activate pathways associated with neuronal activity and diminish neuroinflammation for rewiring AD brains. This customizable HDL&#8208;mediated membrane fusogenicity platform primes MSC inflammatory brain delivery, which can be expanded to other disease treatments by simply fusing 4F with relevant ligands for living cell engineering.

         <title>Trivalent Europium&#8208;Doped CsCl Quantum Dots for MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Inherent Bandgap through Lattice Strain Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots are introduced in FAPbI3 PSCs to solve the key issues in CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 (Cs&#8211;FA) PSCs and simultaneously exert the talent of Cs&#8211;FA PSCs on stability, which maintains the optimal bandgap of FAPbI3 and offsets the Cs&#8208;induced local strain with a high power conversion efficiency of 24.13%.








Abstract
Cesium&#8211;formamidinium (Cs&#8211;FA) perovskites have garnered widespread interest owing to their excellent thermal&#8208; and photostability in achieving stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, Cs&#8211;FA perovskite typically suffers from Cs+ and FA+ mismatches, affecting the Cs&#8211;FA morphology and lattice distortion, resulting in an enlarged bandgap (Eg). In this work, &#8220;upgraded&#8221; CsCl, Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots, are&#160;developed to solve the key issues in Cs&#8211;FA PSCs and also exploit the advantage of Cs&#8208;FA PSCs on stability. The introduction of Eu3+ promotes the formation of high&#8208;quality Cs&#8211;FA films by adjusting the Pb&#8211;I cluster. CsCl:Eu3+ also offsets the local strain and lattice contraction induced by Cs+, which maintains the inherent Eg of FAPbI3 and decreases the trap density. Finally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% is obtained with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 . The unencapsulated devices show excellent humidity stability and&#160;storage stability, and an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination, and bias voltage conditions is achieved. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8211;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA&#8208;free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.

         <title>Intense Hydrochromic Photon Upconversion from Lead&#8208;Free 0D Metal Halides For Water Detection and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new 0D lead&#8208;free metal halide upconversion smart material is developed and applied as a moisture sensor. It exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Additionally, this upconversion smart material is applied to cipher text information encryption via a laser&#8208;based optical lighting method.








Abstract
Hydrochromic materials that change their luminescence color upon exposure to moisture have attracted considerable attention owing to their applications in sensing and information encryption. However, the existing materials lack high hydrochromic response and color tunability. This study reports the development of a new and bright 0D Cs3GdCl6 metal halide as the host for hydrochromic photon upconversion in the form of polycrystals (PCs) and nanocrystals. Lanthanides co&#8208;doped cesium gadolinium chloride metal halides exhibit upconversion luminescence (UCL) in the visible&#8211;infrared region upon 980&#160;nm laser excitation. In particular, PCs co&#8208;doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ exhibit hydrochromic UCL color change from green to red. These hydrochromic properties are quantitatively confirmed through the sensitive detection of water in tetrahydrofuran solvent via UCL color changes. This water&#8208;sensing probe exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Furthermore, the hydrochromic UCL property is exploited for stimuli&#8208;responsive information encryption via cyphertexts. These findings will pave the way for the development of new hydrochromic upconverting materials for emerging applications, such as noncontact sensors, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Error&#8208;Correction Learning Accelerates Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning model using error&#8208;correction learning with experimental feedback is developed to predict high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials. Experimentally a new family of thermoelectric materials consisting of PbSe:SnSb is achieved, which exhibits large power factor at room temperature.








Abstract
The exploration of thermoelectric materials is challenging considering the large materials space, combined with added exponential degrees of freedom coming from doping and the diversity of synthetic pathways. Here, historical data is incorporated, and is updated using experimental feedback by employing error&#8208;correction learning (ECL). This is achieved by learning from prior datasets and then&#160;adapting the model to differences in synthesis and characterization that are otherwise difficult to parameterize. This strategy is thus applied to discovering thermoelectric materials, where synthesis is prioritized at temperatures &lt;300&#160;&#176;C. A previously unexplored chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, is documented, finding that the best candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power factor more than 2&#215; that of PbSe. The investigations herein reveal that a closed&#8208;loop experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an optimized material by a factor as high as 3&#215; compared to high&#8208;throughput searches powered by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art machine&#8208;learning (ML) models. It is also observed that this improvement is dependent on the accuracy of the ML model in a manner that exhibits diminishing returns: once a certain accuracy is reached, factors that are instead associated with experimental pathways begin to dominate trends.

         <title>Achieving All&#8208;Plateau and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Insertion in Topological Graphitized Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon is constructed through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy. Evidence from advanced techniques indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements, resulting in a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hard carbon anodes with all&#8208;plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion storage, which holds promise for future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions head off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, a highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long&#8208;range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.

         <title>Advancing In Situ Food Monitoring through a Smart Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package System Demonstrated by the Detection of Salmonella in Whole Chicken</title>

         <dc:description>
The development of &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221;, a novel food packaging platform, consisting of a redesigned tray for sample localization, a membrane for reagent immobilization, and a Salmonella&#8208;specific sensor, is reported. Performance is substantiated with ready&#8208;to&#8208;eat chicken products, including ones that are contaminated using knives, gloves, and surfaces. Real&#8208;world use is also simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.








Abstract
With food production shifting away from traditional farm&#8208;to&#8208;table approaches to efficient multistep supply chains, the incidence of food contamination has increased. Consequently, pathogen testing via inefficient culture&#8208;based methods has increased, despite its lack of real&#8208;time capabilities and need for centralized facilities. While in situ pathogen detection would address these limitations and enable individual product monitoring, accurate detection within unprocessed, packaged food products without user manipulation has proven elusive. Herein, &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221; is presented, a platform capable of sampling, concentrating, and detecting target pathogens within closed food packaging, without intervention. This system consists of a newly designed packaging tray and reagent&#8208;infused membrane that can be paired universally with diverse pathogen sensors. The inclined food packaging tray maximizes fluid localization onto the sensing interface, while the membrane acts as a reagent&#8208;immobilizing matrix and an antifouling barrier for the sensor. The platform is substantiated using a newly discovered Salmonella&#8208;responsive nucleic acid probe, which enables hands&#8208;free detection of 103 colony forming units (CFU) g&#8722;1 target pathogen in a packaged whole chicken. The platform remains effective when contamination is introduced with toolsand surfaces, ensuring widespread efficacy. Its real&#8208;world use for in situ detection is simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.

         <title>Rationally Designing High&#8208;Performance Versatile Organic Memristors through Molecule&#8208;Mediated Ion Movements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized effective strategy with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions, and regulating device functions through modulation of the molecule distribution is implemented. This well&#8208;known delicate coordination reaction is introduced into a generalized robust polymer framework, leading to modulation of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecule distribution and domain separation inside the polymer framework, and then to regulation of the formed shape of the Ag conductive filaments (CFs). The work inspires novel strategies in rationally designing high&#8208;performance and multifunctional memory devices and is promising to lead broad interest in special molecule&#8208;mediated ion memristors.








Abstract
Organic memory has attracted tremendous attention for next&#8208;generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; striking ease of structural design. However, due to them being hardly controllable and their low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway, and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions have been rarely reported. In this work, as a generalized rational design strategy, the well&#8208;known tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is introduced with multiple coordination groups and small plane structure into a stable polymers framework to modulate Ag migration and then achieve high&#8208;performance devices with ideal productivity, low operation voltage and power, stable switching cycles, and state retention. Raman mapping demonstrates&#160;that the migrated Ag can specially coordinate with the embedded TCNQ molecules. Notably, the TCNQ molecule distribution can be modulated inside the polymer framework and regulate the memristive behaviors through controlling the formed Ag conductive filaments (CFs) as demonstrated by Raman mapping, in situ conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thus the controllable molecule&#8208;mediated Ag movements show its potential in rationally designing high&#8208;performance devices and versatile functions and is enlightening in constructing memristors with molecule&#8208;mediated ion movements.

         <title>Direct Observation of Atomic Step&#8208;Assisted Stabilization of&#160;Polar Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations discovers a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces. The dynamic motion of atomic steps activated at a high temperature converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.








Abstract
Polar surfaces are intrinsically unstable and thus highly reactive due to the uncompensated surface charges. The charge compensation is accompanied by various surface reconstructions, establishing novel functionality for their applications. The present&#160;in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy study directly shows that the atomic step and step&#8208;assisted reconstruction play central roles in the charge compensation of polar oxide surfaces. The&#160;flat (LaO)+&#8208;terminated LaAlO3 (001) polar surface, when annealed at high temperature in vacuum, transits to the (015) vicinal surface via the dynamic motion and interaction of atomic steps. While the (015) vicinal surface possesses zero polarization along the surface normal, a thermodynamic ground state is achieved when the in&#8208;plane polarization is fully compensated via the reconstruction of step&#8208;edge atoms; the step&#8208;edge La atoms are displaced from their ordinary atomic sites toward the adjacent Al step&#8208;edge sites, resulting in the formation of negatively charged La vacancies at the corresponding step edges. As confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations, the observed step reconstruction of (015) vicinal surface can completely cancel both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane electric fields. This hitherto unknown mechanism reveals the central role of step reconstruction in stabilizing a polar surface, providing valuable insights for understanding the novel charge compensation mechanism accompanied by the step reconstruction.

The first band&#8208;like transport behavior in polypyrrole (PPy) is reported. Utilizing an air/H2SO4&#8208;interface&#8208;assisted approach, a quasi&#8208;2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film is synthesized, formed by a layered assembly of fully extended quinoidal PPy chains. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy at various temperatures reveals unprecedented high charge&#8208;carrier mobility up to &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, attributed to the efficient band&#8208;like short&#8208;range transport in q2DPPy.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (q2D) conjugated polymers (CPs) are polymers that consist of linear CP chains assembled through non&#8208;covalent interactions to form a layered structure. In this work, the synthesis of a novel crystalline q2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film at the air/H2SO4 (95%) interface is reported. The unique interfacial environment facilitates chain extension, prevents disorder, and results in a crystalline, layered assembly of protonated quinoidal chains with a fully extended conformation in its crystalline domains. This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus, the temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transport properties of q2DPPy are investigated using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS). The vdP method reveals that the q2DPPy film exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long&#8208;range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz&#8208;TDS reveals a band&#8208;like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short&#8208;range high THz mobility of &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.

         <title>Triiodide Attacks the Organic Cation in Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites: Mechanism and Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triiodide is formed from thermally stressed lead halide perovskites. It hydrogen bonds strongly with organic cations in these materials, and it induces, catalytically, their deprotonation leading to perovskite decomposition. A simple thiol applied to the perovskite surface interrupts the catalytic cycle, and when applied at the perovskite&#8211;hole&#8208;transport material interface, creates a surface dipole that facilitates hole injection.








Abstract
Molecular I2 can be produced from iodide&#8208;based lead perovskites under thermal stress; triiodide, I3&#8722;, is formed from this I2 and I&#8722;. Triiodide attacks protic cation MA+&#8208; or FA+&#8208;based lead halide perovskites (MA+, methylammonium; FA+, formamidinium) as explicated through solution&#8208;based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies: triiodide has strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding affinity for MA+ or FA+, which leads to their deprotonation and perovskite decomposition. Triiodide is a catalyst for this decomposition that can be obviated through perovskite surface treatment with thiol reducing agents. In contrast to methods using thiol incorporation into perovskite precursor solutions, no penetration of the thiol into the bulk perovskite is observed, yet its surface application stabilizes the perovskite against triiodide&#8208;mediated thermal stress. Thiol applied to the interface between FAPbI3 and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (&#8220;Spiro&#8221;) prevents oxidized iodine species penetration into Spiro and thus preserves its hole&#8208;transport efficacy. Surface&#8208;applied thiol affects the perovskite work function; it ameliorates hole injection into the Spiro overlayer, thus improving device performance. It helps to increase interfacial adhesion (&#8220;wetting&#8221;): fewer voids are observed at the Spiro/perovskite interface if thiols are applied. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating interfacial thiol treatment maintain over 80% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 300&#160;h of 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress.

         <title>A Transformable Mucoadhesive Microgel Network for Noninvasive Multimodal Imaging And Radioprotection of a Large Area of the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mucoadhesive microgel (Bi&#8208;GLUE) integrating high mucoadhesion and flowability is developed as a novel gastrointestinal (GI) modulation platform, which can cover large&#8208;area GI tracts through oral administration. The contrast&#8208;loaded Bi&#8208;GLUE achieves multimodal, large&#8208;area GI imaging that traditional contrasts cannot fulfill. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;GLUE offers a new GI&#8208;radioprotection strategy by constructing an intracorporal radiation&#8208;attenuating shield in the GI lumen.








Abstract
The lack of noninvasive imaging and modulation of a large area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract constrain the diagnosis and treatment of many GI&#8208;related diseases. Recent advances use novel mucoadhesive materials to coat a part of the GI tract and then modulate its functions. High mucoadhesion is the key factor of the partial coating, but also the limitation for not spreading and covering the lower GI tract. Here, a bismuth&#8211;pectin organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid complex is screened and engineered into a transformable microgel network (Bi&#8208;GLUE) with high flowability and mucoadhesion, such that it&#160;can quickly transit through and coat a large area of the GI tract. In murine and porcine models, Bi&#8208;GLUE delivers contrast agents to achieve real&#8208;time, large&#8208;area GI&#8208;tract imaging under X&#8208;ray or magnetic resonance &#160;modalities and to facilitate the non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, Bi&#8208;GLUE, like an intracorporal radiation shield, decreases the radiotoxicity in a whole&#8208;abdomen irradiation rat model. This transformable microgel network offers a new direction that can modulate a large area of the GI tract and may have broad applications for GI&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets to construct conductive nanolayers and fast ion channels. Based on this, the DFG&#8208;N materials developed in this work achieve record&#8208;fast discharge rates and ultrahigh power densities without sacrificing energy density in both lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries, proving promising for commercial applications.








Abstract
Fluorinated carbon (CFx) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C&#8211;F bond in the highly fluorinated CFx. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG&#8208;N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C&#8211;F bonds. The DFG&#8208;N delivers an unprecedented dual performance for lithium primary batteries with a power density of 77456&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of 1067&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an ultrafast rate of 50 C, which is the highest level reported to date. The DFG&#8208;N also achieves a record power density of 15 256 and 17 881&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 C for sodium and potassium primary batteries, respectively. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the excellent performance of DFG&#8208;N is attributed to surface engineering strategies that remarkably improve electronic and ionic conductivity without sacrificing the high fluorine content. This work provides a compelling strategy for developing advanced ultrafast primary batteries that combine ultrahigh energy density and power density.

By adjusting the feed ratio of two thiol ligands with different steric hindrances, the conformation of the gold nanocluster is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16, while simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into a membrane&#8208;active antibacterial nanomedicine for the effective treatment of refractory bacterial keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.








Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year, among which &#8776;25% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. With the spread of bacterial resistance, refractory keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) affects &#8776;120&#160;000&#8211;190&#160;000 people annually and is a significant cause of infectious blindness. Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (GNCs) recently emerged as promising antibacterial agents; although how the GNC structure and capping ligands control the antibacterial properties remains largely unexplored. In this study, by adjusting the ratio of a &#8220;bulky&#8221; thiol fragrance to a linear zwitterionic ligand, the GNC conformation is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16 species, simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into potent antibacterial nanomaterials. Surprisingly, mixed&#8208;ligand capped Au23(SR)16 GNCs exhibit superior antibacterial potency compared to their monoligand counterparts. The optimal GNC is highly potent against MRSA, showing &gt;1024&#8208;fold lower minimum inhibitory concentration than the corresponding free ligands. Moreover, it displays excellent potency in treating MRSA&#8208;induced keratitis in mice with greatly accelerated corneal recovery (by approximately ninefold). Thus, this study establishes a feasible method to synthesize antibacterial GNCs by adjusting the ligand ratio to control GNC conformation and active non&#8208;antibacterial ligands, thereby greatly increasing the repertoires for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Promote Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts Embedded in Collagen/Platelet&#8208;Rich Plasma Scaffold and Accelerate Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and application of an exosome/cell&#8208;loaded COL/PRP scaffold for wound healing are assessed. The scaffold is applied on the dorsum wound of the mouse, wherein it promotes wound healing by reducing the level of inflammation, triggering proliferation of cells embedded in the scaffold, and promoting angiogenesis.








Abstract
Engineered skin substitutes derived from human skin significantly reduce inflammatory reactions mediated by foreign/artificial materials and are consequently easier to use for clinical application. Type I collagen is a main component of the extracellular matrix during wound healing and has excellent biocompatibility, and platelet&#8208;rich plasma can be used as the initiator of the healing cascade. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are crucial for tissue repair and play key roles in enhancing cell regeneration, promoting angiogenesis, regulating inflammation, and remodeling extracellular matrix. Herein, Type I collagen and platelet&#8208;rich plasma, which provide natural supports for keratinocyte and fibroblast adhesion, migration, and proliferation, are mixed to form a stable 3D scaffold. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are added to the scaffold to improve the performance of the engineered skin. The physicochemical properties of this cellular scaffold are analyzed, and the repair effect is evaluated in a full&#8208;thickness skin defect mouse model. The cellular scaffold reduces the level of inflammation and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis to accelerate wound healing. Proteomic analysis shows that exosomes exhibit excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory and proangiogenic effects in collagen/platelet&#8208;rich plasma scaffolds. The proposed method provides a new therapeutic strategy and theoretical basis for tissue regeneration and wound repair.

         <title>Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Carbon Dots for Solvent&#8208;Free Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of solvent&#8208;free direct ink writing (DIW) of carbon dots is demonstrated via liquid crystallization, giving rise to highly luminescent fluorescent patterns in three primary colors of blue, green, and red, respectively, due to the significantly limited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect, and promising technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the major advances of nanolights with extensive exploration of nano&#8208;luminescent materials like carbon dots (CDs). However, solvent&#8208;free processing of these materials remains a formidable challenge, impeding endeavors to develop advanced manufacturing techniques. Herein, in response to this challenge, liquid crystallization is demonstrated as a versatile and robust approach by deliberately anchoring flexible alkyl chains on the CDs surface. Alkyl chain grafting on the CDs surface is observed to substantially depress the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, and results in a shift of self&#8208;assembly structure from the crystalline phase to smectic liquid crystalline phase. The liquid&#8208;crystalline phase&#8208;transition temperature is ready to adjust by varying the alkyl chain length, endowing low&#8208;temperature (&lt;50&#160;&#176;C) melt&#8208;processing capabilities. Consequently, the first case of direct ink writing (DIW) with liquid crystal (LC) carbon dots is demonstrated, giving rise to highly emissive objects with blue, green and red fluorescence, respectively. Another unexpected finding is that DIW with the LC inks dramatically outperforms DIW with isotropic inks, further highlighting the significance of the LC processing. The approach reported herein not only exhibits a fundamental advance by imparting LC functions to CDs, but also promises technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.

         <title>Enhanced Multiwavelength Response of Flexible Synaptic Transistors for Human Sunburned Skin Simulation and Neuromorphic Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic synaptic transistors with enhanced multiwavelength light&#8208;response properties are prepared by introducing alumina oxide (AlOX ) nanoparticles. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, a learning efficiency model, neural network computing, and &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning memory functions are successfully simulated.








Abstract
In biological species, optogenetics and bioimaging work together to regulate the function of neurons. Similarly, the light&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic system not only enhances computational speed but also simulates complex synaptic functions. However, reported synaptic properties are mainly limited to mimicking simple biological functions and single&#8208;wavelength responses. Therefore, the development of flexible synaptic devices with multiwavelength optical signal response and multifunctional simulation remains a challenge. Here, flexible organic light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) enabled by alumina oxide (AlOX), with a simple fabrication process, are reported. By embedding AlOX nanoparticles, the excitons separation efficiency is improved, allowing for multiple wavelength responses. Optimized LSSTs can respond to multiple optical and electrical signals in a highly synaptic manner. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, electrical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, learning efficiency model controlled by photoelectric cooperative stimulation, neural network computing, &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning and memory functions are successfully proposed, which promote the development for future artificial intelligent systems. Furthermore, as prepared flexible transistors exhibit mechanical flexibility with bending radius down to 2.5&#160;mm and improved photosynaptic plasticity, which facilitating development of neuromorphic computing and multifunction integration systems at the device&#8208;level.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Oxides Enabling Anomalously Stable Charge Transport across the Li/Electrolyte Interface in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is unveiled, which features a low activation energy (0.2 eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on interstitial sites, caused by the Li&#8211;O polyhedra distortion and the Li&#8208;ion correlation. High Li&#8208;ion conductivities (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and anomalously stable charge transport across Li/LiTa2PO8 without interfacial modifications are thereby induced.








Abstract
The softness of sulfur sublattice and rotational PS4 tetrahedra in thiophosphates result in liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction, leading to enhanced ionic conductivities and stable electrode/thiophosphate interfacial ionic transport. However, the existence of liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction in rigid oxides remains unclear, and modifications are deemed necessary to achieve stable Li/oxide solid electrolyte interfacial charge transport. In this study, by combining the neutron diffraction survey, geometrical analysis, bond valence site energy analysis, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, 1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is discovered in LiTa2PO8 and its derivatives, wherein Li&#8208;ion migration channels are connected by four&#8208; or five&#8208;fold oxygen&#8208;coordinated interstitial sites. This conduction features a low activation energy (0.2&#160;eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on the interstitial sites, originating from the Li&#8211;O polyhedral distortion and Li&#8208;ion correlation, which are controlled by doping strategies. The liquid&#8208;like conduction enables a high ionic conductivity (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C), and a 700&#160;h anomalously stable cycling under 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for Li/LiTa2PO8/Li cells without interfacial modifications.

&lt;p&gt;1D liquid-like Li-ion conduction is unveiled, which features a low activation energy (0.2 eV) and short mean residence time (&amp;lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on interstitial sites, caused by the Li&#8211;O polyhedra distortion and the Li-ion correlation. High Li-ion conductivities (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#160;&#176;C) and anomalously stable charge transport across Li/LiTa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; without interfacial modifications are thereby induced.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The softness of sulfur sublattice and rotational PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra in thiophosphates result in liquid-like ionic conduction, leading to enhanced ionic conductivities and stable electrode/thiophosphate interfacial ionic transport. However, the existence of liquid-like ionic conduction in rigid oxides remains unclear, and modifications are deemed necessary to achieve stable Li/oxide solid electrolyte interfacial charge transport. In this study, by combining the neutron diffraction survey, geometrical analysis, bond valence site energy analysis, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, 1D liquid-like Li-ion conduction is discovered in LiTa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and its derivatives, wherein Li-ion migration channels are connected by four- or five-fold oxygen-coordinated interstitial sites. This conduction features a low activation energy (0.2&#160;eV) and short mean residence time (&amp;lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on the interstitial sites, originating from the Li&#8211;O polyhedral distortion and Li-ion correlation, which are controlled by doping strategies. The liquid-like conduction enables a high ionic conductivity (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#160;&#176;C), and a 700&#160;h anomalously stable cycling under 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for Li/LiTa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/Li cells without interfacial modifications. These findings provide principles for the future discovery and design of improved solid electrolytes that do not require modifications to the Li/solid electrolyte interface to achieve stable ionic transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Natural light enabling spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40 alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully. It can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the spin wave is modulated stably, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior








Abstract
Spin waves are considered to be an alternative carrier with great promise for information sensing. The feasible excitation and low&#8208;power manipulation of spin waves still remain a challenge. In this regard, natural light enablings spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40&#8208;alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully Meanwhile, an eye&#8208;catching shift (817&#160;Oe) of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field is obtained optically, leading to changes in magnetic anisotropy. Based on the modified Puszkarski's surface inhomogeneity model, the control of spin&#8208;wave resonance (SWR) by sunlight can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the body spin wave is modulated stably with natural light illumination, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior. This work has both practical and theoretical importance for developing future sunlight&#8208;tunable magnonics/spintronics devices.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable and Efficient Fully &#928;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer via Internal Plasticization for Flexible Deep&#8208;Blue Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with CIEy = 0.08</title>

         <dc:description>
A universal internal plasticization strategy is proposed to construct intrinsically stretchable and efficient fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers for the flexible deep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs). The introduction of pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers in polyfluorenes can simultaneously obtain excellent intrinsic stretchability, robust deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, and comparable charge&#8208;transport behavior. Stable deep&#8208;blue PLEDs based on stretchable layers are also fabricated with a CIE of (0.15, 0.08).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long&#8208;time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge&#8208;transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep&#8208;blue PLEDs. Herein, an internal plasticization strategy is proposed to introduce a phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF&#8208;MC4, PF&#8208;MC6, and PF&#8208;MC8) for narrowband deep&#8208;blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF&#8208;MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &gt;25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission (PLQY &gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers. The PF&#8208;MC8&#8208;based PLEDs show deep&#8208;blue emission, which corresponds to CIE and EQE values of (0.16, 0.10) and 1.06%, respectively. Finally, the narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8776;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF&#8208;MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&#8722;2 at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.

An implantable, biodegradable, and wireless triboelectric device is developed for cancer therapy. The significantly enhanced tumor therapeutic effects against a broad&#8208;spectrum of tumors through cell and animal experiments are demonstrated.








Abstract
Electric&#8208;field&#8208;based stimulation is emerging as a new cancer therapeutic modality through interfering with cell mitosis. To address its limitations of complicated wire connections, bulky devices, and coarse spatial resolution, an improved and alternative method is proposed for wirelessly delivering electrical stimulation into tumor tissues through designing an implantable, biodegradable, and wirelessly controlled therapeutic triboelectric nanogenerator (ET&#8208;TENG). With the excitation of ultrasound (US) to the ET&#8208;TENG, the implanted ET&#8208;TENG can generate an alternating current voltage and concurrently release the loaded anti&#8208;mitotic drugs into tumor tissues, which synergistically disrupts the assembly of microtubules and filament actins, induces cell cycle arrest, and finally enhances cell death. With the assistance of US, the device can be completely degraded after the therapy, getting free of a secondary surgical extraction. The device can not only work around those unresectable tumors, but also provides a new application of wireless electric field in cancer therapy.

         <title>3D&#8208;Heterojunction Based on Embedded Perovskite Micro&#8208;Sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/Narrowband Dual&#8208;Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for creating a vertical fast photomultiplier photodetector based on a 3D heterostructure of embedded perovskite microsized single crystals with a dual mode of voltage&#8208;controlled broad/narrowband switching is reported. The additional radial interface and charge separation in the 3D heterostructure effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response of the high&#8208;performance multifunctional photodetectors.








Abstract
A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode is implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro&#8208;sized single crystals. Because the single&#8208;crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer&#8208;embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built&#8208;in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow&#8208;band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.

     alt="3D-Heterojunction Based on Embedded Perovskite Micro-Sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/Narrowband Dual-Mode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy for creating a vertical fast photomultiplier photodetector based on a 3D heterostructure of embedded perovskite microsized single crystals with a dual mode of voltage-controlled broad/narrowband switching is reported. The additional radial interface and charge separation in the 3D heterostructure effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response of the high-performance multifunctional photodetectors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode is implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro-sized single crystals. Because the single-crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer-embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built-in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow-band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Blinking Luminescence from Charged Single Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;blinking luminescence from charged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is observed. This is attributed to the singly charged trion maintaining photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the different energy levels in the GQDs caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups.








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking behavior from single quantum dots under steady illumination is an important but controversial topic. Its occurrence has impeded the use of single quantum dots in bioimaging. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for it, although controversial, the most important of which is the non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination mechanism whereby photocharging of quantum dots can lead to the blinking phenomenon. Here, the singly charged trion, which maintains photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination, leads to fluorescence non&#8208;blinking which is observed in photocharged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of different energy levels in the GQDs, caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups in the single GQDs. The suppressed blinking is due to the filling of trap sites owing to a Coulomb blockade. These results provide a profound understanding of the special optical properties of GQDs, affording a reference for further in&#8208;depth research.

         <title>Magnetization Control of Zero&#8208;Field Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;field SDE is demonstrated in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices with the magnetic toroidal moment. The periodic insertion of Fe with Pt into the superlattices increases the nonreciprocity of the critical current in the absence of a magnetic field. These findings can be utilized to realize non&#8208;volatile memories and logic circuits with ultralow power consumption.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. However, the practical control of the SDE necessities the precise tuning of current, temperature, magnetic field, or magnetism. Therefore, the mechanisms of the SDE must be understood to develop novel materials and devices capable of realizing the SDE under more controlled and robust conditions. This study demonstrates an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices. The polarity and magnitude of the zero&#8208;field SDE are controllable by the direction of magnetization, indicating that the effective exchange field acts on Cooper pairs. Furthermore, the first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the SDE can be enhanced by an asymmetric configuration of proximity induced magnetic moments in superconducting layers, which induces a magnetic toroidal moment. This study has important implications regarding the development of novel materials and devices that can effectively control the SDE. Moreover, the magnetization control of the SDE is expected to aid in the designing of superconducting quantum devices and establishing a material platform for topological superconductors.

         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating for long&#8208;term biointerfacing: Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes is fabricated through the engineering of nanocrystalline domains at the interface, enabling long&#8208;term electrocardiogram recording and electrical pacing without failure.








Abstract
Because of their distinct electrochemical and mechanical properties, conducting polymer hydrogels have been widely exploited as soft, wet, and conducting coatings for conventional metallic electrodes, providing mechanically compliant interfaces and mitigating foreign body responses. However, the long&#8208;term viability of these hydrogel coatings is hindered by concerns regarding fatigue crack propagation and/or delamination caused by repetitive volumetric expansion/shrinkage during long&#8208;term electrical interfacing. This study reports a general yet reliable approach to achieving a fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes by engineering nanocrystalline domains at the interface between the hydrogel and metallic substrates. It demonstrates the efficacy of this robust, biocompatible, and fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating in cardiac pacing, showcasing its ability to effectively reduce the pacing threshold voltage and enhance the long&#8208;term reliability of electric stimulation. This study findings highlight the potential of its approach as a promising design and fabrication strategy for the next generation of seamless bioelectronic&#160;interfaces.

         <title>A Flexible Tough Hydrovoltaic Coating for Wearable Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible tough hydrovoltaic coating with a strong structural binding effect is developed for the simultaneous achievement of good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage &#8776;3.18 V) and highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing ability. Based on skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures, wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat is demonstrated.








Abstract
The lack of a strong binding mechanism between nanomaterials severely restricts the advantages of the evaporation&#8208;driven hydrovoltaic effect in wearable sensing electronics. It is a challenging task to observably improve the mechanical toughness and flexibility of hydrovoltaic devices to match the wearable demand without abandoning the nanostructures and surface function. Here, a flexible tough polyacrylonitrile/alumina (PAN/Al2O3) hydrovoltaic coating with both good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage, Voc&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.18&#160;V) and sensitive ion sensing (2285&#160;V&#160;M&#8722;1 for NaCl solutions in 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;3&#160;m) capabilities is developed. The porous nanostructure composed of Al2O3 nanoparticles is firmly locked by the strong binding effect of PAN, giving a critical binding force 4 times that of Al2O3 film to easily deal with 9.92&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 strong water&#8208;flow impact. Finally, skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures are proposed to achieve wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat. The flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating breaks through the mechanical brittleness limitation and broadens the applications of the evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect in self&#8208;powered wearable sensing electronics.

A three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction, and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction, and the [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF shows excellent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and natural&#8208;sunlight&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging, but promising way to realize carbon&#8208;resources recycling utilization. Herein, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction. A Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF) with oxidation and reductive sites is synthesized; then, ionic liquids (ILs) are loaded into the pores. As a result, [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF shows a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 105.88&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere, even superior than most photocatalysts in high concentrations CO2. Moreover, natural sunlight driven diluted CO2 reduction rate also reaches 126.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 in 5&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the triazine ring in the Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF promotes the activity of H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction sites, and the loaded ILs provide an enriched CO2 atmosphere, realizing the efficient photocatalytic activity in diluted CO2 reduction.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Activation of In&#8208;Layer Channels for Enhanced Ion Storage and Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>

The study proposes an electrochemical phase transformation approach for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) for ammonium&#8208;ion batteries. The in&#8208;layer channels provide additional NH4+ storage sites and rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. The E&#8208;VOPO shows exceptional NH4+ storage performance with increased capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. The resulting full cell operates stably for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, leveraging non&#8208;metallic ammonium ions, have arisen as a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their advancement has been hindered by the scarcity of high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion storage materials. In this study, an electrochemical phase transformation approach is proposed for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) with predominant growth on the (200) plane, corresponding to the tetragonal channels on the (001) layers. The findings reveal that these tetragonal in&#8208;layer channels not only furnish NH4+ storage sites but also enhance transfer kinetics by providing rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. This crucial aspect has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The E&#8208;VOPO electrode exhibits exceptional ammonium&#8208;ion storage performance, including significantly increased specific capacity, enhanced rate capability, and robust cycling stability. The resulting full cell can be stably operated for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 for over 70 days. The proposed approach offers a new strategy for meticulously engineering electrode materials with facilitated ion storage and migration, thereby paving the way for developing more efficient and sustainable energy storage systems.

         <title>Ultrahigh Permeability at High Frequencies via A Magnetic&#8208;Heterogeneous Nanocrystallization Mechanism in an Iron&#8208;Based Amorphous Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy is developed by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism and it shows an exceptionally high permeability up to 36&#160;000 at high frequency of 100 kHz. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to its low anisotropy and unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields in the nanocrystalline alloy.








Abstract
The prevalence of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) semiconductors allows modern electronic devices to operate at much higher frequencies. However, development of soft magnetic materials with high&#8208;frequency properties matching the WBG&#8208;based devices remains challenging. Here, a promising nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy with a normal composition Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 in atomic percent is reported, which is producible under industrial conditions, and which shows an exceptionally high permeability at high frequencies up to 36&#160;000 at 100&#160;kHz, an increase of 44% compared with commercial FeSiBCuNb nanocrystalline alloy (25&#160;000&#160;&#177;&#160;2000 at 100&#160;kHz), outperforming all existing nanocrystalline alloy systems and commercial soft magnetic materials. The alloy is obtained by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism in an iron&#8208;based amorphous alloy, which is different from the traditional strategy of nanocrystallization by doping nonmagnetic elements (e.g., Cu and Nb). The induced magnetic inhomogeneity by adding Co atoms locally promotes the formation of highly ordered structures acting as the nuclei of nanocrystals, and Mo atoms agglomerate around the interfaces of the nanocrystals, inhibiting nanocrystal growth, resulting in an ultrafine nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structure in the alloy. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to the low magnetic anisotropy and the unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields.

         <title>Regulating the Lithium Ions&#8217; Local Coordination Environment through Designing a COF with Single Atomic Co Site to Achieve Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Synergistic effects of Co&#9472;N coordination and a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior.








Abstract
The detrimental growth of lithium dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) inhibit the practical application of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, atomically dispersed cobalt coordinate conjugated bipyridine&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (sp2c&#8208;COF) is explored as an artificial SEI on the surface of the Li&#8208;metal anode to resolve these issues. The single Co atoms confined in the structure of COF enhance the number of active sites and promote electron transfer to the&#160;COF. The synergistic effects of the Co&#9472;N coordination and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior. Furthermore, in situ technology and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co inducing Li uniform deposition and promoting Li+ rapid migration. Based on these advantages, the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co modified Li anode exhibits a low Li&#8208;nucleation barrier of 8&#160;mV, and excellent cycling stability of 6000&#160;h.

A series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstate based foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) with tunable loadings (17 to 44 wt%) is fabricated, which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides.








Abstract
Indirect electrocatalytic conversion of cheap organic raw materials via the activation of S&#9472;H and N&#9472;H bonds into the value&#8208;added S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds chemicals for industrial rubber production is a promising strategy to realize the atomic economic reaction, during which the kinetic inhibition that is associated with the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in traditional direct electrocatalysis can be eliminated to achieve higher performance. In this work, a series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstatebased foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) are fabricated with tunable loadings (17 to 44&#160;wt%), which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides. Specifically, the optimal PW10Cu2@CMC (44&#160;wt%) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the construction of S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds (yields up to 99%) coupling with the efficient production of H2 (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (&#8776;14.4&#160;g in a batch experiment) and the obtained products can serve as rubber vulcanization accelerators with superior properties to traditional industrial rubber additives in real industrial processes. This powerful catalysis system that can simultaneously produce rubber vulcanization accelerator and H2 may inaugurate a new electrocatalytic avenue to explore polyoxometalate&#8208;based foam catalysts in electrocatalysis field.

Following oral administration in mice, &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticles (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) target and transpass intestinal M cells, overcome the epithelial barrier, and undergo phagocytosis by macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; pass through the lymphatic system, enter systemic circulation, and then spontaneously target a primary tumor and metastatic lesions, functioning like &#8220;precision&#8208;guided stealth missiles&#8221;, improving the effectiveness of antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The prognosis in cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with current treatment modalities is poor owing to the highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticle system (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) that can be orally administered, is developed for targeted PDAC therapy. Following oral administration in PDAC&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs actively target/transpass microfold cells, overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier, and then undergo subsequent phagocytosis by endogenous macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; transits through the intestinal lymphatic system and enters systemic circulation, ultimately accumulating in the tumor tissue as a result of the tumor&#8208;homing and &#8220;stealth&#8221; properties that are conferred by endogenous M&#981;. Meanwhile, the M&#981; that hitchhikes&#160;&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs&#160;is activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases, destroying the desmoplastic stromal barrier, and differentiates toward the M1&#8208;like phenotype, modulating the TME and recruiting effector T cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis of the tumor cells. The combination of &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;&#160;and immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits the growth of the primary tumor and suppresses the development of metastasis. It thus represents an appealing approach to targeted PDAC therapy.

         <title>Tailoring the Weight of Surface and Intralayer Edge States to Control LUMO Energies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rolling transfer of Langmuir layers of amphiphilic C60 derivatives is shown to enable the production of films with highly defined morphology. The resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies enable the establishment of a practical model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor. This allows prediction of the range of experimentally accessible LUMO energies.








Abstract
The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals determine the optoelectronic properties in organic films, which are crucial for their application, and strongly depend on the morphology and supramolecular structure. The impact of the latter two properties on the electronic energy levels relies primarily on nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions, which are difficult to study due to their nanoscale nature and heterogeneity. Here,&#160;an automated method is presented for fabricating thin films with a tailored ratio of surface to bulk sites and a controlled extension of domain edges, both of which are used to control nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions. This method uses a Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer&#8208;type rolling transfer of Langmuir layers (rtLL) to minimize flow during the deposition of rigid Langmuir layers composed of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Using UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that the rtLL method advances the deposition of multi&#8208;Langmuir layers and enables the production of films with defined morphology. The variation in nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions is thus achieved and the resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (determined via square&#8208;wave voltammetry) enable the establishment of a model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor, allowing for the prediction of the range of accessible LUMO energies.

         <title>Soft&#8211;Rigid Heterostructures with Functional Cation Vacancies for Fast&#8208;Charging and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 heterostructure is proposed and realized in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is confirmed by electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations. The synergy of heterostructure and functional cation vacancies can effectively lower the mechanical stress, decrease Na+&#8208;diffusion barriers and maintain structural stability, resulting in high rate capacity and remarkable cycling performance.








Abstract
Optimizing charge transfer and alleviating volume expansion in electrode materials are critical to maximize electrochemical performance for energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, an atomically thin soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure with dual cation vacancies at the atomic interface is constructed as a promising anode for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The dual cation vacancies involving VCo and VMo in the heterostructure and the soft MoS2 shell afford ionic pathways for rapid charge transfer, as well as the rigid Co9S8 core acting as the dominant active component and resisting structural deformation during charge&#8211;discharge. Electrochemical testing and theoretical calculations demonstrate both excellent Na+&#8208;transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive behavior. Consequently, the soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure delivers extraordinary sodium&#8208;storage performance (389.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1), superior to those of the single&#8208;phase counterparts: the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3||d&#8208;Co9S8@MoS2/S&#8208;Gr full cell achieves an energy density of 235.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 C. This finding opens up a unique strategy of soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure and broadens the horizons of material design in energy storage and conversion.

Consequently, the soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure delivers extraordinary sodium-storage performance (389.7&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500 cycles at 5.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), superior to those of the single-phase counterparts: the assembled Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||d-Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/S-Gr full cell achieves an energy density of 235.5&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 C. This finding opens up a unique strategy of soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure and broadens the horizons of material design in energy storage and conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Diode&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the continuous power generation from water droplets by capillary infiltration, an Al2O3/PVDF based hydrovoltaic electricity generator with an ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like heterojunction is developed. With a drop of water, this device can generate a peak short&#8208;circuit current density of 160 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.7 V, and an accumulated charge of 60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s.








Abstract
Water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode&#8208;like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials is fabricated. This device can generate current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 65 &#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieves a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppresses the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This results in an improved charge accumulation of &#8776;60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s, which is three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device is increased to 6 cm2, the current increases linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale&#8208;up potential of the generator. It has been proven that the streaming potential originates from&#160;capillary infiltration, and the presence of ion rectification. The proposed method of constructing ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like structures provides a new strategy for improving generator performance.

         <title>Restraining Interfacial Cu2+ by using Amorphous SnO2 as Sacrificial Protection Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy is proposed to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction to formate. The high active interface can significantly lower the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) of the carbon dioxide reduction and enhance its selectivity and activity for formate. 








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate is of great interest in the field of electrochemical energy. Cu&#8208;based material is an appealing electrocatalyst for the CO2RR. However, retaining Cu2+ under the high cathodic potential of CO2RR remains a great challenge, leading to low electrocatalytic selectivity, activity, and stability. Herein, inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 (c&#8208;CuO/a&#8208;SnO2) is reported, which greatly boosts the electrocatalytic sensitivity, activity, and stability for CO2RR to formate. The as&#8208;made hybrid catalyst can achieve superior high selectivity for CO2RR to formate with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.7%, and a superhigh current density of over 1 A cm&#8722;2 that far outperforms industrial benchmarks (FE &gt; 90%, current density &gt; 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray diffractionexperimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the broadened s&#8208;orbital in interfacial a&#8208;SnO2 offers the lower orbital for extra electrons than Cu2+, which can effectively retain nearby Cu2+, and the high active interface significantly lowers the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) and enhances the selectivity and activity for CO2RR to formate.

         <title>Skin Thermal Management for Subcutaneous Photoelectric Conversion Reaching 500&#160;mW</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous power supply device utilizing second near&#8208;infrared light is proposed with the synergistic combination of photovoltaic cells and a thermoelectric generator. Skin thermal management is used to turn photothermal toxicity into a favorable factor for photoelectric conversion. In in vivo experiment, its output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%.








Abstract
Despite possessing higher tissue transmittance and maximum permissible exposure power density for skin relative to other electromagnetic waves, second near&#8208;infrared light (1000&#8211;1350&#160;nm) is scarcely applicable to subcutaneous photoelectric conversion, owing to the companion photothermal effect. Here, skin thermal management is conceived to utmostly utilize the photothermal effect of a photovoltaic cell, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency but also eliminates skin hyperthermia. In vivo, the output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%. This output power is promising to recharge all the clinically applied implantable devices via wireless power transmission, that is, clinical pacemakers (6&#8211;200&#160;&#181;W), drug pumps (0.5&#8211;2&#160;mW), cochlear (5&#8211;40&#160;mW), and wireless endo&#8208;photo cameras (&#8776;100&#160;mW).

         <title>Folding Double&#8208;Stranded DNA into Designed Shapes with Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;stranded DNA is cooperatively compacted into designed shapes by triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides, which bridge multiple normal or reverse Hoogsteen recognition domains. Hoogsteen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is highly programmable, methodologically straightforward, and yields large uniquely addressable nanostructures at low&#8208;cost. Moreover, the presented &#8220;triplex origami&#8221; method enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates not achievable by other artificial methodologies.








Abstract
The compaction and organization of genomic DNA is a central mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but engineered architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) is notably challenging. Here, long dsDNA templates are folded into designed shapes via triplex&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind purines in dsDNA via normal or reverse Hoogsteen interactions. In the triplex origami methodology, these non&#8208;canonical interactions are programmed to compact dsDNA (linear or plasmid) into well&#8208;defined objects, which demonstrate a variety of structural features: hollow and raster&#8208;filled, single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layered, with custom curvatures and geometries, and featuring lattice&#8208;free, square&#8208;, or honeycomb&#8208;pleated internal arrangements. Surprisingly, the length of integrated and free&#8208;standing dsDNA loops can be modulated with near&#8208;perfect efficiency; from hundreds down to only six bp (2&#160;nm). The inherent rigidity of dsDNA promotes structural robustness and non&#8208;periodic structures of almost 25.000&#160;nt are therefore formed with fewer unique starting materials, compared to other DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly methods. Densely triplexed structures also resist degradation by DNase I. Triplex&#8208;mediated dsDNA folding is methodologically straightforward and orthogonal to Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;based methods. Moreover, it enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates.

Surprisingly, the length of integrated and free-standing dsDNA loops can be modulated with near-perfect efficiency; from hundreds down to only six bp (2&#160;nm). The inherent rigidity of dsDNA promotes structural robustness and non-periodic structures of almost 25.000&#160;nt are therefore formed with fewer unique starting materials, compared to other DNA-based self-assembly methods. Densely triplexed structures also resist degradation by DNase I. Triplex-mediated dsDNA folding is methodologically straightforward and orthogonal to Watson-Crick-based methods. Moreover, it enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conversion of Dielectric Surface Effect into Volume Effect for High Output Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of the dielectric surface effect into a volume effect is proposed for a high output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, the physics mechanism of thick dielectric films used in TENGs is identified and a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs is provided.








Abstract
Improving the output energy and durability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) remains a considerable challenge for their practical applications. Owing to the interface effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, thinner films with higher dielectric constants yield a higher output; however, they are not durable for practical applications. Herein, the dielectric surface effect is changed into a volume effect by adopting a millimeter&#8208;thick dielectric film with an inner porous network structure so that charges can hop in the surface state of the network. Charge migration inside the dielectric film is the key factor affecting the output of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)&#160;with a thick film, based on which each working stage follows the energy&#8208;maximization principle in the voltage&#8211;charge plot. The maximum peak and average power densities of the TENG with polyurethane foam film in 1&#160;mm thickness reach 40.9 and 20.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;Hz&#8722;1, respectively, under environmental conditions, and the output charge density is 5.14&#160;times that of TENGs with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film of the same thickness. Superdurability is achieved in the rotary&#8208;mode TENG&#160;after 200&#160;000 operation cycles. This study identifies the physical mechanism of the thick dielectric film used in TENGs and provides a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs.

         <title>Porous, Ultrathin PtAgBiTe Nanosheets for Direct Hydrazine Hydrate Fuel Cell Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous, ultrathin PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets with widths beyond 700 nm are synthesized via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route, and are employed as anode electrocatalysts for hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction and actual direct hydrazine hydrate fuel cells. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets in actual hydrazine&#8211;O2/air fuel cell devices are 532.9/315.9 mW cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D&#160;nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their fascinating applications in sustainable and clean&#8208;energy&#8208;related devices, but obtaining ultrathin 2D multimetallic polycrystalline structures with large lateral dimensions remains a challenge. In this study, ultrathin 2D porous PtAgBiTe and PtBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets (PNSs) are obtained via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route. The PtAgBiTe PNSs are assembled by sub&#8208;5&#160;nm grains with widths beyond 700&#160;nm. Strain and ligand effects originating from the porous, curly polycrystalline structure endow the PtAgBiTe PNSs with robust hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction activity. Theoretical research demonstrates that the modified Pt activates the N&#8211;H bonds in N2H4 during the reaction, and strong hybridization between Pt&#8208;5d and N&#8208;2p facilitates dehydrogenation while reducing energy consumption. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe PNSs in actual hydrazine&#8208;O2/air fuel cell devices are boosted to 532.9/315.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, while those of the commercial Pt/C are 394.7/157.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides a strategy not only for preparing ultrathin multimetallic PNSs but also for finding promising electrocatalysts for actual hydrazine fuel cells.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence and Photoluminescence Heterojunction for Superior Multimode Sensing Platform of Friction, Force, Pressure, and Temperature in Fibers and 3D&#8208;Printed Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a multifunctional sensing platform in the form of photo&#8208;/mechano&#8208;luminescent powder, fibers, and 3D&#8208;printed polymers for optical detection of pressure, temperature, force, and friction is reported. The combination of 3D&#8208;printing with fiber spinning demonstrates the possibility of mass production of mechanoluminescence&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.








Abstract
Endowing a single material with various types of luminescence, that is, exhibiting a simultaneous optical response to different stimuli, is vital in various fields. A photoluminescence (PL)&#8208; and mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based multifunctional sensing platform is built by combining heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS:Mn2+ mechano&#8208;photonic materials using a 3D&#8208;printing technique and fiber spinning. ML&#8208;active particles are embedded in micrometer&#8208;sized cellulose fibers for flexible optical devices capable of emitting light driven by mechanical force. Individually modified 3D&#8208;printed hard units that exhibit intense ML in response to mechanical deformation, such as impact and friction, are also fabricated. Importantly, they also allow low&#8208;pressure sensing up to &#8776;100&#160;bar, a range previously inaccessible by any other optical sensing technique. Moreover, the developed optical manometer based on the PL of the materials demonstrates a superior high&#8208;pressure sensitivity of &#8776;6.20&#160;nm&#160;GPa&#8722;1. Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation&#8208;band spectral shifts, emission&#8208;band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening, and lifetime shortening. This work supports the possibility of mass production of ML&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.

DNA Nanotechnology
DNA nanotechnology, so far, has almost exclusively relied on Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. In article number 2302497, Minke A. D. Nijenhuis, Kurt V. Gothelf, and co&#8208;workers introduce a triplex origami methodology. They demonstrate that triplex DNA, formed by Hoogsteen interactions, also possesses remarkable potential for nanoscale engineering. Triplex origami enables unprecedented large&#8208;scale architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA templates, folding and compacting them into sheets, bundles, and even custom potted flower shapes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DNA Nanotechnology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA nanotechnology, so far, has almost exclusively relied on Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202302497"&gt;2302497&lt;/a&gt;, Minke A. D. Nijenhuis, Kurt V. Gothelf, and co-workers introduce a triplex origami methodology. They demonstrate that triplex DNA, formed by Hoogsteen interactions, also possesses remarkable potential for nanoscale engineering. Triplex origami enables unprecedented large-scale architectural control over double-stranded DNA templates, folding and compacting them into sheets, bundles, and even custom potted flower shapes.

Tissue Regeneration
In article number 2300180, Hao Chen, Wenguo Cui, Yuhui Zhang, and co&#8208;workers propose a hydrogel&#8208;microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with cell recruiting and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction. The microsphere niche guides the fate of endogenous stem cells in the aberrant mechanical microenvironment, offering an effective strategy for enhancing the endogenous regeneration of degenerated tissues.

Polar Oxide Surfaces
In article number 2303051, Jaekwang Lee, Sang Ho Oh, and co&#8208;workers discover a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces using in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with atomic simulation. The dynamic motion of atomic steps, activated at a high temperature, converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via a step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.

Superconducting Diode Effect
Magnetization control of the superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. In article number 2304083, Hideki Narita, Teruo Ono, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Materials, Components, Systems, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is great potential for air humidity not only to provide water for drinking and agriculture, but also to be used for energy/fuel production, energy conservation, and humidity/thermal management. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) technology makes this possible even in dry regions. The purpose of this paper is to review comprehensively the materials, designs, components, and application of SAWH.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water, is first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Porosity as a Design Element for Developing Catalytic Molecular Materials for Electrochemical and Photochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular materials catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), that feature permanent porosity as a design feature, are showcased. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.








Abstract
The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sustainable energy inputs is a promising strategy for upcycling of atmospheric carbon into value&#8208;added chemical products. This goal has inspired the development of catalysts for selective and efficient CO2 conversion using electrochemical and photochemical methods. Among the diverse array of catalyst systems designed for this purpose, 2D and 3D platforms that feature porosity offer the potential to combine carbon capture and conversion. Included are covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous molecular cages, and other hybrid molecular materials developed to increase active site exposure, stability, and water compatibility while maintaining precise molecular tunability. This mini&#8208;review showcases catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that incorporate well&#8208;defined molecular elements integrated into porous materials structures. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.

         <title>Catalyst Development for High&#8208;Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review outlines catalyst advancements for high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte fuel
cells operating at elevated temperatures (160&#8208;180 &#176;C). These cells utilize reformate/air gasses and employ phosphoric acid within the polybenzimidazole polymer matrix as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. Catalysts employed are platinum or platinum&#8208;alloyed nanoparticles immobilized on a carbon support.








Abstract
A constant increase in global emission standard is causing fuel cell (FC) technology to gain importance. Over the last two decades, a great deal of research has been focused on developing more active catalysts to boost the performance of high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFC), as well as their durability. Due to material degradation at high&#8208;temperature conditions, catalyst design becomes challenging. Two main approaches are suggested: (i) alloying platinum (Pt) with low&#8208;cost transition metals to reduce Pt usage, and (ii) developing novel catalyst support that anchor metal particles more efficiently while inhibiting corrosion phenomena. In this comprehensive review, the most recent platinum group metal (PGM) and platinum group metal free (PGM&#8208;free) catalyst development is detailed, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT&#8208;PEMFCs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Redox Bicatalysis Batteries for Energy Storage and Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, the fundamentals and design principles of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery (constructed by redox bifunctional catalyst cathode and metal anode) are summarized and proposed, and the effects of device structure and compositions are deeply discussed for energy storage and chemical production, which provides a design paradigm for new types of energy storage and conversion devices.








Abstract
New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device is the metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional catalyst&#160;(named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants while anode is metal, driven by cathodic redox electrocatalytic reactions during charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical production. In this system, the metal anode, redox&#8208;bicatalyst cathode, electrolytes, and the redox electrochemical reactions can be modified and adjusted to achieve the optimal energy conversion and utilization. Therefore, the deep understanding of the electrochemical system is conducive to designing new devices to meet the demand among various applications, including energy storage and conversion. In this review, the authors clarify the fundamentals and design principles of the rechargeable/reversible metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries and how each part affects the devices in energy conversion and chemical production. The authors summarize the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions, the reported systems relied on redox reactions, and the corresponding redox bicatalysts. Finally, a perspective of the key challenges and the possible new types of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries for efficient energy utilization and chemical production are given.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Meet Polymers: From Synthesis Strategies to Healthcare Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybridizing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with flexible polymers leads to unique properties wherein the incorporation of suitable polymers enhances the MOF performance. This review highlights the recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials, and discusses their applications in anticancer therapy, anti&#8208;bacteria treatment, imaging, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Insights from the current research and design principles are revealed for addressing future challenges.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been at the forefront of nanotechnological research for the past decade owing to their high porosity, high surface area, diverse configurations, and controllable chemical structures. They are a rapidly developing class of nanomaterials that are predominantly applied in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors, drug delivery, gas separation, adsorption, and storage. However, the limited functions and unsatisfactory performance of MOFs resulting from their low chemical and mechanical stability hamper further development. Hybridizing MOFs with polymers is an excellent solution to these problems, because polymers&#8212;which are soft, flexible, malleable, and processable&#8212;can induce unique properties in the hybrids based on those of the two disparate components while retaining their individuality. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials. Furthermore, several applications wherein the incorporation of polymers enhances the MOF performance are discussed, such as anticancer therapy, bacterial elimination, imaging, therapeutics, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Finally, insights from the focus of existing research and design principles for mitigating future challenges are presented.

This review highlights recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials. Furthermore, several applications wherein the incorporation of polymers enhances the MOF performance are discussed, such as anticancer therapy, bacterial elimination, imaging, therapeutics, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Finally, insights from the focus of existing research and design principles for mitigating future challenges are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured Wide&#8208;Necked Aneurysms using a Microcatheter Injectable Biomaterial</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WNAs are challenging to treat, and when they rupture, they can lead to significant mortality. In this work, it is shown that embolization of the aneurysm sac using a gel embolic agent in combination with a flow diverter stent&#160;can safely treat non&#8208;ruptured and ruptured aneurysms in large&#8208;animal models. This combinatorial approach may best treat complex WNAs and save lives.








Abstract
Ruptured wide&#8208;neck aneurysms (WNAs), especially in a setting of coagulopathy, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is shown that by trapping a sub&#8208;millimeter clinical catheter inside the aneurysm sac using a flow diverter stent (FDS), instant hemostasis can be achieved by filling the aneurysm sac using a novel biomaterial, rescuing catastrophic bleeding in large&#8208;animal models. Multiple formulations of a biomaterial comprising gelatin, nanoclay (NC), and iohexol are developed, optimized, and extensively tested in vitro to select the lead candidate for further testing in vivo in murine, porcine, and canine models of WNAs, including in a subset with aneurysm rupture. The catheter&#8208;injectable and X&#8208;ray visible versions of the gel embolic agent (GEA) with the optimized mechanical properties outperform control groups, including a subset that receive a clinically used liquid embolic (Onyx, Medtronic), with and without aneurysm rupture. A combinatorial approach to ruptured WNAs with GEA and FDS may change the standard of medical practice and save lives.

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ceramic architectures are captivating geometrical features with an immense demand in photonics. Here, we develop an additive manufacturing (AM) approach for printing alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite 3D microarchitectures. The newly developed approach enables custom&#8208;made photoresists suited for two&#8208;photon lithography, permitting the production of alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite (BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3) 3D structures shaped in the form of octet&#8208;truss lattices, gyroids or inspired architectures like sodalite zeolite, and C60 buckyball with micrometric and nanometric feature sizes. Alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite morphological, structural, and chemical characteristics are studied. The optical properties of such perovskite architectures are investigated using cathodoluminescence and wide&#8208;field photoluminescence emission to estimate the lifetime rate and defects in BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3. From a broad perspective, our AM methodology facilitates the production of 3D&#8208;structured mixed oxides. Our findings are the first steps toward dimensionally&#8208;refined high refractive index ceramics for micro&#8208;optics and other terrains like (photo)catalysis.

         <title>Spin Quantum dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Two&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Perovskite with Spin&#8208;Dependent Carrier Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect provides innovative approach to spintronics and quantum&#8208;based devices for chiral materials. Different from the conventional ferromagnetic devices, the application of CISS effect is potential to operate under room temperature and zero applied magnetic field. Low dimensional chiral perovskites by introducing chiral amines are beginning to show significant CISS effect for spin injection, but research on chiral perovskites is still in its infancy, especially on spin&#8208;light emitting diode (spin&#8208;LED) construction. Here we report the spin&#8208;QLEDs enabled by two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral perovskites as CISS layer for spin&#8208;dependent carrier injection and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as light emitting layer. The regulation pattern of the chirality and thickness of chiral perovskites, which affects the circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) emission of spin&#8208;QLED, has been discovered. Notably, the spin injection polarization of 2D chiral perovskites is higher than 80% and the CP&#8208;EL asymmetric factor (gCP&#8208;EL) achieves up to 1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;2. Consequently, this work opens up a new and effective approach for high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Aniline&#8208;Fused Quinonoid Units Affords Efficient Proton Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF)&#8208;based cathode&#160;with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids for proton batteries is developed. The assembled TPAD&#8208;COF//AQ all&#8208;organic proton battery exhibits excellent cycling performance. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that both the NH and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoids exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes.








Abstract
Owing to their intrinsic safety and sustainability, aqueous proton batteries have emerged as promising energy devices. Nevertheless, the corrosion or dissolution of electrode materials in acidic electrolytes must be addressed before practical applications. In this study, a cathode material based on a redox&#8208;active 2D covalent organic framework (TPAD&#8208;COF) with aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units&#160;featuring inherently regular open porous channels and excellent stability is developed. The TPAD&#8208;COF cathode delivers a high capacity of 126 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, paired with long&#8208;term cycling stability with capacity retention of 84% after 5000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Comprehensive ex situ spectroscopy studies correlated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that both the &#8211;NH&#8211; and C=O groups of the aniline&#8208;fused quinonoid units exhibit prominent redox activity of six electrons during the charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the assembled punch battery consisting of a TPAD&#8208;COF//anthraquinone (AQ) all&#8208;organic system delivers a discharge capacity of 115 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 130 cycles, implying the potential application of the TPAD&#8208;COF cathode in aqueous proton batteries. This study provides a new perspective on the design of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance and high capacity.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond Reconfiguration of Ferroelectric Domains in Bismuth Ferrite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pulsed photoexcitation, multiferroic bismuth ferrite thin film exhibits a sub&#8208;nanosecond melting of their periodic stripe domains. The disordered domains recover back to their original state over few nanosecond timescale. The ultrafast manipulation of domains can be used for fast speed operation in applications of ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Domain switching is crucial for achieving desired functions in ferroic materials that are used in various applications. Fast control of domains at sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales remains a challenge despite its potential for high&#8208;speed operation in random&#8208;access memories, photonic, and nanoelectronic devices. Here, ultrafast laser excitation is shown to transiently melt and reconfigure ferroelectric stripe domains in multiferroic bismuth ferrite on a timescale faster than 100&#160;picoseconds. This dynamic behavior is visualized by picosecond&#8208; and nanometer&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffuse scattering. The disordering of stripe domains is attributed to the screening of depolarization fields by photogenerated carriers resulting in the formation of charged domain walls, as supported by phase&#8208;field simulations. Furthermore, the recovery of disordered domains exhibits subdiffusive growth on nanosecond timescales, with a non&#8208;equilibrium domain velocity reaching up to 10&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1. These findings present a new approach to image and manipulate ferroelectric domains on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales, which can be further extended into other complex photoferroic systems to modulate their electronic, optical, and magnetic properties beyond gigahertz frequencies. This approach could pave the way for high&#8208;speed ferroelectric data storage and computing, and, more broadly, defines new approaches for visualizing the non&#8208;equilibrium dynamics of heterogeneous and disordered materials.

Here, ultrafast laser excitation is shown to transiently melt and reconfigure ferroelectric stripe domains in multiferroic bismuth ferrite on a timescale faster than 100&#160;picoseconds. This dynamic behavior is visualized by picosecond- and nanometer-resolved X-ray diffraction and time-resolved X-ray diffuse scattering. The disordering of stripe domains is attributed to the screening of depolarization fields by photogenerated carriers resulting in the formation of charged domain walls, as supported by phase-field simulations. Furthermore, the recovery of disordered domains exhibits subdiffusive growth on nanosecond timescales, with a non-equilibrium domain velocity reaching up to 10&#160;m&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings present a new approach to image and manipulate ferroelectric domains on sub-nanosecond timescales, which can be further extended into other complex photoferroic systems to modulate their electronic, optical, and magnetic properties beyond gigahertz frequencies. This approach could pave the way for high-speed ferroelectric data storage and computing, and, more broadly, defines new approaches for visualizing the non-equilibrium dynamics of heterogeneous and disordered materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Smart Single&#8208;Fluorophore Polymer: Self&#8208;Assembly Shapechromic Multicolor Fluorescence and Erasable Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart single&#8208;fluorophore polymer polyethyleneimine&#8208;grafted pyrene (PGP) incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers: amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8211;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites, exhibits deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. Besides, PGP driven by its reversible chelation capacity can be used as an advanced fluorescent ink with erasable and recoverable properties.








Abstract
A novel smart fluorescent polymer polyethyleneimine&#8208;grafted pyrene (PGP) is developed by incorporating four stimuli&#8208;triggers at molecular level. The triggers are amphiphilicity, supramolecular host&#8211;guest sites, pyrene fluorescence indicator, and reversible chelation sites. PGP exhibits smart deformation and shape&#8208;dependent fluorescence in response to external stimuli. It can deform into three typical shapes with a characteristic fluorescence color, namely, spherical core&#8211;shell micelles of cyan&#8208;green fluorescence, standard rectangular nanosheets of yellow fluorescence, and irregular branches of deep&#8208;blue fluorescence. A quasi&#8208;reversible deformation between the first two shapes can be dynamically manipulated. Moreover, driven by reversible coordination and the resulting intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, PGP can be used as an aqueous fluorescence ink with erasable and recoverable properties. The fluorescent patterns printed by PGP ink on paper can be rapidly erased and recovered by simple spraying a sequence of Cu2+ and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid aqueous solutions. This erase/recover transformation can be repeated multiple times on the same paper. The multiple stimulus responsiveness of PGP makes it have potential applications in nanorobots, sensing, information encryption, and anticounterfeiting.

         <title>Engineering Clinically Relevant Probiotics with Switchable &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221; and &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221; for Precision Tumor Therapy</title>

Abstract
Probiotics have the potential as biotherapeutic agents for cancer management in preclinical models and human trials by secreting antineoplastic or immunoregulatory agents in the tumor microenvironment. However, current probiotics lack the ability to dynamically respond to unique TME characteristics, leading to limited therapeutic accuracy and efficacy. Although progress has been made in customizing controllable probiotics through synthetic biology, the engineering process is complex and the predictability of production is relatively low. To address this, here, for the first time, we adopted pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) artificial enzymes as both an inducible &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221; and &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221; to engineer clinically relevant probiotics to achieve switchable control of probiotic therapy. The nanozyme initially serves as an inducible &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221;, generating trace amounts of nonlethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress to upregulate acidic metabolites in probiotics. Once metabolites acidify the TME to a threshold, the nanozyme switches to a &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221;, producing a great deal of lethal ROS to fight cancer. This approach shows promise in subcutaneous, orthotopic, and colitis&#8208;associated colorectal cancer tumors, offering a new methodology for modulating probiotic metabolism in a pathological environment.

Abstract
Pressure&#8208;driven membrane separation promises a sustainable energy&#8208;water nexus but is hindered by ubiquitous fouling. Natural systems evolved from prebiotic chemistry offer a glimpse of creative solutions. Herein, a prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile (AMN)/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization method is reported for universally engineering a superhydrophilic hierarchical MnO2 nanocoating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with exceptional catalytic cleaning ability. Green hydrogen peroxide catalytically triggered in&#8208;situ cleaning of the mineralized membrane and enabled operando flux recovery to reach 99.8%. Our mineralized membrane exhibited a 9&#8208;fold higher recovery compared to the unmineralized membrane, which was attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling. Electron density differences derived from the precursor interaction during mediated mineralization unveiled an electron&#8208;rich bell&#8208;like structure with an inner electron&#8208;deficient Mn core. This work paves a way to construct multifunctional engineered materials for energy&#8208;efficient water treatment as well as for diverse promising applications in catalysis, solar steam generation, biomedicine, and beyond.

         <title>Phosphorescent&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 37% External Quantum Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
Red quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes with TFB:10 wt% Ir(MDQ)2(acac) as hole&#8208;transport layer and exciton harvester realize a record high external quantum efficiency of 37% (37.3 cd A&#8722;1, 41 lm W&#8722;1) and a central wavelength of 628 nm with narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum of 23.4 nm. The devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.








Abstract
Exciton harvesting is of paramount importance for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Direct exciton harvesting by the quantum dots (QDs) emitting layer suffers from poor hole injection due to the low conduction bands and valence bands of QDs, leading to unbalanced electron&#8211;hole injection and recombination. To address this issue, here, an exciton sensitizing approach is reported, where excitons form on a phosphorescent&#8208;dye&#8208;doped layer, which then transfer their energies to adjacent QDs layer for photon emission. Due to the very efficient exciton formation and energy&#8208;transfer processes, higher device performance can be achieved. To demonstrate the above strategy, red QLEDs with a phosphorescent dye, iridium (III) bis(2&#8208;methyldibenzo&#8208;[f,h]quinoxaline) (acetylacetonate), Ir(MDQ)2(acac), doped hole&#8208;transporting layer are fabricated and studied. At a doping concentration of 10&#160;wt%, the best device achieves record high current efficiency, power efficiency, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, 41&#160;lm W&#8722;1, and 37%, respectively. Simultaneously, the efficiency roll&#8208;off characteristic is greatly improved, in that 35% EQE can be well retained at a high luminance level of 450&#8201;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Moreover, the devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.

         <title>Neural Networks Push The Limits of Luminescence Lifetime Nanosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Luminescence lifetime&#8208;based sensing is ideally suited to monitor biological systems due to its minimal invasiveness and remote working principle. Yet, its applicability is limited in conditions of low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) induced by, e.g., short exposure times and presence of opaque tissues. Herein we overcome this limitation applying a U&#8208;shaped convolutional neural network (U&#8208;NET) to improve luminescence lifetime estimation under conditions of extremely low SNR. Specifically, we showcase the prowess of the U&#8208;NET in the context of luminescence lifetime thermometry, achieving more precise thermal readouts using Ag2S nanothermometers. Compared to traditional analysis methods of decay curve fitting and integration, the U&#8208;NET can extract average lifetimes more precisely and consistently regardless of the SNR value. The improvement achieved in the thermometric performance using the U&#8208;NET is showcased with two experiments characterized by extreme measurement conditions: thermal monitoring of free&#8208;falling droplets and monitoring of thermal transients in suspended droplets through an opaque medium. These results broaden the applicability of luminescence lifetime&#8208;based sensing in fields including in vivo experimentation and microfluidics, while, hopefully, spurring further research on the implementation of machine learning in luminescence sensing.

Compared to traditional analysis methods of decay curve fitting and integration, the U-NET can extract average lifetimes more precisely and consistently regardless of the SNR value. The improvement achieved in the thermometric performance using the U-NET is showcased with two experiments characterized by extreme measurement conditions: thermal monitoring of free-falling droplets and monitoring of thermal transients in suspended droplets through an opaque medium. These results broaden the applicability of luminescence lifetime-based sensing in fields including in vivo experimentation and microfluidics, while, hopefully, spurring further research on the implementation of machine learning in luminescence sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Computationally Guided Synthesis of MXenes by Dry Selective Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of a dry, fluorine&#8208;free MXene synthesis route is investigated through quantum mechanics calculations and thermodynamic modeling. Computational insights are experimentally validated to demonstrate synthesis of MXenes through dry selective extraction (DSE) of MAX phase precursors using iodine vapor under suitable temperatures and pressures. The DSE approach opens avenues for the sustainable and scalable synthesis of new MXenes.








Abstract
MXenes are a rapidly growing family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides and nitrides&#160;that&#160;are promising for various applications, including energy storage and conversion, electronics, and healthcare. Hydrofluoric&#8208;acid&#8208;based etchants are typically used for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;throughput synthesis of MXenes, which also leads to a mixture of surface terminations that impede MXene properties. Herein, a computational thermodynamic model with experimental validation is presented to explore the feasibility of fluorine&#8208;free synthesis of MXenes with uniform surface terminations by dry selective extraction (DSE) from precursor MAX phases using iodine vapors. A range of MXenes&#160;and respective precursor compositions are systematically screened using first&#8208;principles calculations to find candidates with high phase stability and low etching energy. A thermodynamic model based on the &#8220;CALculation of PHAse Diagrams&#8221; (CALPHAD) approach is further demonstrated, using Ti3C2I2 as an example, to assess the Gibbs free energy of the DSE reaction and the state of the byproducts as a function of temperature and pressure. Based on the assessment, the optimal synthesis temperature and vapor pressure are predicted and further verified by experiments. This work opens an avenue for scalable, fluorine&#8208;free dry synthesis of MXenes with compositions and surface chemistries that are not accessible using wet chemical etching.

         <title>Functionalized MXene Films with Substantially Improved Low&#8208;voltage Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for low&#8208;voltage electrochemical actuators due to its excellent electrical conductivity, volumetric capacitance, and mechanical properties. However, its in&#8208;plane actuation is limited to little intralayer strain of MXene sheets under polarization. Here we demonstrate that a simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA) functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain by 337% and also enhances the mechanical property and stability in air and the electrolyte. Various in situ characterizations reveal that the improved actuation is ascribed to the co&#8208;insertion/desertion of TBA and Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps that causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations. The assembled bending actuator has a high strength and modulus and generates a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference of 0.771% and a blocking force up to 51.5 times its own weight under 1&#160;V. The designed soft robotic tweezer can grasp an object under 1&#160;V and hold it firmly under 0&#160;V. The novel sheet sliding mechanism resembling the filament sliding theory in skeletal muscles may inspire the design of high&#8208;performance actuators with other nanomaterials.

         <title>Boosting the Electrochemical 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Oxidation by Balancing the Competitive Adsorption of Organic and OH&#8722; over Controllable Reconstructed Ni3S2/NiOx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n with continuously controllable surface compositions is synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of 5&#8208;hyfroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibits excellent performance inHMF electrooxidation, with a current density of 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;V and selectivity of &gt;98% for the 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising method for the efficient production of biomass&#8208;derived high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. However, its practical application is limited by: 1) the low activity and selectivity caused by the competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722; and 2) the low operational stability caused by the uncontrollable reconstruction of the catalyst. To overcome these limitations, a series of Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;n catalysts with controllable compositions and well&#8208;defined structures are synthesized using a novel in situ controlled surface reconstruction strategy. The adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722; can be continuously adjusted by varying the ratio of NiOx to Ni3S2 on the catalysts surface, as indicated by in situ characterizations, contact angle analysis,&#160;and theoretical simulations. Owing to the balanced competitive adsorption of HMF and OH&#8722;, the optimized Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 catalyst exhibited remarkable HMF electrocatalytic oxidation performance, with the current density reaching 366&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;VRHE and the Faradaic efficiency of the product, 2,5&#8208;furanedicarboxylic acid, reaching 98%. Moreover, Ni3S2/NiOx&#8208;15 exhibits excellent durability, with its activity and structure remaining stable for over 100&#160;h of operation. This study provides a new route for the design and construction of catalysts for value&#8208;added biomass conversion and offers new insights into enhancing catalytic performance by balancing competitive adsorption.

         <title>Pulsed&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Piezoelectric Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Tetragonal BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient pressure induced by a 355&#160;nm pulsed laser (PL) builds a pulsed built&#8208;in electric field on tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T), contributing to the photoinduced carrier separation and band bending of the BTO&#8208;T. The PL&#8208;triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and efficient continuous photocatalysis (0.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The recombination of photoinduced carriers in photocatalysts is considered one of the biggest barriers to the increase of photocatalytic efficiency. Piezoelectric photocatalysts open a new route to realize rapid carrier separation by mechanically distorting the lattice of piezoelectric nanocrystals to form a piezoelectric potential within the nanocrystals, generally requiring external force (e.g., ultrasonic radiation, mechanical stirring, and ball milling). In this study, a low&#8208;power UV pulsed laser (PL) (3&#160;W, 355&#160;nm) as a UV light source can trigger piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction of tetragonal BaTiO3 (BTO&#8208;T) in the absence of an applied force. The tremendous transient light pressure (5.7 &#215; 107&#160;Pa, 2.7&#160;W) of 355&#160;nm PL not only bends the energy band of BTO&#8208;T, thus allowing reactions that cannot theoretically occur to take place, but also induces a pulsed built&#8208;in electric field to determine an efficient photoinduced carrier separation. On that basis, the PL&#8208;triggered piezoelectric photocatalytic CO2 reduction realizes the highest reported performance, reaching a millimole level CO yield of 52.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the continuous catalytic system. The method in this study is promising to contribute to the design of efficient piezoelectric photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Additive&#8208;Assisted Tellurium Homogenization in ZnSeTe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dependence on aqueous hydrohalic acids poses challenges when working with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors, as seen in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe quantum dots. In this work, a safe and oxygen&#8208;free method is proposed to introduce anhydrous acids into the synthesis using benzenecarbonyl fluoride as a chemical additive. This method enables a controlled release of acid, resulting in a more uniform Te distribution within the ZnSeTe lattice.








Abstract
Addition of aqueous hydrohalic acids during the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is widely employed to achieve high&#8208;quality QDs. However, this reliance on the use of aqueous solutions is incompatible with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors such as those used in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe QDs. Herein, it is shown that this incompatibility leads to phase segregation into Te&#8208;rich and Te&#8208;poor regions, causing spectral broadening and luminescence peak shifting under high laser irradiation and applied electrical bias. Here, a synthetic strategy to produce anhydrous&#8208;HF in situ by using benzenecarbonyl fluoride (BF) as a chemical additive is reported. Through in situ 19F NMR spectroscopy, it is found that BF reacts with surfactants in tandem, ultimately producing intermediary F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;trioctylamine adducts. These act as a pseudo&#8208;HF source that releases anhydrous HF. The controlled release of HF during nucleation and growth steps homogenizes Te distribution in ZnSeTe lattice, leading to spectrally stable blue&#8208;emitting QDs under increasing laser flux from &#8776;3 &#181;W to &#8776;12 mW and applied bias from 2.6 to 10 V. Single&#8208;dot photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and analyses of the absorption, PL and transient absorption spectra together with density functional theory point to the role of anhydrous HF as a Te homogenizer.

         <title>Non&#8208;Lignin Constructing the Gas&#8211;Solid Interface for Enhancing the Photothermal Catalytic Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K&#8208;SrTiO3&#8208;loaded TiN silica wool (K&#8208;STO/TiN SW) is used to build photothermal&#8211;photocatalytic system. TiN SW enables stable steam production and produced a gas/solid reaction interface with a lower Gibbs free energy. This enables K&#8208;STO to split water vapor into hydrogen and oxygen, and ensures that the TiN SW substrate material does not involve in the catalytic reaction.








Abstract
The progress of solar&#8208;driven water&#8208;splitting technology has been impeded by the limited light response capability of semiconductor materials. Despite attempts to leverage nearly 50% of infrared radiation for photothermal synergy and catalytic reaction enhancement, heat loss during liquid phase reactions results in low energy conversion efficiency. Here, the photothermally driven catalytic water&#8208;splitting system, which designs K&#8208;SrTiO3&#8208;loaded TiN silica wool at the water&#8211;air interface. Photocatalytic tests and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the thermal effect transforms liquid water into water vapor, thereby reducing the reaction free energy of catalysts and improving the transmission rate of catalytic products. Hence, the hydrogen evolution rate reaches 275.46&#160;mmol m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) efficiency is 1.81% under 1 sun irradiation in this gas&#8211;solid system, which is more than twice that of liquid water splitting. This novel photothermal catalytic pathway, which involves a coupled reaction of water evaporation and water splitting, is anticipated to broaden the utilization range of the solar spectrum and significantly enhance the conversion efficiency of STH.

         <title>Achieving a Record Scintillation Performance by Micro&#8208;Doping a Heterovalent Magnetic Ion in Cs3Cu2I5 Single&#8208;Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;doping of magnetic Mn2+ ions in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal can regulate the emission of self&#8208;trapped excitons under high&#8208;energy ray excitation, solving its drawback of slow scintillation decay. This optimization makes the crystal an ideal scintillator for ultrafast, ultrabright, and low&#8208;cost scintillation with significant application prospects.








Abstract
An ultrabright, ultrafast, and low&#8208;cost ideal scintillator has been critically absent and is sorely desired in scintillation detection, but has hitherto not been found. Here, a high&#8208;quality bulk Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal scintillator with ultrahigh light yield (&#8776;95&#8239;772 photons&#160;per&#160;MeV, 137Cs &#947;&#8208;rays), excellent energy resolution (3.79%, 662&#160;keV), and ultrafast scintillation decay time (3&#160;ns, 81.5%) is reported. In mechanism, it is found that micro&#8208;doping of a heterovalent magnetic ion (at the ppm level) can effectively modulate the luminescence kinetics of self&#8208;trapped excitons in the scintillator. Compared with previous reports, the introduction of trace amounts of magnetic Mn2+ (&#8776;18.6&#160;ppm) in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal shortens the scintillation decay time by several hundred times, transforming the slow decay into an ultrafast decay. Simultaneously, the light yield is also increased about three times&#160;to the highest value so far. From the comprehensive performance of the micro&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal, these excellent scintillation properties, physical characteristics suitable for practical applications, and low&#8208;cost advantages render this single&#8208;crystal an ideal scintillator with great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Antibacterial Fusobacterium nucleatum&#8208;Mimicking Nanomedicine to Selectively Eliminate Tumor&#8208;Colonized Bacteria and Enhance Immunotherapy Against Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fusobacterium&#160;nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine is presented, by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin&#8208;loaded liposomes&#160;to achieve selective killing of tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum. In F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous colorectal tumor models and a chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer model, such F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine can effectively relieve F. nucleatum&#8208;derived pro&#8208;tumoral microenvironment and improve the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Clinical evidence indicates that tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria can be closely related to the tumor development and therapeutic responses. Selectively eliminating bacteria within tumors may be an attractive approach to enhance cancer treatment without additional side effects. Herein, it is found that, owing to the high affinity between the membrane protein Fap&#8208;2 on Fusobacterium nucleatum and d&#8208;galactose&#8208;&#946; (1&#8208;3)&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;galactosamine (Gal&#8208;GalNAc) overexpressed on colorectal tumor cells, F. nucleatum can colonize in colorectal tumors, as evidenced by both clinical samples and animal tumor models. Notably, F. nucleatum colonized in colorectal tumors can lead to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, greatly reducing their responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Inspired by this finding, an F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine is designed by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin&#8208;loaded liposomes to achieve selective killing of tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum without affecting gut microbes. As a result, the therapeutic responses of F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized tumors to ICB therapies can be successfully restored, as demonstrated in an F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous CT&#8208;26 tumor model, chemically induced spontaneous colorectal cancer models, and MC&#8208;38 tumor model. In summary, this work presents an F. nucleatum&#8208;mimicking nanomedicine that can selectively eliminate tumor&#8208;colonized bacteria, which is promising for enhancing the responses of cancer immunotherapy against F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized colorectal cancer.

         <title>Communicating Supraparticles to Enable Perceptual, Information&#8208;Providing Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging concept of communicating supraparticles (CSPs), i.e., (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized information providing additives, is presented. Their functional signal characteristics comprise an identification signature and stimuli&#8208;recorder features. Integration of customized CSPs into materials turns them from passive objects into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. Upon interrogation of CSPs, digitally associated information on the hosting material and its intactness is obtained on demand.








Abstract
Materials are the fundament of the physical world, whereas information and its exchange are the centerpieces of the digital world. Their fruitful synergy offers countless opportunities for realizing desired digital transformation processes in the physical world of materials. Yet, to date, a perfect connection between these worlds is missing. From the perspective, this can be achieved by overcoming the paradigm of considering materials as passive objects and turning them into perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter. This matter is capable of communicating associated digitally stored information, for example, its origin, fate, and material type as well as its intactness on demand. Herein, the concept of realizing perceptual, information&#8208;providing matter by integrating customizable (sub&#8208;)micrometer&#8208;sized communicating supraparticles (CSPs) is presented. They are assembled from individual nanoparticulate and/or (macro)molecular building blocks with spectrally differentiable signals that are either robust or stimuli&#8208;susceptible. Their combination yields functional signal characteristics that provide an identification signature and one or multiple stimuli&#8208;recorder features. This enables CSPs to communicate associated digital information on the tagged material and its encountered stimuli histories upon signal readout anywhere across its life cycle. Ultimately, CSPs link the materials and digital worlds with numerous use cases thereof, in particular fostering the transition into an age of sustainability.

Their functional signal characteristics comprise an identification signature and stimuli-recorder features. Integration of customized CSPs into materials turns them from passive objects into perceptual, information-providing matter.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Nanoparticle Vaccine for Combating Fatal Bacterial Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bacterial pneumonia is the leading cause of death worldwide among all infectious diseases. However, currently available vaccines against fatal bacterial lung infections, including pneumonic plague, are accompanied by limitations, including insufficient antigen&#8208;adjuvant co&#8208;delivery and inadequate immune stimulation. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to develop next&#8208;generation vaccines to improve the interaction between antigen and adjuvant, as well as enhance the effects of immune stimulation. Our study developed a novel amino&#8208;decorated mesoporous manganese silicate nanoparticle (AMMSN) loaded with rF1&#8208;V10 (rF1&#8208;V10@AMMSN) to prevent pneumonic plague. Our results suggest that subcutaneous immunization with rF1&#8208;V10@AMMSN in a prime&#8208;boost strategy induces robust production of rF1&#8208;V10&#8208;specific IgG antibodies with a geometric mean titer of 315844 at day 42 post&#8208;primary immunization, which confers complete protection to mice against 50&#215;LD50 of Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) challenge via the aerosolized intratracheal route. Mechanistically, rF1&#8208;V10@AMMSN can be taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) and promote DCs maturation through activation of the cyclic GMP&#8211;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and production of type I interferon. This process results in enhanced antigen presentation and promotes rF1&#8208;V10&#8208;mediated protection against Y. pestis infection. This manganese&#8208;based nanoparticle vaccine represents a valuable strategy for combating fatal bacterial pneumonia.

         <title>A Soft, Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Naked&#8208;Eye Strain/Stress Visualization Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Learning about the strain/stress distribution in a material is essential to achieving its mechanical stability and proper functionality. Conventional techniques such as universal testing machines only apply to static samples with standardized geometry in laboratory environment. Soft mechanical sensors based on stretchable conductors, carbon&#8208;filled composites or conductive gels possess better adaptability, but still face challenges from complicated fabrication process, dependence on extra readout device and limited strain/stress mapping ability. Inspired by the camouflage mechanism of cuttlefish and chameleons, here we developed an innovative responsive hydrogel containing light&#8208;scattering &#8220;mechano&#8208;iridophores&#8221;. Force induced reversible phase separation manipulated the dynamic generation of mechano&#8208;iridophores, serving as optical indicators of local deformation. Patch&#8208;shaped mechanical sensors made from the responsive hydrogel featured fast response time (&lt;0.4 s), high spatial resolution (&#8764;100&#160;&#956;m) and wide dynamic ranges (e.g., 10%&#8208;150% strain). The intrinsic adhesiveness and self&#8208;healing capability of sensing patches also ensured their excellent applicability and robustness. This combination of chemical and optical properties allowed strain/stress distributions in target samples to be directly identified by naked eyes or smartphone apps, which had not yet been achieved. The great advantages above are ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation mechanical sensors towards material studies, damage diagnosis, risk prediction and smart devices.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Organic Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence Materials Based on A Functional Unit Combination Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A rational molecular design strategy facilitates the development of a purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material system with precisely regulated luminescence properties, which surely promotes its functional integration and intelligent application. Here, we propose a functional unit combination strategy to design novel RTP molecules combining a folding unit with diverse luminescent cores. The different luminescent cores are mainly responsible for tunable RTP properties, while the folding unit contributes to the spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement, which makes the RTP material design as workable as the building block principle. By this strategy, a series of color/lifetime&#8208;tunable RTP materials were achieved with unique photo&#8208;responsive RTP enhancement when subjected to UV irradiation, which expands their application scenarios in reusable privacy tags, advanced &#8220;4D&#8221; encryption, and phase separation analysis of blended polymers. This work suggests a simple and effective strategy to design purely organic RTP materials with tunable color and lifetime, and also provides new application options for photo&#8208;responsive dynamic RTP materials.

         <title>Oligo(Phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice For Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great advantages as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we design and synthesize two kgm topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based COFs for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF&#8208;954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibit high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF&#8208;954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ultraviolet&#8208;visible light irradiation. Additionally, the water&#8208;drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25&#160;mL and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 mins under ultraviolet&#8208;visible light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrate an effective design strategy towards highly efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Atomic Distance Engineering in Metal Catalysts to Regulate Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is very important to understand the structure&#8208;performance relationship of metal catalysts by adjusting the microstructure of catalysts at the atomic scale. The atomic distance has an essential influence on the composition of the environment of active metal atom, which is a key factor for the design of targeted catalysts with desired function. In this review, we discuss and summarize strategies for changing the atomic distance from three aspects and relate their effects on the reactivity of catalysts. Firstly, we introduce the effects of regulating bond length between metal and coordination atom at one single&#8208;atom site on the catalytic performance. The bond lengths are affected by the strain effect of the support and high&#8208;shell doping, and can evolve during the reaction. Next, we try to discuss the influence of the distance between single&#8208;atom sites on the catalytic performance. Due to the space matching of adsorption and electron transport, the catalytic performance can be adjusted with the shortening of site distance. In addition, the effect of the arrangement spacing of the surface metal active atoms on the catalytic performance of metal nanocatalysts is studied. Finally, we give a comprehensive summary and outlook of the relationship between atomic distance and catalytic performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to understand the structure-performance relationship of metal catalysts by adjusting the microstructure of catalysts at the atomic scale. The atomic distance has an essential influence on the composition of the environment of active metal atom, which is a key factor for the design of targeted catalysts with desired function. In this review, we discuss and summarize strategies for changing the atomic distance from three aspects and relate their effects on the reactivity of catalysts. Firstly, we introduce the effects of regulating bond length between metal and coordination atom at one single-atom site on the catalytic performance. The bond lengths are affected by the strain effect of the support and high-shell doping, and can evolve during the reaction. Next, we try to discuss the influence of the distance between single-atom sites on the catalytic performance. Due to the space matching of adsorption and electron transport, the catalytic performance can be adjusted with the shortening of site distance. In addition, the effect of the arrangement spacing of the surface metal active atoms on the catalytic performance of metal nanocatalysts is studied. Finally, we give a comprehensive summary and outlook of the relationship between atomic distance and catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Recent consecutive discoveries of various 2D materials have triggered significant scientific and technological interests owing to their exceptional material properties, originally stemming from 2D confined geometry. Ever&#8208;expanding library of 2D materials can provide ideal solutions to critical challenges facing in current technological trend of the 4th industrial revolution. Moreover, chemical modification of 2D materials to customize their physical/chemical properties can satisfy the broad spectrum of different specific requirements across diverse application areas. This review focuses on three particular emerging application areas of 2D materials: smart fibers, soft robotics and single atom catalysts, which hold immense potentials for academic and technological advancements in the post&#8208;AI era. Smart fibers showcase unconventional functionalities including healthcare/environmental monitoring, energy storage/harvesting and antipathogenic protection in the forms of wearable fibers and textiles. Soft robotics aligns with future trend to overcome longstanding limitations of hard&#8208;material based mechanics by introducing soft actuators and sensors. Single atom catalysts are widely useful in energy storage/conversion and environmental management, principally contributing to low carbon footprint for sustainable post AI era. We highlight significance and unique values of 2D materials in these emerging applications, where our research group has devoted research efforts for more than a decade.

         <title>Selective Organ&#8208;Targeting Hafnium Oxide Nanoparticles with Multienzyme&#8208;Mimetic Activities Attenuate Radiation&#8208;Induced Tissue Damage</title>

Abstract
Radioprotective agents hold clinical promises to counteract off&#8208;target adverse effects of radiation and benefit radiotherapeutic outcomes, yet the inability to control drug transport in human organs poses a leading limitation. Based upon a validated rank&#8208;based multigene signature model, we evaluate radiosensitivity indices of diverse normal organs as a genomic predictor of radiation susceptibility. We rationally design Selective ORgan&#8208;Targeting (SORT) hafnium oxide nanoparticles (HfO2 NPs) via modulated synthesis by &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin, homing to top vulnerable organs. HfO2 NPs like Hensify are commonly radioenhancers, but SORT HfO2 NPs exhibit surprising radioprotective effects dictated by unfolded ligands and Hf(0)/Hf(IV) redox couples. Still, the X&#8208;ray attenuation patterns allow radiological confirmation in target organs by dual&#8208;beam spectral computed tomography. SORT HfO2 NPs present potent antioxidant activities, catalytically scavenge reactive oxygen species, and mimic multienzyme catalytic activities. Consequently, SORT NPs rescue radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage in mouse and rabbit models and provide survival benefits upon lethal exposures. In addition to inhibiting radiation&#8208;induced mitochondrial apoptosis, SORT NPs impede DNA damage and inflammation by attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades. We propose a universal methodology to reverse radioenhancers into radioprotectors. SORT radioprotective agents with image guidance are envisioned as compelling in personalized shielding from radiation deposition.

         <title>Layered Inorganic Silicate Aerogel Pillared by Nanoclusters for High Temperature Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered inorganic material, with large&#8208;area interlayer surface and interface, provide an essential material platform for constructing new configuration of functional materials. Herein, we demonstrate a layered materials pillared with nanoclusters realizing high temperature thermal insulation performance for the first time. Specifically, systematic synchrotron radiation spectroscopy and finite element calculation analysis show that ZrOx nanoclusters served as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to effectively produce porous structures with enough boundary defect while maintaining the layered structure, thereby significantly reducing solid state thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.32&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, 298&#8211;573 K). Moreover, the layered inorganic silicate material assembled aerogel also exhibits superior thermal insulation performance from room temperature (0.034&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, 298 K, air conditions) to high temperature (0.187&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, 1073 K, air conditions) and largely enhanced compressive strength (42&#160;kPa at 80% compression), which is the best layered material based aerogel that has achieved synergistic improvement in thermal and mechanical performance so far. Layered inorganic silicate aerogel pillared by nanoclusters will pave a new avenue for design of advanced thermal insulation materials under extreme conditions.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Synthesis of 2d Ternary Transition Metal Phosphorous Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ternary transition metal phosphorous chalcogenides (TMPCs) have attracted extensive research interest due to their widely tunable band gap, rich electronic properties, inherent magnetic and ferroelectric properties. However, the synthesis of TMPCs via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still challenging since it is difficult to control reactions among multi&#8208;precursors. Here, we propose a subtractive element growth mechanism to controllably synthesize the TMPCs. Based on the growth mechanism, the TMPCs including FePS3, FePSe3, MnPS3, MnPSe3, CdPS3, CdPSe3, In2P3S9 and SnPS3 are achieved successfully and further confirmed by Raman, second harmonic generation (SHG) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The typical TMPCs &#8211; SnPS3 shows a strong SHG signal at 1064&#160;nm, with an effective nonlinear susceptibility &#967;(2) of 8.41&#215;10&#8722;11 m V&#8722;1, which is about 8 times of that in MoS2. And the photodetector based on CdPSe3 exhibits superior detection performances with responsivity of 582&#160;mA/W, high detectivity of 3.19&#160;&#215;&#160;1011 Jones and fast rise time of 611 &#956;s, which is better than most previously reported TMPCs based photodetectors. These results demonstrate the high quality of TMPCs and promote the exploration of the optical properties of 2D TMPCs for their applications in optoelectronics.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Induced Lattice Strain for High&#8208;Performance Organic Transistors with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Integrating the merits of low cost, flexibility, and large&#8208;area processing, organic semiconductors (OSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electronic materials. The mobility and stability are the key figure of merit for its practical application. However, it is greatly challenging to improve the mobility and stability simultaneously owing to the weak interactions and poor electronic coupling between OSCs molecules. Here, we developed an oxygen&#8208;induced lattice strain (OILS) strategy to achieve OSCs with both high&#8208;mobility and high&#8208;stability. Utilizing the strategy, the maximum mobility of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT) organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) rises to 15.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and the contact resistance lowers to 25.5 &#937;&#183;cm. Remarkably, the thermal stability of DNTT is much improved, and a record saturated power density of approximately 3.4&#215;104&#160;W cm&#8722;2 is obtained. Both the experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the lattice compressive strain induced by oxygen is responsible for the high performance and stability. Furthermore, the universality of the strategy is manifested in both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type small OSCs. This work provides a novel strategy to improve both the mobility and the stability of OSCs, paving the way for the practical applications of organic devices.

This work provides a novel strategy to improve both the mobility and the stability of OSCs, paving the way for the practical applications of organic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Healing Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of so&#8208;called smart organic coatings for anticorrosion application involves stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with a self&#8208;healing ability. For this, it is of crucial importance to understand various aspects related to the storage and release of self&#8208;healing agents, as well as the spreading of the trigger signal. The requirements and possibilities for designing self&#8208;healing materials for corrosion protection are discussed.








Abstract
Organic coatings are one of the most popular and powerful strategies for protecting metals against corrosion. They can be applied in different ways, such as by dipping, spraying, electrophoresis, casting, painting, or flow coating. They offer great flexibility of material designs and cost effectiveness. Moreover, self&#8208;healing has evolved as a new research topic for protective organic coatings in the last two decades. Responsive materials play a crucial role in this new research field. However, for targeting the development of high&#8208;performance self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection, it is not sufficient just to focus on smart responsive materials and suitable active agents for self&#8208;healing. A better understanding of how coatings can react on different stimuli induced by corrosion, how these stimuli can spread in the coating, and how the released agents can reach the corroding defect is also of high importance. Such knowledge would allow the&#160;design of coatings that are optimized for specific applications. Herein, the requirements and possibilities from the corrosion and synthesis perspectives for designing materials for preparing self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection are discussed.

         <title>Stabilizing Metal Halide Perovskites for Solar Fuel Production: Challenges, Solutions, and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as one of the promising photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their exceptional photophysical properties. This review focuses on their most pressing stability issue for practical applications and summarizes the latest stabilization strategies to design and prepare water&#8208;stable perovskite photocatalysts.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are emerging photocatalyst materials that can enable sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion by virtue of their broad absorption spectra, effective separation/transport of photogenerated carriers, and solution processability. Although preliminary studies show the excellent photocatalytic activities of MHPs, their intrinsic structural instability due to the low formation energy and soft ionic nature is an open challenge for their practical applications. This review discusses the latest understanding of the stability issue and strategies to overcome this issue for MHP&#8208;based photocatalysis. First, the origin of the instability issue at atomic levels and the design rules for robust structures are analyzed and elucidated. This is then followed by presenting several different material design strategies for stability enhancement, including reaction medium modification, material surface protection, structural dimensionality engineering, and chemical composition engineering. Emphases are placed on understanding the effects of these strategies on photocatalytic stability as well as the possible structure&#8208;performance correlation. Finally, the possible future research directions for pursuing stable and efficient MHP photocatalysts in order to accelerate their technological maturity on a practical scale are outlined. With that, it is hoped to provide readers a valuable snapshot of this rapidly developing and exciting field.

         <title>Deep Learning in Mechanical Metamaterials: From Prediction and Generation to Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials, from property prediction and geometry generation to inverse design. It is highly anticipated that deep learning can bring about significant advancements in mechanical metamaterials by creating universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence in the near&#160;future.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are meticulously designed structures with exceptional mechanical properties determined by their microstructures and constituent materials. Tailoring their material and geometric distribution unlocks the potential to achieve unprecedented bulk properties and functions. However, current mechanical metamaterial design considerably relies on experienced designers' inspiration through trial and error, while investigating their mechanical properties and responses entails time&#8208;consuming mechanical testing or computationally expensive simulations. Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the design process of mechanical metamaterials, enabling property prediction and geometry generation without prior knowledge. Furthermore, deep generative models can transform conventional forward design into inverse design. Many recent studies on the implementation of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials are highly specialized, and their pros and cons may not be immediately evident. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in property prediction, geometry generation, and inverse design of mechanical metamaterials. Additionally, this review highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning to create universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence. This article is expected to be valuable not only to researchers working on mechanical metamaterials but also those in the field of materials&#160;informatics.

         <title>Reversible Multielectron Redox Chemistry in a NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe&#8208;substituted Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 cathode with Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type structure is proposed, which realizes reversible structural evolution and multielectron redox reactions (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) by incorporating iron, whose unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital are inextricably related to the activation of higher&#8208;voltage redox couple.








Abstract
Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility, and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON&#8208;type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by an Fe&#8208;substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realizes high&#8208;voltage multielectron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10&#160;000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+, and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic&#8208;migration energy barrier and ideal Na+&#8208;diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher&#8208;valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;duration cycling lifespan (3000&#160;stable cycles at 50 C), along with material&#8208;level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Stabilized Fiber Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Amniotic Fluid During Pregnancy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Diseases in pregnancy endanger millions of fetuses worldwide every year. The onset of these diseases can be early warned by the dynamic abnormalities of biochemicals in amniotic fluid, thus requiring real&#8208;time monitoring. However, when continuously penetrated by detection devices, the amnion is prone to loss of robustness and rupture, which is difficult to regenerate. Here, we present an interface&#8208;stabilized fiber sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of biochemical dynamics in amniotic fluid during pregnancy. The sensor is seamlessly integrated into the amnion through tissue adhesion, amniotic regeneration and uniform stress distribution, posing no risk to the amniotic fluid environment. The sensor demonstrates a response performance of less than 0.3% fluctuation under complex dynamic conditions and an accuracy of more than 98% from the second to the third trimester. By applying it to early warning of diseases such as intrauterine hypoxia, intrauterine infection, and fetal growth restriction, fetal survival increases to 95% with timely intervention.

         <title>Molecular Heptazine&#8208;triazine Junction over Carbon Nitride Frameworks for Artificial Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Revealing the photocatalytic mechanism between various junctions and catalytic activities has become the hotspot in photocatalytic system. Herein, an internal molecular heptazine/triazine (H/T) junction in crystalline carbon nitride (HTCN) was constructed and devoted to selective two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. In&#8208;situ XRD spectra under various temperature authenticated the successful formation of molecular H/T junction in HTCN during the calcining process rather than physically mixing. The increased surface photovoltage (SPV) and transient photovoltage (TPV) signals, and the decreased exciton binding energy (Eb) undoubtably elucidated that an obvious increasement of carrier density and diffusion capability of photogenerated electrons were realized over HTCN. Additionally, the analyses of in&#8208;situ photoirradiated Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and femto&#8208;second transient absorption spectra (fs&#8208;TAS) revealed the successful construction of the strong internal built&#8208;in&#8208;electric field and existence of the majority of long&#8208;lived shallow trapped electrons associated with molecular H/T junction over HTCN, respectively. Benefiting from these, the photocatalytic results exhibited an incredible improvement (96.5&#8208;fold) for H2O2 production. This novel work provides a comprehensive understanding of the long&#8208;lived reactive charges in molecular H/T junction for strengthening the driving&#8208;force for photocatalytic H2O2 production, which opens potential applications for enhancing PCN&#8208;based photocatalytic redox reactions.

         <title>Facile Photopatterning of Perfusable Microchannels in Synthetic Hydrogels to Recreate Microphysiological Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fabrication of perfusable hydrogels is crucial for recreating in vitro microphysiological environments. Existing strategies to fabricate complex microchannels in hydrogels involve sophisticated equipment/techniques. We report a cost&#8208;effective, facile, versatile, and ultra&#8208;fast methodology to fabricate perfusable microchannels of complex shapes in photopolymerizable hydrogels without the need of specialized equipment or sophisticated protocols. Our methodology utilizes one&#8208;step UV light&#8208;triggered crosslinking and a photomask printed on inexpensive transparent films to photopattern PEG&#8208;norbornene hydrogels. Complex and intricate patterns with high resolution, including perfusable microchannels, can be fabricated in &lt;1 second. We integrate the perfusable hydrogel into a custom&#8208;made microfluidic device that permits connection to external pump systems, allowing continuous fluid perfusion into the microchannels. Under dynamic culture, human endothelial cells form a functional and confluent endothelial monolayer that remains viable for at least 7 days and respond to inflammatory stimuli. Finally, we adapt our approach to photopattern norbornene hyaluronic acid hydrogels, highlighting the versatility of the technique. This study presents an innovative strategy to simplify and reduce the cost of biofabrication techniques for developing functional in vitro models using perfusable 3D hydrogels. Our approach offers a novel solution to overcome the complexities associated with existing methods, allowing engineering advanced in vitro microphysiological environments.

         <title>Measuring Solvent Exchange in Silica Nanoparticles with Rotor&#8208;based Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Measuring the diffusivity of molecules is the first step towards understanding their dependence and controlling diffusion, but the challenge increases with the decrease of molecular size, particularly for non&#8208;fluorescent and non&#8208;reactive molecules such as solvents. Here, we demonstrate the capability to monitor the solvent exchange process within the micropores of silica with millisecond time resolution, by simply embedding a rotor&#8208;based fluorophore (thioflavin T) in colloidal silica nanoparticles. Basically, the silica provides an extreme case of viscous microenvironment, which is affected by the polarity of the solvents. The fluorescence intensity traces could be well fitted to the Fickian diffusion model, allowing analytical solution of the diffusion process and revealing the diffusion coefficients. The validation experiments, involving the water&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;water solvent exchange, the comparison of different drying conditions, and the variation in the degree of cross&#8208;linking in silica, confirmed the effectiveness and sensitivity of this method for characterizing diffusion in silica micropores. This work focuses on the method development of measuring diffusivity and the high temporal resolution in tracking solvent exchange dynamics over a short distance (within 165&#160;nm) opens enormous possibilities for further studies.

         <title>Aromatic&#8208;Free Polymers Based All&#8208;Organic Dielectrics with Breakdown Self&#8208;Healing for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers are becoming increasingly desirable for capacitive energy storage in renewable energy utilization, electrified transportation, and pulse power systems. Current dielectric polymers typically require robust aromatic molecular frameworks to ensure structural thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Nevertheless, the introduction of aromatic units compromises electrical insulation owing to pronounced &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions that facilitate electron transport and eliminates the breakdown self&#8208;healing property owing to their high carbon content. Herein, we describe an aromatic&#8208;free polynorborne copolymer exhibiting an electrical conductivity&#8212;two orders of magnitude lower than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyetherimide&#8212;at elevated temperatures and high electric fields owing to its large bandgap (&#8764; 4.64&#160;eV) and short hopping conduction distance (&#8764; 0.63&#160;nm). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the copolymer can effectively suppress the excitation of high&#8208;field valence electrons. Furthermore, the incorporation of trace semiconductors results in high discharge density (3.73 J cm&#8722;3) and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency (95% at 150&#176;C), outperforming existing high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers. The excellent electrical breakdown self&#8208;healing capability of the copolymer film at elevated temperatures further demonstrates its potential for use in dielectric capacitors capable of continuous operation under extreme conditions.

         <title>Ferroics in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites: Fundamentals, Design Strategies and Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) afford highly versatile structure design and lattice dimensionalities; thus, they are actively researched as material platforms for the tailoring of ferroic behaviors. Unlike single&#8208;phase organic or inorganic materials, the interlayer coupling between organic and inorganic components in HOIPs allows the modification of strain and symmetry by chirality transfer or lattice distortion, thereby enabling the co&#8208;existence of ferroic orders. This review focuses on the principles for engineering one or multiple ferroic orders in HOIPs, and the conditions for achieving multiferroicity and magnetoelectric properties. The prospects of multi&#8208;level ferroic modulation and spin orbitronics in HOIPs are also presented.

         <title>Optical Enhancement of Indirect Bandgap 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Multi&#8208;Functional Optoelectronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifications to improve the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides and their emerging applications in optoelectronic sensors are the focus of this review. Various engineering techniques are discussed to overcome their limitations derived from the indirect bandgap of multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as well as future directions of these materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The unique electrical and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make them attractive nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications, especially optical sensors. However, the optical characteristics of these materials are dependent on the number of layers. Monolayer TMDs have a direct bandgap that provides higher photoresponsivity compared to multilayer TMDs with an indirect bandgap. Nevertheless, multilayer TMDs are more appropriate for various photodetection applications due to their high carrier density, broad spectral response from UV to near&#8208;infrared, and ease of large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, this review focuses on the modification of the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap TMDs and their emerging applications. Several successful developments in optical devices are examined, including band structure engineering, device structure optimization, and heterostructures. Furthermore, it introduces cutting&#8208;edge techniques and future directions for optoelectronic devices based on multilayer TMDs.

&lt;p&gt;Modifications to improve the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap transition metal dichalcogenides and their emerging applications in optoelectronic sensors are the focus of this review. Various engineering techniques are discussed to overcome their limitations derived from the indirect bandgap of multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides as well as future directions of these materials for optoelectronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique electrical and optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make them attractive nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications, especially optical sensors. However, the optical characteristics of these materials are dependent on the number of layers. Monolayer TMDs have a direct bandgap that provides higher photoresponsivity compared to multilayer TMDs with an indirect bandgap. Nevertheless, multilayer TMDs are more appropriate for various photodetection applications due to their high carrier density, broad spectral response from UV to near-infrared, and ease of large-scale synthesis. Therefore, this review focuses on the modification of the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap TMDs and their emerging applications. Several successful developments in optical devices are examined, including band structure engineering, device structure optimization, and heterostructures. Furthermore, it introduces cutting-edge techniques and future directions for optoelectronic devices based on multilayer TMDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The emergence of nano innovations in membrane distillation (MD) has garnered increasing scientific interest. This enabled the exploration of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nano&#8208;enabled MD membranes with desirable properties, which significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of the MD process and open up opportunities for achieving sustainable water&#8208;energy&#8208;environment (WEE) nexus. This comprehensive review provides broad coverage and in&#8208;depth analysis of recent innovations in nano&#8208;enabled MD membranes, focusing on their role in achieving desirable properties, such as strong liquid&#8208;repellence, high resistance to scaling, fouling, and wetting, as well as efficient self&#8208;heating and self&#8208;cleaning functionalities. The recent developments in nano&#8208;enhanced photothermal&#8208;catalytic applications for water&#8208;energy co&#8208;generation within a single MD system are also discussed. Furthermore, we identify the bottlenecks that impede the scale&#8208;up of nano&#8208;enhanced MD membranes and propose a future roadmap for their sustainable commercialization. This holistic overview is expected to inspire future research and development efforts to fully harness the potential of nano&#8208;enabled MD membranes to achieve sustainable integration of water, energy, and the environment.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Self&#8208;Assembled Hydroxyl Radical Generator Based on Photoinduced Cascade Electron Transfer for Hypoxic Tumor Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generators (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) that are activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, capable of forming nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The generation of &#8226;OH is accomplished with high efficiency through photoinduced cascade electron transfer pathways within the self&#8208;assembled molecular state. Consequently, ANOR&#8208;Cy5 exhibits exceptional efficacy in inducing photoablation of hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
The hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) is an extremely potent reactive oxygen species that plays a crucial role in photooxidations within the realm of hypoxic tumor therapy. However, the current methods for &#8226;OH photogeneration typically rely on inorganic materials that require UV/vis light excitation. Consequently, photogenerators based on organic molecules, especially those utilizing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation, are rare. In this study, the concept of photoinduced cascade charge transfer (PICET), which utilizes NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (ANOR&#8208;Cy5) to generate &#8226;OH is introduced. The ANOR&#8208;Cy5 photosensitizer, with its flexible hydrophobic structure, enables the formation of nanoparticles in aqueous solutions through molecular assembly. PICET involves a symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation&#8208;induced localized charge&#8208;separated state, transitioning to a delocalized charge&#8208;separated state, which governs the efficiency of &#8226;OH generation. Thanks to the oxygen&#8208;independent nature of &#8226;OH generation and its robust oxidative properties, the ANOR&#8208;Cy5&#8208;based photosensitizer demonstrates highly effective photoinduced anti&#8208;cancer effects, even under severely hypoxic conditions. This discovery emphasizes the potential for achieving &#8226;OH photogeneration using a single organic molecule through the engineering of molecular self&#8208;assembly, thereby opening up new possibilities for phototherapy and beyond.

         <title>Beyond Rattling: Tetrahedrites as Incipient Ionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In tetrahedrite, copper ions are mobile at temperatures of 200&#160;K or above, but confined to cages within the crystal structure. The localized diffusional jumps of the copper ions within a confined octahedral environment are effective at suppressing thermal conduction. This work reveals that tetrahedrite behaves as an incipient ionic conductor.








Abstract
Materials with ultralow thermal conductivity are crucial to many technological applications, including thermoelectric energy harvesting, thermal barrier coatings, and optoelectronics. Liquid&#8208;like mobile ions are effective at disrupting phonon propagation, hence suppressing thermal conduction. However, high ionic mobility leads to the degradation of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric materials under operating conditions due to ion migration and metal deposition at the cathode, hindering their practical application. Here, a new type of behavior, incipient ionic conduction, which leads to ultralow thermal conductivity, while overcoming the issues of degradation inherent in liquid&#8208;like materials, is identified. Using neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is demonstrated that in tetrahedrite, an established thermoelectric material with a remarkably low thermal conductivity, copper ions,&#160;although mobile above 200 K, are predominantly confined to cages within the crystal structure. Hence the undesirable migration of cations to the cathode can be avoided. These findings unveil a new approach for the design of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity, by exploring systems in which incipient ionic conduction may be present.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Magnetic MX3 Single&#8208;Chains (M = Cr, V and X = Cl, Br, I)</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic materials in reduced dimensions are not only excellent platforms for fundamental studies of magnetism, but they play crucial roles in technological advances. The discovery of intrinsic magnetism in monolayer two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals systems has sparked enormous interest, but the single&#8208;chain limit of one&#8208;dimensional magnetic van der Waals materials has been largely unexplored. Here, we report on a family of one&#8208;dimensional magnetic van der Waals materials with composition MX3 (M = Cr, V, and X = Cl, Br, I), prepared in fully&#8208;isolated fashion within the protective cores of carbon nanotubes. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies unique structures that differ from the well&#8208;known 2D honeycomb lattice MX3 structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal charge&#8208;driven reversible magnetic phase transitions.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Networks Meet Water: It's Complicated!</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robotics is a field of research that solves the challenges facing traditional robotics through the use of compliant materials such as liquid crystal networks (LCNs). However, LCNs face limitations when interacting with water. The relationship between LCNs and water is examined, the existing body of literature on LCNs as aquatic soft robots is discussed, and possible paths forward are discussed.








Abstract
Soft robots are composed of compliant materials that facilitate high degrees of freedom, shape&#8208;change adaptability, and safer interaction with humans. An attractive choice of material for soft robotics is crosslinked networks of liquid crystal polymers (LCNs), as they are responsive to a wide variety of external stimuli and capable of undergoing fast, programmable, complex shape morphing, which allows for their use in a wide range of soft robotic applications. However, unlike hydrogels, another popular material in soft robotics, LCNs have limited applicability in flooded or aquatic environments. This can be attributed not only to the poor efficiency of common LCN actuation methods underwater but also to the complicated relationship between LCNs and water. In this review, the relationship between water and LCNs is elaborated and the existing body of literature is surveyed where LCNs, both hygroscopic and non&#8208;hygroscopic, are utilized in aquatic soft robotic applications. Then the challenges LCNs face in widespread adaptation to aquatic soft robotic applications are discussed and, finally, possible paths forward for their successful use in aquatic environments are envisaged.

         <title>A Balance between Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Microgel Mechanics Governs Stem Cell Viability in Injectable Dynamic Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guest&#8208;host injectable microgel formulation strategy is introduced in which flowability and elasticity are tuned independently by modulating inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;microgel crosslinking. Flowability and elasticity represent conflicting constraints for injectable design, &#160;as they respectively govern injection protection and engraftment potential following injection. The balance between these parameters is systematically investigated and found to regulate stem cell viability during injection.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are increasingly explored for the delivery of cells to tissue. These materials exhibit both liquid&#8208;like properties, protecting cells from mechanical stress during injection, and solid&#8208;like properties, providing a stable 3D engraftment niche. Many strategies for modulating injectable hydrogels tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like material properties simultaneously, such that formulation changes designed to improve injectability can reduce stability at the delivery site. The ability to independently tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like properties would greatly facilitate formulation development. Here, such a strategy is presented in which cells are ensconced in the pores between microscopic granular hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels (microgels), where elasticity is tuned with static covalent intra&#8208;microgel crosslinks and flowability with mechanosensitive adamantane&#8208;cyclodextrin (AC) inter&#8208;microgel crosslinks. Using the same AC&#8208;free microgels as a 3D printing support bath, the location of each cell is preserved as it exits the needle, allowing identification of&#160;the mechanism driving mechanical trauma&#8208;induced cell death. The microgel AC concentration is varied to find the threshold from microgel yielding&#8208; to AC interaction&#8208;dominated injectability, and this threshold is exploited to fabricate a microgel with better injection&#8208;protecting performance. This delivery strategy, and the balance between intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;microgel properties it reveals, may facilitate the development of new cell injection formulations.

Abstract
Current research in the area of surgical mesh implants is somewhat limited to traditional designs and synthesis of various mesh materials, whereas meshes with multiple functions may be an effective approach to address long&#8208;standing challenges including postoperative complications. We herein present a bioresorbable electronic surgical mesh that offers high mechanical strength over extended timeframes, wireless post&#8208;operative pressure monitoring, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for the restoration of tissue structure and function. Study of materials and mesh layouts provides a wide range of tunability of mechanical, biochemical properties. Dissolvable dielectric composite with porous structure in a pyramidal shape enhances sensitivity of a wireless capacitive pressure sensor, and resistive microheaters integrated with inductive coils provide thermo&#8208;responsive drug delivery system for an antibacterial agent. In vivo evaluations demonstrate reliable, long&#8208;lived operation and effective treatment for abdominal hernia defects, by clear evidence of suppressed complications such as adhesion formation and infections.

         <title>Reconfigurable Cascaded Thermal Neuristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While the complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is the mainstream for the hardware implementation of neural networks, we explore an alternative route based on a new class of spiking oscillators we call &#8220;thermal neuristors&#8221;, which operate and interact solely via thermal processes. Utilizing the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition in vanadium dioxide, we demonstrate a wide variety of reconfigurable electrical dynamics mirroring biological neurons. Notably, inhibitory functionality is achieved just in a single oxide device, and cascaded information flow is realized exclusively through thermal interactions. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the neuristors, a detailed theoretical model is developed, which accurately reflects the experimental results. This study establishes the foundation for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient thermal neural networks, fostering progress in brain&#8208;inspired computing.

         <title>Suppressing Bulk Strain and Surface O2 Release in Li&#8208;rich Cathodes by Just Tuning the Li Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered oxides represent a prominent class of cathode materials extensively employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The structural degradation of layered cathodes causes the capacity decay during battery cycling, which is generally induced by anisotropic lattice strain in the bulk of the cathode particle and undesirable oxygen release at the surface. However, particularly in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here we construct a thin (1&#8208;nm) and coherent spinel&#8208;like phase on the surface of LLOs particle (LixMn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) to suppress bulk strain and surface O2 release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel&#8208;like phase hinders the surface O2 release by accommodating O2 inside the surface layer, while the trapped O2 in the bulk lattice impedes strain evolution by about 70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs cathodes. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability in bulk and surface leads to a significantly improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of about 99.5% after 100 cycles at a rate of 0.1 C. Our findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high&#8208;capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.

         <title>In Situ Formation of 2d Perovskite Seeding for Record&#8208;Efficiency Indoor Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
With 40% efficiency under room light intensity, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) would be promising power supplies for low&#8208;light applications, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and indoor electronics, should they become commercialized. Herein, &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is utilized to spontaneously form a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds for improved film uniformity, crystallization quality, and solar cell performance. It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10&#8208;fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small&#8208;area (0.09 cm2) perovskite solar cell achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large&#8208;area cells (1.00 cm2, and 2.56 cm2) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale&#8208;up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs (i&#8208;PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large&#8208;area printing technology.

         <title>Injection&#8208;on&#8208;skin Granular Adhesive for Interactive Human&#8208;machine Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Realization of interactive human&#8208;machine interfaces (iHMI) has been improved with development of soft tissue&#8208;like strain sensors beyond hard robotic exosuits, potentially allowing cognitive behavior therapy and physical rehabilitation for patients with brain disorders. Here, we report on a strain&#8208;sensitive granular adhesive inspired by the core&#8208;shell architectures of natural basil seeds for iHMI as well as human&#8208;metaverse interfacing. The granular adhesive sensor consists of easily fragmented hydro&#8208;micropellets as a core and tissue&#8208;adhesive catecholamine layers as a shell, satisfying great on&#8208;skin injectability, ionic&#8208;electrical conductivity, and sensitive resistance changes through reversible yet robust cohesion among the hydropellets. Particularly, it is found that the ionic&#8208;electrical self&#8208;doping of the catecholamine shell on hydrosurfaces leads to a compact ion density of the materials. Based on these physical and electrical properties of the sensor, it is demonstrated that successful iHMI integration with a robot arm in both real and virtual environments enable robotic control by finger gesture and haptic feedback. This study expresses benefits of using granular hydrogel&#8208;based strain sensors for implementing on&#8208;skin writable bioelectronics and their bridging into the metaverse world.

         <title>Polarization&#8208; and Gate&#8208;Tunable Optoelectronic Reverse in 2D Semimetal/Semiconductor Photovoltaic Heterostructure</title>

Abstract
Polarimetric photodetector can acquire higher resolution and more surface information of imaging targets in complex environments due to the identification of light polarization. To date, the existing technologies yet sustain the poor polarization sensitivity (&lt;10), far from market application requirement. Here, the photovoltaic detectors with polarization&#8208; and gate&#8208;tunable optoelectronic reverse phenomenon are developed based on semimetal 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 and ambipolar WSe2. The device exhibits gate&#8208;tunable reverse in rectifying and photovoltaic characters due to the directional inversion of energy band, yielding a wide range of current rectification ratio from 10&#8722;2 to 103 and a clear object imaging with 100 &#215; 100 pixels. Acting as a polarimetric photodetector, the polarization ratio (PR) value can reach a steady state value of &#8764;30, which is compelling among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D&#8208;based polarized detectors. The sign reversal of polarization&#8208;sensitive photocurrent by varying the light polarization angles is also observed, that can enable the PR value with a potential to cover possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8208;&#8734;&#8594;&#8208;1). This work develops a photovoltaic detector with polarization&#8208; and gate&#8208;tunable optoelectronic reverse phenomenon, making a significant progress in polarimetric imaging and multi&#8208;function integration applications.

         <title>A Multiscale, Dynamic Elucidation of Li Solubility in The Alloy And Metallic Plating Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;containing alloys and metallic deposits offer substantial Li+ storage capacities as alternative anodes to commercial graphite. However, the thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetically competitive mechanism between Li solubility in the solid solution and intermediate alloy&#8208;induced Li deposition remains debated, particularly across the multiple scales. The elucidation of the mechanism is rather challenging due to the dynamic alloy evolution upon the non&#8208;equilibrium, transient lithiation processes under coupled physical fields. Here, we comprehensively investigate influential factors governing Li solubility in the Li&#8208;Zn alloy as a demonstrative model, spanning from the bulk electrolyte solution to the ion diffusion within the electrode. Through real&#8208;time phase tracking and spatial distribution analysis of intermediate alloy/Li metallic species at varied temperatures, current densities and particle sizes, the driving force of Li solubility and metallic plating along the Li migration pathway are probed in&#8208;depth. This study investigates the correlation between kinetics (pronounced concentration polarization, miscibility gap in lattice grains) and rate&#8208;limiting interfacial charge transfer thermodynamics in dedicating the Li diffusion into the solid solution. Additionally, the lithiophilic alloy sites with the balanced diffusion barrier and Li adsorption energy are explored to favor the homogeneous metal plating, which provides new insights for the rational innovation of high&#8208;capacity alloy/metallic anodes.

         <title>Preparation of High Conductive Medium and Establishment of Laege Capacity Conductive Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The preparation of highly conductive media and the construction of conducting channels play a crucial role in improving the electrical conductivity of Electrically Conductive Adhesives (ECAs). Therefore, a new MXene structure is reported in this paper, and the improved structure is rationally designed by computational modeling, which greatly prevents the buildup of MXene nanosheets, improves the stability of the structure, and creates a wide electron transfer channel, and the capacitance contribution of this structure is up to 86.3%. By mixing MXene modified with Ag&#8208;plated copper powder in a quantitative relationship to form high conductive media, the electrical conductivity is largely improved and the defect of low electron transfer rate of conventional conductive fillers is broken. The potential value of high conductive media is largely exploited using high throughput and machine learning methods, and here we show that the resistivity has reached 9.668&#215;10&#8722;7 &#937;&#183;m. The first principles investigate the conductive channels and electron transfer pathways of high conductive media at the atomic level, further revealing the mechanism of action of high conductive media. This study is also the first report on the application of MXene to high conductive media.

         <title>18.6% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by a Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor Based on Benzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d&#8242;]bisthiazole</title>

Abstract
The limited selection of wide bandgap polymer donors for all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) is a bottleneck problem restricting their further development and remains poorly studied. Herein, a new wide bandgap polymer, namely PBBTz&#8208;Cl, was designed and synthesized by bridging the benzobisthiazole acceptor block and chlorinated benzodithiophene donor block with thiophene units for application as an electron donor in all&#8208;PSCs. PBBTz&#8208;Cl not only possessed a wide bandgap and deep energy levels, but also displayed strong absorption, high&#8208;planar structure, and good crystallinity, making it to be a promising candidate for application as polymer donor in organic solar cells. When paired with the narrow bandgap polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, a fibril&#8208;like morphology formed, which facilitated the exciton dissociation and charge transport, contributing to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.15% of the corresponding all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, when introducing another crystalline polymer acceptor BTP&#8208;2T2F into the PBBTz&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT host blend, the absorption ditch in the range of 600&#8211;750&#160;nm was filled, and the blend morphology was further optimized with the trap density reducing. As a result, the ternary blend all&#8208;PSCs achieved a significantly improved PCE of 18.60%, which is among the highest vales for all&#8208;PSCs to date.

         <title>A Simple and Versatile Approach for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Transition Metal Phosphide Nanoparticles from Metal Chloride Complexes and P(SiMe3)3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal chloride complexes react with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine under mild condition to produce metal phosphide nanoparticles, and chlorotrimethylsilane as a byproduct. The formation of Si&#8208;Cl bonds that are stronger than the starting M&#8208;Cl bonds acts as a driving force for the reaction. The potential of this strategy is illustrated through the preparation of ruthenium phosphide nanoparticles using [RuCl2(cymene)] and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine at 35&#176;C. Characterization with a combination of techniques including electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, evidences the formation of small (diameter of 1.3&#160;nm) and amorphous NPs with an overall Ru50P50 composition. Interestingly, these NPs can be easily immobilized on functional support materials, which is of great interest for potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. Mo50P50 and Co50P50 NPs could also be synthesized following the same strategy. This approach is simple and versatile and paves the way toward the preparation of a wide range of transition metal phosphide nanoparticles under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Dispersion Engineering by Hybridizing the Back&#8208;Folded Soft Mode of Monomode Elastic Metamaterials with Stiff Acoustic Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In many cases, the hybridization of two or more excitation modes in solids has led to new and useful dispersion relations of waves. Well&#8208;studied examples are phonon polaritons, plasmon polaritons, particle&#8208;plasmon polaritons, cavity polaritons, and magnetic resonances at optical frequencies. In all of these cases, the lowest propagating mode couples to a finite&#8208;frequency localized resonance. Herein, the unusual metamaterial phonon dispersion relations arising from the hybridization of an ordinary acoustical phonon mode with a back&#8208;folded soft or easy phonon mode of a monomode elastic metamaterial are discussed. Conceptually, the single easy mode can have strictly zero wave velocity. In reality, its wave velocity is very much smaller than that of all other modes. Considering polymeric 3D printed elastic monomode metamaterials at ultrasound frequencies, it is shown theoretically and experimentally that the resulting pronounced avoided crossing, with a frequency splitting comparable to the mid&#8208;frequency, leads to backward&#8208;wave behavior for the lowest band over a broad frequency range, conceptually at zero loss.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the hybridization of two or more excitation modes in solids has led to new and useful dispersion relations of waves. Well-studied examples are phonon polaritons, plasmon polaritons, particle-plasmon polaritons, cavity polaritons, and magnetic resonances at optical frequencies. In all of these cases, the lowest propagating mode couples to a finite-frequency localized resonance. Herein, the unusual metamaterial phonon dispersion relations arising from the hybridization of an ordinary acoustical phonon mode with a back-folded soft or easy phonon mode of a monomode elastic metamaterial are discussed. Conceptually, the single easy mode can have strictly zero wave velocity. In reality, its wave velocity is very much smaller than that of all other modes. Considering polymeric 3D printed elastic monomode metamaterials at ultrasound frequencies, it is shown theoretically and experimentally that the resulting pronounced avoided crossing, with a frequency splitting comparable to the mid-frequency, leads to backward-wave behavior for the lowest band over a broad frequency range, conceptually at zero loss.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sensitive and Selective Dual&#8208;Mode Responses to Reactive Oxygen Species by Chiral Manganese Dioxide Nanoparticles for Anti&#8208;Aging Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to oxidative stress and oxidative damage, which is one of the important factors for aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring and the moderate elimination of ROS is extremely important. In this study, a ROS&#8208;responsive circular dichroic (CD) at 553&#160;nm and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual&#8208;signals chiral manganese oxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) were designed and synthesized. Both the CD and MRI signals showed excellent linear ranges for intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.0027&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.016&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The lower LOD achieved with CD detection may be attributable to its higher anti&#8208;interference capability from the intracellular matrix. Importantly, ROS&#8208;induced cell aging was intervened by chiral MnO2 NPs via redox reactions with excessive intracellular ROS. In vivo experiments confirmed that chiral MnO2 NPs effectively eliminated ROS in skin tissue, reduce oxidative stress levels, and alleviate skin aging. This approach provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of age&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Stochastic Electrical Detection of Single Ion&#8208;Gated Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconducting polymer chains constitute the building blocks for a wide range of electronic materials and devices. However, most of their electrical characteristics at single&#8208;molecule level have received little attention. Elucidating these properties could help understanding performance limits and enable new applications. Here we exploit coupled ionic&#8208;electronic charge transport to measure the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional electrical current through long single conjugated polymer chains as they form transient contacts with electrodes separated by &#8764;10&#160;nm. Fluctuations between internal conformations of the individual polymers are resolved as abrupt, multi&#8208;level switches in the electrical current. This behavior is consistent with our theoretical simulations based on the worm&#8208;like&#8208;chain model for semi&#8208;flexible polymers. In addition to probing the intrinsic properties of single semiconducting polymer chains, our results provide an unprecedented window into the dynamics of random&#8208;coil polymers and enable the use of semiconducting polymers as electrical labels for single&#8208;molecule (bio)sensing assays.

         <title>Selective Interfacial Excited&#8208;State Carrier Dynamics And Efficient Charge Separation in Borophene&#8208;based Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Borophene&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures have demonstrated enormous potential in the realm of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, which has sparked a wide range of interest. However, a thorough understanding of the microscopic excited&#8208;state electronic dynamics at interfaces is lacking, which is essential for determining the macroscopic optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance of borophene&#8208;based devices. In this study, photoexcited carrier dynamics of &#946;12, &#967;3, and &#945;' borophene/MoS2 heterostructures have been systematically studied based on time&#8208;domain nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Different Schottky contacts are found in borophene/semiconductor heterostructures. The interplay between Schottky barriers, electronic coupling, and the involvement of different phonon modes collectively contribute to the unique carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures. The diverse borophene allotropes within the heterostructures exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors on an ultrafast timescale: electrons tunnel into &#945;&#900; borophene with an ultrafast transfer rate (&#8764; 29 fs) in &#945;&#900;/MoS2 heterostructures, whereas &#946;12 borophene only allows holes to migrate with a lifetime of 176 fs. The feature enables efficient charge separation and offers promising avenues for applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. This study provides insight into the interfacial carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures, which is helpful in further design of advanced 2D boron&#8208;based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Quantitative Description of Metal Center Organization and Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>

Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts (UHD&#8208;SACs) present unique opportunities for harnessing cooperative effects between neighboring metal centers. However, the lack of tools to establish correlations between the density, type, and arrangement of the isolated metal atoms with the support surface properties hinders efforts to engineer advanced material architectures. Here, we precisely describe the metal center organization in various mono&#8208; and multimetallic UHD&#8209;SACs based on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supports by coupling transmission electron microscopy with tailored machine&#8208;learning methods (released as a user&#8208;friendly web app) and density functional theory simulations. Our approach quantifies the non&#8208;negligible presence of multimers with increasing atom density, characterizes the size and shape of these low&#8209;nuclearity clusters, and identifies surface atom density criteria to ensure isolation. Further, it provides previously inaccessible experimental insights into coordination site arrangements in the NC host, uncovering a repulsive interaction that influences the disordered distribution of metal centers in UHD&#8208;SACs. This observation holds in multimetallic systems, where chemically&#8208;specific analysis quantifies the degree of intermixing. These fundamental insights into the materials chemistry of single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for designing catalytic systems with superior reactivity.

         <title>Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adaptive Polymers Trigger Fission of Tumor Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles for Enhanced Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor cell&#8208;derived microparticles (MPs) can function as anticancer drug delivery carriers. However, short blood circulation time, large size&#8208;induced insufficient tumor accumulation and penetration into tumor parenchyma as well as limited cellular internalization by tumor cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs), and difficult intracellular drug release restrict the anticancer activity of tumor cell&#8208;derived MP&#8208;based drug delivery systems. Here, hydrophobicity&#8208;adaptive polymers based on poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrilamide) are anchored to tumor cell&#8208;derived MPs for enhanced delivery of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The polymers are hydrophilic in blood to prolong the circulation time of DOX&#8208;loaded MPs (DOX@MPs), while rapidly switch to hydrophobic at the tumor acidic microenvironment. The hydrophobicity of polymers drives the fission of tumor cell&#8208;derived MPs to form small vesicles, facilitating tumor accumulation, deep tumor penetration and efficient internalization of DOX@MPs into tumor cells and CSCs. Subsequently, the hydrophobicity of polymers in acidic lysosomes further promotes DOX release to nuclei for strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells and CSCs. Our work provides a facile and simple strategy for improved anticancer drug delivery of tumor cell&#8208;derived MPs.

Rational selection and design of recombination electrodes (RCEs) are crucial to enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of monolithic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) with high conductivity and excellent transmittance is introduced as RCE in perovskite/organic TSCs. To prevent high&#8208;energy ITO particles destroy the underlying material during sputtering, dual&#8208;functional transport and protective layer (C1) is employed. The styryl group in C1 can be thermally crosslinked to serve as a sputtering protective layer. Meanwhile, the conjugated phenanthroline skeleton in C1 shows high electron mobility and hole blocking capability to promote the electron transport process at the interfaces and effectively reduce charge accumulation. Monolithic perovskite/organic TSC with high PCE of 24.07% and excellent stability is demonstrated by stacking a 1.77&#160;eV bandgap perovskite layer and a 1.35&#160;eV bandgap organic active layer. This strategy provides new insights for overcoming the fundamental efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices and promotes the further development of TSC devices.

         <title>Exciton Chirality Transfer Empowers Self&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Polarized Amplified Spontaneous Emission from 1D&#8208;Anchoring&#8208;3D Perovskites</title>

Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized lasers, arising from stimulated emission of imbalanced spin populations, play a vital role in spin&#8208;optoelectronics. The achievement of spin&#8208;polarized lasing remains a long&#8208;lasting challenge, which is usually tackled by external spin injection, inevitably suffering from additional losses across the barriers from injection sources to gain materials. Herein, we report self&#8208;triggered spin&#8208;polarized coherent light emission from designed composite chiral perovskites, where the imbalanced populations in achiral 3D perovskites are endowed with the spin selection of exciton chirality (EC) underpinned by chiral 1D perovskites. Efficient transfer of EC is enabled by rapid energy transfer from the chiral 1D perovskites to the achiral 3D perovskites, thereby creating an imbalance of the spin population of excited states in the achiral 3D perovskites. Stimulated emission of such populations brings self&#8208;triggered spin&#8208;polarized amplified spontaneous emission in the composite perovskites, yielding a higher degree of polarization (DOP) than that based on optical spin injection into bare achiral 3D perovskite. Chemical diversity of the composite perovskites not only enables to adjust the band gap of perovskites for broadband output of spin&#8208;polarized amplified spontaneous emission signals but also promises to manipulate radiative decay and spin relaxation toward remarkably increased values of DOP. These results highlight the importance of EC transfer mechanism for spin&#8208;polarized lasing and represent a crucial step towards the development of chiral&#8208;spintronics.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Liposomes Loaded with Monoclonal Antibodies Reduce Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation and Improve Behavioral Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold promise for treating Parkinson's disease (PD), but their therapeutic use is hindered by poor delivery to the brain. In this study, we demonstrate that brain&#8208;targeted liposomes (BTL) enhance the delivery of mAbs across the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and into neurons, thereby improving the intracellular and extracellular treatment of the PD brain. BTL were decorated with transferrin to improve brain targeting through overexpressed transferrin&#8208;receptors on the BBB during PD. The BTL were loaded with SynO4, a mAb that inhibits alpha&#8208;synuclein (AS) aggregation, a pathological hallmark of PD. We show that 100&#8208;nm BTL cross human BBB models intact and were taken up by primary neurons. Inside the neurons, SynO4 is released from the nanoparticles and binds to its target, thereby reducing AS aggregation and increasing neuronal viability. In&#8208;vivo, intravenous administration of BTL led to a 7&#8208;fold increase of mAbs in brain cells, reducing AS aggregation and neuroinflammation. In addition, BTL treatments improved behavioral motor function and learning ability in mice, with a favorable safety profile. Targeted nanotechnologies are promising platforms for delivering medicines to treat brain neurodegeneration.

         <title>Breath Biopsy Reveals Systemic Immunothrombosis and Its Resolution through Bioorthogonal Dendritic Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of immunothrombosis is an unmet medical need as it relates to prevalent and life&#8208;threatening conditions, including severe COVID&#8208;19&#160;and sepsis. A novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive nanoprobe releases a volatile reporter molecule, when in contact with thrombin. The volatile reporter exits the circulation in the lungs. Analysis of the exhaled breath provides unprecedented quantitative knowledge of thrombin activity in vivo.








Abstract
Immunothrombosis, an inflammation&#8208;dependent activation of the coagulation cascade, leads to microthrombi formations in small vessels. It is a dreaded complication of COVID&#8208;19&#160;and a major cause of respiratory failure. Due to their size and disseminated nature, microthrombi are currently undetectable. Here, noninvasive detection of a volatile reporter in the exhaled air is introduced for assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. A dendritic nanoprobe, containing high loading of a thrombin&#8208;sensitive substrate, is selectively cleaved by thrombin, resulting in release of a synthetic bioorthogonal volatile organic compound (VOC). The VOC is quantitated in the exhaled air biopsies via gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS), allowing near real&#8208;time assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. The VOC detection can be further improved with more rapid and sensitive MS&#8208;based technologies. The amount of the VOC in the exhaled air decreases with resolution of the microvascular inflammation and intravascular fibrin depositions. Through conjugation of the thrombin&#8208;sensitive peptide with a rhodol derivative, a novel thrombin&#8208;sensitive fluorescent nanoprobe is developed for intravital visualization of thrombin activity in actively growing thrombi. These results establish unprecedented detection of thrombin activity in vivo, addressing this unmet medical need. This novel approach facilitates diagnosis of immunothrombosis in diseases such as diabetic complications, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Reactions on Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions play a critical role in the synthesis of value&#8208;added products within the chemical industry. Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) using water as the hydrogen source has emerged as an alternative to conventional thermocatalytic processes for sustainable and decentralized chemical synthesis under mild conditions. Among various ECH catalysts, copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) nanomaterials are promising candidates due to their earth&#8208;abundance, unique electronic structure, versatility, and high activity/selectivity. Herein, recent advances in the application of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH reactions for the upgrading of valuable chemicals are systematically analyzed. The unique properties of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in ECH are initially introduced, followed by the design strategies to enhance their activity and selectivity. Then, typical ECH reactions on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are presented in detail, including carbon dioxide reduction for multicarbon generation, alkyne&#8208;to&#8208;alkene conversion, selective aldehyde conversion, ammonia production from nitrogen&#8208;containing substances, and amine production from organic nitrogen compounds. In these catalysts, we focus on the role of catalyst composition and nanostructures toward different products. The co&#8208;hydrogenation of two substrates (e.g., CO2 and NOxn, CO2 and SO32&#8211;, etc.) via C&#8211;N, C&#8211;S, and C&#8211;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions are also highlighted. Finally, the critical issues and future perspectives of Cu&#8208;catalyzed ECH are proposed to accelerate the rational development of next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <title>Fast Gas&#8208;Adsorption Kinetics in Supraparticle&#8208;Based MOF Packings with Hierarchical Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#160;adsorbents with a multilevel hierarchical pore structure consisting of interconnected pore networks at three distinct length scales (&gt;1000, &#8776;100, and &#8776;1 nm) exhibit efficient mass transport. These materials can be self&#8208;assembled using supraparticles formed with nanoscale ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles as intermediate building blocks and exhibit 30 times faster adsorption kinetics compared to their unstructured analogs.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high&#8208;throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass&#8208;transport limitations. In this work, this problem is addressed by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle&#8208;based approach. Spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles are fabricated by emulsion templating and they are used as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) particles are used as a model system and the gas&#8208;adsorption kinetics of the hierarchical material are compared with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. It is demonstrated that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate compared to an unstructured ZIF&#8208;8 powder pellet. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials. In the hierarchical MOFs, large macropores between the supraparticles, smaller macropores between individual ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles, and micropores inherent to the ZIF&#8208;8 framework collude to combine large surface area, defined adsorption sites, and efficient mass transport to enhance performance.

&lt;p&gt;Macroscopic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#160;adsorbents with a multilevel hierarchical pore structure consisting of interconnected pore networks at three distinct length scales (&amp;gt;1000, &#8776;100, and &#8776;1 nm) exhibit efficient mass transport. These materials can be self-assembled using supraparticles formed with nanoscale ZIF-8 primary particles as intermediate building blocks and exhibit 30 times faster adsorption kinetics compared to their unstructured analogs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high-throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass-transport limitations. In this work, this problem is addressed by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle-based approach. Spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles are fabricated by emulsion templating and they are used as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) particles are used as a model system and the gas-adsorption kinetics of the hierarchical material are compared with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. It is demonstrated that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate compared to an unstructured ZIF-8 powder pellet. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials. In the hierarchical MOFs, large macropores between the supraparticles, smaller macropores between individual ZIF-8 primary particles, and micropores inherent to the ZIF-8 framework collude to combine large surface area, defined adsorption sites, and efficient mass transport to enhance performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Scalable insights of zinc batteries for designing robust Zn&#8208;metal anodes with compatible preferred orientations are presented. Half&#8208; and full&#8208;cells performances are evaluated with commercial standards to compete with lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) technology is considered one of the promising candidates to complement the existing lithium&#8208;ion batteries for future large&#8208;scale high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage demands. The scientific literature reveals many efforts for the ZAB chemistries, materials design, and limited accounts for cell design principles with apparently superior performances for liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. However, along with the difficulty of forming robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases, the discrepancy in testing methods and assessment metrics severely challenges the realistic evaluation/comparison and commercialization of ZABs. Here, strategies to formulate reversible zinc anodes are proposed and specific cell&#8208;level energy metrics (100&#8722;500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and realistic long&#8208;cycling operations are realized. Stabilizing anode/electrolyte interfaces results in a cumulative capacity of 25 Ah cm&#8722;2 and Coulomb efficiency of &gt;99.9% for 5000 plating/stripping cycles. Using 1&#8211;10 Ah scale (&#8776;500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at cell level) solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air pouch cells, scale&#8208;up insights for Ah&#8208;level ZABs that can progress from lab&#8208;scale research to practical production are also offered.

         <title>Perspectives on the Novel Multifunctional Nerve Guidance conduits: From Specific Regenerative Procedures to Motor Function Rebuilding</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury potentially destroys the quality of life by inducing functional movement disorders and sensory capacity loss, which results in severe disability and substantial psychological, social, and financial burdens. Autologous nerve grafting has been commonly used as treatment in the clinic; however, its rare donor availability limits its application. A series of artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGC) with advanced architectures have also been proposed to promote injured peripheral nerve regeneration, which is a complicated process from axon sprouting to targeted muscle reinnervation. Therefore, exploring the interactions between sophisticated NGC complexes and versatile cells during each process including axon sprouting, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, nerve myelination, and muscle reinnervation is necessary. This review highlights the contribution of functional NGCs and the influence of microscale biomaterial architecture on biological processes of nerve repair. Progressive NGCs with chemical molecule induction, heterogeneous topographical morphology, electroactive, anisotropic assembly microstructure, and self&#8208;powered electroactive and magnetic&#8208;sensitive NGCs were also collected, and they are expected to be pioneering features in future multifunctional and effective NGCs.

         <title>Ultralow Roll&#8208;Off Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Using Engineered Carrier Injection Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLED) have attracted extensive attention due to their high color purity, solution&#8208;processability, and high brightness. Due to extensive efforts, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of QLED has approached the theoretical limit. However, because of the efficiency roll&#8208;off, the high EQE can only be achieved at relatively low luminance, hindering their application in high&#8208;brightness devices such as near&#8208;to&#8208;eye displays and lighting applications. Here, we report an ultralow roll&#8208;off QLEDs that is achieved by simultaneously blocking electron leakage and enhancing the hole injection, thereby shifting the recombination zone back to the emitting quantum dots (QDs) layer. These devices maintain EQE over 20.6% up to 1000 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 current density, dropping only by &#8764;5% from the peak EQE of 21.6%, which is the highest value ever reported for the bottom&#8208;emitting red QLEDs. Furthermore, the maximum luminance of the optimal device reached 320,000 cd&#183;m&#8722;2, 2.7 times higher than the control device (Lmax: 128,000 cd&#183;m&#8722;2). We also demonstrated a passive matrix QLED display panel with high brightness based on the optimized device structure. The proposed approach advances the potential of QLEDs to operate efficiently in high&#8208;brightness scenarios.

         <dc:description>
Multienzymic nanozymes are nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity. Multienzymic nanozymes have unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and responsive selectivity. The catalytic mechanism of multienzymic nanozymes is more complicated and elusive than single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the classification, regulating factors, rational design, and application of multienzymic nanozymes are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity are termed multienzymic nanozymes, and they&#160;have received increasing attention in recent years and hold huge potential to be applied in diverse fields, especially for biosensing and therapeutics. Compared to single enzyme&#8208;like nanozymes, multienzymic nanozymes offer various unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and environmentally responsive selectivity. Nevertheless, along with these merits, the catalytic mechanism and rational design of multienzymic nanozymes are more complicated and elusive as compared to single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the multienzymic nanozymes classification scheme based on the numbers/types of activities, the internal and external factors regulating the multienzymatic activities, the rational design based on chemical, biomimetic, and computer&#8208;aided strategies, and recent progress in applications attributed to the advantages of multicatalytic activities are systematically discussed. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development and application of multienzymatic nanozymes are suggested. This review aims to deepen the understanding and inspire the research in multienzymic nanozymes to a greater extent.

         <title>Activating Selenium Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se (abbreviated as &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se) is successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal method for advanced cathodes of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs). Benefiting from synergistic doping and amorphization strategy, the resulting &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se||Zn battery displays record&#8208;high capacity and exceptional cyclability. Such novel electrode chemistry of &#945;&#8208;Ru0.14Se with both intercalation/deintercalation and deposition/stripping mechanisms opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation ARZIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ARZIBs) are a promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage device by virtue of the superior safety and low cost of both the aqueous electrolyte and zinc&#8208;metal anode. However, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can provide both lightweight and compact size. Herein, a novel cathode chemistry based on amorphous Se doped with transition metal Ru that mitigates the resistive surface layer produced by the side reactions between the Se cathode and aqueous electrolyte is reported. This improvement can permit high volumetric capacity in this system. Distinct from the conventional conversion mechanisms between Se and ZnSe in Se||Zn cells, this strategy realizes synchronous proton and Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation in the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells. Moreover, an unanticipated Zn2+ deposition/stripping process in this system further contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of this new cathode chemistry. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells are found to deliver a record&#8208;high capacity of 721&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1/3472&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, and superior cycling stability of over 800 cycles with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle.

&lt;p&gt;Ru-doped amorphous Se (abbreviated as &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.14&lt;/sub&gt;Se) is successfully prepared via a facile hydrothermal method for advanced cathodes of aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ARZIBs). Benefiting from synergistic doping and amorphization strategy, the resulting &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.14&lt;/sub&gt;Se||Zn battery displays record-high capacity and exceptional cyclability. Such novel electrode chemistry of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.14&lt;/sub&gt;Se with both intercalation/deintercalation and deposition/stripping mechanisms opens new opportunities for next-generation ARZIBs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ARZIBs) are a promising next-generation energy-storage device by virtue of the superior safety and low cost of both the aqueous electrolyte and zinc-metal anode. However, their development is hindered by the lack of suitable cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can provide both lightweight and compact size. Herein, a novel cathode chemistry based on amorphous Se doped with transition metal Ru that mitigates the resistive surface layer produced by the side reactions between the Se cathode and aqueous electrolyte is reported. This improvement can permit high volumetric capacity in this system. Distinct from the conventional conversion mechanisms between Se and ZnSe in Se||Zn cells, this strategy realizes synchronous proton and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation/deintercalation in the Ru-doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells. Moreover, an unanticipated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition/stripping process in this system further contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of this new cathode chemistry. Consequently, the Ru-doped amorphous Se||Zn half cells are found to deliver a record-high capacity of 721&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/3472&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and superior cycling stability of over 800 cycles with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle. This reported work opens the door for new chemistries that can further improve the gravimetric and volumetric capacity of ARZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cholesterol Metabolic Regulated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF)&#8208;Based Biotuner for Antibody Non&#8208;Dependent Immunotherapy Tailored for Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile nanocarrier, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF)&#8208;based biotuner, regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism for bidirectionally blocking immune checkpoints to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive microenvironment. It synergizes with chemiexcited&#8208;PDT to enable effective immunotherapy and significantly inhibit glioblastoma growth. The biotuner is tailored to address the immunotherapeutic dilemma and metabolic characteristics of glioblastomas, providing new insights into the metabolically regulated immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioblastomas.








Abstract
The metabolic reprogramming of glioblastoma (GBM) poses a tremendous obstacle to effective immunotherapy due to its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In this work, a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) specifically designed for GBM immunotherapy is developed, taking advantage of the relatively isolated cholesterol metabolism microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS). The HOF&#8208;based biotuner regulates extra/intracellular cholesterol metabolism, effectively blocking the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) pathway and reducing 2B4 expression. This metabolically disrupts the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM and rejuvenates CD8+ T cells. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism regulation offers additional benefits in treating GBM invasion. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;initiated chemiexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT) is enhanced during the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and the biotuner can effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) and increase the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in GBM. By reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and bolstering chemiexcited&#8208;PDT, this approach invigorates efficient antibody non&#8208;dependent immunotherapy for GBM. This study provides a model for enhancing immunotherapy through cholesterol metabolism regulation and explores the feasibility of a &#8220;metabolic checkpoint&#8221; strategy in GBM treatment.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Discovery of Amorphous Fluorinated Polymer Electret with Improved Charge Stability for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new descriptor, solid&#8208;state ionization potential, is proposed to quantify the charging performance of amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using the descriptor and a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based model, 3 promising molecules are identified out of 1.17 million candidates via high&#8208;throughput screening. The 3 new polymers are successfully synthesized and experimentally validated to have excellent charge&#8208;trapping performance as electret materials.








Abstract
Electret materials are promising dielectric materials with trapped charges for various applications such as vibration energy harvesters and acoustic transducers. In the present work, ionization potential is discovered as the descriptor to quantify the charging performance for amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using this descriptor, high&#8208;throughput computations, and graph neural network models, 1&#160;176&#160;591 functional groups are screened on the cyclic transparent optical polymers (CYTOP), and 3 promising electrets are identified. The electrets are synthesized experimentally as 15 &#181;m&#8208;thick films. The films are able to keep their both bipolar surface potentials above &#177;3.1&#160;kV for over 1500 h and are estimated to have longevity of 146 years under 80&#160;&#176;C, achieving significant improvements on charging stability among CYTOP&#8208;based polymer electrets. The excellent bipolar charging performance can greatly enhance power generation capacity of electret&#8208;based vibration energy harvesters. This work also demonstrates the use of deep learning as a new paradigm for accelerating practical materials discovery.

         <title>Core Electron Count as a Versatile and Accurate New Descriptor for Sorting Mechanical Properties of Diverse Transition Metal Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;electron consideration of both valence electron concentration (VEC) and core electron count (CEC) is invoked in developing a distinct VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor to sort mechanical properties of diverse transition&#8208;metal compounds with higher accuracy and versatility compared to many other commonly used descriptors. A fresh path is thus opened for rational design and optimization of these compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal light&#8208;element compounds show superb mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties, and accurate descriptors are important to sorting targeted properties among this vast class of materials. Valence electron concentration (VEC) can track broad trends of mechanical properties, but this widely used descriptor suffers low accuracy with sorted data strongly scattered along trendlines, necessitating an improved sorting strategy. Here, elastic parameters from first&#8208;principles calculations are examined for 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMN) in cubic structure and 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal diborides (TMB2) in hexagonal structure and identify core electron count (CEC) of the solvent atoms as a new descriptor. Combined with VEC, the composite VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor exhibits greatly improved ability to sort elastic parameters of distinct TMN and TMB2 compounds. Unregulated property variations under the VEC description are well&#8208;captured by CEC, which tends to enhance ductility and reduce strength at fixed VEC and rising CEC. By invoking a full&#8208;electron consideration, the VEC&#8211;CEC descriptor accounts for the impact on bonding behaviors by both core and valence electrons with much&#8208;improved accuracy and versatility in sorting mechanical properties of diverse TM compounds compared to many other commonly used descriptors, opening a fresh path for rational design and optimization of TM compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.

         <title>Unleashing the Full Potential of Photo&#8208;Driven CO&#160;Hydrogenation to Light Olefins over Carbon&#8208;Coated CoMn&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light for converting syngas to light olefins. Through the coupling of photo&#8208;thermocatalysis and photocatalysis (between MnO and Co with carbon mediation), the catalyst unleashes the full potential of a photodriven reaction, achieving 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermal catalysis.








Abstract
As a nonpetroleum process, photodriven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis provides a practical approach for the synthesis of light olefins. However, maximizing the solar&#8208;energy conversion efficiency based on the design of the composite catalyst and understanding the catalytic mechanism remain challenging. Herein, a novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalyst, a C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed for the efficient conversion of syngas to light olefins under light irradiation. The CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst exhibits a CO conversion of 12.6% with a selectivity to light olefins of 36.5% under light irradiation, showing 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermocatalysis. Experimental characterizations as certain the CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst can be excited to generate photogenerated carriers under light irradiation and then the electron transfer to metallic Co to form electron&#8208;rich active sites with carbon mediation, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculation based on density functional theory reveal the unique roles of photogenerated carriers in promoting the adsorption and activation of CO molecules. This study demonstrates a feasible catalyst model to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light to produce the value&#8208;added chemical.

Electronic structure calculations are an essential complement to experiments to characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, simulating SACs with quantum chemistry approaches is not as simple as often thought. Unless a number of essential aspects are adequately considered, the predictive power of electronic structure calculations remains limited. This perspective discusses&#160;what aspects need to be included to perform a reliable simulation of SACs.








Abstract
Electronic structure calculations represent an essential complement of experiments to characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), consisting of isolated metal atoms stabilized on a support, but also to predict new catalysts. However, simulating SACs with quantum chemistry approaches is not as simple as often assumed. In this work,&#160;the essential factors that characterize a reliable simulation of SACs activity are examined. The Perspective focuses on the importance of precise atomistic characterization of the active site, since even small changes in the metal atom's surroundings can result in large changes in reactivity. The dynamical behavior and stability of SACs under working conditions, as well as the importance of adopting appropriate methods to solve the Schr&#246;dinger equation for a quantitative evaluation of reaction energies are addressed. The Perspective also focuses on the relevance of the model adopted. For electrocatalysis this must include the effects of the solvent, the presence of electrolytes, the pH, and the external potential. Finally, it is discussed how the similarities between SACs and coordination compounds may result in reaction intermediates that usually are not observed on metal electrodes. When these aspects are not adequately considered, the predictive power of electronic structure calculations is quite limited.

         <title>Confining Prepared Ultra&#8208;Small Nanozymes Loading Ato for Lung Cancer Catalytic Therapy/Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Nanozymes with inherent enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic properties combat malignant tumor progression via catalytic therapy, while the therapeutic efficacy still needs to be improved. In this work, we innovatively synthesized ultra&#8208;small platinum nanozymes (nPt) in confined domain of wormlike pore channel in gold nanobipyramidal&#8208;mesoporous silica dioxide nanocomposites, producing nanozyme carriers AP&#8208;mSi with photo&#8208;enhanced peroxidase ability. Afterwards, based on the prepared AP&#8208;mSi, the lung cancer nanozymes probe (AP&#8208;HAI) was ingeniously produced by removing SiO2 template, modifying HSA, and loading ATO as well as IR780. Under NIR light irradiation, inner AuP and IR780 collaborated for photothermal process, thus facilitating the peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic process of H2O2. Additionally, loaded atovaquone molecules (ATO), a cell respiration inhibitor, could impair tumor respiration metabolism and cause oxygen retention, hence enhancing IR780's PDT effectiveness. In a result, IR780's PDT property and nPt nanozymes' photo&#8208;enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like ability endowed probes a high ROS productivity, eliciting anti&#8208;tumor immune responses to destroy tumor tissue. Systematic studies revealed that the obvious ROS generation was obtained by the strategy of using nPt nanozymes and reducing oxygen consumption by ATO, which in turn enabled lung cancer synergetic catalytic therapy/ICD&#8208;based immunotherapy. The results of this work would provide theoretical justification for the practical use of photo&#8208;enhanced nanozyme probes.

         <title>Regulating Intramolecular Electron Transfer of Nickel&#8208;Based Coordinations through Ligand Engineering for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The integration of electronic effects into complexes for the construction of novel materials has not yet attracted significant attention in the field of energy storage. In the current study, eight one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nickel&#8208;based salicylic acid (SA) complexes, Ni&#8208;XSAs (X = pH, pMe, pMeO, mMe, pBr, pCl, pF, and pCF3), are prepared by ligand engineering. The coordination environments in the Ni&#8208;XSAs are explored using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The charge transfer of the complexes is modulated according to the difference in the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituents, in combination with frontier orbital theory. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) is used to investigate the effect of the substituent position on the electronic properties of the complexes. Ni&#8208;mMeSA exhibits better electrical conductivity than Ni&#8208;pMeSA. The electrochemical performance of Ni&#8208;mMeSA as an aqueous battery cathode is remarkably improved with a maximum energy density of 0.30 mWh cm&#8722;2 (125.00&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and a peak power density of 33.72&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 (14.03&#160;kW kg&#8722;1). This study provides ideas for the application of new coordination chemistry in the field of energy materials science.

         <title>Electrochemical and Biocatalytic Signal&#8208;Controlled Payload Release from a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), ZIF&#8208;8, which is stable at neutral and slightly basic pH values in aqueous solutions and destabilized/dissolved under acidic conditions w as loaded with a pH&#8208;insensitive fluorescent dye, rhodamine&#8208;B isothiocyanate, as a model payload species. Then, the MOF species w ere immobilized at an electrode surface. The local (interfacial) pH value w as rapidly decreased by means of an electrochemically stimulated ascorbate oxidation at +0.4&#160;V (Ag/AgCl/KCl). Oxygen reduction upon switching the applied potential to &#8722;0.8&#160;V, allowed to return the local pH to the neutral/basic pH, then stopping rapidly the release process. The developed method allowed electrochemical control over stimulated or inhibited payload release processes from the MOF. The pH variation proceeded in a thin film of the solution near the electrode surface. The switchable release process w as realized in a buffer solution and undiluted human serum. As the second option, the pH decrease stimulating the release process w as achieved upon an enzymatic reaction using esterase and ester substrate. This approach potentially allows the release activation controlled by numerous enzymes assembled in complex biocatalytic cascades. It is expected that related electrochemical or biocatalytic systems can represent novel signal&#8208;responding materials with the switchable features for delivering (bio)molecules within biomedical applications.

         <title>Theranostic Lipid Nanoparticles for Renal Cell Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological malignancy and represents a leading threat to healthcare. Recent years have seen a series of progresses in the early diagnosis and management of RCC. Theranostic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are increasingly one of the focuses in this field, because of their suitability for tumor targeting and multimodal therapy. LNPs can be precisely fabricated with desirable chemical compositions and biomedical properties, which closely match the physiological characteristics and clinical needs of RCC. Herein, a comprehensive review of theranostic LNPs is presented, emphasizing the generic tool nature of LNPs in developing advanced micro&#8208;nano biomaterials. It begins with a brief overview of the compositions and formation mechanism of LNPs, followed with an introduction to kidney&#8208;targeting approaches, such as passive, active, and stimulus responsive targeting. With examples provided, a series of modification strategies for enhancing the tumor targeting and functionality of LNPs were discussed. Thereafter, research advances on applications of these LNPs for RCC including bioimaging, liquid biopsy, drug delivery, physical therapy, and gene therapy are summarized and discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective. The final part highlights the milestone achievements of translation medicine, current challenges as well as future development directions of LNPs for the diagnosis and treatment of RCC.

         <title>Precisely Inhibiting Excessive Intestinal Epithelial Cell Apoptosis to Efficiently Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease with Oral Pifithrin&#8208;&#945; Embedded Nanomedicine (OPEN)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has seriously affected the life quality of patients. IBD develops due to excessive intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis, disrupting the gut barrier, colonizing harmful bacteria, and initiating persistent inflammation. The current therapeutic approaches that reduce inflammation are limited. Although IBD can be treated significantly by directly preventing IEC apoptosis, achieving this therapeutic approach remains challenging. Accordingly, we are the first to develop an oral pifithrin&#8208;&#945; (PFT&#945;, a highly specific p53 inhibitor) embedded nanomedicine (OPEN) to effectively treat IBD by inhibiting excessive IEC apoptosis. As a major hub for various stressors, p53 is a central determinant of cell fate, and its inhibition can effectively reduce excessive IEC apoptosis. The tailored OPEN can precisely inhibit the off&#8208;target and inactivation resulting from PFT&#945; entry into the bloodstream. Subsequently, it persistently targets IBD lesions with high specificity to inhibit the pathological events caused by excessive IEC apoptosis. Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first&#8208;line drugs 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.

Eventually, OPEN exerts a significant curative effect compared with the clinical first-line drugs 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and dexamethasone (DEX). Consequently, the OPEN therapeutic strategy provides new insights into comprehensive IBD therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multi&#8208;Sensing Platform Based on 2D Monoelement Germanane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;assisted fluorometric sensing platform based on CH3Ge&#8208;coated paper is developed. CH3Ge paper is suitable for sensing humidity as well as acidic and alkaline gases emitted by spoiled food to track its quality. Further, it is used for printing confidential information using a water inkjet printer and shows significant re&#8208;writability.








Abstract
Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl&#8208;functionalized germanane (CH3Ge) is developed for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Luminescence (red&#8211;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH3Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH3Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH3Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). To demonstrate real&#8208;time and on&#8208;the&#8208;spot testing, absorbed gas molecules are first precisely quantified by CH3Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH3Ge&#8208;paper&#8208;based sensor is integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. Finally, CH3Ge&#8208;based rewritable paper is applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.

2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase perovskite BDASnI4 is identified to be promising for constructing high&#8211;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). By developing interface and additive engineering strategies, BDASnI4 FETs achieve mobility of 1.61 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Moreover, the devices remain functional after being exposed to ambient conditions (temperature of 45 &#8451; and humidity of 45%) for over 150 h.&#160; 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites hold immense potential for the advancement of next&#8208;generation field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the instability of perovskite&#8208;based transistors has impeded their progress and practical applications. Here, ambient&#8208;stable high&#8208;performance FETs based on 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson phase tin halide perovskite BDASnI4, which has high film quality and excellent electrical properties, are reported. The perovskite channels are established by engineering the film crystallization process via the employment of ammonium salt interlayers and the incorporation of NH4SCN additives within the precursor solution. The refined FETs demonstrate field&#8208;effect hole mobilities up to 1.61 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio surpassing 106. Moreover, the devices show impressive operational and environmental stability and retain their functional performance even after being exposed to ambient conditions with a temperature of 45 &#176;C and humidity of 45% for over 150 h.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Assemblable Bespoke Scaffold as a Versatile Microcryogel Carrier for Site&#8208;Specific Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE) can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so surgeons can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. This simple and cost&#8208;effective patient&#8208;specific implant reduces the healthcare system burden.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing have led to diverse patient&#8208;specific implant designs utilizing computed tomography, but this requires intensive work and financial implications. Here, Digital Light Processing is used to fabricate a hive&#8208;structured assemblable bespoke scaffold (HIVE). HIVE can be manually assembled in any shape/size with ease, so a surgeon can create a scaffold that will best fit a defect before implantation. Simultaneously, it can have site&#8208;specific treatments by working as a carrier filled with microcryogels (MC) incorporating different biological factors in different pockets of HIVE. After characterization, possible site&#8208;specific applications are investigated by utilizing HIVE as a versatile carrier with incorporated treatments such as growth factors (GF), bioceramic, or cells. HIVE as a GF&#8208;carrier shows a controlled release of bone morphogenetic protein/vascular endothelial growth factor (BMP/VEGF) and induced osteogenesis/angiogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)/human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, as a bioceramic&#8208;carrier, HIVE demonstrates enhanced mineralization and osteogenesis, and as a HUVEC carrier, it upregulates both osteogenic and angiogenic gene expression of hMSCs. HIVE with different combinations of MCs yields a distinct local effect and successful cell migration is confirmed within assembled HIVEs. Finally, an in vivo&#160;rat subcutaneous implantation demonstrates site&#8208;specific osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

         <title>Directional Shunting of Photogenerated Carriers in POM@MOF for Promoting Nitrogen Adsorption and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 composite is prepared by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction, which realizes an effective photocatalyst for storing and relaying oxidation N2 by inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers under mild conditions. The Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits the high N2 adsorption capacity (250.5&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1) and superior N2 oxidation performance to produce HNO3 (702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1).








Abstract
The efficient catalysis of nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing products plays a crucial role in the N economic cycle. However, weak N2 adsorption and invalid N2 activation remain two major bottlenecks in rate&#8208;determining steps, leading to low N2 fixation performance. Herein, an effective dual active sites photocatalyst of polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is highlighted via altering coordination microenvironment and inducing directional shunting of photogenerated carriers to facilitate N2/catalyst interaction and enhance oxidation performance. MOFs create more open unsaturated metal cluster sites with unoccupied d orbital possessing Lewis acidity to accept electrons from the 3&#963;g bonding orbital of N2 for storage by combining with POMs to replace bidentate linkers. POMs act as electron sponges donating electrons to MOFs, while the holes directional flow to POMs. The hole&#8208;rich POMs with strong oxidation capacity are easily involved in oxidizing adsorbed N2. Taking UiO&#8208;66 (C48H28O32Zr6) and Mo72Fe30 ([Mo72Fe30O252(CH3COO)12{Mo2O7(H2O)}2{H2Mo2O8(H2O)}(H2O)91]&#183;150H2O) as an example, Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 shows twofold enhanced adsorption of N2 (250.5&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) than UiO&#8208;66 (122.9&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1) at P/P0&#160;=&#160;1. And, the HNO3 yield of Mo72Fe30@UiO&#8208;66 is 702.4&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;7&#160;times and 24 times higher than UiO&#8208;66 and Mo72Fe30. This work provides reliable value for the storage and relaying artificial N2 fixation.

         <title>Toward Chiral Lasing from All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite&#8208;Nanocrystal&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Crystal Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing membrane consisting of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) layers is demonstrated. Two CLCs layers with same helical structure act as reflectors to construct a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. The selective reflection of CLCs leads to polarization selectivity. The membrane device is highly flexible and all&#8208;solution&#8208;processable and exhibits a high dissymmetry factor of 1.4.








Abstract
Circularly polarized (CP) coherent light sources are of great potential for various advanced optical applications spanning displays/imaging to data processing/encryption and quantum communication. Here, the first demonstration of CP amplified spontaneous emission (ASE)/lasing from a free&#8208;standing and flexible membrane device is reported. The membrane device consists of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) and cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)&#160;layers sandwiched within a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (F&#8211;P) cavity architecture. The chiral liquid crystal cavity enables the generation of CP light from the device. The device is completely solution&#8208;processable and displays CP ASE with record dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 1.4, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher as compared with glum of CP luminescence of chiral ligand&#8208;capped colloidal PNCs. The device exhibits ultraflexibility as the ASE intensity remains unchanged after repeated 100 bending cycles and it is stable for more than 3 months with 80% of its original intensity. Furthermore, the ultraflexibility enables the generation of ASE from various objects of different geometric surfaces covered with the flexible perovskite membrane device. This work not only demonstrates the first CP ASE from a PNCs membrane with extremely high glum but also opens the door toward the fabrication of ultraflexible, extremely stable, and all solution&#8208;processable perovskite chiral laser devices.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases and Hyaluronan Synthase: A Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal dual&#8208;bionic nanozyme (MPMP), mimicking antioxidases and hyaluronan synthase, is developed for effective osteoarthritis (OA) therapy, which can produce heat, scavenge free radical and promote chondrogenesis even if under inflammatory conditions. This nanozyme regulates anabolic and catabolic processes simultaneously, thereby restoring joint homeostasis effectively and demonstrating an admirable photothermally therapeutic&#160; effect on OA.








Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8208;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, a dual&#8208;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) is constructed to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowers the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8208;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contribute to eliminating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;2&#8211;/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, the MPMP nanozyme triggers thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promotes the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating NF&#8208;&#954;B/IL&#8208;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8208;NIR shows HAS&#8208;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (twofold) and extracellular (3.12&#8208;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8208;NIR demonstrates superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% of reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% of reduction), and ACAN expression (2.70&#8208;fold of increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8208;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Observation of Phonon Polaritons in Wafer&#8208;Scale Multilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared nanoimaging reveals propagating phonon polaritons on wafer&#8208;scale nanometer&#8208;thick hexagonal boron nitride grown by chemical vapor deposition. The material quality allows for the fabrication of phonon polariton nanoresonators with quality factors comparable to those fabricated from exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride, paving the way for wafer&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Polaritons in layered materials (LMs) are a promising platform to manipulate and control light at the nanometer scale. Thus, the observation of polaritons in wafer&#8208;scale LMs is critically important for the development of industrially relevant nanophotonics and optoelectronics applications. In this work, phonon polaritons (PhPs) in wafer&#8208;scale multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition are reported. By infrared nanoimaging, the PhPs are visualized, and PhP lifetimes of &#8776;0.6&#160;ps are measured, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. Further, PhP nanoresonators are demonstrated. Their quality factors of &#8776;50 are about 0.7 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices based on exfoliated hBN. These results can enable PhP&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Driven Tribo&#8208;Electrophoresis Enabled Human&#8211;Droplet Interaction in 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel human&#8211;droplet interaction platform rooted in the TEP approach is demonstrated, eliminating the need for complex electrodes and external power sources. By employing a well&#8208;designed triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer, precise and flexible manipulation of droplets in 3D space is achieved through human motion, fostering enhanced synergy and flexibility between humans and droplets.








Abstract
Electronically controlled droplet manipulation has widespread applications in biochemistry, life sciences, and industry. However, current technologies such as electrowetting, electrostatics, and surface charge printing rely on complex electrode arrays and external power supplies, leading to inefficient manipulation. In light of these limitations, a novel method is proposed, which&#160;leverages tribo&#8208;electrophoresis (TEP) to pipette in an oil medium, thereby enabling human&#8211;droplet interactions to be constructed with greater efficiency. The approach involves the rational design of a triboelectric nanogenerator&#8211;electrostatic tweezer&#160;that generates an electric field to charge the droplet and improves the maneuverability of the charged droplet, including aligned/non&#8208;aligned pipetting and stable transport in the clamped state, which can be accomplished solely by hand motion. The TEP method not only provides droplets with freedom to move in three dimensions but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non&#8208;invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8211;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.

The TEP method not only provides droplets with freedom to move in three dimensions but also offers a feasibility case for chemical reactions in the liquid phase and non-invasive sample extraction. This breakthrough establishes a cornerstone for human&#8211;droplet interactions capitalized on triboelectric nanogenerators, opening new avenues for research in droplet manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>UV&#8208;Curing&#8208;Enhanced Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy to enhance long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing is reported, by which amorphous organic LPL materials show broader application prospects.








Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, where the luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, a universal strategy is proposed to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8211;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing a generation of materials with highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area, and &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, nondestructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Cosmetic Contact Lenses for Ocular Surface Disease Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor Prussian blue family nanozymes with antioxidant abilities are embedded into cosmetic contact lenses to prevent ocular surface diseases, minimize potential safety risks, and protect corneas from external stimulation and underlying systemic diseases via reactive oxygen species scavenging.








Abstract
Efficiently balancing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by various factors on the ocular surface is a promising strategy for preventing the development of ocular surface diseases (OSDs). Nevertheless, the conventional topical administration of antioxidants is limited in efficacy due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and irreversible depletion, which impede their performance. To address this issue, contact lenses embedded with antioxidant nanozymes that can continuously scavenge ROS, thereby providing an excellent preventive effect against OSDs are developed. Specifically, Prussian blue family nanozymes are chosen based on their multiple antioxidant enzyme&#8208;like activities and excellent biocompatibility. The diverse range of colors made them promising candidates for the development of cosmetic contact lenses (CCLs) as a substitute for conventional pigments. The efficacy of nanozyme&#8208;CCLs is demonstrated in rabbits and rats exposed to a high risk of developing OSDs. These OSDs' prevention nanozyme&#8208;CCLs can pave the way for CCLs toward powerful wearable biomedical devices and provide novel strategies for the rational utilization of nanomaterials in clinical practice.

         <title>Grain Boundary Elimination via Recrystallization&#8208;Assisted Vapor Deposition for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor deposition method in combination with a solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization technique is presented to fabricate high&#8208;quality larger&#8208;area perovskite film. Efficiency of 19.9% is achieved, which is among the highest values ever reported for minimodules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor deposition is a promising technology for the mass production of perovskite solar cells. However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor&#8208;deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top&#8208;down crystallization mechanism. Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent&#8208;assisted recrystallization for fabricating high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small&#8208;area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large&#8208;area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain &gt;92% of their initial efficiencies after 200&#160;h of continuous operation.

         <title>Synergizing Spatial Confinement and Dual&#8208;Metal Catalysis to Boost Sulfur Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Fish&#8208;in&#8208;net&#8221; encapsulation of sulfur nanoparticles in an ordered metal&#8211;organic framework is reported as an efficient strategy for overcoming the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This approach results in long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption, and decent multistep catalytic conversion, thereby significantly improving the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and sulfur conversion rate.








Abstract
Sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions severely impede lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery operation; resolving these issues can enhance the capacity retention and cyclability of Li&#8211;S cells. Therefore, an effective strategy featuring core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Co/Ni bimetal&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/sulfur nanoparticles is reported herein for addressing these problems; this approach offers unprecedented spatial confinement and abundant catalytic sites by encapsulating sulfur within an ordered architecture. The protective shells exhibit long&#8208;term stability, ion screening, high lithium&#8208;polysulfide adsorption capability, and decent multistep catalytic conversion. Additionally, the delocalized electrons of the MOF endow the cathodes with superior electron/lithium&#8208;ion transfer ability. Via multiple physicochemical and theoretical analysis, the resulting synergistic interactions are proved to significantly promote interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, facilitate sulfur conversion dynamics, and inhibit shuttling. The assembled Li&#8211;S batteries deliver a stable, highly reversible capacity with marginal decay (0.075% per cycle) for 400 cycles at 0.2 C, a pouch&#8208;cell areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 200 cycles under a high sulfur loading, as well as remarkably improved pouch&#8208;cell performance.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads with Flexible Spacers: Deciphering Complex Photophysics for Targeted Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads are deciphered for practical use in materials science. In solution, fluorescent exciplexes are formed only for the short spacer (n = 4). Upon freezing, emissive static charge transfer (CT) complexes are formed for all spacer lengths. The molecular solids are stimuli&#8208;responsive, showing on/off fluorescence switching (n &gt; 4) or change of the emission color (n = 4).








Abstract
The complex photokinetics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triads with varying flexible spacer lengths (n = 4&#8211;10 carbon atoms) are investigated in liquid and solid solution, as well as in crystals, by steady&#8208;state and transient fluorescence spectroscopy combined with computational studies. For the short spacer (n = 4) in a liquid solution, dynamic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state formation with subsequent, efficient exciplex emission is observed, effectively competing with quenching through electron transfer (eT) via a radical ion pair. In a solid solution, a fluorescent CT static complex is formed upon freezing for all spacer lengths. This allows the observations of a former seminal report on stimuli&#8208;responsive high&#8208;contrast fluorescence on/off switching in films of the triads to be reassigned (Adv. Mater. 2012, 24, 5487), now providing a holistic picture on varying spacer length. In fact, external stimuli of the film by modulating the geometry of the CT complex, which results in on/off fluorescence switching (for n &gt; 4) or in a change of the emission color (n = 4). The work thus demonstrates how in&#8208;depth analysis of complex photophysics can be put to practical use in materials science.

Mater. 2012, 24, 5487), now providing a holistic picture on varying spacer length. In fact, external stimuli of the film by modulating the geometry of the CT complex, which results in on/off fluorescence switching (for &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 4) or in a change of the emission color (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4). The work thus demonstrates how in-depth analysis of complex photophysics can be put to practical use in materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identifying a Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal activity descriptor (orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy) is successfully extracted from various materials&#8217; physicochemical properties for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions in multiple electrolytes. Systematic experiments and computations reveal the life&#8208;cycle HER and OER mechanisms and identify the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory as a powerful mechanism analysis tool and foundation.








Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) is not yet developed. Moreover, a unifying concept is not yet established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over ten representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides are rationally bridged through statistical methodologies. The orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8776;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in the OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in the HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in the OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>Flash&#8208;Thermal Shock Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Toward High&#8208;Performance Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flash&#8208;thermal shock (FTS)&#8208;driven synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles on carbon nanofibers and other 2D materials is presented. In particular, the FTS method merits scalability (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2), rapid synthesis (&gt;1800 &#160;&#176;C within 20 ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1), and ambient air processing. To prove their practical utility, high electrocatalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) provide unprecedented physicochemical properties over unary nanoparticles (NPs). According to the conventional alloying guideline (Hume&#8211;Rothery rule), however, only size&#8208;and&#8208;structure similar elements can be mixed, limiting the possible combinations of alloying elements. Recently, it has been reported that based on carbon thermal shocks (CTS) in a vacuum atmosphere at high temperature, ultrafast heating/cooling rates and high&#8208;entropy environment play a critical role in the synthesis of HEAs, ruling out the possibility of phase separation. Since the CTS requires conducting supports, the Joule&#8208;heating efficiencies rely on the carbon qualities, featuring difficulties in uniform heating along the large area. This work proposes a photo&#8208;thermal approach as an alternative and innovative synthetic method that is compatible with ambient air, large&#8208;area, remote process, and free of materials selection. Single flash irradiation on carbon nanofibers induced momentary high&#8208;temperature annealing (&gt;1800&#160;&#176;C within 20&#160;ms duration, and ramping/cooling rates &gt;104 K&#160;s&#8722;1) to successfully decorate HEA NPs up to nine elements with excellent compatibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis (6.0 &#215; 6.0 cm2 of carbon nanofiber paper). To demonstrate their feasibility toward applications, senary HEA NPs (PtIrFeNiCoCe) are designed and screened, showing high activity (&#951;overall = 777&#160;mV) and excellent stability (&gt;5000 cycles) at the water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Controlling Crystallization Kinetics Simultaneously for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that the TFFH additive can inhibit the oxidation of I&#8722;, eliminating I0, Pb0, and uncoordinated Pb2+ defects and control crystallization kinetics by the strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics mean the optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility and stability, and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux.








Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed; however, defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to the reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. In this work, fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) is introduced to stabilize precursor solution and improve crystallization dynamics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The TFFH stabilizes the precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722;, and passivates undercoordinated Pb2+ by interacting with the Pb&#9472;I framework. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics and in situ defect passivation due to the presence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#9472;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallization dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, fewer defects and more efficient charge extraction in PSCs. The optimized PSCs achieve improved reproducibility and better stability and reach an efficiency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurfaces without the Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing metasurface based on orthogonal phase encoding is demonstrated to implement a near&#8208;field optical router. Bragg diffraction, which plays a vital role in traditional volume holography,is replaced by mode&#8208;matching surface waves, resulting in the realization of ultrathin metadevices. The method facilitates further development of an additional degree of freedom in the field of photonic multiplexing.








Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the 2D nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in 3D space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the 2D design. An example of code&#8208;based all&#8208;optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which can find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Constructing Chiral Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional chiral covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (CityU&#8208;7 and CityU&#8208;8) have been developed for the detection of circularly polarized light, where both samples exhibited distinguishable photoresponse toward left&#8208;handed and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (at 405&#160;nm).








Abstract
The use of chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active elements in photodetectors to directly identify circularly polarized light (CPL) can meet the requirement of integration and miniaturization of the as&#8208;fabricated devices. Herein, the design and synthesis of two isoreticular chiral two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs (CityU&#8208;7 and CityU&#8208;8) by introducing photosensitive porphyrin&#8208;based amines (5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin) to enhance the optical absorption and chiral aldehyde linkage (2,5&#8208;bis((S/R))&#8208;2&#8208;methylbutoxy)terephthalaldehyde) to engender chirality for direct CPL detection &#160;are&#160; reported. Their crystalline structures &#160;were&#160; confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and low&#8208;dose transition electron microscopy. Employing both chiral COFs as the active layers in photodetectors, left&#8208;handed circularly (LHC) and right&#8208;handed circularly (RHC) polarized light at 405&#160;nm can be well distinguishable with short response time, high responsivity, and satisfying detectivity. The study provides the first example on the design and synthesis of chiral COFs for direct detection of CPL.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Ferromagnetic Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Programmed Dual&#8208;Anisotropy and Multi&#8208;Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic liquid crystal elastomer (magLCE) ink whose nematic order and magnetization can be independently programmed to be anisotropic via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform is reported. The 3D&#8208;printed magLCE provides designable multimodal shape morphing under different stimuli, which is promising for wireless soft robots and intelligent devices.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and magnetic soft materials are promising active materials in many emerging fields, such as soft robotics. Despite the high demand for developing active materials that combine the advantages of LCE and magnetic actuation, the lack of independent programming of the LCE nematic order and magnetization in a single material still hinders the desired multi&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization is developed that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as &#8220;dual anisotropy&#8221;, via a customized 3D&#8208;printing platform. The magLCE ink is fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic microparticles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D&#8208;printing platform is created by integrating a magnet with 3&#8208;DoF motion into an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo&#8208;heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. A programmed magLCE strip robot is demonstrated with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi&#8208;actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multistable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Like Stretchable Nanocomposite Using Locally&#8208;Bundled Nanowires for Skin&#8208;Mountable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable nanocomposite with metal&#8208;like conductivity and high stretchability is proposed. When the nanocomposite is solidified in the highly humid air, silver nanowires are locally&#8208;bundled, minimizing contact resistance. Treatment of dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol improves conductivity further to &#8776;120 000 S cm&#8722;1 while attaining high stretchability of &#8776;200% for skin&#8208;mountable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable conductive nanocomposites have been intensively studied for wearable bioelectronics. However, development of nanocomposites that simultaneously feature metal&#8208;like conductivity(&gt; 100 000 S cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&gt; 100%) for high&#8208;performance skin&#8208;mountable devices is still extremely challenging. Here&#160;a material strategy for such a nanocomposite is&#160;presented by using local bundling of silver nanowires stabilized with dual ligands (i.e., 1&#8208;propanethiols and 1&#8208;decanethiols). When the nanocomposite&#160;is&#160;solidified via solvent evaporation under a highly humid condition, the nanowires in the organic solution are bundled and stabilized. The resulting locally&#8208;bundled nanowires lower contact resistance while maintain their percolation network, leading to high conductivity. Dual ligands of 1&#8208;propanethiol and 1&#8208;decanethiol further boost up the conductivity. As a result, a nanocomposite with both high conductivity of &#8776;122,120 S cm&#8722;1 and high stretchability of &#8776;200% is obtained. Such superb electrical and mechanical properties are critical for various applications in skin&#8208;like electronics, and&#160;herein, a wearable thermo&#8208;stimulation device is demonstrated.

         <title>Regulating Exciton De&#8208;Trapping of Te4+&#8208;Doped Zero&#8208;Dimensional Scandium&#8208;Halide Perovskite for Fluorescence Thermometry with Record High Time&#8208;Resolved Thermal Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive fluorescence thermometer is developed by Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O engineering. The rapid de&#8208;trapping process of self&#8208;trapped excitons induced by the soft lattice results in a record high thermal sensitivity for the lifetime&#8208;based detection, reaching up to 27.36% K&#8722;1 at 325 K, with the temperature uncertainty below 0.1 K, enabling remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components.








Abstract
Fluorescence thermometry has been propelled to the forefront of scientific attention due to its high spatial resolution and remote non&#8208;invasive detection. However, recent generations of thermometers still suffer from limited thermal sensitivity (Sr) below 10% change per Kelvin. Herein, this work presents an ideal temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence material through Te4+&#8208;doped 0D Cs2ScCl5&#183;H2O, in which isolated polyhedrons endow highly localized electronic structures, and the strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling facilitates the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). With rising temperature, the dramatic asymmetric expansion of the soft lattice induces increased defects, strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, and low thermal activation energy, which evokes a rapid de&#8208;trapping process of STEs, enabling several orders of magnitude changes in the fluorescence lifetime over a narrow temperature range. After regulating the de&#8208;trapping process with different Te4+ doping, a record&#8208;high Sr (27.36% K&#8722;1) of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based detection is achieved at 325 K. The robust stability against multiple heating/cooling cycles and long&#8208;term measurements enables a low temperature uncertainty of 0.067 K. Further, the developed thermometers are demonstrated for the remote local monitoring of operating temperature on internal electronic components. It is believed that this work constitutes a solid step towards building the next generation of ultrasensitive thermometers based on low&#8208;dimensional metal halides.

         <title>Inhibited Grain Growth Through Phase Transition Modulation Enables Excellent Mechanical Properties in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers up to 1700&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase transition modulation strategy is proposed to prepare oxide ceramic nanofibers, which are featured by inhibited grain growth at high temperatures. As a result, a strikingly high average tensile strength of 1.02&#160;GPa is achieved at 1700&#160;&#176;C, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramics for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Oxide ceramics are widely used as thermal protection materials due to their excellent structural properties and earth abundance. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), the explosive growth of grain size causes irreversible damage to the microstructure of oxide ceramics, thus exhibiting poor thermomechanical stability. This problem, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, remains a great challenge for oxide ceramic materials. Here, a novel strategy of phase transition modulation is proposed to control the grain growth at high temperatures in oxide ceramic nanofibers, realizing effective regulation of the crystalline forms as well as the size uniformity of primary grains, and thus suppressing the malignant growth of the grains. The resulting oxide ceramic nanofibers have excellent mechanical strength and flexibility, delivering an average tensile strength as high as 1.02&#160;GPa after being exposed to 1700&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min, and can withstand thousands of flexural cycles without obvious damage. This work may provide new insight into the development of advanced oxide ceramic materials that can serve in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments with long&#8208;term durability.

&lt;p&gt;A phase transition modulation strategy is proposed to prepare oxide ceramic nanofibers, which are featured by inhibited grain growth at high temperatures. As a result, a strikingly high average tensile strength of 1.02&#160;GPa is achieved at 1700&#160;&#176;C, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramics for reliable thermal protection in extremely high-temperature environments.

         <title>Universal Strategy of Efficient Intracellular Macromolecule Directional Delivery Using Photothermal Pump Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal pump patch is proposed as a universal structure for a highly efficient, non&#8208;destructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule directional delivery. It is based on poly(dimethyl siloxane) photothermal expansion&#8208;driven pore shrinkage, which directionally delivers macromolecules into the cell to improve intracellular delivery efficiency. It is also suitable for transdermal intracellular delivery and has broad potential in the fields of cell/gene therapy.








Abstract
The development of a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable universal delivery strategy of therapeutic macromolecules into desired cells and tissues is very challenging. Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; is reported. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while &#8220;exogenous molecular reservoirs&#8221; shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high&#8208;efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high&#8208;efficiency, nondestructive, and in&#8208;vitro/vivo&#8208;applicable macromolecule delivery.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Anode&#8208;Free Batteries Enabled by Li Compensation Coupled Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of Li2S as a Li supplement and interfacial promoter facilitates efficient Li compensation coupled interface strengthening against irreversible Li loss, enabling a durable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free battery with long life, high energy, and remarkable safety.








Abstract
Initially, anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges the high production feasibility of Li&#8208;ion batteries with the superb energy capabilities of Li&#8208;metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero&#8208;Li&#8208;excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. A Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy is reported for realizing long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries. The Li2S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry. Meanwhile, it demonstrates remarkable efficacy in establishing a robust yet slender inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid solid&#8208;state interphase for inhibiting cell degradation by dead and dendritic Li. This strategy enables quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries with a long lifespan of 500 cycles. The Ah&#8208;scale quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, featuring a high&#8208;loading LiFePO4 cathode and lean gel polymer electrolyte, exhibit a high specific energy of 300&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1. This achievement translates into an improvement of 46% in gravimetric energy and 94% in volumetric energy compared to LiFePO4||graphite batteries while outperforming LiFePO4||Li&#8208;metal batteries by 22&#8211;47% in volumetric energy. Such quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free cells also demonstrate good safety, showcasing remarkable resistance against nail penetration in ambient air without failure, smoke, or fire accidents.

         <title>Microfluidic&#8208;Assembled Covalent Organic Frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene Vertical Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance electrochemical supercapacitor based on vertically structured covalent organic frameworks@Ti3C2Tx MXene fiber is developed via one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis. Due to vertical ion transport channels, sufficient ion&#8208;accessible area, decreased ion adsorption energy, excellent pseudocapacitive activity, and strong interfacial electron migration, the supercapacitors exhibit large capacitance, high energy density, excellent cycling stability, and wearable applications.








Abstract
The delicate design of innovative and sophisticated fibers with vertical porous skeleton and eminent electrochemical activity to generate directional ionic pathways and good faradic charge accessibility is pivotal but challenging for realizing high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Here, hierarchically ordered hybrid fiber combined vertical&#8208;aligned and conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene (VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) with interstratified electroactive covalent organic frameworks LZU1 (COF&#8208;LZU1) by one&#8208;step microfluidic synthesis is developed. Due to the incorporation of vertical channels, abundant redox active sites and large accessible surface area throughout the electrode, the VA&#8208;Ti3C2Tx@COF&#8208;LZU1 fibers express exceptional gravimetric capacitance of 787&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 in a three&#8208;electrode system. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state asymmetric FSCs deliver a prominent energy density of 27&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, capacitance of 398&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 and cycling life of 20&#160;000 cycles. The key to high energy storage ability originates from the decreased ions adsorption energy and ameliorative charge density distribution in vertically aligned and active hybrid fiber, accelerating ions transportation/accommodation and interfacial electrons transfer. Benefiting from excellent electrochemical performance, the FSCs offer sufficient energy supply to power watches, flags, and digital display tubes as well as be integrated with sensors to detect pulse signals, which opens a promising route for architecting advanced fiber toward the carbon neutrality market beyond energy&#8208;storage technology.

         <title>Ductile Oligomeric Acceptor&#8208;Modified Flexible Organic Solar Cells Show Excellent Mechanical Robustness and Near 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oligomeric acceptors with different flexible alkyl chains (DOY&#8208;C2, DOY&#8208;C4, and TOY&#8208;C4) are synthesized. When doped into D18:N3 system, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.01% and 17.91% are achieved in rigid and flexible devices based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of ternary films are also successfully improved due to form tie and entangled chain networks.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness are key requirements for wearable applications of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, almost all highly efficient photoactive films comprising polymer donors (PD) and small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are mechanically brittle. In this study, highly efficient (PCE = 17.91%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS] = 11.7%) flexible OSCs are fabricated by incorporating a ductile oligomeric acceptor (DOA) into the PD:SMA system, representing the most flexible OSCs to date. The photophysical, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties of D18:N3 with different DOAs are characterized. By introducing DOA DOY&#8208;C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4&#8208;based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3&#8208;based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY&#8208;C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible OSCs.

By introducing DOA DOY-C4 with a longer flexible alkyl linker and lower polymerization, the D18:N3:DOY-C4-based flexible OSCs exhibit a significantly higher PCE (17.91%) and 50% higher COS (11.7%) than the D18:N3-based device (PCE = 17.06%, COS = 7.8%). The flexible OSCs based on D18:N3:DOY-C4 retain 98% of the initial PCE after 2000 consecutive bending cycles, showing greater mechanical stability than the reference device (maintaining 89% of initial PCE). After careful investigation, it is hypothesized that the enhancement in mechanical properties is mainly due to the formation of tie chains or entanglement in the ternary blend films. These results demonstrate that DOAs have great potential for achieving high-performance flexible OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor is designed, realizing visual perception and memory capacities. The dual&#8208;functional device exhibit excellent performance in both PD and memristor. Such a device provides new opportunities for the mimicry of human visual memory in future multifunctional application.








Abstract
The imitation of human visual memory demands the multifunctional integration of light sensors similar to the eyes, and image memory, similar to the brain. Although humans have already implemented electronic devices with visual memory functions, these devices require a combination of various components and logical circuits. However, the combination&#160;of visual perception and high&#8208;performance information storage capabilities into a single device to achieve visual memory remains challenging. In this study, inspired by the function of human visual memory, a dual&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photodetector (PD) and memristor are designed to realize visual perception and memory capacities. As a PD, it realizes an ultrahigh self&#8208;powered responsivity of 276&#160;mA W&#8722;1, a high detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones (530&#160;nm; light intensities, 2.34&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;100 (&#177;2&#160;V). As a memristor, an ultrahigh on/off ratio (&#8776;105), an ultralow power consumption of 3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;W, a low setting voltage (0.15&#160;V), and a long retention time (&gt;7000&#160;s) are realized. Moreover, the dual&#8208;functional device has the capacity to perceive and remember light paths and store data with good cyclic stability. This device exhibits perceptual and cyclic erasable memory functions, which provides new opportunities for mimicking human visual memory in future multifunctional applications.
