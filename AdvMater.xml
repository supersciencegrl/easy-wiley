         <title>Tuning the Organ Tropism of Polymersome for Spleen&#8208;Selective Nanovaccine Delivery to Boost Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
The past few decades have witnessed explosive development in drug delivery systems. However, in vivo delivery suffers from non&#8208;specific distribution in non&#8208;targeted organs or tissues, which may cause undesired side effects and even genotoxicity. Here, we report a general strategy that enables tuning the tropism of polymersomes for liver&#8208; and spleen&#8208;selective delivery. By using a library screening approach, spleen&#8208;targeted polymersome PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 and liver&#8208;targeted polymersome PA9&#8208;ZP3&#8208;5050 are identified accordingly. Meanwhile, the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging allows for in vivo dynamic evaluation of their spatial and temporal accumulation in specific tissues. Our findings indicate that both polymer composition and protein corona on the surface are essential to determine the in vivo fate of polymersomes and tendency for specific organs. Importantly, we employ PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 as a systemic nanocarrier to co&#8208;deliver the antigen and adjuvant, which remarkably boost splenic immune responses in acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and melanoma lung metastasis mouse models. This study may open a new frontier for polymersomes in organ&#8208;selective delivery and other biomedical applications.

&lt;p&gt;The past few decades have witnessed explosive development in drug delivery systems. However, in vivo delivery suffers from non-specific distribution in non-targeted organs or tissues, which may cause undesired side effects and even genotoxicity. Here, we report a general strategy that enables tuning the tropism of polymersomes for liver- and spleen-selective delivery. By using a library screening approach, spleen-targeted polymersome PH9-Aln-8020 and liver-targeted polymersome PA9-ZP3-5050 are identified accordingly. Meanwhile, the second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging allows for in vivo dynamic evaluation of their spatial and temporal accumulation in specific tissues. Our findings indicate that both polymer composition and protein corona on the surface are essential to determine the in vivo fate of polymersomes and tendency for specific organs. Importantly, we employ PH9-Aln-8020 as a systemic nanocarrier to co-deliver the antigen and adjuvant, which remarkably boost splenic immune responses in acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and melanoma lung metastasis mouse models. This study may open a new frontier for polymersomes in organ-selective delivery and other biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Jellybean Quantum Dots in Silicon for Qubit Coupling and On&#8208;Chip Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly elliptical, elongated, quantum dots&#8212;so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dots&#8212;can be used for qubit&#8211;qubit coupling over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances and alleviate crowding in scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Such a jellybean dot is formed in a silicon&#8208;MOS quantum device and reported to support controlled charge filling and well&#8208;defined spin states for higher charge occupations, corroborating its potential for qubit&#8211;qubit couplers in quantum computing architectures.








Abstract
The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass&#8208;manufacturable, scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on&#8208;chip, in&#8208;between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot&#8212;a so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dot&#8212;for the prospects of acting as a qubit&#8211;qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing, and magneto&#8208;spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature and compared to Hartree&#8211;Fock multi&#8208;electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron&#8211;electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule. One dot is formed centrally under the gate and two are formed at the edges. At high electron occupancies, these dots merge into one large dot with well&#8208;defined spin states, verifying that jellybean dots have the potential to be used as qubit couplers in future quantum computing&#160;architectures.

         <title>Alloying of Cu with Ru Enabling the Relay Catalysis for Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3 with renewable energy is of great practical significance to balance the environmental problems and economic benefits. Ru1Cu10 alloy exhibits high activity for direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 under an ultralow potential due to a relay effect on Cu (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) and Ru (NO2&#8722; to NH3) sites.








Abstract
Involving eight electron transfer process and multiple intermediates of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction reaction leads to a sluggish kinetic and low Faradaic efficiency, therefore, it is essential to get an insight into the reaction mechanism to develop highly efficient electrocatalyst. Herein, a series of reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported RuCu alloy catalysts (RuxCux/rGO) are fabricated and used for the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. It is found that the Ru1Cu10/rGO shows the ammonia formation rate of 0.38&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (loading 1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and the ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 98% under an ultralow potential of &#8722;0.05&#160;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electode (RHE), which is comparable to Ru catalyst. The highly efficient activity of Ru1Cu10/rGO can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Ru and Cu sites via a relay catalysis, in which the Cu shows the exclusively efficient activity for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and Ru exhibits the superior activity for NO2&#8722; to NH3. In addition, the doping of Ru into Cu tunes the d&#8208;band center of alloy and effectively modulates the adsorption energy of the NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, which promotes the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. This synergetic electrocatalysis strategy opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Deciphering Structural Origins of Highly Reversible Lithium Storage in High Entropy Oxides with In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, distinct reaction dynamics and phase transformations during (de)lithiation of rocksalt high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, revealing composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics and spatiotemporal variations of valence states. Unexpectedly, the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase can be fully and reversibly recovered to the original rocksalt structure upon delithiation. These findings afford valuable guidelines to compositionally engineer novel HEO electrodes.








Abstract
Configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) have been considered revolutionary electrode materials with both reversible lithium storage and high specific capacity that are difficult to fulfill simultaneously by conventional electrodes. However, precise understanding of lithium storage mechanisms in such HEOs remains controversial due to complex multi&#8208;cationic oxide systems. Here, distinct reaction dynamics and structural evolutions in rocksalt&#8208;type HEOs upon cycling are carefully studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including imaging, electron diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy at atomic scale. The mechanisms of composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics along with spatiotemporal variations of valence states upon lithiation are revealed, characterized by disappearance of the original rocksalt phase. Unexpectedly, it is found from the first visualization evidence that the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase state can be recovered to the original rocksalt&#8208;structured HEOs via reversible and symmetrical delithiation reactions, which is unavailable for monometallic oxide systems. Rigorous electrochemical tests coupled with postmortem ex situ TEM and bulk&#8208;level phase analyses further validate the crucial role of structural recovery capability in ensuring the reversible high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;storage in HEOs. These findings can provide valuable guidelines to design compositionally engineer HEOs for almighty electrodes of next&#8208;generation long&#8208;life energy storage devices.

         <title>Reusable Electronic Tongue Based on Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 Nanodisc&#8208;Conjugated Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistor for a Spiciness&#8208;Related Pain Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pain&#8208;related receptor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 is activated by noxious stimuli such as chemical, physical, and thermal stimuli. The stimuli of pungent compounds induce a sensation of burning or prickling of the tongue. To verify reversible TRPV1 activation to pungent materials, a reusable electronic tongue based on TRPV1 nanodisc conjugated graphene field&#8208;effect transistor is presented.








Abstract
The sense of spiciness is related to the stimulation of vanilloid compounds contained in the foods. Although, the spiciness is commonly considered as the part of taste, it is more classified to the sense of pain stimulated on a tongue, namely, pungency, which is described as a tingling or burning on the tongue. Herein, first, a reusable electronic tongue based on a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) nanodisc conjugated graphene field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated and spiciness&#8208;related pain evaluation with reusable electrode is demonstrated. The pungent compound reactive receptor TRPV1 is synthesized in the form of nanodiscs to maintain stability and reusability. The newly developed platform shows highly selective and sensitive performance toward each spiciness related vanilloid compound repeatably: 1 aM capsaicin, 10 aM dihydrocapsaicin, 1 fM piperine, 10&#160;nM allicin, and 1 pM AITC. The binding mechanism is also examined by simulation. Furthermore, the elimination of the burning sensation on the tongue after eating spicy foods is not investigated. Based on the synthesis of micelles composed of casein protein (which is contained in skim milk) that remove pungent compounds bound to TRPV1 nanodisc, the deactivation of TRPV1 is investigated, and the electrode is reusable that mimics electronic tongue.

         <title>Anisotropic Excitons Reveal Local Spin Chain Directions in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order. It is found that the polarization of maximal exciton emission in NiPS3 rotate locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the antiferromagnetic order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing pursuit in materials science is to identify suitable magnetic semiconductors for integrated information storage, processing, and transfer. Van der Waals magnets have brought forth new material candidates for this purpose. Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order, that is, the exciton photoluminescence intensity diminishes above the N&#233;el temperature. Here, it is found that the polarization of maximal exciton emission rotates locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the antiferromagnet order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments. Furthermore, defect&#8208;bound states are suggested as an alternative exciton formation mechanism that has yet to be explored in NiPS3. The supporting evidence includes chemical analysis, excitation power, and thickness dependent photoluminescence and first&#8208;principles calculations. This mechanism for exciton formation is also consistent with the presence of strong phonon side bands. This study shows that anisotropic exciton photoluminescence can be used to read out local spin chain directions in antiferromagnets and realize multi&#8208;functional devices via spin&#8208;photon transduction.

         <title>Geometric Tuning of Single&#8208;Atom FeN4 Sites via Edge&#8208;Generation Enhances Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometric tuning of single&#8208;atom active sites is desirable way to enhance catalytic activity. H2O2&#8208;etching to carbon matrix generates abundant edge&#8208;located FeN4 sites with distinct geometric and electronic structures compared to basal plane&#8208;located FeN4 sites. FeNC&#8208;edge with the unique local environment exhibits remarkably improved multi&#8208;enzymatic activity and inhibits tumor growth effectively.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are considered promising alternatives to natural enzymes. The catalytic performance of SAzymes featuring homogeneous, well&#8208;defined active structures can be enhanced through elucidating structure&#8208;activity relationship and tailoring physicochemical properties. However, manipulating enzymatic properties through structural variation is an underdeveloped approach. Herein, the synthesis of edge&#8208;rich Fe single&#8208;atom nanozymes (FeNC&#8208;edge) via an H2O2&#8208;mediated edge generation is reported. By controlling the number of edge sites, the peroxidase (POD)&#8208; and oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like performance is significantly enhanced. The activity enhancement results from the presence of abundant edges, which provide new anchoring sites to mononuclear Fe. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FeN4 moieties in the edge sites display high electron density of Fe atoms and open N atoms. Finally, it is demonstrated that FeNC&#8208;edge nanozyme effectively inhibits tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that edge&#8208;tailoring is an efficient strategy for developing artificial enzymes as novel catalytic therapeutics.

         <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Upper Critical Field in Ta&#8208;Doped Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superconducting transition temperature is greatly enhanced to be as large as 7.5 K in bulk Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 single crystals, which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level.&#160;We&#160;also find the enhanced upper critical field beyond the Pauli limit in Ta&#8208;doped Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2, which is likely due to the mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides are promising platforms for next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics. The layered Weyl semimetal (W,Mo)Te2 series features structural phase transition, nonsaturated magnetoresistance, superconductivity, and exotic topological physics. However, the superconducting critical temperature of the bulk (W,Mo)Te2 remains ultralow without applying a high pressure. Here, the significantly enhanced superconductivity is observed with a transition temperature as large as about 7.5 K in bulk Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 single crystals upon Ta doping (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 0.22), which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level. In addition, an enhanced perpendicular upper critical field of 14.5 T exceeding the Pauli limit is also observed in Td&#8208;phase Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 (x&#160;= 0.08), indicating the possible emergence of unconventional mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity owing to the inversion symmetry breaking. This work provides a new pathway for exploring the exotic superconductivity and topological physics in transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Supporting Trimetallic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks on S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over the hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) are prepared as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating active sites exposure, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 296&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and outstanding durability.








Abstract
Hybrid materials, integrating the merits of individual components, are ideal structures for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the rational construction of hybrid structures with decent physical/electrochemical properties is yet challenging. Herein, a promising OER electrocatalyst composed of trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) via a cation&#8208;exchange strategy is delicately fabricated. Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating exposure of active sites, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers outstanding activity and stability for alkaline OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 296&#160;mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. In combination with X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed Fe/Co&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during the OER operation is revealed to account for the high OER performance of S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF.

         <title>Realizing the Heteromorphic Superlattice: Repeated Heterolayers of Amorphous Insulator and Polycrystalline Semiconductor with Minimal Interface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superlattices represent the epitome of combinatorial materials science: their properties can transcend those of their constituent layers, such as improved mobility with modulation doped structures. Here superlattice combinations are expanded into the morphological domain by introducing direct growth of alternating amorphous and polycrystalline layers, realizing a high&#8208;quality, high mobility &#8220;heteromorphic superlattice,&#8221; originally conceived by Raphael Tsu in 1989.








Abstract
An unconventional &#8220;heteromorphic&#8221; superlattice (HSL) is realized, comprised of repeated layers of different materials with differing morphologies: semiconducting pc&#8208;In2O3 layers interleaved with insulating a&#8208;MoO3 layers. Originally proposed by Tsu in 1989, yet never fully realized, the high quality of the HSL heterostructure demonstrated here validates the intuition of Tsu, whereby the flexibility of the bond angle in the amorphous phase and the passivation effect of the oxide at interfacial bonds serve to create smooth, high&#8208;mobility interfaces. The alternating amorphous layers prevent strain accumulation in the polycrystalline layers while suppressing defect propagation across the HSL. For the HSL with 7:7&#160;nm layer thickness, the observed electron mobility of 71 cm2&#160;Vs&#8208;1, matches that of the highest quality In2O3 thin films. The atomic structure and electronic properties of crystalline In2O3/amorphous MoO3 interfaces are verified using ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid functional calculations. This work generalizes the superlattice concept to an entirely new paradigm of morphological combinations.

         <title>Integrating Mixed Halide Perovskite Photocatalytic HI Splitting and Electrocatalysis into a Loop for Efficient and Robust Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difficult pure water splitting is disassembled into two parts that are easy to implement, namely mixed halide perovskite photocatalytic HI splitting for H2 production, and simultaneous electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production. The circulation of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; between the designed photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems can achieve efficient and robust pure water splitting.








Abstract
Developing a hydrogen economy to replace traditional fossil fuels is essential for sustainable human development. As two promising H2 production strategies, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting with large reaction energy barriers still face the great challenges of poor solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency and large electrochemical overpotentials, respectively. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to disassemble the difficult pure water splitting into two parts that are easy to implement, namely mixed halide perovskite photocatalytic HI splitting for H2 production, and simultaneous electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production. The efficient charge separation, abundant H2 production active sites, and a small HI splitting energy barrier contribute to the superior photocatalytic H2 production activity of MoSe2/MAPbBr3&#8722;xIx (CH3NH3+&#160;= MA). Subsequent electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production reactions only need a small voltage of 0.92&#160;V to drive, which is far lower than that of the electrocatalytic pure water splitting (&gt;1.23&#160;V). The molar ratio of H2 (6.99&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) to O2 (3.09&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) produced during the first photocatalytic and electrocatalytic cycle is close to 2:1, and the continuous circulation of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; between the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems can achieve efficient and robust pure water splitting.

         <title>Near&#8208; and Long&#8208;Range Electronic Modulation of Single Metal Sites to Boost CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnN4 sites decorated with axial sulfur ligand and surrounded phosphorus atoms are successfully constructed in the hollow carbon supports, which exhibits excellent performance for CO2 reduction reaction. The total energy efficiency of CO2RR device can be improved by coupling with anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Tuning the electronic structure of the active center is effective to improve the intrinsic activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts but the realization of precise regulation remains challenging. Herein, a strategy of &#8220;synergistically near&#8208; and long&#8208;range regulation&#8221; is reported to effectively modulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites. ZnN4 sites decorated with axial sulfur ligand in the first coordination and surrounded phosphorus atoms in the carbon matrix are successfully constructed in the hollow carbon supports (ZnN4S1/P&#8208;HC). ZnN4S1/P&#8208;HC exhibits excellent performance for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with a Faraday efficiency of CO close to 100%. The coupling of the CO2RR with thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction to replace oxygen evolution reaction in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer can greatly lower the cell voltage by 0.92&#160;V at a current density of 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, theoretically saving 46% of energy consumption. Theoretical calculation reveals that the near&#8208;range regulation with axial thiophene&#8208;S ligand and long&#8208;range regulation with neighboring P atoms can synergistically lead to the increase of electron localization around the Zn sites, which strengthens the adsorption of *COOH intermediate and therefore boosts the CO2RR.

&lt;p&gt;Tuning the electronic structure of the active center is effective to improve the intrinsic activity of single-atom catalysts but the realization of precise regulation remains challenging. Herein, a strategy of &#8220;synergistically near- and long-range regulation&#8221; is reported to effectively modulate the electronic structure of single-atom sites. ZnN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites decorated with axial sulfur ligand in the first coordination and surrounded phosphorus atoms in the carbon matrix are successfully constructed in the hollow carbon supports (ZnN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P-HC). ZnN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P-HC exhibits excellent performance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) with a Faraday efficiency of CO close to 100%. The coupling of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR with thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction to replace oxygen evolution reaction in a two-electrode electrolyzer can greatly lower the cell voltage by 0.92&#160;V at a current density of 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, theoretically saving 46% of energy consumption. Theoretical calculation reveals that the near-range regulation with axial thiophene-S ligand and long-range regulation with neighboring P atoms can synergistically lead to the increase of electron localization around the Zn sites, which strengthens the adsorption of *COOH intermediate and therefore boosts the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Chromium Tellurium Compounds with Thickness&#8208;Tunable Magnetic Texture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic van der Waals epitaxial approach is demonstrated to synthesize the non&#8208;van der Waals 2D ternary chromium tellurium compounds with thicknesses as low as mono&#8208;UC. Intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior is observed in the bi&#8208;UC, tri&#8208;UC, and few&#8208;UC nanosheets. Thickness&#8208;dependent magnetic textures are studied and applied in neuromorphic computing tasks.








Abstract
2D ferromagnetic chromium tellurides exhibit intriguing spin configurations and high&#8208;temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism, providing unprecedented opportunities to explore the fundamental spin physics and build spintronic devices. Here, a generic van der Waals epitaxial approach is developed to synthesize the 2D ternary chromium tellurium compounds with thicknesses down to mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and few&#8208;unit cells&#160;(UC). The Mn0.14Cr0.86Te evolves from intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior in bi&#8208;UC, tri&#8208;UC, and few&#8208;UC to temperature&#8208;induced ferrimagnetic behavior as the thickness increases, resulting in a sign reversal of the anomalous Hall resistance. Temperature&#8208; and thickness&#8208;tunable labyrinthine&#8208;domain ferromagnetic behaviors are derived from the dipolar interactions in Fe0.26Cr0.74Te and Co0.40Cr0.60Te. Furthermore, the dipolar&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced stripe domain and field&#8208;induced domain wall (DW) motion velocity are studied, and multibit data storage is realized through an abundant DW state. The magnetic storage can function in neuromorphic computing tasks, and the pattern recognition accuracy can reach up to 97.93%, which is similar to the recognition accuracy of ideal software&#8208;based training (98.28%). Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic chromium tellurium compounds with intriguing spin configurations can significantly promote the exploration of the processing, sensing, and storage based on 2D magnetic systems.

Abstract
A unique class of advanced materials&#8212;quantum composites based on polymers with fillers composed of a van der Waals quantum material that reveals multiple charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave quantum condensate phases&#8212;is demonstrated. Materials that exhibit quantum phenomena are typically crystalline, pure, and have few defects because disorder destroys the coherence of the electrons and phonons, leading to collapse of the quantum states. The macroscopic charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phases of filler particles after multiple composite processing steps are successfully preserved in this work. The prepared composites display strong charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phenomena even above room temperature. The dielectric constant experiences more than two orders of magnitude enhancement while the material maintains its electrically insulating properties, opening a venue for advanced applications in energy storage and electronics. The results present a conceptually different approach for engineering the properties of materials, extending the application domain for van der Waals materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Nano&#8208;Assemblies as Tumor&#8208;Targeted and Renal Clearable Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an ultra&#8208;small nano photosensitizer is presented through a facile self&#8208;assembly strategy that can target a disease state, boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, as well as be cleared efficiently from the body in a reasonable amount of time.








Abstract
It is a challenge to design photosensitizers to balance between the tumor&#8208;targeting enrichment for precise treatment and efficient clearance within a reasonable timescale for reducing side effects. Herein, an ultra&#8208;small nano&#8208;photosensitizer 1a with excellent tumor&#8208;specific accumulation and renal clearance is reported. It is formed from the self&#8208;assembly of compound 1 bearing three triethylene glycol (TEG) arms&#160;and two pyridinium groups in water. The positively charged surface with neutral TEG coating enables 1a to efficiently target the tumor, with the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio reaching as high as 11.5 after tail intravenous injection. The ultra&#8208;small size of 1a with an average diameter of 5.6&#160;nm allows its fast clearance through kidney. Self&#8208;assembly also endows 1a with an 18.2&#8208;fold enhancement of reactive oxygygen species generation rate compared to compound 1 in organic solution. Nano&#8208;PS 1a manifests an excellent photodynamic therapy efficacy on tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. This work provides a promising design strategy of photosensitizers with renal clearable and tumor&#8208;targeting ability.

         <title>User&#8208;Controlled 4D Biomaterial Degradation with Substrate&#8208;Selective Sortase Transpeptidases for Single&#8208;Cell Biology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using engineered sortase transpeptidases that orthogonally recognize and cleave peptide substrates largely absent from the mammalian proteome, multiplexed cell liberation from within 3D hydrogel biomaterials is uniquely achieved without significantly altering cell fate. Cell recovery is compatible with downstream single&#8208;cell&#8208;based functional assays including flow cytometry.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials show great promise for modeling disease dynamics ex vivo with spatiotemporal control over the cellular microenvironment. However, harvesting cells from such materials for downstream analysis without perturbing their state remains an outstanding challenge in 3/4&#8208;dimensional (3D/4D) culture and tissue engineering. In this manuscript, a fully enzymatic strategy for hydrogel degradation that affords spatiotemporal control over cell release while maintaining cytocompatibility is introduced. Exploiting engineered variants of the sortase transpeptidase evolved to recognize and selectively cleave distinct peptide sequences largely absent from the mammalian proteome, many limitations implicit to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods to liberate cells from gels are sidestepped. It is demonstrated that evolved sortase exposure has minimal impact on the global transcriptome of primary mammalian cells and that proteolytic cleavage proceeds with high specificity; incorporation of substrate sequences within hydrogel crosslinkers permits rapid and selective cell recovery with high viability. In composite multimaterial hydrogels, it is shown that sequential degradation of hydrogel layers enables highly specific retrieval of single&#8208;cell suspensions for phenotypic analysis. It is expected that the high bioorthogonality and substrate selectivity of the evolved sortases will lead to their broad adoption as an enzymatic material dissociation cue and that their multiplexed use will enable newfound studies in 4D cell culture.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Resolved Imaging of Antiferromagnetic Order in Fe4Se5 Ultrathin Films on SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe4Se5 ultrathin films are experimentally demonstrated to host a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, evident with magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent spin contrasts in real&#8208;space by spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. The AFM order is modulated by a spin&#8211;lattice coupling and exhibits three types of nanoscale AFM domains, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Unraveling the magnetic order in iron chalcogenides and pnictides at atomic scale is pivotal for understanding their unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism, but is experimentally challenging. Here, by utilizing spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, real&#8208;space spin contrasts are successfully resolved to exhibit atomically unidirectional stripes in Fe4Se5 ultrathin films, the plausible closely related compound of bulk FeSe with ordered Fe&#8208;vacancies, which are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. As is substantiated by the first&#8208;principles electronic structure calculations, the spin contrast originates from a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, which is modulated by a spin&#8211;lattice coupling. These measurements further identify three types of nanoscale antiferromagnetic domains with distinguishable spin contrasts, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures. This work provides promising opportunities in understanding the emergent magnetic order and the electronic phase diagram for FeSe&#8208;derived superconductors.

         <title>Volumetric Printing of Thiol&#8208;Ene Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linkable Poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone): A Tunable Material Platform Serving Biomedical Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;ene cross&#8208;linkable poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#160;is introduced and the effect of the cross&#8208;link density on the networks&#8217; physico&#8208;chemical properties, volumetric printability, and biocompatibility is investigated. Notably, this is the first report on volumetric 3D&#8208;printing of polyesters and 3D&#8208;printing of the smallest features to date, for non&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based resins, is illustrated.








Abstract
Current thoroughly described biodegradable and cross&#8208;linkable polymers mainly rely on acrylate cross&#8208;linking. However, despite the swift cross&#8208;linking kinetics of acrylates, the concomitant brittleness of the resulting materials limits their applicability. Here, photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#160;networks through orthogonal thiol&#8208;ene chemistry are introduced. The step&#8208;growth polymerized networks are tunable, predictable by means of the rubber elasticity theory and it is shown that their mechanical properties are significantly improved over their acrylate cross&#8208;linked counterparts. Tunability is introduced to the materials, by altering Mc (or the molar mass between cross&#8208;links), and its effect on the thermal properties, mechanical strength and degradability of the materials is evaluated. Moreover, excellent volumetric printability is illustrated and the smallest features obtained via volumetric 3D&#8208;printing to date are reported, for thiol&#8208;ene systems. Finally, by means of in vitro and in vivo characterization of 3D&#8208;printed constructs, it is illustrated that the volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed materials are biocompatible. This combination of mechanical stability, tunability, biocompatibility, and rapid fabrication by volumetric 3D&#8208;printing charts a new path toward bedside manufacturing of biodegradable patient&#8208;specific implants.

         <title>A Concerted Redox&#8208; and Light&#8208;Activated Agent for Controlled Multimodal Therapy against Hypoxic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia represents a compelling tumor therapeutic target. The first metal&#8208;based multimodal theranostic agent (RuAzNM) for targeting hypoxia is reported. The&#160;activity of RuAzNM is caged by a conjugated azo group, and selectively unleashed in hypoxic cancer cells. This allows emission&#8208;directed multimodal therapy, elicits apoptosis, and suggests that RuAzNM can deliver&#160;an efficacious theranostic outcome for hypoxic cancer cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia represents a remarkably exploitable target for cancer therapy, is encountered only in solid human tumors, and is highly associated with cancer resistance and recurrence. Here, a hypoxia&#8208;activated mitochondria&#8208;accumulated Ru(II) polypyridyl prodrug functionalized with conjugated azo (Az) and nitrogen mustard (NM) functionalities, RuAzNM, is reported. This prodrug has multimodal theranostic properties toward hypoxic cancer cells. Reduction of the azo group in hypoxic cell microenvironments gives rise to the generation of two primary amine products, a free aniline mustard, and the polypyridyl RuNH2 complex. Thus, the aniline mustard triggers generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mtDNA crosslinking. Meanwhile, the resultant biologically benign phosphorescent RuNH2 gives rise to a diagnostic signal and signals activation of the phototherapy. This multimodal therapeutic effect eventually elevates ROS levels, depletes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and induces mitochondrial membrane damage, mtDNA damage, and ultimately cell apoptosis. This unique strategy allows controlled multimodal theranostics to be realized in hypoxic cells and multicellular spheroids, making RuAzNM a highly selective and effective cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective theranostic agent (IC50&#160;= 2.3&#160;&#181;m for hypoxic HepG2 cancer cells vs 58.2&#160;&#181;m for normoxic THL&#8208;3 normal cells). This is the first report of a metal&#8208;based compound developed as a multimodal theranostic agent for hypoxia.

         <title>Electrostatic Epitaxy of Orientational Perovskites for Microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;free electrostatic epitaxy is achieved toward orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline microwire arrays and thin films. This is facilitated by a negatively charged surfactant layer at the air&#8211;liquid interface, where the strong and selective interaction between surfactant anion and perovskite facet induces preferential nucleation and orientational growth. The high&#8208;quality microwire permits a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic lasing, waveguide coupling, and coherent&#8208;light propagation.








Abstract
Orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline structures is pivotal in the semiconductor industry, which is achievable by epitaxy for producing thin films, heterostructures, quantum wells, and superlattices. Beyond silicon and III&#8211;V semiconductors, solution&#8208;processible semiconductors, such as metal&#8208;halide perovskites, are emerging for scalable and cost&#8208;effective manufacture of optoelectronic devices, whereas the polycrystalline nature of fabricated structures restricts their application toward integrated devices. Here, electrostatic epitaxy, a process sustained by strong electrostatic interactions between self&#8208;assembled surfactants (octanoate anions) and Pb2+, is developed to realize orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 microwires. Strong electrostatic interactions localized at the air&#8211;liquid interface not only support preferential nucleation for single crystallinity, but also select the crystal facet with the highest Pb2+ areal density for pure crystallographic orientation. Due to the epitaxy at the air&#8211;liquid interface, direct growth of oriented single&#8208;crystalline microwires onto different substrates without the processes of lift&#8208;off and transfer is realized. Photonic lasing emission, waveguide coupling, and on&#8208;chip propagation of coherent light are demonstrated based on these single&#8208;crystalline microwires. These findings open an avenue for on&#8208;chip integration of single&#8208;crystalline materials.

This study provides &#8220;Mesenchymal&#160;stem&#160;cell&#160;Differentiation&#160;Prediction&#160;(MeD&#8208;P)&#8221;, a machine learning model for predicting hMSCs&#8211;biomaterial interaction. This enables comprehensive evaluation of biomaterials in MSC lineage fate regulation based on RNA&#8208;seq data. MeD&#8208;P is trained to be robust and accurate with large&#8208;scale public RNA&#8208;seq data after correcting for batch variances. It demonstrates much potential in facilitating biological performance optimization of biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.








Abstract
Current functional assessment of biomaterial&#8208;induced stem cell lineage fate in vitro mainly relies on biomarker&#8208;dependent methods with limited accuracy and efficiency. Here a &#8220;Mesenchymal stem cell Differentiation Prediction (MeD&#8208;P)&#8221; framework for biomaterial&#8208;induced cell lineage fate prediction is reported. MeD&#8208;P contains a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific gene expression profile as a reference by integrating public RNA&#8208;seq data related to tri&#8208;lineage differentiation (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis) of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and a predictive model for classifying hMSCs differentiation lineages using the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (kNN) strategy. It is shown that MeD&#8208;P exhibits an overall accuracy of 90.63% on testing datasets, which is significantly higher than the model constructed based on canonical marker genes (80.21%). Moreover, evaluations of multiple biomaterials show that MeD&#8208;P provides accurate prediction of lineage fate on different types of biomaterials as early as the first week of hMSCs culture. In summary, it is demonstrated that MeD&#8208;P is an efficient and accurate strategy for stem cell lineage fate prediction and preliminary biomaterial functional evaluation.

         <title>Iridescence from Total Internal Reflection at 3D Microscale Interfaces: Mechanistic Insights and Spectral Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental investigation and the optical modeling of structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures are described. Ray tracing coupled with spectral analysis techniques are used to examine the iridescence generated for a range of microgeometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres. Microstructure arrays with varying orientation and size create unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects with customizable iridescence.








Abstract
An experimental investigation and the optical modeling of the structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures are described. Ray&#8208;tracing simulations coupled with color visualization and spectral analysis techniques are used to model, examine, and rationalize the iridescence generated for a range of microgeometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres, under varying illumination conditions. An approach to deconstruct the observed iridescence and complex far&#8208;field spectral features into its elementary components and systematically link them to ray trajectories that emanate from the illuminated microstructures is demonstrated. The results are compared with experiments, wherein microstructures are fabricated with methods such as chemical etching, multiphoton lithography, and grayscale lithography. Microstructure arrays patterned on surfaces with varying orientation and size lead to unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects and highlight opportunities for how total internal reflection interference can be used to create customizable reflective iridescence. The findings herein provide a robust conceptual framework for rationalizing this multibounce interference mechanism and establish approaches for characterizing and tailoring the optical and iridescent properties of microstructured surfaces.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Regulation of the Microenvironment of Ni(II)&#8208;Porphyrin Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP, p&#8208;NiTPyP) are prepared as model catalysts for fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment around the active site via affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and N&#63743;Ni&#63743;N bond angles. Among them, m&#8208;NiTPyP as the electrocatalyst delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267/138&#160;mV for the OER/HER, and as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer only requires a cell voltage of 1.62&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 current density.








Abstract
Accurately regulating the microenvironment around active sites is an important approach for boosting the overall water splitting performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts,&#160;which&#160;can drive both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the same electrolyte. Herein, pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP, and p&#8208;NiTPyP) with pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms located at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, or para&#8208;position are prepared and used as model catalysts for alkaline water splitting. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atom positions can regulate the microenvironment around the active sites and the adsorption free energy of H&#8208;donating substances by affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and the N&#63743;Ni&#63743;N bond angles of active sites, and thus those pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins deliver better electrocatalytic activity than the Ni(II)&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) without pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms. Among them, m&#8208;NiTPyP on carbon nanotubes delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267 and 138&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and HER, respectively. Specifically, m&#8208;NiTPyP as bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer requires only 1.62&#160;V to drive efficient overall water splitting at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 while remaining durable. This work proposes a new H&#8208;bond&#8208;regulating approach of the microenvironment of electrocatalysts for effectively boosting the overall water splitting activity and deeply understanding its related mechanism.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Reversal of Phase Segregation in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced halide segregation is a major barrier to the implementation of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites in tandem solar cells. Increasing temperature from 125&#160;K kinetically enhances halide segregation up to 290&#160;K, but higher temperatures are found to hinder it owing to entropic remixing. Increasing the incident light intensity can also induce remixing, but this effect is transient.








Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of light&#8208;induced halide segregation in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites is essential for their application in multijunction solar cells. Here, photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to uncover how both increases in temperature and light intensity can counteract the halide segregation process. It is observed that, with increasing temperature, halide segregation in CH3NH3Pb(Br0.4I0.6)3 first accelerates toward &#8776;290&#160;K, before slowing down again toward higher temperatures. Such reversal is attributed to the trade&#8208;off between the temperature activation of segregation, for example through enhanced ionic migration, and its inhibition by entropic factors. High light intensities meanwhile can also reverse halide segregation; however, this is found to be only a transient process that abates on the time scale of minutes. Overall, these observations pave the way for a more complete model of halide segregation and aid the development of highly efficient and stable perovskite multijunction and concentrator&#160;photovoltaics.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructure of Plant Polyphenol and Arginine Surfactant for Long&#8208;Lasting and Target&#8208;Selective Antimicrobial Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent with anti&#8208;water washing property and broad substrate adhesion is constructed by bottom&#8211;up assembly from plant polyphenol and amino acid surfactant. The antimicrobial molecules dissociate from the secondary structure of hexagonal column by multi&#8208;stage and on&#8208;demand release to selectively kill the pathogen without generating toxicity and irritation to the normal human tissue.








Abstract
Antimicrobial agents are massively used to disinfect the pathogen contaminated surfaces since the Corona&#160;Virus&#160;Disease&#160;2019&#160;(COVID&#8208;19) outbreak.

&lt;p&gt;A kind of long-lasting antimicrobial agent with anti-water washing property and broad substrate adhesion is constructed by bottom&#8211;up assembly from plant polyphenol and amino acid surfactant. The antimicrobial molecules dissociate from the secondary structure of hexagonal column by multi-stage and on-demand release to selectively kill the pathogen without generating toxicity and irritation to the normal human tissue.

&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial agents are massively used to disinfect the pathogen contaminated surfaces since the Corona&#160;Virus&#160;Disease&#160;2019&#160;(COVID-19) outbreak.

         <title>Lead(II) 2&#8208;Ethylhexanoate for Simultaneous Modulated Crystallization and Surface Shielding to Boost Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead(II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into perovskite films to change the kinetics of crystallization, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite film. The carboxyl functional group coordinates with the Pb cation, reducing the defect concentration. Meanwhile, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices.








Abstract
The bulk and surface of a perovskite light&#8208;harvesting layer are two pivotal aspects affecting its carrier transport and long&#8208;term stability. In this work, lead(II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into perovskite films to change the reaction kinetics of the crystallization process, resulting in a high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Meanwhile, a carboxyl functional group with a long alkyl chain coordinates with the Pb cation, reducing the defect density related to unsaturated Pb atoms. Moreover, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer at the surface of the perovskite film to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices. Consequently, the assembled device demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.84%. Both of the thermal and operational stability are significantly improved due to reduced ion&#8208;migration channels.

         <title>Fluorinated Li10GeP2S12 Enables Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiF&#8208;coated core&#8211;shell electrolyte LiF@Li10GeP2S12 is achieved by in situ gas&#8208;phase fluoridation. Benefiting from the LiF shell, LiF@Li10GeP2S12 exhibits excellent compatibility toward moisture and lithium metal, realizing a high ionic conductivity after air exposure and three times higher critical current density. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery exhibits a capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The instability of Li10GeP2S12 toward moisture and that toward lithium metal are two challenges for the application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. In this work, Li10GeP2S12 is fluorinated to form a LiF&#8208;coated core&#8211;shell solid electrolyte LiF@Li10GeP2S12. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm the hydrolysis mechanism of Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte, including H2O adsorption on Li atoms of Li10GeP2S12 and the subsequent PS43&#8722; dissociation affected by hydrogen bond. The hydrophobic LiF shell can reduce the adsorption site, thus resulting in superior moisture stability when exposing in 30% relative humidity air. Moreover, with LiF shell, Li10GeP2S12 shows one order lower electronic conductivity, which can significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth and reduce the side reaction between Li10GeP2S12 and lithium, realizing three times higher critical current density to 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled LiNbO3@LiCoO2/LiF@Li10GeP2S12/Li battery exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 101.0 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

         <title>Genetically Programmable Vesicles for Enhancing CAR&#8208;T Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve the infiltration and effector functions of chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cells. The combination of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs with CAR&#8208;T cells increases the therapeutic effect against orthotopic lung cancer and generates a long&#8208;term immune memory response.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cell therapy has shown remarkable success in eradicating hematologic malignancies; however, its efficacy in treating solid tumors has always been limited due to the presence of an immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 single chain variable fragment (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;scFv) loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive TME and enhance the efficiency of anti&#8208;mesothelin CAR&#8208;T cells in orthotopic lung cancer. As anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv can specifically bind to the programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on tumor cells, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs enable the targeted delivery of glutamine antagonists to the tumor site and address the upregulation of PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells, which prevents the premature exhaustion of CAR&#8208;T cells. More importantly, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs effectively reduce the number of immunosuppressive cells and promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in tumor tissues. These unique features of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs improve the infiltration and effector functions of CAR&#8208;T cells, which ultimately enhance the anti&#8208;tumor ability and long&#8208;term memory immunity of CAR&#8208;T cells. The findings support that D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs act as a promising drug to strengthen the effectiveness of CAR&#8208;T cells against solid tumors.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional&#160;Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 Alloyed Double Perovskite Nanoplatelets for Solution&#8208;Processed Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized. The outstanding optical properties can be well explained by temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy study and first&#8208;principal density functional theory calculations. The as&#8208;prepared alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets exhibit unprecedent stability toward air and polar solvents. All&#8208;solution&#8208;processed light&#8208;emitting diodes using this material as the sole emitting layer are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials with potential to be integrated into a wide range of optical and optoelectronic applications. Herein, the first synthesis of 2D Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) with well controlled morphology and composition is demonstrated. The obtained NPLs show unique optical properties with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.1%. Both temperature dependent spectroscopic studies and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the morphological dimension reduction and In&#8211;Bi alloying effect together boost the radiative pathway of the self&#8208;trapped excitons of the alloyed double perovskite NPLs.

The outstanding optical properties can be well explained by temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy study and first-principal density functional theory calculations. The as-prepared alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets exhibit unprecedent stability toward air and polar solvents.

&lt;p&gt;Lead-free double perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials with potential to be integrated into a wide range of optical and optoelectronic applications. Herein, the first synthesis of 2D Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgIn&lt;i&gt;

The obtained NPLs show unique optical properties with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.1%. Both temperature dependent spectroscopic studies and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the morphological dimension reduction and In&#8211;Bi alloying effect together boost the radiative pathway of the self-trapped excitons of the alloyed double perovskite NPLs. Moreover, the NPLs exhibit good stability under ambient conditions and against polar solvents, which is ideal for all solution-processing of the materials in low-cost device manufacturing. The first solution-processed light-emitting diodes is demonstrated using the Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgIn&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; alloyed double perovskite NPLs as the sole emitting component, showing luminance maximum of 58&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and peak current efficiency of 0.013&#160;cd A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Encoded Structural Color Microneedle Patches for Multiple Screening of Wound Small Molecules</title>

Abstract
Detection of biomarkers associated with wound conditions provides in&#8208;depth healthcare information and benefits wound healing treatment. The current aim of wound detection is to achieve in situ multiple detections. Novel encoded structural color microneedle patches (EMNs) combining photonic crystals (PhCs) and microneedle arrays (MNs) for multiple wound biomarker detection in situ are described here. Using a partitioned and layered casting strategy, the EMNs can be divided into different modules and each serves for the detection of small molecules , including pH, glucose, and histamine. pH sensing is based on the interaction between hydrogen ions and carboxyl groups from hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAM); glucose sensing is achieved with the help of glucose&#8208;responsive fluorophenylboronic acid (FPBA); while histamine sensing relies on specific recognition of aptamers and target molecules. Owing to the responsive volume change of these three modules in the presence of target molecules, the EMNs can create structural color change and characteristic peak shift of the PhCs, thus realizing the qualitative measurement of target molecules with a spectrum analyzer. It is further demonstrated that the EMNs behave well in the multivariate detection of rat wound molecules. These features indicate that the EMNs can be valuable smart detection systems for wound status screening.

         <title>A Superconducting Micro&#8208;Magnetometer for Quantum Vortex in Superconducting Nanoflakes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting quantum interferometer devices are important in investigating magnetic properties in quantum materials, but cannot probe micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Based on the superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer, the density of vortex pinning centers in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 nanoflake can be determined as 1.1 &#215; 1012 m&#8722;2. This superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer sheds light on the detection of small magnetic signals of nanoflakes.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum interferometer device (SQUID) plays a key role in understanding electromagnetic properties and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The technological appeal of SQUID is that its detection accuracy for the electromagnetic signal can precisely reach the quantum level of a single magnetic flux. However, conventional SQUID techniques normally can only be applied to a bulky sample and do not have the capability to probe the magnetic properties of micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Herein, it is demonstrated that, based on a specially designed superconducting nano&#8208;hole array, the contactless detection of magnetic properties and quantized vortices in micro&#8208;sized superconducting nanoflakes is realized. An anomalous hysteresis loop and a suppression of Little&#8211;Parks oscillation are observed in the detected magnetoresistance signal, which originates from the disordered distribution of the pinned vortices in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948;. Therefore, the density of pinning centers of the quantized vortices on such micro&#8208;sized superconducting samples can be quantitatively evaluated, which is technically inaccessible for conventional SQUID detection. The superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer provides a new approach to exploring mesoscopic electromagnetic phenomena of quantum materials.

         <title>The First Demonstration of Strain&#8208;Controlled Periodic Ferroelectric Domains with Superior Piezoelectric Response in Molecular Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By applying tensile strain to the thin film of molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3), a large area of highly ordered periodic domain structures can be obtained. The density and width of these periodic domains can be adjusted by the magnitude of strain and the thickness of the film, respectively, and the piezoelectric response at the domain wall is enhanced.








Abstract
Achieving a periodic domain structure in ferroelectric materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions has always been a hot topic. However, methods to construct periodic domain structures, such as epitaxial growth, direct writing by scanning tips, and the patterned electrode method, are difficult or inefficient to implement in emerging molecular ferroelectrics, which have the advantages of lightweight, flexibility, biocompatibility, etc. An efficient method for constructing and controlling periodic domain structures is urgently needed to facilitate the development of molecular ferroelectrics in nanoelectronic devices. In this work, it is demonstrated that large&#8208;area, periodic and controllable needle&#8208;like domain structures can be achieved in thin films of the molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3) upon the application of tensile strain. The domain evolution under various tensile strains can be clearly observed, and such processes are accordingly identified. Furthermore, the domain wall exhibits a superior piezoelectric response, with up to fivefold enhancement compared to that of the pristine samples. Such large&#8208;area tunable periodic domain structure and abnormally strong piezoresponse are not only of great interests in fundamental studies, but also highly important in the future applications in functional molecular materials.

         <title>The Emerging Layered Hydroxide Plates with Record Thickness for Enhanced High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the NH4+ and F&#8722; synergy mechanism, the intrinsic growth limit of &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 is broken,&#160;realizing record&#8208;level thickness (over 700&#160;nm) for the tailored F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) superstructure. The ultrathick plate superstructure is found to have a versatile family, which can open a new era of novel energy&#8208;storage materials to meet various future demands.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the development of layered&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrodes, but the low active mass ratio impedes its all&#8208;around energy&#8208;storage applications. Herein, the intrinsic limit of layered hydroxides is broken by engineering F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) plates with a sub&#8208;micrometer thickness (over 700&#160;nm), producing a superhigh mass loading of 29.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 on the carbon substrate. Theoretical calculation and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH shares the &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2&#8208;like structure with slightly tuned lattice parameters. More interestingly, the synergy modulation of NH4+ and F&#8722; is found to serve as the key enabler to tailor these sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thickness 2D plates thanks to the modification effects on the (001) plane surface energy and local OH&#8722; concentration. Guided by this mechanism, the superstructures of bimetallic hydroxides and their derivatives are further developed, revealing they are a versatile family with great promise. The tailored ultrathick phosphide superstructure achieves a superhigh specific capacity of 7144 mC cm&#8722;2 and a superior rate capability (79% at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). This work highlights a multiscale understanding of how exceptional structure modulation happens in low&#8208;dimensional layered materials. The as&#8208;built unique methodology and mechanisms will boost the development of advanced materials to better meet future energy demands.

&lt;p&gt;With the NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; synergy mechanism, the intrinsic growth limit of &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is broken,&#160;realizing record-level thickness (over 700&#160;nm) for the tailored F-substituted &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) superstructure. The ultrathick plate superstructure is found to have a versatile family, which can open a new era of novel energy-storage materials to meet various future demands.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past decade has witnessed the development of layered-hydroxide-based self-supporting electrodes, but the low active mass ratio impedes its all-around energy-storage applications. Herein, the intrinsic limit of layered hydroxides is broken by engineering F-substituted &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) plates with a sub-micrometer thickness (over 700&#160;nm), producing a superhigh mass loading of 29.8&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the carbon substrate. Theoretical calculation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH shares the &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like structure with slightly tuned lattice parameters. More interestingly, the synergy modulation of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is found to serve as the key enabler to tailor these sub-micrometer-thickness 2D plates thanks to the modification effects on the (001) plane surface energy and local OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration. Guided by this mechanism, the superstructures of bimetallic hydroxides and their derivatives are further developed, revealing they are a versatile family with great promise. The tailored ultrathick phosphide superstructure achieves a superhigh specific capacity of 7144 mC cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a superior rate capability (79% at 50&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This work highlights a multiscale understanding of how exceptional structure modulation happens in low-dimensional layered materials. The as-built unique methodology and mechanisms will boost the development of advanced materials to better meet future energy demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Van der Waals Epitaxy Growth of 2D Single&#8208;Element Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2D single&#8208;element cobalt nanosheets with a sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy is demonstrated for the first time, which is guaranteed by the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization. Cobalt nanosheets exhibit significant in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy and magnetoresistance effects, opening up exciting opportunities for the exploration of 2D single&#8208;element magnetism.








Abstract
2D single&#8208;element materials, which are pure and intrinsically homogeneous on the nanometer scale, can cut the time&#8208;consuming material&#8208;optimization process and circumvent the impure phase, bringing about opportunities to explore new physics and applications. Herein, for the first time, the synthesis of ultrathin cobalt single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets with a sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy is demonstrated. The thickness can be as low as &#8776;6&#160;nm. Theoretical calculations reveal their intrinsic ferromagnetic nature and epitaxial mechanism: that is, the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization dominates the growth process. Cobalt nanosheets exhibit ultrahigh&#160;blocking temperatures above 710 K and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Electrical transport measurements further reveal that cobalt nanosheets have significant magnetoresistance (MR) effect, and can realize a unique coexistence of positive MR and negative MR under different magnetic field configurations, which can be attributed to the competition and cooperation effect among ferromagnetic interaction, orbital scattering, and electronic correlation. These results provide a valuable case for synthesizing 2D elementary metal crystals with pure phase and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and pave the way for investigating new physics and related applications in spintronics.

         <title>Quantifiable Relationship Between Antibacterial Efficacy and Electro&#8211;Mechanical Intervention on Nanowire Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantifiable relationship between biophysical force and antibacterial efficiency is demonstrated. Electrical interactions not only supplement mechanical damage by accentuating the electrostatic attraction between the bacteria and implant surface, but also facilitate electron flow from the bacteria to the materials to boost production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. This principle aids the development of non&#8208;leaching antibacterial implant materials with clinical significance.








Abstract
Physical disruption is an important antibacterial means as it is lethal to bacteria without spurring antimicrobial resistance. However, it is very challenging to establish a quantifiable relationship between antibacterial efficacy and physical interactions such as mechanical and electrical forces. Herein, titanium nitride (TN) nanowires with adjustable orientations and capacitances are prepared to exert gradient electro&#8211;mechanical forces on bacteria. While vertical nanowires show the strongest mechanical force resulting in an antibacterial efficiency of 0.62 log reduction (vs 0.22 for tiled and 0.36 for inclined nanowires, respectively), the addition of electrical charges maximizes the electro&#8211;mechanical interactions and elevates the antibacterial efficacy to more than 3 log reduction. Biophysical and biochemical analyses indicate that electrostatic attraction by electrical charge narrows the interface. The electro&#8211;mechanical intervention more easily stiffens and rips the bacteria membrane, disturbing the electron balance and generating intracellular oxidative stress. The antibacterial ability is maintained in vivo and bacteria&#8208;challenged rats are protected from serious infection. The physical bacteria&#8208;killing process demonstrated here can be controlled by adjusting the electro&#8211;mechanical interactions. Overall, these results revealed important principles for rationally designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial interfaces for clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Scanning Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Microscopy for Polar Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput scanning second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation microscope with automatic partitioning, accurate positioning, and fast scanning is developed. The microscope&#160;is capable of rapidly screening high&#8208;throughput polar materials without common artifacts arising from leakage current and electrostatic interference, and is successfully applied to compositional&#8208;gradient as well as thickness&#8208;gradient polar materials to demonstrate its high&#8208;throughput capabilities.








Abstract
The Materials Genome Initiative aims to discover, develop, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials at twice the speed of conventional approaches. To achieve this, high&#8208;throughput characterization is essential for the rapid screening of candidate materials. In this study, a high&#8208;throughput scanning second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation microscope with automatic partitioning, accurate positioning, and fast scanning is developed that can rapidly probe and screen polar materials. Using this technique, typical ferroelectrics, including periodically poled lithium niobate crystals and PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films are first investigated, whereby the microscopic domain structures are clearly revealed. This technique is then applied to a compositional&#8208;gradient (100&#8722;x)%BaTiO3&#8722;x%SrTiO3 film and a thickness&#8208;gradient PZT film to demonstrate its high&#8208;throughput capabilities. Since the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation signal is correlated with the macroscopic remnant polarization over the probed region determined by the laser spot, it is free of artifacts arising from leakage current and electrostatic interference, while materials&#8217; symmetries and domain structures must be carefully considered in the data analysis. It is believed that this work can help promote the high&#8208;throughput development of polar materials and contribute to the Materials Genome Initiative.

         <title>Doping by Design: Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of GeSe Alloys Through Metavalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common denominator for successful dopants of GeSe is revealed, which is related to metavalent bonding. These dopants can simply be identified in a chemical bonding map. The metavalently bonded GeSe shows strong lattice anharmonicity, a low band effective mass, and a large Fermi surface complexity factor, leading to significantly improved thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Doping is usually the first step to tailor thermoelectrics. It enables precise control of the charge&#8208;carrier concentration and concomitant transport properties. Doping should also turn GeSe, which features an intrinsically a low carrier concentration, into a competitive thermoelectric. Yet, elemental doping fails to improve the carrier concentration. In contrast, alloying with Ag&#8211;V&#8211;VI2 compounds causes a remarkable enhancement of thermoelectric performance. This advance is closely related to a transition in the bonding mechanism, as evidenced by sudden changes in the optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, the Born effective charge, the maximum of the optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), and the bond&#8208;breaking behavior. These property changes are indicative of the formation of metavalent bonding (MVB), leading to an octahedral&#8208;like atomic arrangement. MVB is accompanied by a thermoelectric&#8208;favorable band structure featuring anisotropic bands with small effective masses and a large degeneracy. A quantum&#8208;mechanical map, which distinguishes different types of chemical bonding, reveals that orthorhombic GeSe employs covalent bonding, while rhombohedral and cubic GeSe utilize MVB. The transition from covalent to MVB goes along with a pronounced improvement in thermoelectric performance. The failure or success of different dopants can be explained by this concept, which redefines doping rules and provides a &#8220;treasure map&#8221; to tailor p&#8208;bonded chalcogenides.

A quantum-mechanical map, which distinguishes different types of chemical bonding, reveals that orthorhombic GeSe employs covalent bonding, while rhombohedral and cubic GeSe utilize MVB. The transition from covalent to MVB goes along with a pronounced improvement in thermoelectric performance. The failure or success of different dopants can be explained by this concept, which redefines doping rules and provides a &#8220;treasure map&#8221; to tailor p-bonded chalcogenides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Induced Optimization Mechanism for an Ultrathin&#8208;Strut Biodegradable Zn&#8208;Based Vascular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin&#8208;strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#181;m) design in durable metallic vascular stents remains challengeable in biodegradable scaffolds. In this work, a zinc&#8208;based scaffold with a 65&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick strut and adequate radial force isn achieved via introducing trace amounts of lithium (Li). The scaffold's ultrafine microstructure, which contains nanoscale Li&#8208;containing phases, alters its biodegradable behavior and enhances its biofunction for vessel healing.








Abstract
To reduce incidences of in&#8208;stent restenosis and thrombosis, the use of a thinner&#8208;strut stent has been clinically proven to be effective. Therefore, the contemporary trend is toward the use of ultrathin&#8208;strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#181;m) designs for durable stents. However, stents made from biodegradable platforms have failed to achieve intergenerational breakthroughs due to their excessively thick struts. Here, microalloying is used to create an ultrathin&#8208;strut (65&#160;&#181;m) zinc (Zn) scaffold with modified biodegradation behavior and improved biofunction, by adding lithium (Li). The scaffold backbone consists of an ultrafine&#8208;grained Zn matrix (average grain diameter 2.28&#160;&#181;m) with uniformly distributed nanoscale Li&#8208;containing phases. Grain refinement and precipitation strengthening enable it to achieve twice the radial strength with only 40% of the strut thickness of the pure Zn scaffold. Adding Li alters the thermodynamic formation pathways of products during scaffold biodegradation, creating an alkaline microenvironment. Li2CO3&#160;may actively stabilize this microenvironment due to its higher solubility and better buffering capability than Zn products. The co&#8208;release of ionic zinc and lithium enhances the beneficial differential effects on activities of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, resulting in good endothelialization and limited intimal hyperplasia in porcine coronary arteries. The findings here may break the predicament of the next&#8208;generation biodegradable scaffolds.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Incorporated Mg&#8208;Ion Solvation Modulation Enables Fast Magnesium Storage Kinetics of Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion in the Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure of the borate&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte enables the fast magnesium storage kinetics of the conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The as&#8208;prepared copper selenide cathode achieved a more than twofold capacity increase at a high rate and the highest reversible capacities compared to those of the previously reported metal selenide cathodes.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the prominent advantages of magnesium metal anodes. Nevertheless, their application is hindered by sluggish Mg&#8208;ion storage kinetics in cathodes, although various structural modifications of cathode materials have been performed. Herein, an electrolyte design using an anion&#8208;incorporated Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure is developed to promote the Mg&#8208;ion storage reactions of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The addition of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion (OTf&#8722;) in the ether&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte modulates the solvation structure of Mg2+ from [Mg(DME)3]2+ to [Mg(DME)2.5OTf]+ (DME = dimethoxy ethane), which facilitates Mg&#8208;ion desolvation and thus significantly expedites the charge transfer of the cathode material. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CuSe cathode material on copper current collector exhibits a considerable increase in magnesium storage capacity from 61% (228 mAh g&#8208;1) to 95% (357 mAh g&#8208;1) of the theoretical capacity at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and a more than twofold capacity increase at a high current density of 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This work provides an efficient strategy via electrolyte modulation to achieve high&#8208;rate conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for RMBs. The incorporation of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion in the Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure of the borate&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte enables the fast magnesium storage kinetics of the conversion&#8208;type cathode materials.

         <title>Multileveled Hierarchical Hydrogel with Continuous Biophysical and Biochemical Gradients for Enhanced Repair of Full&#8208;Thickness Osteochondral Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multileveled continuous gradient hydrogel is developed by inserting gradedly distributed MagHA, mechanical, and magnetism gradients simultaneously in double&#8208;network (DN) hydrogel via a brief exposure of a magneto field using the computed and optimized parameter. Such gradient hierarchically triggers bi&#8208;directional (cartilage&#8208;subchondral bone) differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) rearrangement to repair full&#8208;thickness osteochondral tissue.








Abstract
The repair of hierarchical osteochondral defect requires sophisticated gradient reestablishment; however, few strategies for continuous gradient casting consider the relevance to clinical practice regarding cell adaptability, multiple gradient elements, and precise gradient mirroring native tissue. Here, a hydrogel with continuous gradients in nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (HA) content, mechanical, and magnetism is developed using synthesized superparamagnetic HA nanorods (MagHA) that easily respond to a brief magnetic field. To precisely reconstruct osteochondral tissue, the optimized gradient mode is calculated according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy rabbit knees. Then, MagHA are patterned to form continuous biophysical and biochemical gradients, consequently generating incremental HA, mechanical, and electromagnetic cues under an external magnetic stimulus. To make such depth&#8208;dependent biocues work, an adaptable hydrogel is developed to facilitate cell infiltration. Furthermore, this approach is applied in rabbit full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects equipped with a local magnetic field. Surprisingly, this multileveled gradient composite hydrogel repairs osteochondral unit in a perfect heterogeneous feature, which mimics the gradual cartilage&#8208;to&#8208;subchondral transition. Collectively, this is the first study that combines an adaptable hydrogel with magneto&#8208;driven MagHA gradients to achieve promising outcomes in osteochondral regeneration.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulated 2D ReSe2: A Universal Platform Boostin Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level regulated ReSe2 nanosheets serve as the general platform to significantly advance the photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductors, such as TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4, and C3N4. The outstanding activity is attributed to the existence of abundant Re/Se active sites and strongly coupled interface between atomic&#8208;level regulated ReSe2 and the semiconductor photocatalyst.








Abstract
Solar hydrogen (H2) generation via photocatalytic water splitting is practically promising, environmentally benign, and sustainably carbon neutral. It is important therefore to understand how to controllably engineer photocatalysts at the atomic level. In this work, atomic&#8208;level engineering of defected ReSe2 nanosheets (NSs) is reported to significantly boost photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductor photocatalysts including TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4, and C3N4. Advanced characterizations, such as atomic&#8208;resolution aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, and transient&#8208;state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, together with theoretical computations confirm that the strongly coupled ReSe2/TiO2 interface and substantial atomic&#8208;level active sites of defected ReSe2 NSs result in the significantly raised activity of ReSe2/TiO2. This work not only for the first time realizes the atomic&#8208;level engineering of ReSe2 NSs as a versatile platform to significantly raise the activities on different photocatalysts, but, more importantly, underscores the immense importance of atomic&#8208;level synthesis and exploration on 2D materials for energy conversion and storage.

Advanced characterizations, such as atomic-resolution aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM), synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient-state surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, and transient-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, together with theoretical computations confirm that the strongly coupled ReSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface and substantial atomic-level active sites of defected ReSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs result in the significantly raised activity of ReSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work not only for the first time realizes the atomic-level engineering of ReSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs as a versatile platform to significantly raise the activities on different photocatalysts, but, more importantly, underscores the immense importance of atomic-level synthesis and exploration on 2D materials for energy conversion and storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ethanol&#8208;Induced Ni2+&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Organic Frameworks on Vanadium Pentoxide for Synergistically Enhancing the Performance of 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>

The hollow structure is synthesized by controlling the amount of Ni doping by using the different coordination abilities of Ni2+ and Co2+ with N and O atoms and the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the 3D structure of ZIF&#8208;67. The composite material applied to 3D printing micro supercapacitor has excellent specific capacitance and energy density.








Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites with high energy density and excellent mechanical strength is limited by the degree of lattice matching and crystal surface structure. In this study, dodecahedral ZIF&#8208;67 is synthesized uniformly on vanadium pentoxide nanowires. The influence of the coordination mode on the surface of ZIF&#8208;67 in ethanol is also investigated. Benefitting from the different coordination abilities of Ni2+, Co2+, and N atoms, spatially separated surface&#8208;active sites are created through metal&#8208;ion exchange. Furthermore, the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure of ZIF&#8208;67 afforded the synthesis of hollow structures by controlling the amount of Ni doping. The formation of NiCo&#8208;MOF@CoOOH@V2O5 nanocomposites is confirmed using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis. The high performance of the obtained composite is illustrated by fabricating a 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;supercapacitor, exhibiting a high area specific capacitance of 585 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 159.23 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2 (at power density = 0.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The solvent/coordination tuning strategy demonstrated in this study provides a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage applications.

         <title>Fibro&#8208;Gel: An All&#8208;Aqueous Hydrogel Consisting of Microfibers with Tunable Release Profile and its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable fibro&#8208;gel with controllable physicochemical properties and tunable drug release rates is demonstrated. The release of distinct drugs at different rates from fibro&#8208;gels can accelerate wound healing with high efficiency. These properties enable precise tailoring of the fibro&#8208;gel for potential applications, such as in situ tissue engineering.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are valuable tools in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their unique advantages of injectability with minimal invasiveness and usability for irregularly shaped sites. However, it remains challenging to achieve scalable manufacturing together with matching physicochemical properties and on&#8208;demand drug release for a high level of control over biophysical and biomedical cues to direct endogenous cells. Here, the use of an injectable fibro&#8208;gel is demonstrated, a water&#8208;filled network of entangled hydrogel microfibers, whose physicochemical properties and drug release profiles can be tailored to overcome these shortcomings. This fibro&#8208;gel exhibits favorable in vitro biocompatibility and the capability to aid vascularization. The potential use of the fibro&#8208;gel for advancing tissue regeneration is explored with a mice excision skin model. Preliminary in vivo tests indicate that the fibro&#8208;gel promotes wound healing and new healthy tissue regeneration at a faster rate than a commercial gel. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the release of distinct drugs at different rates can further accelerate wound healing with higher efficiency, by using a two&#8208;layer fibro&#8208;gel model. The combination of injectability and tailorable properties of this fibro&#8208;gel offers a promising approach in biomedical fields such as therapeutic delivery, medical dressings, and 3D tissue scaffolds for tissue engineering.

         <title>2D Nano&#8208;Sonosensitizers Facilitate Energy Transfer to Enhance Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D metal&#8211;organic nano&#8208;sonosensitizers are constructed from photosensitizing iridium&#8208;based linkers and surface&#8208;anchored porphyrin sonosensitizers to absorb high&#8208; and low&#8208;energy regions of sonoluminescence, respectively. The excited iridium&#8208;based linkers undergo triplet&#8211;triplet Dexter energy transfer to porphyrin sonosensitizers for efficient singlet oxygen generation, leading to greatly enhanced sonodynamic therapy efficacy over free sonosensitizers in mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer.








Abstract
Although sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown promise for cancer treatment, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers (SSs) has limited the clinical application of SDT. Here, a new strategy is reported for designing efficient nano&#8208;sonosensitizers based on 2D nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). Composed of Hf&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) and iridium&#8208;based linkers, the MOL is anchored with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (TBP) sensitizers on the SBUs to afford TBP@MOL. TBP@MOL shows 14.1&#8208; and 7.4&#8208;fold higher singlet oxygen (1O2) generation than free TBP ligands and Hf&#8208;TBP, a 3D nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework, respectively. The 1O2 generation of TBP@MOL is enhanced by isolating TBP SSs on the SBUs of the MOL, which prevents&#160;aggregation&#8208;induced quenching of the excited sensitizers, and by triplet&#8211;triplet Dexter energy transfer between excited iridium&#8208;based linkers and TBP SSs, which more efficiently harnesses broad&#8208;spectrum sonoluminescence. Anchoring TBP on the MOL surface also enhances the energy transfer between the excited sensitizer and ground&#8208;state triplet oxygen to increase 1O2 generation efficacy. In mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer, TBP@MOL demonstrates significantly higher SDT efficacy than Hf&#8208;TBP and TBP. This work uncovers a new strategy to design effective nano&#8208;sonosensitizers by facilitating energy transfer to efficiently capture broad&#8208;spectrum sonoluminescence and enhance 1O2 generation.

         <title>A Whole&#8208;Course&#8208;Repair System Based on Neurogenesis&#8208;Angiogenesis Crosstalk and Macrophage Reprogramming Promotes Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis crosstalk and macrophage reprogramming can pave way for the next generation of regenerative hydrogels to accelerate the recovery of chronic wounds. The work presents a novel approach to deliver drug&#8208;loaded extracellular vesicles and magnesium ions by an in situ injectable hydrogel for concurrent supportive cycles of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment to heal diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Diabetic wound (DW) therapy is currently a big challenge in medicine and strategies to enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis have appeared to be a promising direction. However, the current treatments have failed to coordinate neurogenesis and angiogenesis simultaneously, leading to an increased disability rate caused by DWs. Herein, a whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system is introduced by a hydrogel to concurrently achieve a mutually supportive cycle of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment. This hydrogel can first be one&#8208;step packaged in a syringe for later in situ local injections to cover wounds long&#8208;termly for accelerated wound healing via the synergistic effect of magnesium ions (Mg2+) and engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The self&#8208;healing and bio&#8208;adhesive properties of the hydrogel make it an ideal physical barrier for DWs. At the inflammation stage, the formulation can recruit bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells to the wound sites and stimulate them toward neurogenic differentiation, while providing a favorable immune microenvironment via macrophage reprogramming. At the proliferation stage of wound repair, robust angiogenesis occurs by the synergistic effect of the newly differentiated neural cells and the released Mg2+, allowing a regenerative neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis cycle to take place at the wound site. This whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system provides a novel platform for combined DW therapy.

However, the current treatments have failed to coordinate neurogenesis and angiogenesis simultaneously, leading to an increased disability rate caused by DWs. Herein, a whole-course-repair system is introduced by a hydrogel to concurrently achieve a mutually supportive cycle of neurogenesis-angiogenesis under a favorable immune-microenvironment. This hydrogel can first be one-step packaged in a syringe for later in situ local injections to cover wounds long-termly for accelerated wound healing via the synergistic effect of magnesium ions (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The self-healing and bio-adhesive properties of the hydrogel make it an ideal physical barrier for DWs. At the inflammation stage, the formulation can recruit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to the wound sites and stimulate them toward neurogenic differentiation, while providing a favorable immune microenvironment via macrophage reprogramming. At the proliferation stage of wound repair, robust angiogenesis occurs by the synergistic effect of the newly differentiated neural cells and the released Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, allowing a regenerative neurogenesis-angiogenesis cycle to take place at the wound site. This whole-course-repair system provides a novel platform for combined DW therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Multiplexed Cell Capture
Harvesting cells from biomaterials for downstream analysis without perturbing their state represents an outstanding challenge in 3D/4D culture and tissue engineering. In article number 2209904, Cole A. DeForest and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that engineered sortase transpeptidases can be used to selectively grade and recover single&#8208;cell suspensions from specific subvolumes of hydrogel multimaterials, permitting multiplexed cell capture with largely &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; cues.

Jellybean Quantum Dots
Highly elliptical, elongated, quantum dots&#8212;so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dots&#8212;can be used for qubit&#8211;qubit coupling over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances and alleviate crowding in scaled&#8208;up quantum processors, as described by Zeheng Wang, Arne Laucht, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2208557. The cover illustration shows an artist's impression of two spin qubits in silicon metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor quantum dots that are coupled through such a jellybean coupler.

Exotic Superconductivity
In article number 2207841, Fucong Fei, Zhicheng Zhong, Fengqi Song, Xuefeng Wang, and co&#8208;workers report boosted superconductivity with a transition temperature of about 7.5 K in Ta&#8208;doped MoTe2 single crystals under ambient pressure. An enhanced upper critical field beyond the Pauli limit is also observed in Ta&#8208;doped Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2, which is likely due to the mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity.

Stem Cell Lineage Fate
Highly accurate, efficient, and convenient evaluation for biomaterial&#8208;induced stem cell lineage fate is pivotal for regenerative biomaterials research. In article number 2210637, Binbin Lai, Xuehui Zhang, Xuliang Deng, and co&#8208;workers report MeD&#8208;P, a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;supported intelligent evaluation model, for predicting human mesenchymal stem cell&#8211;biomaterial interaction based on RNA&#8208;seq data. This framework shows the potential of artificial intelligence in facilitating biological performance optimization of biomaterials in stem cell lineage fate regulation.

Volumetric 3D Printing
In volumetric 3D printing, the whole 3D object is developed simultaneously (i.e., volume&#8208;at&#8208;once) by means of light&#8208;induced crosslinking of a (rotating) liquid resin, as reported by Sandra Van Vlierberghe and co&#8208;workers in article number 2210136. The 3D&#8208;structure illustrated in the image is based on the chemical network structure of the reported thiol&#8211;ene crosslinked poly(caprolactone) (PCL) network, which can be considered a homogeneous 3D network consisting of telechelic alkene&#8208;functionalized PCL and tetra&#8208;functional thiol crosslinker junctions.

         <title>Artificial Muscles and Soft Robotic Devices for Treatment of End&#8208;Stage Heart Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>

This review discusses the present state and future direction of soft robotic biomedical devices in supporting the inotropic function of the heart, focusing on electrothermally artificial heart muscles. The current state of the ventricular assist devices and the key factors for the development of a full soft robotic ventricular assist device were discussed.








Abstract
Medical soft robotics constitutes a rapidly developing field in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, with a promising future for millions of patients suffering from heart failure worldwide. Herein, the present state and future direction of artificial muscle&#8208;based soft robotic biomedical devices in supporting the inotropic function of the heart are reviewed, focusing on the emerging electrothermally artificial heart muscles (AHMs). Artificial muscle powered soft robotic devices can mimic the action of complex biological systems such as heart compression and twisting. These artificial muscles possess the ability to undergo complex deformations, aiding cardiac function while maintaining a limited weight and use of space. Two very promising candidates for artificial muscles are electrothermally actuated AHMs and biohybrid actuators using living cells or tissue embedded with artificial structures. Electrothermally actuated AHMs have demonstrated superior force generation while creating the prospect for fully soft robotic actuated ventricular assist devices. This review will critically analyze the limitations of currently available devices and discuss opportunities and directions for future research. Last, the properties of the cardiac muscle are reviewed and compared with those of different materials suitable for mechanical cardiac compression.

         <title>Shaping a Soft Future: Patterning Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping liquid metals down to the sub&#8208;micrometer scale has enabled a wide range of novel soft and stretchable devices. This review highlights patterning techniques such as injection/vacuum filling, direct ink writing, selective adhesion, and stenciling. Applications are highlighted, followed by a summary of present&#8208;day challenges and opportunities for future development.








Abstract
This review highlights the unique techniques for patterning liquid metals containing gallium (e.g., eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn). These techniques are enabled by two unique attributes of these liquids relative to solid metals: 1) The fluidity of the metal allows it to be injected, sprayed, and generally dispensed. 2) The solid native oxide shell allows the metal to adhere to surfaces and be shaped in ways that would normally be prohibited due to surface tension. The ability to shape liquid metals into non&#8208;spherical structures such as wires, antennas, and electrodes can enable fluidic metallic conductors for stretchable electronics, soft robotics, e&#8208;skins, and wearables. The key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices are summari.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;based nanomaterials have unique features to be used in tumor traceable immunotherapy in the form of nanocarriers, immunomodulators, and immunoactivators. This review focuses on the recent progress of Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy. It is highly anticipated that Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy can open up a promising avenue in nanomedicine.








Abstract
As an essential micronutrient, manganese (Mn) participates in various physiological processes and plays important roles in host immune system, hematopoiesis, endocrine function, and oxidative stress regulation. Mn&#8208;based nanoparticles are considered to be biocompatible and show versatile applications in nanomedicine, in particular utilized in tumor immunotherapy in the following ways: 1) acting as a biocompatible nanocarrier to deliver immunotherapeutic agents for tumor immunotherapy; 2) serving as an adjuvant to regulate tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy; 3) activating host's immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to trigger tumor immunotherapy; 4) real&#8208;time monitoring tumor immunotherapy effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since Mn2+ ions are ideal MRI contrast agent which can significantly enhance the T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal after binding to proteins. This comprehensive review focuses on the most recent progress of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms in tumor immunotherapy. The characteristics of Mn are first discussed to guide the design of Mn&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatforms. Then the biomedical applications of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of Mn&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are highlighted.

Recent advances on lactate oxidase (LOx)&#8208;based biosensors are summarized, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;based, oxygen (O2)2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical, for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies, including lactate&#8208;depletion&#8208;based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy, H2O2&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy, are discussed.








Abstract
Lactate oxidase (LOx) has attracted extensive interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy in recent years owing to its specific catalysis on l&#8208;lactate; its catalytic process consumes oxygen (O2) and generates a large amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and pyruvate. Given high levels of lactate in tumor tissues and its tight correlation with tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence, LOx&#8208;based biosensors including H2O2&#8208;based, O2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical have been designed for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies including lactate&#8208;depletion&#8208;based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy, H2O2&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy have also been developed. In this review, the lactate&#8208;specific catalytic properties of LOx are introduced, and the recent advances on LOx&#8208;instructed cancer diagnostic or therapeutic platforms and corresponding biological applications are summarized. Additionally, the challenges and potential of LOx&#8208;based nanomedicines are highlighted.

Research on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is currently transitioning from lab&#8208;scale fundamental study to industry&#8208;scale application research. This review provides a timely summary of the current progress on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, analyzes their technical challenges, and outlines future research targets for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries have piqued global research interest because of their unprecedented safety and high energy density. Significant advances have been made in achieving high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and good air stability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the challenges at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, and developing feasible manufacturing processes. Along with the advances in fundamental study, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells using inorganic SSEs have been widely demonstrated, revealing their immense potential for industrialization. This review provides an overview of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, focusing on ultrathin SSE membranes, sheet&#8208;type thick solid&#8208;state electrodes, and bipolar stacking. Moreover, several critical parameters directly influencing the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are outlined. Finally, perspectives on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells are provided and specific metrics to meet certain energy density targets are specified. This review looks to facilitate the development of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells with high energy density and excellent safety.

         <title>Clinical Validation of a Wearable Piezoelectric Blood&#8208;Pressure Sensor for Continuous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable piezoelectric blood&#8208;pressure sensor (WPBPS) using an extremely sensitive flexible piezoelectric sensor is demonstrated for continuous and non&#8208;invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring. Its transfer function is designed by a linear regression model, offering a simple solution to convert the sensor signals into BP values. The high accuracy of WPBPS is confirmed through clinical validation with an oscillometric sphygmomanometer as a reference.








Abstract
Wearable blood&#8208;pressure sensors have recently attracted attention as healthcare devices for continuous non&#8208;invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring. However, the accuracy of wearable blood&#8208;pressure (BP) monitoring devices has been controversial due to the low signal quality of sensors, the absence of an accurate transfer function to convert the sensor signals into BP values, and the lack of clinical validation regarding measurement precision. Here, a wearable piezoelectric blood&#8208;pressure sensor (WPBPS) is reported, which achieves a high normalized sensitivity (0.062 kPa&#8722;1), and fast response time (23&#160;ms) for CNAP monitoring. The transfer function of a linear regression model is designed, offering a simple solution to convert the flexible piezoelectric sensor signals into BP values. In order to verify the measurement accuracy of WPBPS, clinical trials are performed on 35 subjects aged from 20 to 80 s after screening. The mean difference between the WPBPS and a commercial sphygmomanometer of 175 BP data pairs is &#8722;0.89 &#177; 6.19 and &#8722;0.32 &#177; 5.28&#160;mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. By building a WPBPS&#8208;embedded wristwatch, the potentially promising use of a convenient, portable, continuous BP monitoring system for cardiovascular disease diagnosis is demonstrated.

         <title>A light&#8208;programmed rewritable lattice&#8208;mediated multistate memory for high&#8208;density data storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Mainstream non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) devices based on floating gate structures or phase&#8208;change/ferroelectric materials face inherent limitations that compromise their suitability for long&#8208;term data storage. To address this challenge, a novel memory device based on light&#8208;programmed lattice engineering of thin ReS2 flakes is proposed. By inducing sulfur vacancies in the ReS2 channel through light illumination, the device's electrical conductivity is modified accordingly and multiple conductance states for data storage therefore are generated. The device exhibits more than 128 distinct states with linearly increasing conductance, corresponding to a 7&#8208;fold increase in storage density. Through further optimization to achieve atomic&#8208;level precision in defect creation, it is possible to achieve even higher storage densities. These states are extremely stable in vacuum or inert ambient showing long retention of &gt;10 years, while they can be erased upon exposure to the air. The ReS2 memory device can maintain its stability over multiple program&#8208;erase operation cycles and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability for incident light in the range of 405&#160;nm &#8764; 785&#160;nm. This device represents a significant contribution to NVM technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter&#8208;free color image recorder applications.

         <title>Augmenting Immunogenic Cell Death and Alleviating Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells by Sono&#8208;Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Nanopartners for Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) by sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is promising for cancer immunotherapy, which however is inefficient due to oxygen depletion that compromises SDT effect and mediates recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The fabrication of sono&#8208;activatable semiconducting polymer nanopartners (SPNTi) to simultaneously augment ICD and alleviate MDSCs for immunotherapy is reported. A sonodynamic semiconducting polymer, hydrophobic hypoxia&#8208;responsive tirapazamine (TPZ)&#8208;conjugate, and MDSC&#8208;targeting drug (ibrutinib) are encapsulated inside such SPNTi with surface shell of a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;cleavable amphiphilic polymer. TPZ and ibrutinib serve as drug partners to enlarge immunotherapeutic effect. Upon sono&#8208;activation, SPNTi generate 1O2 to break 1O2&#8208;cleavable polymers for in&#8208;situ liberations of TPZ&#8208;conjugate and ibrutinib in tumor sites, and oxygen is consumed to create severer hypoxic tumor microenvironment, in which, TPZ&#8208;conjugate is activated for augmenting ICD action, while ibrutinib alleviates MDSCs for promoting antitumor immunological effect. In a bilateral tumor mouse model, SPNTi&#8208;mediated sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapy results in growth restraints of primary and distant tumors and noteworthy precaution of tumor metastases. This study thus provides a sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic strategy with high precision and safety for cancer via overcoming post&#8208;treatment hypoxia and targeting MDSCs.

         <title>Semiconductor Thermal and Electrical Properties Decoupled by Localized Phonon Resonances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of semiconductor membranes is reduced by coupling heat&#8208;carrying phonons with localized phonon resonances in deposited nanopillars. This full&#8208;spectrum resonance&#8208;hybridization mechanism decouples the electrical properties of the membrane from its thermal properties, paving the way for novel thermoelectric materials and device designs. The experimental results are a manifestation of nanophononic metamaterial effects previously shown in molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials convert heat into electricity through thermally driven charge transport in solids or vice versa for cooling. To compete with conventional energy&#8208;conversion technologies, a thermoelectric material must possess the properties of both an electrical conductor and a thermal insulator.&#160;However, these properties are normally mutually exclusive because of the interconnection between scattering mechanisms for charge carriers and phonons. Recent theoretical investigations on sub&#8208;device scales have revealed that nanopillars attached to a membrane exhibit a multitude of local phonon resonances, spanning the full spectrum, that couple with the heat&#8208;carrying phonons in the membrane and cause a reduction in the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, with no expected change in the electrical properties because the nanopillars are outside the pathway of voltage generation and charge transport. Here this effect is demonstrated experimentally for the first time by investigating device&#8208;scale suspended silicon membranes with GaN nanopillars grown on the surface. The nanopillars cause up to 21% reduction in the thermal conductivity while the power factor remains unaffected, thus demonstrating an unprecedented decoupling in the semiconductor's thermoelectric properties.&#160;The measured thermal conductivity behavior for coalesced nanopillars and corresponding lattice&#8208;dynamics calculations provide evidence that the reductions are mechanistically tied to the phonon resonances. This finding paves the way for high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state energy recovery and cooling.

To compete with conventional energy-conversion technologies, a thermoelectric material must possess the properties of both an electrical conductor and a thermal insulator.&#160;However, these properties are normally mutually exclusive because of the interconnection between scattering mechanisms for charge carriers and phonons. Recent theoretical investigations on sub-device scales have revealed that nanopillars attached to a membrane exhibit a multitude of local phonon resonances, spanning the full spectrum, that couple with the heat-carrying phonons in the membrane and cause a reduction in the in-plane thermal conductivity, with no expected change in the electrical properties because the nanopillars are outside the pathway of voltage generation and charge transport. Here this effect is demonstrated experimentally for the first time by investigating device-scale suspended silicon membranes with GaN nanopillars grown on the surface. The nanopillars cause up to 21% reduction in the thermal conductivity while the power factor remains unaffected, thus demonstrating an unprecedented decoupling in the semiconductor's thermoelectric properties.&#160;The measured thermal conductivity behavior for coalesced nanopillars and corresponding lattice-dynamics calculations provide evidence that the reductions are mechanistically tied to the phonon resonances. This finding paves the way for high-efficiency solid-state energy recovery and cooling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Anchoring Ultrafine ZnS Nanodots on 2D MXene Nanosheets for Accelerating Polysulfide Redox and Regulating Li Plating</title>

Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery is a promising energy storage system due to its cost effectiveness and high energy density. However, formation of Li dendrites from Li metal anode and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) from S cathode impede its practical application. Herein, ultrafine ZnS nanodots are uniformly grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by a low&#8208;temperature (60&#176;C) hydrothermal method for the first time. Distinctively, the ZnS nanodot decorated MXene nanosheets (ZnS/MXene) can be easily filtered to be a flexible and freestanding film in several minutes. The ZnS/MXene film can be used as a current collector for Li metal anode to promote uniform Li deposition due to the superior lithiophilicity of ZnS nanodots. ZnS/MXene powders obtained by freeze drying can be used as separator decorator to address the shuttle effect of LiPSs due to their excellent adsorbability. Theoretical calculation proves that the existence of ZnS nanodots on MXene can obviously improve the adsorption ability of ZnS/MXene with Li+ and LiPSs. Li&#8722;S full cells with composite Li metal anode and modified separator exhibit remarkable rate and cycling performance. Other transition metal sulfides (CdS, CuS, etc) can be also grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by the low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal strategy.

Abstract
Water utilization is accompanied with the development of human beings, whereas gaseous moisture is usually regarded as an underexploited resource. The advances of highly efficient hygroscopic materials endow atmospheric water harvesting as an intriguing solution to convert moisture into clean water. The discovery of hygroelectricity, which refers to the charge buildup at a material surface dependent on humidity, and the following moisture&#8208;enabled electric generation (MEG) realizes energy conversion and directly outputs electricity. Much progress has been made since then to optimize MEG performance, pushing forward the applications of MEG into a practical level. Herein, the evolvement and development of MEG are systematically summarized in a chronological order. The optimization strategies of MEG are discussed and comprehensively evaluated. Then, the latest applications of MEG are presented, including high&#8208;performance powering units and self&#8208;powered devices. In the end, a perspective on the future development of MEG is given for inspiring more researchers into this promising area.

         <title>Progress and Perspective toward Continuous&#8208;Wave Organic Solid&#8208;State Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic solid&#8208;state laser under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) excitation is one of the most challenging areas in organic optoelectronics. Recent advances in long&#8208;pulsed organic lasers are comprehensively summarized with respect to molecular designs, optical&#8208;resonator architectures, triplet scavenging, and potential triplet&#8208;contribution strategies. Future directions and perspectives for CW operation are discussed.








Abstract
A continuous&#8208;wave (CW) organic solid&#8208;state laser is highly desirable for spectroscopy, sensing, and communications, but is a significant challenge in optoelectronics. The accumulation of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons and relevant excited&#8208;state absorptions, as well as singlet&#8211;triplet annihilation, are the main obstacles to CW lasing. Here, progress in singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;state utilizations in organic gain media is reviewed to reveal the issues in working with triplets. Then, exciton behaviors that inhibit light oscillations during long excitation pulses are discussed. Further, recent advances in increasing organic lasing pulse widths from microseconds toward the indication of CW operation are summarized with respect to molecular designs, advanced resonator architectures, triplet scavenging, and potential triplet contribution strategies. Finally, future directions and perspectives are proposed for achieving stable CW organic lasers with significant triplet contribution.

         <title>Templated 2D Polymer Heterojunctions for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
2D polymers have emerged as one of the most promising classes of organic photocatalysts for solar fuels production due to their tunability, charge transport properties and robustness. They are however difficult to process and so there have been limited studies into the formation of heterojunction materials incorporating these components. In this work w e use a novel templating approach to combine an imine&#8208;based donor polymer and an acceptor polymer formed through Knoevenagel condensation. Heterojunction formation is shown to be highly dependent on the topological match of the donor and acceptor polymers with the most active templated material found to be between 3 and 9 times more active for photocatalysis than its constituent components. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that this improvement is due to faster charge separation and more efficient charge extraction in the templated heterojunction. The templated material shows a very high hydrogen evolution rate of more than 20&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 with an ascorbic acid hole scavenger but also produces hydrogen in the presence of only water and a cobalt based redox mediator. This suggested the improved charge separation interface and reduced trapping accessed through this approach could be suitable for Z&#8208;scheme formation.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Resonant Exciton&#8208;trion Conversion in Electrically Modulated Atomically Thin WS2 at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Excitonic resonance in atomically thin semiconductors offers a favorite platform to study 2D nanophotonics in both classical and quantum regimes and promises potentials for highly tunable and ultra&#8208;compact optical devices. The understanding of charge density dependent exciton&#8208;trion conversion is the key for revealing the underlaying physics of optical tunability. Nevertheless, the insufficient and inefficient light&#8208;matter interactions hinder the observation of trionic phenomenon and the development of excitonic devices for dynamic power&#8208;efficient electro&#8208;optical applications. Here, by engaging an optical cavity with atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), we demonstrate greatly enhanced exciton&#8208;trion conversion at room temperature (RT) and achieve electrical modulation of reflectivity of nearly 40% at exciton and 7% at trion state, which correspondingly enables a broadband large phase tuning in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2). Besides the absorptive conversion, almost 100% photoluminescence conversion from excitons to trions is observed at RT, illustrating a clear physical mechanism of an efficient exciton&#8208;trion conversion for extraordinary optical performance. The results indicate that both excitons and trions can play significant roles in electrical modulation of the optical parameters of TMDCs at RT. The work shows the real possibility for realizing electrical tunable and multi&#8208;functional ultra&#8208;thin optical devices using 2D materials.

Disordered solid&#8208;solution high&#8208;entropy alloys have attracted wide research attention as robust electrocatalysts. In comparison, ordered high&#8208;entropy intermetallic alloys have been hardly explored and the effects of the degree of chemical ordering on catalytic activity remain unknown. In this study, a series of multi&#8208;component intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles with tunable ordering degrees were fabricated. The transformation mechanism of multi&#8208;component nanoparticles from the disordered structure into the ordered structure was revealed at the single&#8208;particle level using aberration&#8208;corrected STEM, which agrees with macroscopic analysis by SAED and XRD. The electrocatalytic performance of Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles correlates well with their crystal structure and electronic structure. It was found that increasing the degree of order promotes electrocatalytic performance. The highly ordered Pt4FeCoCuNi achieves the highest mass activities towards both acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which are 18.9&#8208;fold and 5.6&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The experiment also shows that this catalyst demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability than both partially ordered and disordered Pt4FeCoCuNi as well as Pt/C when subject to both HER and ORR. This ordering&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property relationship provides insight into the rational design of catalysts and stimulates the exploration of many other multi&#8208;component intermetallic alloys.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Removable Solid Additives: Selective Interaction Contributes to Vertical Component Distributions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sequentially deposited organic solar cells (SD&#8208;OSCs) have attracted great attention owing to their ability in achieving more favorable, vertically phase&#8208;separated morphology to avoid the accumulation of counter charges at absorber/transporting layer interfaces. However, the processing of SD&#8208;OSCs is still quite challenging in preventing the penetration of small&#8208;molecule acceptors into the polymer donor layer via erosion or swelling. Herein, solid additives (SAs) with varied electrostatic potential distributions and steric hinderance were introduced into SD&#8208;OSCs to investigate the effect of evaporation dynamics and selective interaction on vertical component distribution. Multiple modellings indicate that the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction dominates the interactions between aromatic SAs and active layer components. Among them, p&#8208;dibromobenzene (DBB) shows a stronger interaction with donor while 2&#8208;chloronaphthalene (2&#8208;CN) interacts more preferably with acceptor. Combining the depth&#8208;dependent morphological study aided by multiple X&#8208;ray scattering methods, we conclude that the evaporation of SAs can drive the stronger&#8208;interaction component upward to the surface, while having minor impact on the overall molecular packing. Ultimately, the 2&#8208;CN&#8208;treated devices with reduced acceptor concentration at the bottom surface deliver a high power conversion efficiency of 19.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of applying selective interactions to improve the vertical morphology of OSCs by using SAs with proper structure.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Long Carrier Lifetime Exceeding 20 &#956;s in Lead Halide Perovskite Film Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The carrier lifetime is one of the key parameters for perovskite solar cells. However, it's still a great challenge to achieve long carrier lifetimes in perovskite films that are comparable with perovskite crystals owning to the large trap density resulting from the unavoidable defects in grain boundaries and surfaces. Here, by regulating the electronic structure with ou r developed 2&#8208;thiopheneformamidinium bromide (ThFABr) combined with the unique film structure of 2D perovskite layer caped 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite film, w e achieved an ultra&#8208;long carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#956;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#956;m. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices to yield a champion efficiency of 24.69% with a minimum VOC loss of 0.33&#160;V. The unencapsulated device retained &#8764;95% of its initial efficiency after 1180&#160;h by max power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light illumination. Our work provides important implications for structured 2D/(2D/3D) perovskite films combined with unique FA&#8208;based spacers to achieve ultralong carrier lifetime for high&#8208;performance PSCs and other optoelectronic applecations.

         <title>Microporogen&#8208;Structured Collagen Matrices for Embedded Bioprinting of Tumor Models for Immuno&#8208;Oncology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Embedded bioprinting enables the rapid design and fabrication of complex tissues that recapitulate in vivo microenvironments. However, few biological matrices enable good print fidelity, while simultaneously facilitate cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Here, we introduce a new microporogen&#8208;structured (&#956;POROS) matrix for embedded bioprinting, in which matrix rheology, printing behavior, and porosity are tailored by adding sacrificial microparticles composed of a gelatin&#8208;chitosan complex to a prepolymer collagen solution. To demonstrate its utility, we created a three&#8208;dimensional tumor model via embedded printing of a murine melanoma cell ink within the &#956;POROS collagen matrix at 4&#176;C. The collagen matrix is subsequently crosslinked around the microparticles upon warming to 21&#160;&#176;C, followed by their melting and removal at 37&#160;&#176;C. This process results in a &#956;POROS matrix with a fibrillar collagen type&#8208;I network akin to that observed in vivo. Printed tumor cells remain viable and proliferate, while antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells incorporated in the matrix migrate to the tumor site, where they induce cell death. The integration of our &#956;POROS matrix with embedded bioprinting opens new avenues for creating complex tissue microenvironments in vitro that may find widespread use in drug discovery, disease modeling, and tissue engineering for therapeutic use.

         <title>Carbon Additive Manufacturing with a Near&#8208;replica &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; Transformation</title>

Abstract
Nanocomposites containing nanoscale materials offer exciting opportunities to encode nanoscale features into macroscale dimensions, which produces unprecedented impacts in material design and application. However,&#160;conventional methods cannot process nanocomposites with a high particle loading, as well as nanocomposites with the ability to be tailored at multiple scales. We report a&#160;Composite Architected Mesoscale Process (CAMP) strategy that brings particle loading nanoscale materials combined with multiscale features including nanoscale manipulation, mesoscale architecture, and macroscale formation to create spatially programmed nanocomposites with high particle loading and multiscale tailorability. The process features a low&#8208;shrinking (&lt;10%) &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation, making a near geometric replica of the 3D design to produce a &#8220;brown&#8221; part with full nanomaterials to allow further matrix infill. Our demonstration includes additively manufactured carbon nanocomposites containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and thermoset epoxy, leading to multiscale CNTs tailorability, performance improvement, and 3D complex geometry feasibility. The&#160;process can produce nanomaterial&#8208;assembled architectures with 3D geometry and multiscale features and can incorporate a wide range of matrix materials, such as polymers, metals, and ceramics, to fabricate nanocomposites for new device structures and applications.

A novel photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;emitting luminescent material ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP is obtained by encapsulating spiropyran molecules into a cadmium&#8208;based MOF,&#160;ZJU&#8208;128. ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP exhibits a switchable dynamic fluorescent behavior under alternating UV&#8208; and visible&#8208;light irradiation, enabling its good potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multiplexed coding.








Abstract
The development of photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials is essential to address emerging demands in encryption security. Here, a novel photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;emitting luminescent material ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP (SP = spiropyran) is reported, which is obtained by encapsulating spiropyran molecules into a cadmium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), [Cd3(TCPP)2]&#183;4DMF&#183;4H2O (ZJU&#8208;128, H4TCPP = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)pyrazine). This MOF/dye composite ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP exhibits a blue emission from the ligand of ZJU&#8208;128 at 447&#160;nm and a red emission around 650&#160;nm from spiropyran. Utilizing the photoisomerization of spiropyran from ring&#8208;closed to ring&#8208;open form under UV&#8208;light irradiation, significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process between ZJU&#8208;128 and spiropyran is achieved. As a result, the blue emission of ZJU&#8208;128 is gradually decreased while the red emission of spiropyran increases. This dynamic fluorescent&#160;behavior can fully recover to the original state following exposure to visible light (&gt;405&#160;nm). By taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent fluorescence, dynamical anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and multiplexed coding are successfully developed based on ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP film. This work provides an inspiring point for the design of information encryption materials with higher security requirements.

         <title>Programming 3D Curves with Discretely Constrained Cylindrical Inflatables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse design method is proposed that outputs geometric parameters for patch&#8208;clad cylindrical inflatables such that they match target 3D curves. The approach uses an initial conceptual solution based on curve kinematics to seed a finite element simulation nested within an optimization algorithm, resulting in excellent curve matching. Demonstrations showcase the utility of bespoke 3D inflatables for robotics applications.








Abstract
Programming inflatable systems to deform to desired 3D&#160;shapes opens up multifarious applications in robotics, morphing architecture, and interventional medicine. This work elicits complex deformations by attaching discrete strain limiters to cylindrical hyperelastic inflatables. Using this system, a method is presented to solve the inverse problem of programming myriad 3D centerline curves upon inflation. The method entails two steps: first, a reduced&#8208;order model generates a conceptual solution giving coarse indications of strain limiter placement on the undeformed cylindrical inflatable. This low&#8208;fidelity solution then seeds a finite element simulation nested within an optimization loop to further tune strain limiter parameters.&#160;We&#160;leverage this framework to achieve functionality through a priori programmed deformations of cylindrical inflatables, including 3D curve matching, self&#8208;tying knotting, and manipulation. The results hold broad significance for the emerging computational design of inflatable systems.

         <title>Organic Persistent RTP Crystals: From Brittle to Flexible by&#160; Tunable Self&#8208;Partitioned Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to solve the trade&#8208;off of &#8220;room&#8208;temperature phosphoresence (RTP)&#8211;flexibility&#8221; in principle,&#160;RTP&#160;crystals with plastic/elastic deformation are achieved by self&#8208;partitioned molecular packing, and&#160;adjusted by the controllable distributions of intermolecular interactions from different directions. An elastic RTP crystal with lifetime of 972.3&#160;ms is achieved as the record, and afterglow delivery is realized by plastic RTP crystals for biomedical optical technology.








Abstract
Aiming to solve the trade&#8208;off of &#8220;room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#8211;flexibility&#8221; in principle, organic RTP crystals with elastic/plastic deformation are realized. These properties are mainly due to the divisional aggregation structures of aromatics and alkoxy chains, and can be modulated by the controllable molecular configurations. The longest RTP lifetime of 972.3&#160;ms is achieved as the highest record for organic flexible crystals. Plastic crystals with persistent RTP are realized, which can be applied into biomedical optical technologies by afterglow delivery. Moreover, the relationship among elastic/plastic deformation, RTP property, and aggregated structures is established. The elastic/plastic deformation is mainly determined by the difference of interaction energies from the aromatics and the alkoxy chains. For the BP&#8208;OR series with twisted configurations, the alkoxy chain with the middle length is favorable for the RTP property, while the strength of the &#960;&#8211;&#960; coupling is the cruical factor to the RTP property of the Xan&#8208;OR series with planar skeletons. A new way to promote the development of flexible RTP crystals, by modulation of aggregated structures as well as rational distribution of intermolecular interactions, is explored.

         <title>Visualizing the Atomic Configuration of Carbonate Groups&#160; in a (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonates (CO32&#8722;) are always known to suppress superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors. By employing integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC), the triangular atomic configuration of carbonates and their alternated spatial arrangement are visualized in (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948;. Combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, a competitive mechanism is unveiled with the decreased number of charge carriers while the improved flatness in CuO2 layers.








Abstract
Carbonates (CO32&#8722;) have always been known as impurities to degrade the superconductivity in cuprate high&#8208;Tc superconductors. Herein, the atomic arrangement of carbonates is directly visualized in (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; via integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The carbon atoms replace Cu atoms in the charge&#8208;reservoir layers, contributing to the formation of carbonates through strong orbital hybridization with the surrounding oxygen atoms. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the spatial configuration of the carbonate groups is confirmed and their influence on the local crystal lattice and electronic states is further investigated. The carbonates not only accommodate distortions by improving the flatness of the outer CuO2 layers but also reduce the density of states at the Fermi level. These two factors play competitive roles to affect the superconductivity. This study provides direct evidence of the presence of CO32&#8722; groups and gains an insight into the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Nanozyme Design: Lessons from Materials and Engineered Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials. However, the design of new nanozymes remains challenging. Here, recent advancements in ML&#8208;assisted discovery and design of materials and engineered enzymes is summarized, along with a discussion as to how these successful cases can be implicated in addressing the current problems facing the nanozyme field. The prospective design of nanozymes based on ML technology is also proposed.








Abstract
Nanozymes are nanomaterials that exhibit enzyme&#8208;like biomimicry. In combination with intrinsic characteristics of nanomaterials, nanozymes have broad applicability in materials science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, biochemistry, and disease theranostics. Recently, the heterogeneity of published results has highlighted the complexity and diversity of nanozymes in terms of consistency of catalytic capacity. Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials, yet it remains challenging for the design of new nanozymes based on ML approaches. Alternatively, ML is employed to promote optimization of intelligent design and application of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes. Incorporation of the successful ML algorithms used in the intelligent design of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes can concomitantly facilitate the guided development of next&#8208;generation nanozymes with desirable properties. Here, recent progress in ML, its utilization in the design of catalytic materials and enzymes, and how emergent ML applications serve as promising strategies to circumvent challenges associated with time&#8208;expensive and laborious testing in nanozyme research and development are summarized. The potential applications of successful examples of ML&#8208;aided catalytic materials and engineered enzymes in nanozyme design are also highlighted, with special focus on the unified aims in enhancing design and recapitulation of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity.

In combination with intrinsic characteristics of nanomaterials, nanozymes have broad applicability in materials science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, biochemistry, and disease theranostics. Recently, the heterogeneity of published results has highlighted the complexity and diversity of nanozymes in terms of consistency of catalytic capacity. Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials, yet it remains challenging for the design of new nanozymes based on ML approaches. Alternatively, ML is employed to promote optimization of intelligent design and application of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes. Incorporation of the successful ML algorithms used in the intelligent design of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes can concomitantly facilitate the guided development of next-generation nanozymes with desirable properties. Here, recent progress in ML, its utilization in the design of catalytic materials and enzymes, and how emergent ML applications serve as promising strategies to circumvent challenges associated with time-expensive and laborious testing in nanozyme research and development are summarized. The potential applications of successful examples of ML-aided catalytic materials and engineered enzymes in nanozyme design are also highlighted, with special focus on the unified aims in enhancing design and recapitulation of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hollow Hierarchical Cu2O&#8208;Derived Electrocatalysts Steering CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Chemicals at Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational design of catalyst morphology and elaborate calculations, a heteroseed&#8208;induced crystallization strategy is developed for the synthesis of hollow hierarchical vertex Cu/Cu2O catalysts that can provide intermediate confinement and surface electric field enhancement for CO intermediate dimerization, thereby boosting electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products at low overpotentials.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide&#160;into multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) using renewably generated electricity provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. Various oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) catalysts have been showcased, but still require high overpotential to drive C2+ production owing to sluggish carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation and low CO intermediate (*CO) coverage. Here, the dilemma is circumvented by elaborately devising the OD&#8208;Cu morphology. First, computational studies propose a hollow and hierarchical OD&#8208;Cu microstructure that can generate a core&#8211;shell microenvironment to inhibit CO evolution and accelerate *CO dimerization via intermediate confinement and electric field enhancement, thereby boosting C2+ generation. Experimentally, the designed nanoarchitectures are synthesized through a heteroseed&#8208;induced approach followed by electrochemical activation. In situ spectroscopic studies further elaborate correlation between *CO dimerization and designed architectures. Remarkably, the hierarchical OD&#8208;Cu manifests morphology&#8208;dependent selectivity of CO2 reduction, giving a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 75.6% at a considerably positive potential of &#8722;0.55&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.

         <title>The Myth of &#8220;Metavalency&#8221; in Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual properties of phase&#8208;change materials have been related to the presence of a &#8220;unique,&#8221; &#8220;fundamentally different,&#8221; and &#8220;unconventional&#8221; bonding mechanism, &#8220;metavalency.&#8221; However, bonding in these materials involves just two types of covalent bond: two&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) and electron&#8208;rich multicenter (3c&#8208;4e) bonds involving lone&#8208;pair electrons.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change memory materials (PCMs) have unusual properties and important applications, and recent efforts to find improved materials have focused on their bonding mechanisms. &#8220;Metavalent bonding&#8221; or &#8220;metavalency,&#8221; intermediate between &#8220;metallic&#8221; and &#8220;covalent&#8221; bonding and comprising single&#8208;electron bonds, has been proposed as a fundamentally new mechanism that is relevant both here and for halide perovskite materials. However, it is shown that PCMs, which violate the octet rule, have two types of covalent bond: two&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) bonds, and electron&#8208;rich, multicenter bonds (3c&#8208;4e bonds, hyperbonds) involving lone&#8208;pair electrons. The latter have bond orders less than one and are examples of the century&#8208;old concept of &#8220;partial&#8221;&#160;bonds.

         <title>Laser Derived Electron Transport Layers with Embedded p&#8208;n Heterointerfaces Enabling Planar Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) with pronounced electron conducting capability are essential for high performance planar photovoltaics, with the great challenge being that the most widely used metal oxide ETLs unfortunately have intrinsically low carrier mobility. Herein is demonstrated that by simply addressing the carrier loss at particle boundaries of TiO2 ETLs, through embedding in ETL p&#8208;n heterointerfaces, the electron mobility of the ETLs can be boosted by three orders of magnitude. Such embedding is also encouragingly favorable for both inhibiting the formation of rutile phase TiO2 in ETL, and initiating the growth of the top high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;grain perovskite films with less defect states. By virtue of these merits, creation of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 25.05% is achieved, setting a new benchmark for planar PSCs employing TiO2 ETLs. Unencapsulated PSCs employing such ETLs also deliver much&#8208;improved environmental stability, i.e., more than 80% of their initial efficiency after 9000&#160;h of air storage under RH of 40%, and over 90% of their initial efficiency at maximum power point under continuous illumination for 500&#160;h. Further work exploring other laser&#8208;generated p&#8208;type nanocrystals for embedding warrants the proposed strategy as a universal alternative for addressing the low&#8208;carrier mobility of metal oxide based ETLs, from the view point of particle boundaries engineering.

Abstract
Multimodal phototheranostics on the basis of a single molecule with one&#8208;for&#8208;all characteristics represents a convenient approach for effective cancer treatment. In this report, a versatile molecule featured by aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely DHTDP, synchronously enabling NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission and efficient photothermal conversion was developed by elaborate structural modulation. By camouflaging DHTDP nanoparticles with cancer cell membrane, the resultant biomimetic nanoparticles exhibited significantly facilitated both delivery efficiency and homologous targeting capability, and afforded precise imaging guidance and maximized therapeutic outcomes in form of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (FLI)&#8208;photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;photothermal imaging (PTI) trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT). This study presents the first example of biomimetic multimodal phototheranostics loaded by homogeneity&#8208;targeting cell membrane, thus brings a new insight into the exploration of superior phototheranostics for practical cancer theranostics.

         <title>A Computationally Assisted Approach for Designing Wearable Biosensors toward Non&#8208;invasive Personalized Molecular Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine as they can non&#8208;invasively collect molecular information closely associated with an individual's health status. However, the majority of clinically relevant biomarkers cannot be continuously detected in situ using existing wearable approaches. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here we introduce QuantumDock, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/crosslinker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, we performed successful experimental validation of QuantumDock using solution&#8208;synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, we designed a QuantumDock&#8208;optimized graphene&#8208;based wearable device that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. We, for the first time, demonstrate wearable non&#8208;invasive phenylalanine monitoring in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.

Abstract
Electrical stimulation is a promising strategy for treating neural diseases. However, current energy suppliers cannot provide effective power for in situ electrical stimulation. Here, w e reported an implantable tubular zinc&#8208;oxygen battery as the power source for in situ electrical stimulation during the neural repair. The battery exhibited a high volumetric energy density of 231.4 mWh&#183;cm&#8722;3 based on the entire anode and cathode in vivo. Due to its superior electrochemical properties and biosafety, the battery can be directly wrapped around the nerve to provide in situ electrical stimulation with a minimal size of 0.86 mm3. The cell and animal experiments demonstrated that the zinc&#8208;oxygen battery&#8208;based nerve tissue engineering conduit effectively promoted regeneration of the injured long&#8208;segment sciatic nerve, proving its promising applications for powering implantable neural electronics in the future.

         <title>Bi&#8208;chiral Nanostructures Featuring Dynamic Optical Rotatory Dispersion for Polychromatic Light Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chiral nanostructures featuring the unique optical activity have attracted broad interests from scientists. The typical polarization rotation of transmitted light is usually wavelength dependent, namely the optical rotatory dispersion. However, its dynamic tunability and intriguing collaboration with other optical degrees of freedom, especially the highly&#8208;desired spatial phase, remain elusive. Herein, a bi&#8208;chiral liquid crystalline nanostructure is proposed to induce an effect called reflective optical rotatory dispersion. Thanks to the independent manipulation of opposite&#8208;handed self&#8208;assembled helices, spin&#8208;decoupled geometric phases are induced simultaneously. These naturally unite multi&#8208;dimensions of light and versatile stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of soft matters. Dynamic holography driven by heat and electric field has been demonstrated with a fast response. For polychromatic light, the hybrid multiplexed holographic painting is exhibited with fruitful tunable colors. This work extends the ingenious construction of soft chiral superstructures, presents an open&#8208;ended strategy for on&#8208;demand light control, and enlightens advanced applications of display, optical computing and communication.

         <title>Organic Electroactive Materials for Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic electroactive materials take advantages of potentially sustainable production and structural tunability compared to present commercial inorganic materials. Unfortunately, traditional redox flow batteries based on toxic redox&#8208;active metal ions have certain deficiencies in resource utilization and environmental protection. In comparison, organic electroactive materials in aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) have received extensive attentions in recent years for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage systems due to their inherent safety. This review aims to provide the recent progress in organic electroactive materials for ARFBs. We first classify the main reaction types of organic electroactive materials in ARFBs to provide an overview on how to regulate their solubility, potential, stability and viscosity. Then, the organic anolyte and catholyte in ARFBs are summarized according to the types of quinones, viologens, nitroxide radicals, hydroquinones etc, and how to increase the solubility by designing various functional groups is emphasized. We next present the research advances of the characterization of organic electroactive materials for ARFBs. Future efforts are finally suggested to focus on building neutral ARFBs, designing advanced electroactive materials through molecular engineering, and resolving problems of commercial applications.

         <title>Wetting Effect on Patterned Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet wetting on patterned substrate is addressed by the Cassie&#8211;Wenzel theory (CWT). This review discusses recent applications of CWT and its limitations. Anisotropic wetting effects beyond the scope of CWT are summarized for droplet size comparable to the pattern dimension. An additional focus is placed on the case when droplet partially wets the pore for mechanically patterned substrate.








Abstract
A droplet deposited on a solid substrate leads to the wetting phenomenon. A natural observation is the lotus effect, known for its superhydrophobicity. This special feature is engendered by the structured microstructure of the lotus leaf, namely, surface heterogeneity, as explained by the quintessential Cassie&#8211;Wenzel theory (CWT). In this work, recent designs of functional substrates are overviewed based on the CWT via manipulating the contact area between the liquid and the solid substrate as well as the intrinsic Young's contact angle. Moreover, the limitation of the CWT is discussed. When the droplet size is comparable to the surface heterogeneity, anisotropic wetting morphology often appears, which is beyond the scope of the Cassie&#8211;Wenzel work. In this case, several recent studies addressing the anisotropic wetting effect on chemically and mechanically patterned substrates are elucidated. Surface designs for anisotropic wetting morphologies are summarized with respect to the shape and the arrangement of the surface heterogeneity, the droplet volume, the deposition position of the droplet, as well as the mean curvature of the surface heterogeneity. A thermodynamic interpretation for the wetting effect and the corresponding open questions are presented at the&#160;end.

         <title>Li ion Transfer Mechanism of Gel Polymer Electrolyte with the Sole Fluoroethylene Carbonate Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is one of the promising candidates to address the individual limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes, the extensively development is still hindered due to the veiled Li ions conduction mechanism. Herein, the related mechanism in GPE is extensively studied by developing an in&#8208;situ polymerized GPE comprising fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) solvent and carbonate ester segments (F&#8208;GPE). Practically, although with high dielectric constant, FEC is fail to effectively transport Li ions when acts as the sole solvent. By sharp contrast, F&#8208;GPE demonstrates superior electrochemical performances and the related Li ions transfer mechanism is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and 7Li/6Li solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The polymer segments are extended with the swelling of FEC, then an electron delocalization interface layer is generated between abundant electron&#8208;rich groups of FEC and polymer ingredients, which works as an electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and facilitates the rapid transfer of Li ions by lowering the diffusional barrier dramatically, resulting in a high conductivity of 2.47&#8201; &#215; &#8201;10&#8722;4&#8201;S cm&#8722;1 and a small polarization of about 20&#160;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 8000&#160;h. Remarkably, FEC ingredient provides high flame&#8208;retardancy and make F&#8208;GPE remains stable under ignition and puncture tests.

         <title>A Synthetic Signalling Network Imitating the Action of Immune Cells in Response to Bacterial Metabolism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology allows us to replicate many basic biological functions in artificial cell&#8208;like devices. To mimic more complex behaviours, however, artificial cells would need to perform many of these functions in a synergistic and coordinated fashion, which remains elusive. Here we&#160;considered a sophisticated biological response, namely the capture and deactivation of pathogens by neutrophil immune cells, through the process of netosis. We&#160;designed a consortium consisting of two synthetic agents &#8211; responsive DNA&#8208;based particles and antibiotic&#8208;loaded lipid vesicles &#8211; whose coordinated action mimics the sought immune&#8208;like response when triggered by bacterial metabolism. The artificial netosis&#8208;like response emerges from a series of interlinked sensing and communication pathways between the live and synthetic agents, and translates into both physical and chemical antimicrobial actions, namely bacteria immobilisation and exposure to antibiotics. Our&#160;results demonstrate how advanced life&#8208;like responses can be prescribed with a relatively small number of synthetic molecular components, and outlines a new strategy for artificial&#8208;cell&#8208;based antimicrobial&#160;solutions.

Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) have attracted great attention because of their unique complex compositions and tailorable properties. Further expanding the compositional space is of great significance for enriching the material library. Here, we develop a step&#8208;alloying strategy to synthesis HEA&#8208;NPs containing a range of strongly repellent elements (e.g., Bi&#8208;W) by using the Rich&#8208;Pt cores formed during the first liquid phase reaction as the seed of the second thermal diffusion. Remarkably, the representative HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) with up to 14 elements exhibits extremely excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Briefly, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) only requires the ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 11 and 18&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and exhibits ultra&#8208;long durability for 400 and 264 hours under 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4 and 1&#160;M KOH respectively, which surpasses most advanced pH&#8208;universal HER catalysts. Moreover, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) also exhibits an impressive peak current density of 12.6 A mg&#8722;1Pt in 1&#160;M KOH + 1&#160;M MeOH and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (versus RHE.) in 0.1&#160;M KOH. Our work further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is important for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.

         <title>Immobilizing surface halide in perovskite solar cells via calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The halide diffusion across the charge&#8208;transporting layer followed by reaction with metal electrode represents a critical factor limiting the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, we report a supramolecular strategy with surface anion complexation for enhancing the light and thermal stability of perovskite films as well as devices. The calix[4]pyrrole (C[4]P) is demonstrated as a unique anion&#8208;binding agent for stabilizing the structure of perovskite by anchoring surface halides, which increases the activation energy for halide migration, thus effectively suppressing the halide&#8208;metal electrode reactions. The C[4]P stabilized perovskite films preserve their initial morphology after ageing at 85&#160;&#176;C or under 1 sun illumination in humid air over 50 hours, significantly outperforming the control samples. This strategy radically tackles the halide outward&#8208;diffusion issue without sacrificing charge extraction. Inverted&#8208;structured PSCs based on C[4]P modified formamidinium&#8208;cesium perovskite exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of over 23%. The lifespans of unsealed PSCs are unprecedentedly prolonged from dozens of hours to over 2000 hours under operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1) and 85&#160;&#176;C ageing (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2). When subjected to a harsher protocol of ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 with both light and thermal stresses, the C[4]P based PSCs maintain 87% of original efficiency after ageing for 500 hours.

         <title>Highly Reliable Textile&#8208;Type Memristor by Designing Aligned Nanochannels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Information&#8208;processing devices are the core components of modern electronics. Integrating them into textiles is the indispensable demand for electronic textiles to form close&#8208;loop functional systems. Memristors with cross&#8208;bar configuration are regarded as promising building blocks to design woven information&#8208;processing devices that seamlessly unify with textiles. However, the memristors always suffer from severe temporal and spatial variations due to the random growth of conductive filaments during filamentary switching processes. Here, inspired by the ion nanochannels across synaptic membranes, we report a highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor made of Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8764;0.089&#160;V), high on/off ratio (&#8764;106) and low power consumption (0.1 nW). Experimental evidences indicate that nanochannels with abundant active S defects could anchor silver ions and confine their migrations to form orderly and efficient conductive filaments. Such memristive performances enable the resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array to have high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity and process complex physiological data like brainwave signals with high recognition accuracy (95%). Our textile&#8208;type memristor arrays are mechanically durable to withstand hundreds of bending and sliding deformations, and seamlessly unified with sensing, power&#8208;supplying and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new&#8208;generation human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>A Novel Ultra&#8208;Wideband Electromagnetic&#8208;Wave&#8208;Absorbing Metastructure Inspired by Bionic Gyroid Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Butterfly wings possess strut&#8208;gyroid structural color, which shows that varying structures can reflect differing wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. This property inspires creation of a sheet&#8208;gyroid metastructure for subwavelength electromagnetic wave absorption. By using additive manufacturing and a dipping process, this metastructure is able to achieve broadband absorption from 2 to 40 GHz, with a high level of radiation incident angle and polarization&#8208;resistance.








Abstract
Traditional honeycomb&#8208;like structural electromagnetic (EM)&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing materials have been widely used in various equipment as multifunctional materials. However, current EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing materials are limited by narrow absorption bandwidths and incidence angles because of their anisotropic structural morphology. The work presented here proposes a novel EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorbing metastructure with an isotropic morphology inspired by the gyroid microstructures seen in Parides sesostris butterfly wings. A matching redesign methodology between the material and subwavelength scale properties of the gyroid microstructure is proposed, inspired by the interaction mechanism between the microstructure and the material properties on the EM&#8208;wave&#8208;absorption performance of the prepared metastructure. The bioinspired metastructure is fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) and subsequent coating through dipping processes, filled with dielectric lossy materials. Based on simulations and experiments, the metastructure designed in this work exhibits an ultrawide absorption bandwidth covering the frequency range of 2&#8211;40&#160;GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 180% at normal incidence. Moreover, the metastructure has a stable frequency response when the incident angle is 60&#176; under transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. Finally, the synergistic mechanism between the microstructure and the material is elucidated, which provides a new paradigm for the design of novel ultra&#8208;broadband EM&#8208;absorbing materials.

         <title>Graphdiyne and Its Derivatives as Efficient Charge Reservoirs and Transporters in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne (GDY) is a 2D carbon material with sp&#8208;sp2 conjugated carbon network containing evenly distributed pores, which endows GDY with unique properties in charge storage and transport. The applications of GDY and its derivatives as charge reservoirs and transporters in semiconductor devices, including memories, solar cells, photodetectors, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are summarized and analyzed.








Abstract
2D graphdiyne (GDY), which is composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, is a promising semiconductor material with a unique porous lamellar structure. It has high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, high density of states, and strong electrostatic interaction ability with ions and organic functional units. In recent years, interests in applying GDYs (GDY and its derivatives) in semiconductor devices have been growing rapidly, and great achievements have been made. Attractively, GDYs could act as efficient reservoirs and transporters for both carriers and ions, which endows them with enormous potential in future novel optoelectronics. In this review, the progress in this field is systematically summarized, aiming to bring an in&#8208;depth insight into the GDYs&#8217; intrinsic uniqueness. Particularly, the effects of GDYs on carrier dynamics and ionic interactions in various semiconductor devices are succinctly described, analyzed, and concluded.

         <title>Progress of Microfluidic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Scaffolds and Organ&#8208;on&#8208;Chips for the Cartilage Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels are among the most promising options employed for cartilage repair. Subsequent to analyzing different types of hydrogels, microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds are selected due to displaying superior characteristics compared to their counterparts. The application of microfluidic chips, known as organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips, is also investigated in the cartilage tissue engineering.








Abstract
Cartilage degeneration is among the fundamental reasons behind disability and pain across the globe. Numerous approaches have been employed to treat cartilage diseases. Nevertheless, none have shown acceptable outcomes in the long run. In this regard, the convergence of tissue engineering and microfabrication principles can allow developing more advanced microfluidic technologies, thus offering attractive alternatives to current treatments and traditional constructs used in tissue engineering applications. Herein, the current developments involving microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds, promising structures for cartilage regeneration, ranging from hydrogels with microfluidic channels to hydrogels prepared by the microfluidic devices, that enable therapeutic delivery of cells, drugs, and growth factors, as well as cartilage&#8208;related organ&#8208;on&#8208;chips are reviewed. Thereafter, cartilage anatomy and types of damages, and present treatment options are briefly overviewed. Various hydrogels are introduced, and the advantages of microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds over traditional hydrogels are thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, available technologies for fabricating microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds and microfluidic chips are presented. The preclinical and clinical applications of microfluidic hydrogel&#8208;based scaffolds in cartilage regeneration and the development of cartilage&#8208;related microfluidic chips over time are further explained. The current developments, recent key challenges, and attractive prospects that should be considered so as to develop microfluidic systems in cartilage repair are highlighted.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With Near&#8208;Unity Internal Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient blue single&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are demonstrated, achieving 27.7% external quantum efficiency, low roll&#8208;off, and low operating voltages. The internal quantum efficiency approaches unity, demonstrating that highly simplified single&#8208;layer OLEDs without confinement layers can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, while greatly reducing the complexity of the design, fabrication, and device analysis.








Abstract
Efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) commonly comprise a multilayer stack including charge&#8208;transport and charge&#8208; and exciton&#8208;blocking layers, to confine charge recombination to the emissive layer. Here, a highly simplified single&#8208;layer blue&#8208;emitting OLED is demonstrated based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence with the emitting layer simply sandwiched between ohmic contacts consisting of a polymeric conducting anode and a metal cathode. The single&#8208;layer OLED exhibits an external quantum efficiency of 27.7% with minor roll&#8208;off at high brightness. The internal quantum efficiency approaches unity, demonstrating that highly simplified single&#8208;layer OLEDs without confinement layers can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, while greatly reducing the complexity of the design, fabrication, and device analysis.

         <title>Triggering Pt Active Sites in Basal Plane of Van der Waals PtTe2 Materials by Amorphization Engineering for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Exposing active sites and optimizing their bonding strength to reaction intermediates are two essential strategies to significantly improve the catalytic performance of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials. However, pursuing an efficient way to achieve these goals simultaneously remains a considerable challenge. Here, using 2D PtTe2 van der Waals material with well&#8208;defined crystal structure and atomically thin thickness as a model catalyst, we observe that a moderate calcination strategy can promote the structural transformation of 2D crystal PtTe2 nanosheets (c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs) into oxygen&#8208;doped 2D amorphous PtTe2 NSs (a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs). The experimental and theoretical investigations cooperatively reveal that oxygen dopants can break the inherent Pt&#8208;Te covalent bond in c&#8208;PtTe2 NSs, thereby triggering the reconfiguration of interlayer Pt atoms and exposing them thoroughly. Meanwhile, the structural transformation can effectively tailor the electronic properties (e.g., the density of state near the Fermi level, d&#8208;band center, and conductivity) of Pt active sites via the hybridization of Pt 5d orbitals and O 2p orbitals. As a result, a&#8208;PtTe2 NSs with large amounts of exposed Pt active sites and optimized binding strength to hydrogen intermediates exhibit excellent activity and stability in hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Enhancing Prosthetic Control through High&#8208;Fidelity Myoelectric Mapping with Molecular Anchoring Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Myoelectric control utilizes electrical signals generated from the voluntary contraction of remaining muscles in an amputee's stump to operate a prosthesis. Precise and agile control requires low&#8208;level myoelectric signals (below 10% of maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) from weak muscle contractions such as phantom finger or wrist movements, but imbalanced calcium concentration in atrophic skin can distort the signals. This is due to poor ionic&#8208;electronic coupling between skin and electrode, which often causes excessive muscle contraction, fatigue and discomfort during delicate tasks. To overcome this challenge, a new strategy called molecular anchoring has been developed to drive hydrophobic molecular effectively interact with and embed into stratum corneum for high coupling regions between ionic fluxes and electronic currents. The use of hydrophobic poly(N&#8208;vinyl caprolactam) gel has resulted in an interface impedance of 20 k&#937;, which is 1/100 of a commercial acrylic&#8208;based electrode, allowing the detection of ultralow myoelectric signals (&#8764;1.5% MVC) that approach human limits. With this molecular anchoring technology, amputees operated a prosthesis with greater dexterity, as phantom finger and wrist movements w ere predicted with 97.6% accuracy. This strategy provides the potential for a comfortable human&#8208;machine interface when amputees accomplish day&#8208;to&#8208;day tasks through precise and dexterous myoelectric control.

         <title>Controlled Electronic and Magnetic Landscape in Self&#8208;Assembled Complex Oxide Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Complex oxide heterointerfaces contain a rich playground of novel physical properties and functionalities, which give rise to emerging technologies. Among designing and controlling the functional properties of complex oxide film heterostructures, vertically aligned nanostructure (VAN) films using a self&#8208;assembling bottom&#8208;up deposition method present great promise in terms of structural flexibility and property tunability. Here, we extend the bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly to a new approach using a mixture containing a 2D layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer film growth, followed by a 3D VAN film growth. In this work, the two&#8208;phase nanocomposite thin films are based on LaAlO3:LaBO3, grown on lattice&#8208;mismatched SrTiO3. The 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transient structural assembly is primarily controlled by the composition ratio, leading to the coexistence of multiple interfacial properties, 2D electron gas and magnetic anisotropy. This approach provides multidimensional film heterostructures which enrich emergent phenomena for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Catalyst Development for High Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A constant increase in global emission standards is causing fuel cell (FC) technology to gain importance. Over the last two decades, a great deal of research has been focused on developing more active catalysts to boost the performance of high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFC), as well as their durability. Due to material degradation at high temperature conditions, catalyst design becomes challenging. Two main approaches are suggested: (i) alloying platinum (Pt) with low&#8208;cost transition metals to reduce Pt usage, and (ii) developing novel catalyst supports that anchor metal particles more efficiently while inhibiting corrosion phenomena. In this comprehensive review, we detail the most recent Platinum Group Metal (PGM) and Platinum Group Metal Free (PGM&#8208;free) catalyst development, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT&#8208;PEMFCs.

Due to material degradation at high temperature conditions, catalyst design becomes challenging. Two main approaches are suggested: (i) alloying platinum (Pt) with low-cost transition metals to reduce Pt usage, and (ii) developing novel catalyst supports that anchor metal particles more efficiently while inhibiting corrosion phenomena. In this comprehensive review, we detail the most recent Platinum Group Metal (PGM) and Platinum Group Metal Free (PGM-free) catalyst development, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT-PEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Zinc Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Regulated Hard Carbons for High&#8208;Rate and Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Zn single&#8208;atom&#8208;regulated hard carbon with unprecedented sodium&#8208;storage performance is reported. The Zn doping can induce a local electric field to enable the fast bulk Na+ transportation and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and fast interfacial Na+ storage kinetics, both of which contribute to the boosted electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Hard carbons, as one of the most commercializable anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have to deal with the trade&#8208;off between the rate capability and specific capacity or initial Columbic efficiency (ICE), and the fast performance decline at low temperature (LT) remains poorly understood. Here, a comprehensive regulation on the interfacial/bulk electrochemistry of hard carbons through atomic Zn doping is reported, which demonstrates a record&#8208;high reversible capacity (546 mAh g&#8722;1), decent ICE (84%), remarkable rate capability (140 mAh g&#8722;1 @ 50 A g&#8722;1), and excellent LT capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 @ &#8722;40 &#176;C), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. This work reveals that the Zn doping can generally induce a local electric field to enable fast bulk Na+ transportation, and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which elaborates the underlying origin of the boosted electrochemical performance. Importantly, distinguished from room temperature, the intrinsic Na+ migration/desolvation ability of the electrolyte is disclosed to be the crucial rate&#8208;determining factors for the SIB performance at LT. This work provides a fundamental understanding on the charge&#8208;storage kinetics at varied temperatures.

         <title>A Bifunctional Carbazide Additive For Durable CsSnI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An additive&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step annealing process&#160;was&#160;developed for high&#8208;performance CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The carbazide (CBZ) can slow down crystallization for dense coverage at 80&#160;&#176;C. After further annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C, the uncoordinated CBZ reduces Sn4+ to Sn2+ with few deep traps. The efficiency of CsSnI3:CBZ is 11.21%, which is the highest performance for CsSnI3&#8208;based PSCs to date.








Abstract
Inorganic CsSnI3 with low toxicity and a narrow bandgap is a promising photovoltaic material. However, the performance of CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is much lower than that of Pb&#8208;based and hybrid Sn&#8208;based (e.g., CsPbX3 and CH(NH2)2SnX3) PSCs, which may be attributed to its poor film&#8208;forming property and the deep traps induced by Sn4+. Here, a bifunctional additive carbazide (CBZ) is adapted to deposit a pinhole&#8208;free film and remove the deep traps via two&#8208;step annealing. The lone electrons of the &#63743;NH2 and &#63743;CO units in CBZ can coordinate with Sn2+ to form a dense film with large grains during the phase transition at 80&#160;&#176;C. The decomposition of CBZ can reduce Sn4+ to Sn2+ during annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C to remove the deep traps. Compared with the control device (4.12%), the maximum efficiency of the CsSnI3:CBZ PSC reaches 11.21%, which is the highest efficiency of CsSnI3 PSC reported to date. A certified efficiency of 10.90% is obtained by an independent photovoltaic testing laboratory. In addition, the unsealed CsSnI3:CBZ devices maintain initial efficiencies of &#8776;100%, 90%, and 80% under an inert atmosphere (60&#160;days), standard maximum power point tracking (650&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C), and ambient air (100&#160;h), respectively.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Thermoelectric Microdevices for Four&#8208;Dimensional Thermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermometry, the process of measuring temperature, is one of the most fundamental tasks not only for understanding the thermodynamics of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes but also for thermal management of microelectronics. However, it is a challenge to acquire microscale temperature fields in both space and time. Here, w e report on a three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device that enables direct four&#8208;dimensional (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale. The device is composed of freestanding thermocouple probe networks, fabricated by bi&#8208;metal 3D printing with an outstanding spatial resolution of &#8764; &#956;m. W e show that the developed 4D thermometry can explore dynamics of Joule heating or evaporative cooling on microscale subjects of interest such as a microelectrode or a water meniscus. The utilization of 3D printing further opens up the possibility to freely realize a wide range of on&#8208;chip, freestanding microsensors or microelectronic devices without the design restrictions by manufacturing processes.

         <title>Control of Enzyme Reactivity in Response to Osmotic Pressure Modulation Mimicking Dynamic Assembly of Intracellular Organelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In response to variations in osmotic stress, in particular to hypertonicity associated with biological dysregulations, cells have developed complex mechanisms to release their excess water, thus avoiding their bursting and death. When water is expelled, cells shrink and concentrate their internal bio(macro)molecular content, inducing the formation of membraneless organelles following a liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) mechanism. To mimic this intrinsic property of cells, functional thermo&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like polypeptide (ELP) biomacromolecular conjugates are herein encapsulated into self&#8208;assembled lipid vesicles using a microfluidic system, together with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to mimic cells&#8217; interior crowded microenvironment. By inducing a hypertonic shock onto the vesicles, expelled water induces a local increase of concentration and a concomitant decrease of the cloud point temperature (Tcp) of ELP bioconjugates that phase separate and form coacervates mimicking cellular stress&#8208;induced membraneless organelle assemblies. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), as a model enzyme, is bioconjugated to ELPs and is locally confined in coacervates as a response to osmotic stress. This consequently increases local HRP and substrate concentrations and accelerates the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction. These results illustrate a unique way to fine&#8208;tune enzymatic reactions dynamically as a response to a physiological change in isothermal conditions.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;loading Manganese&#8208;based Electrode for Aqueous Battery via Polymorph Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based aqueous batteries utilizing Mn2+/MnO2 redox reactions are promising choices for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high theoretical specific capacity, high power capability, low&#8208;cost, and intrinsic safety with water&#8208;based electrolytes. However, the application of such systems is hindered by the insulating nature of deposited MnO2, resulting in low normalized areal loading (0.005&#8764;0.05 mAh cm&#8722;2) during charge/discharge cycle. In this work, we investigated the electrochemical performance of various MnO2 polymorphs in Mn2+/MnO2 redox reactions and determined &#603;&#8208;MnO2 with low conductivity to be the primary electrochemically deposited phase in normal acidic aqueous electrolyte. We found that increasing the temperature can change the deposited phase from &#603;&#8208;MnO2 with low conductivity to &#947;&#8208;MnO2 with two orders of magnitude increase in conductivity. We demonstrated that the highly conductive &#947;&#8208;MnO2 could be effectively exploited for ultrahigh areal loading electrode, and a normalized areal loading of 33 mAh cm&#8722;2 was achieved. At a mild temperature of 50 &#176;C, cells were cycled with an ultrahigh areal loading of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2 (1&#8208;2 orders of magnitude higher than previous studies) for over 200 cycles with only 13% capacity loss.

&lt;p&gt;Manganese-based aqueous batteries utilizing Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox reactions are promising choices for grid-scale energy storage due to their high theoretical specific capacity, high power capability, low-cost, and intrinsic safety with water-based electrolytes. However, the application of such systems is hindered by the insulating nature of deposited MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in low normalized areal loading (0.005&#8764;0.05 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) during charge/discharge cycle. In this work, we investigated the electrochemical performance of various MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; polymorphs in Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox reactions and determined &#603;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with low conductivity to be the primary electrochemically deposited phase in normal acidic aqueous electrolyte. We found that increasing the temperature can change the deposited phase from &#603;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with low conductivity to &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with two orders of magnitude increase in conductivity. We demonstrated that the highly conductive &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could be effectively exploited for ultrahigh areal loading electrode, and a normalized areal loading of 33 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved. At a mild temperature of 50 &#176;C, cells were cycled with an ultrahigh areal loading of 20 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1-2 orders of magnitude higher than previous studies) for over 200 cycles with only 13% capacity loss.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Neonatal Tissue&#8208;derived Extracellular Vesicle Therapy (NEXT): A Potent Strategy for Precision Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;based therapies have emerged as a promising means in regenerative medicine. However, the conventional EV therapy strategy (using EVs from a single type of cultured cell) displays some limitations, such as inefficient EV production and lack of tissue&#8208;specific repair effects. Here, we report that neonatal tissue&#8208;derived EV therapy (NEXT) is a potent strategy for precision tissue repair. In brief, large amounts of EVs with higher yield/purity can be readily isolated from desired tissues with less production time/cost compared to the conventional cell culture&#8208;based method. Moreover, source factors, such as age and tissue type, can affect the repair efficacy of such tissue&#8208;derived EVs in different tissue injury models (skin wounds and acute kidney injury), and neonatal tissue&#8208;derived EVs show superior tissue repair potency compared with adult tissue&#8208;derived EVs. Different age&#8208; or tissue type&#8208;derived EVs have distinct composition (e.g., protein) signatures that are likely due to the diverse metabolic patterns of the donor tissues, which may contribute to the specific repair action modes of NEXT in different types of tissue injury. Furthermore, neonatal tissue&#8208;derived EVs can be incorporated with bioactive materials (e.g., artificial ECM hydrogel) for advanced tissue repair. This study highlights that our NEXT strategy may provide a new avenue for precision tissue repair in many types of tissue injury.

         <title>Planar Spin Glass with Topologically&#8208;Protected Mazes in the Liquid Crystal Targeting for Reconfigurable Micro Security Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The planar spin glass pattern is widely known for its inherent randomness, resulting from the geometrical frustration. As such, developing physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;which operate with device randomness&#8212;with planar spin glass patterns can be a promising candidate for an advanced security system in the upcoming digitalized society. Despite their inherent randomness, traditional magnetic spin glass patterns pose considerable obstacles in detection, making it challenging to achieve authentication in security systems. This necessitates the development of facilely observable mimetic patterns with similar randomness to overcome these challenges. Here, we introduce a straightforward approach using a topologically&#8208;protected maze pattern in the chiral liquid crystals (LCs). Our maze exhibits a comparable level of randomness to magnetic spin glass and can be reliably identified through the combination of optical microscopy with machine learning&#8208;based object detection techniques. The &#8220;information&#8221; embedded in the maze can be reconstructed through thermal phase transitions of the LCs in tens of seconds. Furthermore, incorporating various elements can enhance the optical PUF, resulting in a multi&#8208;factor security medium. We expect our security medium, based on microscopically controlled and macroscopically uncontrolled topologically&#8208;protected structures, may be utilized as a next&#8208;generation security system.

         <title>Imitating Architectural Mortise&#8208;Tenon Structure for Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are the most promising cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries, but chemo&#8208;mechanical failures during cycling and large first&#8208;cycle capacity loss hinder their applications in high&#8208;energy batteries. Herein, by introducing spinel&#8208;like mortise&#8208;tenon structures into the layered phase of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, the adverse volume variations in cathode materials can be significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, this mortise&#8208;tenon structures play the role of the expressway for fast lithium&#8208;ion transport, which is substantiated by experiments and calculations. Moreover, the particles with mortise&#8208;tenon structures usually terminate with the most stable (003) facet. The new cathode exhibits a discharge capacity of 215 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 C with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%, and capacity retention of 82.2% after 1200 cycles at 1 C. This work offers a viable lattice engineering to address the stability and low initial Coulombic efficiency of the Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides, and facilitates the implementation of Li&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;energy density and long durability.

Abstract
The practical application of metalloid black phosphorus (BP) based anodes for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) is mainly impeded by its instability in air and irreversible/sluggish potassium &#8208;storage behaviors. Herein, w e purposefully conceptualize a two&#8208;dimensional composite, where ultrathin BP nanodisks with Fe3O4 nanoclusters are hybridized with Lewis acid iron (V)&#8208;oxo complex (FC) nanosheets (denoted as BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC). The introduced electron coordinate bridge between FC and BP, and hydrophobic surface of FC synergistically assure that BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC is ultra&#8208;stable in humid air. With the purposeful structural and componential design, the resultant BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC anode is endowed with appealing electrochemical performance in terms of reversible capacity, rate behavior and long&#8208;duration cycling stability in both half and full cells. Furthermore, the underlying formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms of BP@Fe3O4&#8208;NCs@FC w ere tentatively proposed. The in&#8208;depth insights here will provide a crucial understanding in rational exploration of advanced anodes for next&#8208;generation PIBs.

         <title>Bendable Silicene Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to their superior mechanical properties, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have gained interest as active layers in flexible devices co&#8208;integrating electronic, photonic, and straintronic functions altogether. To this end, 2D bendable membranes compatible with the technological process standards and endowed with large scale uniformity are highly desired. Here, we report on the realization of bendable membranes based on silicene layers (the 2D form of silicon) by means of a process in which the layers are fully detached from the native bulk substrate and then transferred onto arbitrary flexible substrates. The application of macroscopic mechanical deformations induces a strain&#8208;responsive behavior in the Raman spectrum of silicene. We also show that the membranes under elastic tension relaxation are prone to form microscale wrinkles displaying a local generation of strain in the silicene layer consistent with that observed under macroscopic mechanical deformation. Optothermal Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a curvature&#8208;dependent heat dispersion in silicene wrinkles. Finally, as compelling evidence of the technological potential of the silicene membranes, we demonstrate that they can be readily introduced into a lithographic process flow resulting in the definition of flexible device&#8208;ready architectures, e.g. piezoresistor, and thus paving the way to a viable advance in a fully silicon&#8208;compatible technology framework.

         <title>Shift Current Photovoltaics based on A Noncentrosymmetric Phase in in&#8208;plane Ferroelectric SnS</title>

Abstract
The shift current photovoltaics of group IV monochalcogenides have been predicted to be comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si&#8208;based solar cells. However, its exploration has been prevented from the centrosymmetric layer stacking in the thermodynamically stable bulk crystal. Herein, we stabilized the noncentrosymmetric layer stacking of tin sulfide (SnS) in the bottom regions of SnS crystals grown on a van der Waals substrate by physical vapor deposition and demonstrated the shift current of SnS by combining the polarization angle dependence and circular photogalvanic effect. Furthermore, 180&#176; ferroelectric domains in SnS were verified through both piezoresponse force microscopy and shift current mapping techniques. Based on these results, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary was proposed. The direct observation of shift current and ferroelectric domains reported herein paves a new path for future studies on shift current photovoltaics.

         <title>Single Quantum Dot Selection and Tailor&#8208;Made Photonic Device Integration using a Nanoscale&#8208;Focus Pinspot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale&#8208;focus pinspot technique reveals a new paradigm for a deterministic integration between quantum emitters and photonic structures. The technique can reduce the luminescent quantum dot density from the high&#8208;density quantum dots (QDs)&#160;without destroying their pristine structures, so that individual QD characterization and tailor&#8208;made photonic structure integration can be done deterministically.








Abstract
Among the diverse platforms of quantum light sources, epitaxially grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the most attractive workhorses for realizing quantum photonic technologies owing to their outstanding brightness and scalability. However, the spatial and spectral randomness of most QDs severely hinders the construction of large&#8208;scale photonic platforms. In this work, a methodology is presented to deterministically integrate single QDs with tailor&#8208;made photonic structures. A nondestructive luminescence picking method termed as nanoscale&#8208;focus pinspot (NFP) is applied using helium&#8208;ion microscopy to reduce the luminous QD density while retaining the surrounding medium. A single QD emission is only extracted out of the high&#8208;density ensemble QDs. Then the tailor&#8208;made photonic structure of a circular Bragg reflector (CBR) is designed and deterministically integrated with the selected QD. Given that the microscopy can image with nanoscale resolution and apply NFP in situ, photonic devices can be deterministically fabricated on target QDs. The extraction efficiency of the NFP&#8208;selected QD emission is improved by 25 times after the CBR integration. Since the NFP method only controls the luminescence without destroying the medium, it is applicable to various photonic structures such as photonic waveguides or photonic crystal cavities regardless of materials.

         <title>Interfacial Regulation for 3D Printing based on Slice&#8208;Based Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in slice&#8208;based 3D printing has boomed the rapid development of advanced manufacturing fields worldwide for scientific research and commercial communities. This review discusses the scientific impetus for improving the printing process and the printing details of slice&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology from the point of view of the involved interfaces and corresponding interfacial adhesions.








Abstract
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can turn computer&#8208;aided designs into delicate structures directly and on demand by eliminating expensive molds, dies, or lithographic masks. Among the various technical forms, light&#8208;based 3D printing mainly involved the control of polymer&#8208;based matter fabrication and realized a field of manufacturing with high tunability of printing format, speed, and precision. Emerging slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing methods have prosperously advanced in recent years but still present challenges to the versatility of printing continuity, printing process, and printing details control. Herein, the field of slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing is discussed and summarized from the view of interfacial regulation strategies to improve the printing continuity, printing process control, and the character of printed results, and several potential strategies to construct complex 3D structures of distinct characteristics with extra external fields, which are favorable for the further improvement and development of 3D printing, are proposed.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are realized in a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn, capped with a Pt overlayer via tuning the magnitude of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. Besides, the temperature&#8208;induced novel transition from skyrmions to antiferromagnetic meron&#8208;like spin textures at &#8776;220 K is also observed in the Mn3Sn/Pt samples. This may stimulate the discovery of new topological spin textures in antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Topologically protected magnetic &#8220;whirls&#8221; such as skyrmions in antiferromagnetic materials have recently attracted extensive interest due to their nontrivial band topology and potential application in antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions in natural metallic antiferromagnetic materials with merit of probable convenient electrical manipulation have not been reported. Here, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are realized in a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn, capped with a Pt overlayer. The evolution of spin textures from coplanar inverted triangular structures to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions is achieved via tuning the magnitude of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. Beyond that, the temperature can induce an unconventional transition from skyrmions to antiferromagnetic meron&#8208;like spin textures at &#8776;220 K in the Mn3Sn/Pt samples. Combining with the theoretical calculations, it is found that the transition originates from the temperature dependence of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between kagome sublayers within the Mn3Sn crystalline unit&#8208;cell. These findings open the avenue for the development of topological spin&#8208;swirling&#8208;based antiferromagnetic spintronics.

         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;step solution processing method is developed to rapidly prepare gram&#8208;scale MAPbX3&#160;microcrystals. Utilizing its intrinsic electromagnetic (EM) properties, a series of EM devices is designed and fabricated, which can be applied in the fields of ultra&#8208;wideband bandpass filters and multi&#8208;band photodetection covering X&#8208;rays, UV, visible light, and microwaves.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency electromagnetic (EM) functional materials are the core building block of high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices, and they are indispensable in various fields ranging from industrial manufacture to daily life, or even from national defense security to space exploration. Searching for high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials and realizing high&#8208;performance EM devices remain&#160;great challenges. Herein, a simple solution&#8208;process is developed to rapidly grow gram&#8208;scale organic&#8211;inorganic (MAPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) perovskite microcrystals. They exhibit excellent EM response in multi bands covering microwaves, visible light, and X&#8208;rays. Among them, outstanding microwave absorption performance with multiple absorption bands can be achieved, and their intrinsic EM properties can be tuned by adjusting polar group. An ultra&#8208;wideband bandpass filter with high suppression level of &#8722;71.8&#160;dB in the stopband in the GHz band, self&#8208;powered photodetectors with tunable broadband or narrowband photoresponse in the visible&#8208;light band, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector with high sensitivity of 3560&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;in the X&#8208;ray band are designed and realized by precisely regulating the physical features of perovskite and designing a novel planar device structure. These findings open a door toward developing high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials for realizing high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices.

         <title>A New Zinc Salt Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new aqueous Zn salt with an anion group, N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide C12H10N(SO2)2&#8722;,&#160;(BBI&#8722;) is designed and synthesized. The 1 m Zn(BBI)2 electrolyte decreases the decomposition activity of H2O molecules, suppresses the&#160;hydrogen evolution reaction, enables compact and uniform zinc deposition, and improves the cycling and calendar stabilities of aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage solutions with low cost and superior safety, but they suffer from chemical and electrochemical degradations closely related to the electrolyte. Here, a new zinc salt design and a drop&#8208;in solution for long cycle&#8208;life aqueous ZIBs are reported. The salt Zn(BBI)2 with a rationally designed anion group, N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide (BBI&#8722;), has a special amphiphilic molecular structure, which combines the benefits of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups to properly tune the solubility and interfacial condition. This new zinc salt does not contain fluorine and is synthesized via a high&#8208;yield and low&#8208;cost method. It is shown that 1&#160;m Zn(BBI)2 aqueous electrolyte with a widened cathodic stability window effectively stabilizes Zn metal/H2O interface, mitigates chemical and electrochemical degradations, and enables both symmetric and full cells using a&#160;zinc&#8208;metal electrode.

         <title>Toughening Double&#8208;Network Hydrogels by Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The employment of the Hoffmeister effect to toughen double&#8208;network hydrogels and broadly tune the mechanical properties using polyelectrolytes is reported. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister&#8208;effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can inhibit hernia formation and accelerate the healing of abdominal wall defects in vivo.








Abstract
The Hoffmeister effect of inorganic salts is verified as a promising way to toughen hydrogels, however, the high concentration of inorganic salts may be accompanied by poor biocompatibility. In this work, it is found that polyelectrolytes can obviously elevate the mechanical performances of hydrogels through the Hoffmeister effect. The introduction of anionic poly(sodium acrylate) into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel induces the aggregation and crystallization of the PVA to boost the mechanical properties of the resulting double&#8208;network hydrogel: elevation of 73, 64, 28, 135, and 19 times in the tensile strength, compressive strength, Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture energy compared with poly(acrylic acid), respectively. It is noteworthy that the mechanical performances of the hydrogels can be flexibly tuned by the variation of polyelectrolyte concentration, ionization degree, relative hydrophobicity of the ionic component, and polyelectrolyte type in a wide range. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister&#8208;effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. Also, the introduction of urea bonds into the polyelectrolyte can further improve the mechanical properties and antiswelling capability of hydrogels. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can efficiently inhibit hernia formation and promote the regeneration of soft tissues in an abdominal wall defect model.

         <title>A Protophilic MOF Enables Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium&#8208;Battery Stable Cycling in a High Water/Acid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique ionic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that combines ultrahigh surface areas and ionic pore environments is used to selectively and effectively adsorb protic impurities from battery electrolytes, realizing high water/acid tolerant&#160;batteries. Even if H2O is introduced into the batteries and generates hydrofluoric acid (HF), such MOF&#8208;based batteries with a high&#8208;nickel cathode still show high cycling performance.








Abstract
Trace protic impurities, such as water and hydrofluoric acid (HF), can severely degrade the stable and long cycling of lithium batteries. Therefore, the costly water removal process is inevitably needed throughout production of lithium batteries, leaving the paradox that energy&#8208;saving lithium&#8208;battery technology consumes non&#8208;negligible amounts of energy. Herein, a unique ionic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is reported that enables highly destructive H2O/HF&#8208;tolerant lithium batteries. The isolated ionic fluorine sites in the MOF exhibit unusual protophilicity and efficiently capture ppm&#8208;levels H2O/HF from the highly polar electrolyte solvents. The resulting MOF&#8208;based LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2&#9474;Li battery achieves over 300 cycles in the presence of 800&#160;ppm H2O or 1107&#160;ppm acidic impurity. This tenfold longer battery lifespan relative to those for batteries with conventional standard separators demonstrates its excellent electrochemical cycling performance. The results reveal that the rational use of unique nanoporous features of MOFs can provide new possibilities for long&#8208;standing challenges in the lithium&#8208;battery industry.

         <title>Amorphous MXene Opens New Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed synthesis methods of amorphous MXene are discussed. The unique structure of amorphous MXenes may possess unexpected properties. The work opens new perspectives on the possibility of MXene amorphization, and their energy conversion, energy storage, and other applications.








Abstract
Recently, novel amorphous nanomaterials formed by introducing atomic irregular arrangement factors have been successfully fabricated, showing superior performance in catalysis, energy storage, and mechanics. Among them, 2D&#160;amorphous nanomaterials are the stars, as they combine the benefits of both 2D structure and amorphous. Up to now, many research studies have been published on the study of 2D amorphous materials. However, as one of the most important parts of 2D materials, the research on MXenes mainly focuses on the crystalline counterpart, while the study of highly disordered forms is much less. This work will provide insight into the possibility of MXenes amorphization, and discusses the application prospect of amorphous MXenes materials.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Confined NiFe Dual Atoms within MoS2 Electrocatalyst for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Confining dual atoms (DAs) within the van der Waals gap of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials is expected to expedite the kinetic and energetic strength in catalytic process, yet is a huge challenge in atomic&#8208;scale precise assembling DAs within two adjacent layers in the 2D limit. Here, an ingenious approach is proposed to assemble DAs of Ni and Fe into the interlayer of MoS2. While inheriting the exceptional merits of diatomic species, this interlayer&#8208;confined structure arms itself with confinement effect, displaying the more favorable adsorption strength on the confined metal active center and higher catalytic activity towards acidic water splitting, as verified by intensive research efforts of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Moreover, the interlayer&#8208;confined structure also renders metal DAs a protective shelter to survive in harsh acidic environment. Our findings embodied the confinement effects at the atom level, and interlayer&#8208;confined assembling of multiple species highlights a general pathway to advance interlayer&#8208;confined DAs catalysts within various 2D materials.

Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskites have shown great application potential in X&#8208;ray detection due to their superior optoelectronic properties and high X&#8208;ray attenuation coefficient.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, halide perovskites have shown great application potential in X-ray detection due to their superior optoelectronic properties and high X-ray attenuation coefficient. However, the large-area perovskite fabrication for high performance X-ray detectors remains extremely challenging. Herein, ultrasound-assisted crystallization combined with hot-pressing method is proposed to prepare large-area (10&#160;cm &#215; 10&#160;cm) and high-quality quasi-monocrystalline thick film of a mixed-cation perovskite MA&lt;sub&gt;0.42&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.58&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The rapid ultrasound-assisted crystallization provides more homogeneous nucleation, which is essential to the fabrication of large-area and uniform perovskite microcrystalline film. Furthermore, the post hot-pressing treatment is implemented to fuse the crystal boundaries, rearrange the crystal grains and eliminate the voids between crystals, resulting in a quasi-monocrystalline film. After the hot-pressing treatment, the carrier mobility and the carrier mobility-lifetime product increased about 13-fold (from 1.8 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 23.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 18 times (from 8.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) respectively. As a result, a high-performance MA&lt;sub&gt;0.42&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.58&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quasi-monocrystalline X-ray detector was achieved with an impressively high sensitivity (1.16 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &#956;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low detection limit (37.4 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), demonstrating the potential of the ultrasound-assisted crystallization and hot-pressing strategy from an industrial perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ion Tunnel Matrix Initiated Oriented Attachment for Highly Utilized Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metallic zinc is an ideal anode for aqueous energy storage, however, Zn anodes suffer from nonhomogeneous deposition, low reversibility and dendrite formation; these lead to an over&#8208;provision of zinc metal in full cells. Herein, we report oriented&#8208;attachment&#8208;regulated Zn stacking initiated through a trapping&#8208;then&#8208;planting process with a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR). Due to the isometric topology features of cubic&#8208;type Prussian blue analogue (PBA), the initial Zn plating occurs at specific sites with equal spacing of &#8764;5 &#197; in the direction perpendicular to the substrate; the trace amount of zinc ions trapped in tunnel matrix provides nuclei for the oriented attachment of Zn (002) deposits. As results, the PBA&#8208;decorated substrate delivers high reversibility of dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping for more than 6600 cycles (1320&#160;h) and achieves an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 100% ZUR. Moreover, the anode&#8208;limited full cell with a low negative&#8208;positive electrode ratio (N/P) of 1.2 can be operated stably for 360 cycles, displaying an energy density of 214&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of metal anodes with high utilization ratio and a practical method for developing high energy density batteries.

         <title>Porosity as a Design Element for Developing Catalytic Molecular Materials for Electrochemical and Photochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sustainable energy inputs is a promising strategy for upcycling of atmospheric carbon into value&#8208;added chemical products. This goal has inspired the development of catalysts for selective and efficient CO2 conversion using electrochemical and photochemical methods. Among the diverse array of catalyst systems designed for this purpose, two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional platforms that feature porosity offer the potential to combine carbon capture and conversion. Included are covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous molecular cages, and other hybrid molecular materials developed to increase active site exposure, stability, and water compatibility while maintaining precise molecular tunability. This mini&#8208;review showcases catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that incorporate well&#8208;defined molecular elements integrated into porous materials structures. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.

         <title>Intramolecular&#8208;Catalyzed Vitrimers with White&#8208;Light Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of intramolecular&#8208;catalyzed vitrimers with white&#8208;light emissions via the synergies between blue and yellow light for light&#8208;emitting diode encapsulations is proposed and developed, where the successful unification of photochemistry and dynamic bond chemistry allows for a rare integration of photoluminescence, dynamic stability, and sustainability in a system.








Abstract
Currently available encapsulating materials for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) have certain limitations, such as the toxicity of phosphors and the non&#8208;recyclable nature of the encapsulating materials. In this study, relatively promising encapsulating materials with two significant advantages are developed. First, the chips can be directly encapsulated without phosphors using luminescent encapsulating materials. Second, the encapsulating materials can be reprocessed for recycling via intramolecular catalysis. To this end, blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting vitrimers (BEVs) are prepared by the reaction of epoxy resin with amines and are found to exhibit strong blue emission and fast stress relaxation via internal catalysis. To obtain white&#8208;light emission, a well&#8208;designed yellow component, perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, is grafted into the BEVs to generate white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting vitrimers (WEVs). A rare synergy of blue&#8208; and yellow&#8208;light emission affords white&#8208;light emission. When the WEV is used as an encapsulating adhesive for 365 nm LED chips without inorganic phosphors, stable white light with CIE coordinates (0.30, 0.32) is successfully achieved, indicating a promising future for WLED encapsulation.

         <title>A Fully Integrated Miniaturized Optical Biosensor for Fast and Multiplexing Plasmonic Detection of High&#8208; and Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Analytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A miniaturized optical biosensor based on organic optoelectronic and nanoplasmonic components, able to perform fast and multiplex plasmonic detection of analytical targets for milk quality and safety: lactoferrin and streptomycin, is presented. Software&#8208;based data analysis and calibration of the sensor is reported, which shows for lactoferrin a limit of detection of 3.7 &#181;g mL&#8722;1, comparable with a reference benchtop analytical instrument.








Abstract
Optical biosensors based on plasmonic sensing schemes combine high sensitivity and selectivity with label&#8208;free detection. However, the use of bulky optical components is still hampering the possibility of obtaining miniaturized systems required for analysis in real settings. Here, a fully miniaturized optical biosensor prototype based on plasmonic detection is demonstrated, which enables fast and multiplex sensing of analytes with high&#8208; and low molecular weight (80&#8239;000 and 582 Da) as quality and safety parameters for milk: a protein (lactoferrin) and an antibiotic (streptomycin). The optical sensor is based on the smart integration of: i) miniaturized organic optoelectronic devices used as light&#8208;emitting and light&#8208;sensing elements and ii) a functionalized nanostructured plasmonic grating for highly sensitive and specific localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The sensor provides quantitative and linear response reaching a limit of detection of 10&#8722;4 refractive index units once it is calibrated by standard solutions. Analyte&#8208;specific and rapid (15 min long) immunoassay&#8208;based detection is demonstrated for both targets. By using a custom algorithm based on principal&#8208;component analysis, a linear dose&#8211;response curve is constructed which correlates with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 3.7&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 for lactoferrin, thus assessing that the miniaturized optical biosensor is well&#8208;aligned with the chosen reference benchtop SPR method.

     alt="A Fully Integrated Miniaturized Optical Biosensor for Fast and Multiplexing Plasmonic Detection of High- and Low-Molecular-Weight Analytes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A miniaturized optical biosensor based on organic optoelectronic and nanoplasmonic components, able to perform fast and multiplex plasmonic detection of analytical targets for milk quality and safety: lactoferrin and streptomycin, is presented. Software-based data analysis and calibration of the sensor is reported, which shows for lactoferrin a limit of detection of 3.7 &#181;g mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable with a reference benchtop analytical instrument.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical biosensors based on plasmonic sensing schemes combine high sensitivity and selectivity with label-free detection. However, the use of bulky optical components is still hampering the possibility of obtaining miniaturized systems required for analysis in real settings. Here, a fully miniaturized optical biosensor prototype based on plasmonic detection is demonstrated, which enables fast and multiplex sensing of analytes with high- and low molecular weight (80&#8239;000 and 582 Da) as quality and safety parameters for milk: a protein (lactoferrin) and an antibiotic (streptomycin). The optical sensor is based on the smart integration of: i) miniaturized organic optoelectronic devices used as light-emitting and light-sensing elements and ii) a functionalized nanostructured plasmonic grating for highly sensitive and specific localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The sensor provides quantitative and linear response reaching a limit of detection of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; refractive index units once it is calibrated by standard solutions. Analyte-specific and rapid (15 min long) immunoassay-based detection is demonstrated for both targets. By using a custom algorithm based on principal-component analysis, a linear dose&#8211;response curve is constructed which correlates with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 3.7&#160;&#181;g mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for lactoferrin, thus assessing that the miniaturized optical biosensor is well-aligned with the chosen reference benchtop SPR method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
As a new solution&#8208;processable laser material, carbon dots (CDs) offer advantages of non&#8208;toxicity, low cost, and high stability, which are conducive to the sustainable development of miniaturized lasers. We prepared full&#8208;color CDs (FC&#8208;CDs) with bright&#8208;blue, green, yellow, red, deep&#8208;red, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence. Their photoluminescence emission ranged from 431 to 714&#160;nm. The FC&#8208;CDs showed narrow full widths at half maximum in the range of 44&#8211;76&#160;nm, with concurrent high radiative transition rates (KR) of 0.54&#8211;1.74 &#215; 108 s&#8722;1; their performance is comparable to that of organic laser dyes, indicating their good gain potential for lasers. Laser pumping of the FC&#8208;CDs gave laser outputs at 467.3, 533.5, 577.4, 616.3, 653.5, and 705.1&#160;nm, spanning from blue to NIR region, and covering 140% of the NTSC color gamut. The FC&#8208;CDs showed high Q&#8208;factors (2000&#8211;5500), appreciable gain coefficients (9&#8211;21.5 cm&#8722;1), and better stability (&#8764;100%@4&#8211;7&#160;h) than commercial laser dyes. These excellent properties make them suitable for high&#8208;quality, colorful, speckle&#8208;free laser imaging and dynamic holographic display. Our findings will be helpful in promoting the practical applications and development of solution&#8208;processable CD&#8208;based lasers.

         <title>Toward a Novel Energy&#8208;Dissipation Metamaterial with Tensegrity Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>A new dissipator with a tensegrity&#8208;based architecture that is highly customizable is presented. It has movement amplification capabilities due to its internal geometry and it is possible to control its stiffness and damping by adjusting the pre&#8208;strain. A 3D&#8208;printed prototype is analyzed and its excellent dissipation abilities are confirmed. Furthermore, this design can serve as a building block for more complex assemblies, like periodic metamaterials with tensegrity architecture.








Abstract
The interest in novel energy&#8208;dissipation devices that offer advanced functionalities for optimal performance in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art engineering applications is growing. In this regard, a highly tunable and innovative dissipator is developed. This dissipator features movement amplification capabilities resulting from the radial replication of a unit&#8208;cell with tensegrity architecture. The kinematic response of the dissipator is analyzed for several layouts, by varying the number of unit&#8208;cells within the device, their internal geometry, and identifying the corresponding locking configurations. A fully operational 3D&#8208;printed prototype is presented, demonstrating its excellent performance in terms of damping capabilities and feasibility. The experimental results are used to validate a numerical model of the flower unit. This model demonstrates the importance of pre&#8208;strain on the overall stiffness and dissipative features of the proposed system. By utilizing these numerical models, it is shown that the proposed device can be used as a building block for more complex assemblies such as periodic metamaterials with tensegrity architecture.

         <title>Tailoring Molecular&#8208;Scale Contact at the Perovskite/Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Material Interface for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With tailored conjugated ligand design, the 2D/3D heterostructure built in perovskite solar cells enhances the interface adhesion between the polymeric hole&#8208;transporting layer&#8212;PTAA and perovskite, and at the same time, realizes a uniform growth of 2D structure on top of 3D perovskite. Therefore, the as&#8208;fabricated device yields a 23.7% power conversion efficiency, along with excellent stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25% and incorporating polymers as hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) can further enhance the stability of devices toward the goal of commercialization. Among the various polymeric hole&#8208;transporting materials, poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) is one of the promising HTL candidates with good stability; however, the hydrophobicity of PTAA causes problematic interfacial contact with the perovskite, limiting the device performance. Using molecular side&#8208;chain engineering, a uniform 2D perovskite interlayer with conjugated ligands, between 3D perovskites and PTAA is successfully constructed. Further, employing conjugated ligands as cohesive elements, perovskite/PTAA interfacial adhesion is significantly improved. As a result, the thin and lateral extended 2D/3D heterostructure enables as&#8208;fabricated PTAA&#8208;based PSCs to achieve a PCE of 23.7%, improved from the 18% of reference devices. Owing to the increased ion&#8208;migration energy barrier and conformal 2D coating, unencapsulated devices with the new ligands exhibit both superior thermal stability under 60&#160;&#176;C heating and moisture stability in ambient conditions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional V2C MXene Assembly in Facilitating Sulfur Evolution Kinetics and Li&#8208;Ion Sieving toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scale&#8208;identified V2C MXene spheres can synchronously promote sulfur&#8208;evolution kinetics and sieve Li&#8208;ions, thereby showing an outstanding dual protection effect on the sulfur cathode and lithium anode for practically working lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising candidates to achieve an energy density of 500&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1. However, the challenges of shuttle effect, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and lithium&#8208;dendrite growth severely obstruct their practical implementation. Herein, multiscale V2C MXene (VC) with a spherical confinement structure is designed as a high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional promotor for the evolution of sulfur and lithium species in Li&#8211;S batteries. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography (X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;CT), small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS), and first&#8208;principle calculations, it is revealed that the activity of VC can be maximized by tuning the scale, and the as&#8208;attained functions are conducted as follows: (i) the VC acts as the efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPS) scavenger due to the large number of active sites; (ii) the VC exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic function for the Li2S nucleation and decomposition reaction kinetics owing to the scale effect; and (iii) the VC can regulate the dynamic behavior of Li&#8208;ions and thus stabilize the lithium plating/stripping effectively on account of the unique ion&#8208;sieving effect.

         <title>Generic Air&#8208;gen Effect in Nanoporous Materials for Sustainable Energy Harvesting from Air Humidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Air humidity is a vast, sustainable reservoir of energy that, unlike solar and wind, is continuously available. However, previously described technologies for harvesting energy from air humidity are either not continuous or require unique material synthesis or processing, which has stymied scalability and broad deployment. Here, we report a generic effect for continuous energy harvesting from air humidity, which can be applied to a broad range of inorganic, organic, and biological materials. The common feature of these materials is that they are engineered with appropriate nanopores to allow air water to pass through and undergo dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption exchange at the porous interface, resulting in surface charging. The top exposed interface experiences such dynamic interaction more than the bottom sealed interface in a thin&#8208;film device structure, yielding a spontaneous and sustained charging gradient for continuous electric output. Analyses of material properties and electric outputs lead to a &#8220;leaky capacitor&#8221; model that can describe how electricity is harvested and predict current behaviors consistent with experiments. Predictions from the model guide the fabrication of devices made from heterogeneous junctions of different material combinations to further expand the device category. The work opens a wide door for the broad exploration of sustainable electricity from ambient air.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Size&#8208;transformable and Bioactivity&#8208;switchable Self&#8208;assembling Chimeric Peptide Nano&#8208;assemblies for Combating Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Biofilms</title>

Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections are prominent problems in the field of antibacterial medicine, seriously affecting human and animal health. Despite the great potential of nanomaterials in the antibacterial field, overcoming the paradox of size and charge, efficient penetration, and retention within biofilms remain a formidable challenge. Here, we designed self&#8208;assembling chimeric peptide nano&#8208;assemblies composed of multiple functional fragments for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Notably, the chimeric peptide self&#8208;assembling into nanofibers at pH 7.4, transformable into nanoparticles in the acidic biofilm&#8208;infected microenvironment at pH 5.0, thus achieving a size reduction and charge increase, improving the penetration into the bacterial biofilms, and killing drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by a mechanism dominated by membrane cleavage. In vivo mouse and piglet infection models confirm the ability of chimeric peptide nano&#8208;assemblies to reduce bacterial load within biofilms. Collectively, this research on pathological environment&#8208;driven nano&#8208;structural transformations may provide a theoretical basis for designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial nanomaterials and advance the application of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in medicine and animal husbandry.

         <title>Quantifying Charge Extraction and Recombination Using the Rise and Decay of the Transient Photovoltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. The present paper provides a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential equations that is solved analytically by determining the eigenvalues of a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay times during a transient photovoltage measurement, w e determine the rates of carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage and establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the perovskite solar cell.

         <title>Ionic accumulation as a diagnostic tool in perovskite solar cells: characterising band alignment with rapid voltage pulses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite record&#8208;breaking devices, interfaces in perovskite solar cells are still poorly understood, inhibiting further progress. The mixed ionic&#8208;electronic nature of lead&#8208;halide perovskites results in compositional variations at the interfaces, depending on the history of externally applied biases. This makes it difficult to measure critical parameters accurately, for example, the band energy alignment of charge extraction layers. As a result, the field often resorts to a lengthy trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process to optimise these interfaces. While techniques to measure interfacial energy level alignment exist, they are typically carried out in a vacuum and on incomplete cells, hence values may not reflect those found in complete device stacks. To address this, w e have developed a pulsed measurement technique that can characterise the electrostatic potential energy drop across the perovskite layer in a functioning device. O ur method reconstructs the JV curve for a range of stabilisation biases which hold the ion distribution &#8220;static&#8221; during subsequent rapid voltage pulses. W e observe two different regimes: at low applied biases, the reconstructed JV curve is &#8220;s&#8208;shaped&#8221;, whereas, at high applied biases, typical diode&#8208;shaped curves are returned. Using drift&#8208;diffusion simulations, w e demonstrate that the intersection of the two regimes changes based on the band offsets at the transport layer interfaces. This approach effectively allows measurements of interfacial energy level alignment in a complete device under illumination and without the need for expensive vacuum equipment.

         <title>Flexible Electrodes for Brain&#8208;Computer Interface System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Brain&#8208;computer interface (BCI) has been the subject of extensive research recently. Governments and companies have substantially invested in relevant research and applications. The restoration of communication and motor function, the treatment of psychological disorders, gaming, and other daily and therapeutic applications all benefit from BCI. The electrodes hold the key to the essential, fundamental BCI precondition of electrical brain activity detection and delivery. However, the traditional rigid electrodes are limited due to their&#160;mismatch&#160;in Young's&#160;modulus, potential damages to the human body and a decline in signal quality with time. These factors make the development of flexible electrodes vital and urgent. Flexible electrodes made of soft materials have grown in popularity in recent years as an alternative to conventional rigid electrodes because they offer greater conformance, the potential for higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) signals, and a wider range of applications. Therefore, the latest classifications and future developmental directions of fabricating these flexible electrodes are explored in this paper to further encourage the speedy advent of flexible electrodes for BCI. In summary, the perspectives and future outlook for this developing discipline are provided.

         <title>MXene&#8208;based Functional Platforms for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, 2D transition metal carbide, nitride, and carbonitrides (MXenes) materials stand out in the field of tumor therapy, particularly in the construction of functional platforms for optimal antitumor therapy due to their high specific surface area, tunable performance, strong absorption of near&#8208;infrared light as well as preferable surface plasmon resonance effect. In this review, we summarize the progress of MXene&#8208;mediated antitumor therapy after appropriate modifications or integration procedures. We discuss in detail the enhanced antitumor treatments directly performed by MXenes, the significant improving effect of MXenes on different antitumor therapies, as well as the MXene&#8208;mediated imaging&#8208;guided antitumor strategies. Moreover, the existing challenges and future development directions of MXenes in tumor therapy are presented.

         <title>Low&#8208;power and Field&#8208;free Perpendicular Magnetic Memory Driven by Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Giant spin-orbit torque (SOT) from topological insulators (TIs) has great potential for the low-power SOT-driven magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM). Here, we demonstrate the functional 3-terminal SOT-MRAM device by integrating the TI [(BiSb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] with perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), where the tunneling magnetoresistance is employed for the effective reading method. The ultralow switching current density of 1.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in the TI-pMTJ device at room temperature, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than that in conventional heavy metals-based systems, due to the high SOT efficiency &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SH&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.16 of (BiSb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;based robotics approach for targeting fungal infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off&#8208;target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, w e develop a nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotic platform that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine&#8208;scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (Candida albicans) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS&#8208;mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo&#8208;like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to Candida&#8208;infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on&#8208;site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 minutes. This nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotics approach provides a uniquely effective and targeted therapeutic modality for pathogen elimination at the infection site.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mesoporous microparticles have the potential to be used in various fields, such as energy generation, sensing and the environmental field. Recently, the process of making homogeneous microparticles in an economical and environmentally friendly way has gained much attention. Herein, w e produce rectangular mesoporous microblocks of various designs by manipulating the fragmentation of colloidal films consisting of micropyramids while controlling the notch angles of pyramidal edges. During calcination of the colloidal films, cracks are generated in the valleys of micropyramids acting as notches, and the angle of notches can be controlled by the prepattern underneath the micropyramids. By changing the location of notches with sharp angles, w e control the shape of microblocks with excellent uniformity. After detaching the microblocks from substrates, mesoporous microparticles of various sizes with multiple functions are easily produced. W e demonstrate anticounterfeiting functions by encoding the rotation angles of rectangular microblocks of various sizes. In addition, the mesoporous microparticles can be utilized for separating desired chemicals mixed with chemicals of different charges. The method of fabricating size&#8208;tunable functionalized mesoporous microblocks can be a platform technology to prepare special films and catalysts and for environmental applications.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Precise Heteroatom Core&#8208;Tailoring of Nanoclusters for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported atomically precise gold&#8208;silver core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, Au12Ag32/TiO2, are fabricated through strong cluster&#8211;support interactions. The controlled modulation of the electronic structure of the nanoclusters through the incorporation of the metallic gold core plays a critical role in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers, making Au12Ag32/TiO2 a &#8776;38&#8208;fold more efficient photocatalyst than TiO2 for hydrogen production (6.8 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) from solar water splitting.








Abstract
While core&#8211;shell nanomaterials are highly desirable for realizing enhanced optical and catalytic properties, their synthesis with atomic&#8208;level control is challenging. Here, the synthesis and crystal structure of [Au12Ag32(SePh)30]4&#8722;, the first example of selenolated Au&#8211;Ag core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, comprising a gold icosahedron core trapped in a silver dodecahedron, which is protected by an Ag12(SePh)30 shell, is presented. The gold core strongly modifies the overall electronic structure and induces synergistic effects, resulting in high enhancements in the stability and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II photoluminescence. The Au12Ag32 and its homometal analog Ag44, show strong interactions with oxygen vacancies of TiO2, facilitating the interfacial charge transfer for photocatalysis. Indeed, the Au12Ag32/TiO2 exhibits remarkable solar H2 production (6810&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), which is &#8776;6.2 and &#8776;37.8 times higher than that of Ag44/TiO2 and TiO2, respectively. Good stability and recyclability with minimal catalytic activity loss are additional features of Au12Ag32/TiO2. The experimental and computational results reveal that the Au12Ag32 acts as an efficient cocatalyst by possessing a favorable electronic structure that aligns well with the TiO2 bands for the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers due to the relatively negatively charged Au12 core. These atomistic insights will motivate uncovering of the structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships of other nanoclusters.

Abstract
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a polyfactorial process associated with alterations in metabolic pathways. A high&#8208;performance screening tool for EOC is in high demand to improve prognostic outcome but is still missing. Here, a concave octahedron Mn2O3/(Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 (MO/CMO) composite with a heterojunction, rough surface, hollow interior, and sharp corners is developed to record metabolic patterns of ovarian tumors by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). The MO/CMO composites with multiple physical effects induce enhanced light absorption, preferred charge transfer, increased photothermal conversion, and selective trapping of small molecules. The MO/CMO shows &#8776;2&#8211;5&#8208;fold signal enhancement compared to mono&#8208; or dual&#8208;enhancement counterparts, and &#8776;10&#8211;48&#8208;fold compared to the commercialized products. Subsequently, serum metabolic fingerprints of ovarian tumors are revealed by MO/CMO&#8208;assisted LDI&#8208;MS, achieving high reproducibility of direct serum detection without treatment. Furthermore, machine learning of the metabolic fingerprints distinguishes malignant ovarian tumors from benign controls with the area under the curve value of 0.987. Finally, seven metabolites associated with the progression of ovarian tumors are screened as potential biomarkers. The approach guides the future depiction of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrix for intensive MS detection and accelerates the growth of nanomaterials&#8208;based platforms toward precision diagnosis scenarios.

         <title>Reversible Perspiring Artificial &#8220;Fingertips&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a coating made of liquid crystal networks&#160;is designed to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography, but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the tribological property when the coating is in contact with other surfaces.








Abstract
Fingertip perspiration is a vital process within human predation, to which the species owes its survival and its biological success. In this paper, the unique human ability of extensive perspiration and controlled friction in self&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystals is recreated, mimicking the natural processes that occur in the dermis and epidermis of human skin. This is achieved by inducing porosity in responsive, liquid&#8208;bearing material through the controlled&#8208;polymerization phase&#8208;separation process. The unique topography of human fingerprints is further emulated in the materials by balancing the parallel chirality&#8208;induced force and the perpendicular substrate&#8208;anchoring force during synthesis. As a result, artificial fingertips are capable of secreting and re&#8208;absorbing liquid upon light illumination. By demonstrating the function of the soft material in a tribological aspect, it exhibits a controllable anti&#8208;sliding property&#160;comparable to human fingertips and subsequently attains a higher degree of biomimicry. This biomimetic fingertip is envisioned being applied in a multitude of fields, ranging from biomedical instruments to interactive, human&#8208;like soft robotic devices.

         <title>Oxidization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Triggered Rapid Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foils, rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) (up to 320 cm2) is achieved within 60 min, thanks to the transformation of the thin CuxO layer to a Cu(111) seed layer. Large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111), and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart.








Abstract
The controlled preparation of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is intensively investigated owing to the superior properties of Cu(111) and its advantages in synthesizing high&#8208;quality 2D materials, especially graphene. However, the accessibility of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is still hindered by time&#8208;consuming, complicated, and high&#8208;cost preparation methods. Here, the oxidization&#8208;temperature&#8208;triggered rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) in which an area up to 320 cm2 is prepared within 60 min, and where low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foil surface plays a vital role, is reported. A mechanism is proposed, by which the thin CuxO layer transforms to a Cu(111) seed layer on the surface of Cu to induce the formation of a large&#8208;area Cu(111) foil, which is supported by both experimental data and molecular dynamics simulation results. In addition, a large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene film is synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foil surface and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart. This work, therefore, not only provides a new avenue toward the monocrystallinity of Cu with specific planes but also contributes to improving the mass production of high&#8208;quality 2D materials.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Dual&#8208;Function Fabric for Zero&#8208;Energy Thermal Environmental Management through Multiband, Synergistic, and Asymmetric Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;function fabric with both radiative cooling and solar heating functions on two sides of the fabric is developed. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance for zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. As a roof coating, the dual&#8208;function fabric can achieve &#8776;22.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 energy saving, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 billion kg global CO2 emission reduction.








Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling techniques have been proposed for passive space thermal management to reduce the global energy burden. However, the currently used single&#8208;function envelope/coating materials can only achieve static temperature regulation, presenting limited energy savings and poor adaption to dynamic environments. In this study, a sandwich&#8208;structured fabric, composed of vertical graphene, graphene glass fiber fabric, and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers is developed, with heating and cooling functions integrated through multiband, synergistic, (solar spectrum and mid&#8208;infrared ranges) and asymmetric optical modulations on two sides of the fabric. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance in a zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. Furthermore, it demonstrates &#8776;15.5 and &#8776;31.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 higher annual energy savings compared to those of their cooling&#8208;only and heating&#8208;only counterparts, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 MT reduction in the global CO2 emission. The fabric exhibits high scalability for batch manufacturing with commercially abundant raw materials and facile technologies, providing a favorable guarantee of its mass production and use.

         <title>Engineering and Development of a Tissue Model for the Evaluation of Microneedle Penetration Ability, Drug Diffusion, Photothermal Activity, and Ultrasound Imaging: A Promising Surrogate to Ex Vivo and In Vivo Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue models based on hydrogel/silicone are prepared for different applications in biomedical sectors. Such customized tissue surrogates can be employed as a platform to evaluate the ability of microneedle insertion, the diffusion of drugs, the activity of photothermal agents, as well as the performance of ultrasound bioimaging.








Abstract
Driven by regulatory authorities and the ever&#8208;growing demands from industry, various artificial tissue models have been developed. Nevertheless, there is no model to date that is capable of mimicking the biomechanical properties of the skin whilst exhibiting the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity properties of the skin layers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, tissue surrogates based on gel and silicone are fabricated for the evaluation of microneedle penetration, drug diffusion, photothermal activity, and ultrasound bioimaging. The silicone layer aims to imitate the stratum corneum while the gel layer aims to mimic the water&#8208;rich viable epidermis and dermis present in in vivo tissues. The diffusion of drugs across the tissue model is assessed, and the results reveal that the proposed tissue model shows similar behavior to a cancerous kidney. In place of typical in vitro aqueous solutions, this model can also be employed for evaluating the photoactivity of photothermal agents since the tissue model shows a similar heating profile to skin of mice when irradiated with near&#8208;infrared laser. In addition, the designed tissue model exhibits promising results for biomedical applications in optical coherence tomography and ultrasound imaging. Such a tissue model paves the way to reduce the use of animals testing in research whilst obviating ethical concerns.

         <title>Mobile Trions in Electrically Tunable 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controlled, bipolar tuning of the excitonic light emission is achieved in 2D perovskites via the field effect in a van der Waals heterostructure. The formation of trions with exceptionally high binding energies up to 46&#160;meV is demonstrated. Localized at liquid helium temperature, these charged excitons become mobile toward 50&#160;K with effective mobilities up to 200 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;emitting applications. It remains extremely challenging, however, to externally control their optical response due to the difficulties of introducing electrical doping. Here, an approach of interfacing ultrathin sheets of perovskites with few&#8208;layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride into gate&#8208;tunable, hybrid heterostructures, is demonstrated. It allows for bipolar, continuous tuning of light emission and absorption in 2D perovskites by electrically injecting carriers to densities as high as 1012&#160;cm&#8722;2. This reveals the emergence of both negatively and positively charged excitons, or trions, with binding energies up to 46&#160;meV, among the highest measured for 2D systems. Trions are shown to dominate light emission and propagate with mobilities reaching 200&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at elevated temperatures. The findings introduce the physics of interacting mixtures of optical and electrical excitations to the broad family of 2D inorganic&#8211;organic nanostructures. The presented strategy to electrically control the optical response of 2D perovskites highlights it as a promising material platform toward electrically modulated light&#8208;emitters, externally guided charged exciton currents, and exciton transistors based on layered, hybrid&#160;semiconductors.

         <title>Modular Design of a Polymer&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Based Mechanically Compliant Worm&#8208;Like Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically compliant earthworm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular soft body that primarily consists of polymers is presented. The robot is based on electrothermally actuated polymer&#8208;bilayer&#8208;based segments and is capable of directional locomotion on various surfaces, turning on the spot, steering during forward movement, and, most strikingly, squeezing itself through constrictions that are smaller than its cross&#8208;section in the resting state.








Abstract
Soft earthworm&#8208;like robots that exhibit mechanical compliance can, in principle, navigate through uneven terrains and constricted spaces that are inaccessible to traditional legged and wheeled robots. However, unlike the biological originals that&#160;they mimic, most of the worm&#8208;like robots reported to date contain rigid components that limit their compliance, such as electromotors or pressure&#8208;driven actuation systems. Here, a mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular body that is based on soft polymers is reported. The robot is composed of strategically assembled, electrothermally activated polymer bilayer actuators, which are based on a semicrystalline polyurethane with an exceptionally large nonlinear thermal expansion coefficient. The segments are designed on the basis of a modified Timoshenko model, and finite element analysis simulation is used to describe their performance. Upon electrical activation of the segments with basic waveform patterns, the robot can move through repeatable peristaltic locomotion on exceptionally slippery or sticky surfaces and it can be oriented in any direction. The soft body enables the robot to wriggle through openings and tunnels that are much smaller than its cross&#8208;section.

         <title>All&#8208;Transfer Electrode Interface Engineering Toward Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated by engineering the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer technique of van der Waals electrodes. The intact and defect&#8208;free interfaces not only reduce the Schottky barrier height at electrodes, but enable high resistances of the MoS2 devices to humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes.








Abstract
Nanoscale electronic devices that can work in harsh environments are in high demand for wearable, automotive, and aerospace electronics. Clean and defect&#8208;free interfaces are of vital importance for building nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices. However, current nanoscale devices are subject to failure in these environments, especially at defective electrode&#8211;channel interfaces. Here, harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 transistors are developed by engineering electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer of van der Waals electrodes. The delivered defect&#8208;free, graphene&#8208;buffered electrodes keep the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces intact and robust. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 devices have reduced Schottky barrier heights, leading to a very large on&#8208;state current and high carrier mobility. More importantly, the defect&#8208;free, hydrophobic graphene buffer layer prevents metal diffusion from the electrodes to MoS2 and the intercalation of water molecules at the electrode&#8211;MoS2 interfaces. This enables high resistances of MoS2 devices with all&#8208;transfer electrodes to various harsh environments, including humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes. The work deepens the understanding of the roles of electrode&#8211;channel interfaces in nanoscale devices and provides a promising interface engineering strategy to build nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices.

         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled silicon&#8208; and Mott&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors ares developed, which exhibit a large superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18), an ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA, high photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and great detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones). Night vision pattern recognition even with noisy inputs is demonstrated, offering intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor vision processing.








Abstract
Light&#8208;intensity selective superlinear photodetectors with ultralow dark current can provide an essential breakthrough for the development of high&#8208;performing near&#8208;sensor vision processing. However, the development of near&#8208;sensor vision processing is not only conceptually important for device operation (given that sensors naturally exhibit linear/sublinear responses), but also essential to get rid of the massive amount of data generated during object sensing and classification with noisy inputs. Therefore, achieving the giant superlinear photoresponse while maintaining the picoampere leakage current, irrespective of the measurement bias, is one of the most challenging tasks. Here, Mott material (vanadium dioxide) and silicon&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors are developed that show giant superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18) and ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA. Specifically, the device demonstrates an electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition, which leads to outstanding photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), a high responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and excellent detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones), while maintaining response speed (&#964;r&#160;=&#160;6&#160;&#181;s and &#964;f&#160;=&#160;10&#160;&#181;s). Further, intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing is demonstrated and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs is exhibited. This research will pave the way for the creation of high&#8208;performance photodetectors with potential uses, such as in night vision, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic processing.

         <title>Principles for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Assisted Nitrides Epitaxial Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematically studying the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D materials&#160;interface, it is found that graphene is the ideal buffer layer for nitrides&#8217; remote epitaxy while WS2 for nitrides&#8217; van der Waals epitaxy. As a result, a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategies and basic guidelines for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy is presented. This work may open a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.








Abstract
Beyond traditional heteroepitaxy, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted epitaxy opens opportunities to revolutionize future material integration methods. However, basic principles in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy remain unclear, which impedes understanding the essence, thus hindering its progress. Here, the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D material interface is theoretically established, which is further confirmed experimentally. It is found that the atomic interaction at the nitrides/2D material interface is related to the nature of underlying substrates. For single&#8208;crystalline substrates, the heterointerface behaves like a covalent one and the epilayer inherits the substrate's lattice. Meanwhile, for amorphous substrates, the heterointerface tends to be a van der Waals one and strongly relies on the properties of 2D materials. Therefore, modulated by graphene, the nitrides&#8217; epilayer is polycrystalline. In contrast, single&#8208;crystalline GaN films are successfully achieved on WS2. These results provide a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategy for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy. It also opens a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.

         <title>Dynamic and Reversible Decoration of DNA&#8208;Based Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;based approach to decorating DNA&#8208;based scaffolds in a dynamic and reversible way is demonstrated. Enzyme&#8208;responsive strands in the assembled scaffolds undergo degradation and spontaneous replacement by strands decorated with different labels in the presence of their corresponding enzymes.








Abstract
An approach to achieving dynamic and reversible decoration of DNA&#8208;based scaffolds is demonstrated here. To do this, rationally engineered DNA tiles containing enzyme&#8208;responsive strands covalently conjugated to different molecular labels are employed. These strands are designed to be recognized and degraded by specific enzymes (i.e., Ribonuclease H, RNase H, or Uracil DNA Glycosylase, UDG) inducing their spontaneous de&#8208;hybridization from the assembled tile and replacement by a new strand conjugated to a different label. Multiple enzyme&#8208;responsive strands that specifically respond to different enzymes allow for dynamic, orthogonal, and reversible decoration of the DNA structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of the strategy, the possibility to orthogonally control the distribution of different labels (i.e., fluorophores and small molecules) on the same scaffold without crosstalk is demonstrated. By doing so, DNA scaffolds that display different antibody recognition patterns are obtained. The approach offers the possibility to control the decoration of higher&#8208;order supramolecular assemblies (including origami) with several functional moieties to achieve functional biomaterials with improved adaptability, precision, and sensing capabilities.

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing of their body shape is significant for soft robots planning trajectories and actions, which can also be a feedback to interactions with the environment. We&#160;present a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin, confluence with machine learning technique, endows soft robots with proprioception of their own status and exteroception of environment awareness, exhibiting advanced artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Inspired by natural biological systems, soft robots have recently been developed, showing tremendous potential in real&#8208;world applications because of their intrinsic softness and deformability. The confluence of electronic skins and machine learning is extensively studied to create effective biomimetic robotic systems. Based on a differential piezoelectric matrix, this study presents a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin (SSES) that can recognize surface conformations with minimal interference from pressing, stretching, or other surrounding stimuli. It is then integrated with soft robots to reconstruct their shape during movement, serving as a proprioceptive sense. Additionally, the robot can utilize machine learning to identify various terrains, demonstrating exteroception and pointing toward more advanced autonomous robots capable of performing real&#8208;world tasks in challenging environments.

         <title>Heteroepitaxy of 2D CuCr2Te4 with Robust Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a heteroepitaxial growth strategy of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and Cr2Te3, with thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K via interfacial charge transfer in lattice&#8208;matched CuCr2Te4/Cr2Te3 heterostructure. The thickness&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetic heterostructures are promising for constructing functional spintronic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in 2D have attracted widespread attention for their intriguing magnetic properties. 2D magnetic heterostructures can provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring fundamental physics and novel spintronic devices. Here, the heteroepitaxial growth of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets is reported on Cr2Te3 and mica by chemical vapor deposition. Magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal the thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica, where a decrease of Curie temperature (TC) from 320 to 260&#160;K and an enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with reducing thickness are observed. Moreover, lattice&#8208;matched heteroepitaxial ultrathin CuCr2Te4 on Cr2Te3 exhibits an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K due to the interfacial charge transfer. Stripe&#8208;type magnetic domains and single magnetic domain are discovered in this heterostructure with different thicknesses. The work provides a way to construct robust room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetic heterostructures for functional spintronic devices.

         <title>Magnetic&#8211;Acoustic Sequentially Actuated CAR T Cell Microrobots for Precision Navigation and In Situ Antitumor Immunoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#8208;CAR Ts are created by decorating CAR T cells with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation, and they are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and antitumor immune responses, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated CAR T. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Despite its clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)&#8208;cell immunotherapy remains limited in solid tumors, owing to the harsh physical barriers and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here a CAR&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;based live microrobot (M&#8208;CAR T) is created by decorating CAR T with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation. M&#8208;CAR Ts are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and in situ activation of antitumor immune responses. Sequential actuation endows M&#8208;CAR Ts with magnetically actuated anti&#8208;flow and obstacle avoidance as well as tissue penetration driven by acoustic propulsion, enabling efficient migration and accumulation in artificial tumor models. In vivo, sequentially actuated M&#8208;CAR Ts achieves long&#8208;distance targeting and accumulate at the peritumoural area under programmable magnetic guidance, and subsequently acoustic tweezers actuate M&#8208;CAR Ts to migrate&#160;into deep tumor tissues, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated exogenous CD8+ CAR T cells compared with that without actuation. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy. Thus, this&#160;sequential&#8208;actuation&#8208;guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in situ T&#8208;cell immunoactivation, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation and cancer immunotherapies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)-cell immunotherapy remains limited in solid tumors, owing to the harsh physical barriers and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here a CAR-T-cell-based live microrobot (M-CAR T) is created by decorating CAR T with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation. M-CAR Ts are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and in situ activation of antitumor immune responses. Sequential actuation endows M-CAR Ts with magnetically actuated anti-flow and obstacle avoidance as well as tissue penetration driven by acoustic propulsion, enabling efficient migration and accumulation in artificial tumor models. In vivo, sequentially actuated M-CAR Ts achieves long-distance targeting and accumulate at the peritumoural area under programmable magnetic guidance, and subsequently acoustic tweezers actuate M-CAR Ts to migrate&#160;into deep tumor tissues, resulting in a 6.6-fold increase in accumulated exogenous CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CAR T cells compared with that without actuation. Anti-CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy. Thus, this&#160;sequential-actuation-guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in situ T-cell immunoactivation, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation and cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Blocking Spatiotemporal Crosstalk between Subcellular Organelles for Enhancing Anticancer Therapy with Nanointercepters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organelle communication interception nanosystem is constructed with an amorphous Fe0 core and an ultrathin crystalline Fe3O4 shell (ACFeNPs). &#183;OH can efficiently generate along with the spatiotemporal trajectory of ACFeNPs within tumor cells. ACFeNPs transfer from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum and block the crosstalk between them, sequentially trigger&#160;AMPK/mTOR, lysosomal damage, and the IRE1/JNK signaling pathway, ultimately inducing deep apoptosis of tumor cells that cannot be alleviated. All experiments confirm the enhanced tumor inhibition of the organelle communication spatiotemporal interception strategy and reveal the biomolecular mechanism.








Abstract
The spatiotemporal characterization of signaling crosstalk between subcellular organelles is crucial for the therapeutic effect of malignant tumors. Blocking interactive crosstalk in this fashion is significant but challenging. Herein, a communication interception strategy is reported, which blocks spatiotemporal crosstalk between subcellular organelles for cancer therapy with underlying molecular mechanisms. Briefly, amorphous&#8208;core@crystalline&#8208;shell Fe@Fe3O4 nanoparticles (ACFeNPs) are fabricated to specifically block the crosstalk between lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hydroxyl radicals generated along with their trajectory through heterogeneous Fenton reaction. ACFeNPs initially enter lysosomes and trigger autophagy, then continuous lysosomal damage blocks the generation of functional autolysosomes, which mediates ER&#8211;lysosome crosstalk, thus the autophagy is paralyzed. Thereafter, released ACFeNPs from lysosomes induce ER stress. Without the alleviation by autophagy, the ER&#8208;stress&#8208;associated apoptotic pathway is fully activated, resulting in a remarkable therapeutic effect. This strategy provides a wide venue for nanomedicine to exert biological advantages and confers new perspective for the design of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>Young Exosome Bio&#8208;Nanoparticles Restore Aging&#8208;Impaired Tendon Stem/Progenitor Cell Function and Reparative Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exosome&#160;bio&#8208;nanoparticles from stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) inhibit senescent phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells and rescue their tenogenic differentiation capacity by inhibiting histone methylation and nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B. Local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres exhibits excellent anti&#8208;aging effects, including reducing senescent cells and heterotopic&#160;ossification, and thereby restores endogenous tendon regeneration capacity in aged rats.








Abstract
Aging impairs tendon stem/progenitor&#160;cell function and tendon homeostasis, however, effective treatments for aging&#8208;induced tendon diseases are lacking. Exosomes are naturally derived nanoparticles that contain bioactive molecules, and therefore, have attracted great interest in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, it is shown that young exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) possess abundant anti&#8208;aging signals. These young bio&#8208;nanoparticles can alleviate the aging phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells (AT&#8208;SCs) and maintain their tenogenic capacity. Mechanistically, SHED&#8208;Exos modulate histone methylation and inhibit nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B to reverse AT&#8208;SC aging. In a naturally aging mouse model, systemic administration of SHED&#8208;Exo bio&#8208;nanoparticles retards tendon degeneration. Interestingly, local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres confers anti&#8208;aging phenotypes, including reduced senescent cells and decreased ectopic bone formation, thereby functionally and structurally rescuing endogenous tendon regeneration and repair capacity in aged rats. Overall, SHED&#8208;Exos, as natural bioactive nanoparticles, have promising translational and therapeutic potential for aging&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Tough Hydrogel Electrolytes for Anti&#8208;Freezing Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>

Co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; are synergistically utilized to create a flexible electrolyte with superior strength, freezing tolerance, high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential over semi&#8208;closed&#8208;pore&#160;counterparts), and stable cycling, benefitting from the suppressed dendritic growth and side reactions (30&#8201;000 cycles), which pushes the limit of flexible batteries toward higher stability in harsh environments.








Abstract
As the soaring demand for energy storage continues to grow, batteries that can cope with extreme conditions are highly desired. Yet, existing battery materials are limited by weak mechanical properties and freeze&#8208;vulnerability, prohibiting safe energy storage in devices that are exposed to low temperature and unusual mechanical impacts. Herein, a fabrication method harnessing the synergistic effect of co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; that can produce poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel electrolytes with unique open&#8208;cell porous structures, composed of strongly aggregated polymer chains, and containing disrupted hydrogen bonds among free water molecules, is introduced. The hydrogel electrolyte simultaneously combines high strength (tensile strength 15.6&#160;MPa), freeze&#8208;tolerance (&lt;&#160;&#8722;77 &#176;C), high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential), and dendrite and parasitic reactions suppression for stable performance (30&#8201;000 cycles). The high generality of this method is further demonstrated with poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) and poly(N&#8208;tertbutylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) hydrogels. This work takes a further step toward flexible battery development for harsh environments.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond 2D Perovskite Scintillators by Dielectric Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy to shorten the scintillation decay time by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and [PbBr6]2&#8722; octahedral emitters in 2D perovskites is shown. Benzimidazole (BM) with conjugated structure inserts between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, shortening the emitting decay time into sub&#8208;nanosecond region. The sub&#8208;nanosecond BM2PbBr4 scintillator exhibits excellent performance in high energy photons and particles detection.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for ultrafast scintillators with high light yield. However, the decay time of perovskite still cannot be further minimized into sub&#8208;nanosecond region, while sub&#8208;nanosecond scintillators are highly demanded in various radiation detection, including high speed X&#8208;ray imaging, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight based tomography or particle discrimination, and timing resolution measurement in synchrotron radiation facilities, etc. Here, a rational design strategy is showed to shorten the scintillation decay time, by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and Pb&#8208;Br octahedral emitters in 2D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP). Benzimidazole (BM) with low dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, resulting in a surprisingly large exciton binding energy (360.3 &#177; 4.8 meV) of 2D OIHP BM2PbBr4. The emitting decay time is shortened as 0.97&#160;ns, which is smallest among all the perovskite materials. Moreover, the light yield is 3190&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1, which is greatly higher than conventional ultrafast scintillator BaF2 (1500&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1). The rare combination of ultrafast decay time and considerable light yield renders BM2PbBr4 excellent performance in &#947;&#8208;ray, neutron, &#945;&#8208;particle detection, and the best theoretical coincidence time resolution of 65.1&#160;ps, which is only half of the reference sample LYSO (141.3&#160;ps).

The rare combination of ultrafast decay time and considerable light yield renders BM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; excellent performance in &#947;-ray, neutron, &#945;-particle detection, and the best theoretical coincidence time resolution of 65.1&#160;ps, which is only half of the reference sample LYSO (141.3&#160;ps).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetramode Metamaterials as Phonon Polarizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental realization and application of a tetramode material are presented. According to Cauchy elasticity, four out of the six deformation modes of such materials are considered &#8220;easy&#8221;. A property that can be exploited as a compact broadband polarizer for transverse phonons. This is demonstrated experimentally with a 3D metamaterial structure fabricated using direct laser writing.








Abstract
In classical Cauchy elasticity, 3D materials exhibit six eigenmodes of deformation. Following the 1995 work of Milton and Cherkaev, extremal elastic materials can be classified by the number of eigenmodes, N, out of these six that are &#8220;easy&#8221;. Using Greek number words, this leads to hexamode (N&#160;= 6), pentamode (N&#160;= 5), tetramode (N&#160;= 4), trimode (N&#160;= 3), dimode (N&#160;= 2), and monomode (N&#160;= 1) materials. While hexamode materials are unstable in all regards, the possibility of pentamode metamaterials (&#8220;meta&#8208;fluids&#8221;) has attracted considerable attention throughout the last decade. Here, inspired by the 2021 theoretical work of Wei, Liu, and Hu, microstructured 3D polymer&#8208;based tetramode metamaterials are designed and characterized by numerical band&#8208;structure calculations, fabricated by laser printing, characterized by ultrasound experiments, and compared to the theoretical ideal. An application in terms of a compact and broadband polarizer for acoustical phonons at ultrasound frequencies is demonstrated.

         <title>Prominent Free Charges Tunneling Through Organic Interlayer of 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We&#160;have constructed convertible RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 perovskite with one organic amine through a protonation control strategy. Organic cations in (4AEPy)PbI4 participate in band edge construction, making its exciton binding energy as low as 27.3 meV and producing more free carriers.








Abstract
The diversity of organic cations greatly enriches the species of 2D perovskites; traditional 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) and Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites are synthesized by two different organic amines. Here, according to the difference in pKa values between conjugated acids of monoprotonated and biprotonated 4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridine (4AEPy) ions, the 2D perovskites of RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 from same organic amine is reported, which can realize reversible transformation under the treatment of HI and NH3, respectively. The interaction of N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond between adjacent organic molecules in (4AEPy)2PbI4 leads to the bending conformation of ethylamine groups, which results in a 2.4 &#197; reduction in layer spacing compared to typical phenylethylamine lead iodine ((PEA)2PbI4) 2D perovskite. Besides, the ethylamine groups of organic layers in (4AEPy)PbI4 are deeply inserted into octahedral cavities and directly participate in the construction of the conduction band minimum, which leads to a small exciton binding energy of 27.3 meV&#160;to&#160;generate&#160;free&#160;charges. The stronger coupling between the organic and inorganic layers and the minor exciton binding energy can promote the DJ phase to possess a more stable structure and better optoelectronic properties. Thus&#160;the (4AEPy)PbI4 device displays better light response and X&#8208;ray detection capability with a high sensitivity of 5627 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and the lowest detectable dose rate of 20 nGyair s&#8208;1.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Fabrication of Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile fabrication of ultrathin NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large area (&gt;200 cm2) with remarkable homogeneity and texture along [00l] direction is presented. This stems from the superior solution processability of the NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets synthesized via a scalable approach. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes exhibit outstanding rejections toward various metal ion and dye solutions while at modest permeance compared with other reported membranes.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes, featuring potential molecular sieving effects and therefore capable of surmounting the ubiquitous trade&#8208;off between membrane selectivity and permeability, hold great promise for multitudinous chemical separations. Nevertheless, it remains highly challenging for the large&#8208;area fabrication of ultrathin MOF membranes with variable thickness, great homogeneity, and preferential orientation. Herein, this work reports the facile fabrication of ultrathin (down to 20&#160;nm) NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large&#8208;area (&gt;200 cm2) yet with great homogeneity and texture along (00l) direction due to the superior solution processability of the as&#8208;synthesized NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes with good adhesion properties and certain flexibility exhibit excellent rejections (&gt;98% for Mg2+ and Al3+, and dyes with molecular weights larger than 585.5 g mol&#8722;1) toward aqueous separation of various metal ions and dyes at modest permeance (1&#8211;3.2 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) due to the well&#8208;aligned structures. Such separation performance outstands among polymetric membranes, thin&#8208;film composite membranes, mixed matrix membranes, and other MOF membranes reported in the literature. The separation mechanism is reasonably discussed based on the experimental and theoretical results. This study opens up novel perspectives for preparing ultrathin and large&#8208;area MOF membranes using the solution processability of MOFs.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Spacing Engineering of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new A&#8208;site cation aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing of A3Bi2I9&#8208;type HPs by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds and large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) are prepared. The interlayer spacing shortened AG3Bi2I9 SC shows a large mobility&#8208;lifetime product, high sensitivity and low detection limit in X&#8208;ray detection, high spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free A3Bi2I9&#8208;type perovskites are demonstrated as a class of promising semiconductors for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection due to their high bulk resistivity and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, as well as reduced ion migration. However, due to their long interlamellar distance along their c&#8208;axis, their limited carrier transport along the vertical direction is a bottleneck for their detection sensitivity. Herein, a new A&#8208;site cation of aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds. The prepared large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 7.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1, which is three times higher than the value measured on the best MA3Bi2I9 SC (2.87 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1). Therefore, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on the AG3Bi2I9 SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC&#160;Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.6&#160;nGy s&#8722;1, and a short response time of 690&#160;&#181;s, all of which are far better than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MA3Bi2I9 SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free X&#8208;ray detectors.

&lt;p&gt;A new A-site cation aminoguanidinium (AG) with all-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing of A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;-type HPs by forming more and stronger N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds and large AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals (SCs) are prepared. The interlayer spacing shortened AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC shows a large mobility-lifetime product, high sensitivity and low detection limit in X-ray detection, high spatial resolution in X-ray imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead-free A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;-type perovskites are demonstrated as a class of promising semiconductors for high-performance X-ray detection due to their high bulk resistivity and strong X-ray absorption, as well as reduced ion migration. However, due to their long interlamellar distance along their &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis, their limited carrier transport along the vertical direction is a bottleneck for their detection sensitivity. Herein, a new A-site cation of aminoguanidinium (AG) with all-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing by forming more and stronger N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds. The prepared large AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility-lifetime product of 7.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is three times higher than the value measured on the best MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC (2.87 &#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Therefore, the X-ray detectors fabricated on the AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC&#160;Gy&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a low detection limit of 2.6&#160;nGy s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1,&lt;/sup&gt; and a short response time of 690&#160;&#181;s, all of which are far better than those of the state-of-the-art MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) X-ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low-cost and high-performance lead-free X-ray detectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiexciton Generation from a 2D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite with Nearly 200% Quantum Yield of Red Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiexciton generation (MEG) is found in a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite, phenylammonium cadmium chloride (PACC). The MEG effect induced by Mn2+ doping improves the red phosphorescent quantum yield of PACC from 6% to nearly 200%, thus resulting in a switching from blue to red afterglow.








Abstract
2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) show obvious advantages in the field of optoelectronics due to their high luminescent stability and good solution processability. However, the thermal quenching and self&#8208;absorption of excitons caused by the strong interaction between the inorganic metal ions lead to a low luminescence efficiency of 2D perovskites. Herein, a 2D Cd&#8208;based OIHP phenylammonium cadmium chloride&#160;(PACC) with a weak red phosphorescence (&#934;P&#160;&lt; 6%) at 620&#160;nm and a blue afterglow is reported. Interestingly, the Mn&#8208;doped PACC exhibits very strong red emission with nearly 200% quantum yield and 15&#160;ms lifetime, thus resulting in a red afterglow. The experimental data prove that the doping of Mn2+ not only induces the multiexciton generation (MEG) process of the perovskite, avoiding the energy loss of inorganic excitons, but also promotes the Dexter energy transfer from organic triplet excitons to inorganic excitons, thus realizing the superefficient red&#8208;light emission of Cd2+. This work suggests that guest metal ions can induce host metal ions to realize MEG in 2D bulk OIHPs, which provides a new idea for the development of optoelectronic materials and devices with ultrahigh energy utilization.

         <title>Full Control of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Electrostatic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled operation of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating applications is demonstrated via the realization of high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor, free of the spurious effects caused by electrochemical reactions. The devices exhibit high geometrical capacitances 20&#8202;&#8211;&#8202;50&#8287;&#181;F&#8287;cm&#8722;2\[20--50\:\mu {\rm{F}}\:{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) enabling the accumulation of electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2, to gate&#8208;induced superconductivity, and to perform ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy.








Abstract
Ionic gating is a powerful technique to realize field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) enabling experiments not possible otherwise. So far, ionic gating has relied on the use of top electrolyte gates, which pose experimental constraints and make device fabrication complex. Promising results obtained recently in FETs based on solid&#8208;state electrolytes remain plagued by spurious phenomena of unknown origin, preventing proper transistor operation, and causing limited control and reproducibility. Here, a class of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating (Lithium&#8208;ion conducting glass&#8208;ceramics, LICGCs) is explored, the processes responsible for the spurious phenomena and irreproducible behavior are identified, and properly functioning transistors exhibiting high density ambipolar operation with gate capacitance of &#8776;20&#8202;&#8722;&#8202;50&#8201;&#181;F cm&#8722;2\[20{\bm{ - }}50\;\mu F c{m^{{\bm{ - }}2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) are demonstrated. Using 2D semiconducting transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides, the ability to implement ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy to determine the semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2 are demostrated, resulting in gate&#8208;induced superconductivity in MoS2 multilayers. As LICGCs are implemented in a back&#8208;gate configuration, they leave the surface of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface&#8208;sensitive techniques (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so far in ionic&#8208;gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices providing independent control of charge density and electric&#160;field.

         <title>Controllable Oxidation of ZrS2 to Prepare High&#8208;&#954;, Single&#8208;Crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable preparation of ultrathin monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) single crystals (EOT&#8776;0.29 nm, EOT is equivalent oxide thickness) via thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. By using K3[Fe(CN)6] as seeding, the large&#8208;scale parent ZrS2 is easily grown. The grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19 and a breakdown voltage of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. Using m&#8208;ZrO2 as top gate dielectric, the MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) shows excellent device performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;&#954; materials that exhibit large permittivity and band gaps are needed as gate dielectrics to enhance capacitance and prevent leakage current in downsized technology nodes. Among these, monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) shows good potential because of its inertness and high&#8208;&#954; with respect to SiO2, but a method to produce ultrathin single crystal is lacking. Here, the controllable preparation of ultrathin m&#8208;ZrO2 single crystals via the in situ thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. As&#8208;grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents an equivalent oxide thickness of &#8776;0.29&#160;nm, a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19, and a breakdown voltage (EBD) of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) by using m&#8208;ZrO2 as a dielectric layer shows comparable mobility to that using SiO2 dielectric. The ultraclean interface of m&#8208;ZrO2/MoS2 and high crystalline quality of m&#8208;ZrO2 lead to negligible hysteresis in transfer curves. Single crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 dielectric shows potential application in digital complementary metal oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) logic FET.

         <title>Constructing a Uniform and Stable Mixed Conductive Layer to Stabilize the Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte/Li Interface by Cold Bonding at Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The great potential of the application of room&#8208;temperature in the situ cold bonding technique for the rational design and optimization of LLZ/Li interfaces with low cost, high safety and operability is highlighted. The prepared RT&#8208;MCL shows good interfacial compatibility and excellent electrochemical properties.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZ) electrolyte&#160;is a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries, while its applications are hindered by interfacial problems. Although the utilization of functional coatings and molten lithium (Li) effectively solves the LLZ interfacial compatibility problem with Li metal, it poses problems such as high cost, high danger, and structural damage. Herein, a mixed conductive layer (MCL) is introduced at the LLZ/Li interface (RT&#8208;MCL) via an in situ cold bonding process at room temperature. Such a stable and compact RT&#8208;MCL can effectively suppress side reactions and protect the crystal structure of LLZ, and it also inhibits growth of Li dendrites and promotes uniform Li deposition. The critical current density (CCD) of the Li symmetric cell composed of RT&#8208;MCL&#8208;LLZ is increased to 1.8&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and provides stable cycling performance over 2000 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, this in situ cold bonding treatment can significantly reduce cost and eliminate potential safety issues caused by the high&#8208;temperature processing of Li metal. This work highlights tremendous potential of this cold bonding technique in the reasonable design and optimization of the LLZ/Li interface.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Changeable Dynamic Conformal Electrode/electrolyte Interlayer enabling Pressure&#8208;Independent Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic conformal interlayer with the reversible phase&#8208;changeable feature is developed. This interlayer (P&#8208;P&#8208;I) comprises PCL polymer skeleton, PC cosolvent, and LiTFSI salt, exhibiting high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, strong adhesion bonding (250 N pulling&#8208;out resistance), and reversible phase&#8208;change property, disengaging Li&#8208;SSBs from pressure dependence and solving the issue of SSE/Li interfacial morphological degeneration.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries (Li&#8208;SSBs) are one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high energy densities. However, under insufficient pressure constraints (&lt;MPa&#8208;level), Li&#8208;SSBs usually exhibit poor electrochemical performances owing to the continuous interfacial degradation between the solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) and electrodes. Herein, a phase&#8208;changeable interlayer is developed to construct the self&#8208;adhesive and dynamic conformal electrode/SSE contact in Li&#8208;SSBs. The strong adhesive and cohesive strengths of the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer enable Li&#8208;SSBs to resist up to 250 N pulling force (=1.9&#160;MPa), affording Li&#8208;SSBs ideal interfacial integrality even without extra stack pressure. Remarkably, this interlayer exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the shortened steric solvation hindrance and optimized Li+ coordination structure. Furthermore, the changeable phase property of the interlayer endows Li&#8208;SSBs with a healable Li/SSE interface, accommodating the stress&#8211;strain evolution of the lithium metal and constructing the dynamic conformal interface. Consequently, the contact impedance of the modified solid symmetric cell exhibits a pressure&#8208;independent manner and does not increase over 700&#160;h (0.2&#160;MPa). The LiFePO4 pouch cell with the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer shows 85% capacity retention after 400 cycles at a low pressure of 0.1&#160;MPa.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Piezocatalysts Enabled By Interfacial Interaction of Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure (GMH) shows a record&#8208;high piezo&#8208;catalytic degradation rate and can totally degrade the organic dyes within 50 s. The fundamental interfacial phenomena and the charge transfer in GMH are carefully examined by theoretical and experimental methods. It opens a new door for creation of new piezo&#8208;catalysts and toward a deeper understanding of the mechanism of piezo&#8208;catalysis.








Abstract
The catalytic activity has been investigated in 2D materials, and the unique structural and electronic properties contribute to their success in conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Heterojunction&#8208;based piezocatalysis has attracted increasing attention due to the band&#8208;structure engineering and the enhanced charge carrier separation by prominent piezoelectric effect. However, the piezocatalytic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is still unknown, and the finite active sites, catalyst poisoning, and poor conductivity are challenges for developing good piezocatalysts. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure is rationally designed to tackle these challenges. The heterostructure shows a record&#8208;high piezocatalytic degradation rate of 1.40 &#215; 102 L mol&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is 7.86 times higher than MoS2 nanosheets. Piezoresponse force microscope measurements and density functional theory calculation reveal that the coupling between semiconductive and piezoelectric properties in the vdW heterojunction is vital to break the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge for keeping the piezoelectric potential. The dynamic charges generated by MoS2 and the fast charge transfer in rGO activate and maintain catalytically active sites for pollutant degradation with an ultra&#8208;fast rate and good stability. The working mechanism opens new avenues for developing efficient catalysts significant to wastewater treatments and other applications.

         <title>PIP2 Alteration Caused by Elastic Modulus and Tropism of Electrospun Scaffolds Facilitates Altered BMSCs Proliferation and Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high expression of PIP2 on the tropic fibers with low elastic modulus is the main reason for the increased potential of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The cells on random fibers or high elastic modulus aligned fibers&#160;were&#160;altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to be consistent with cells on low elastic modulus aligned fibers.








Abstract
Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, it is aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on aligned&#8208;random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels through a regulatory mechanism mediated by B&#8208;cell lymphoma 6 protein(BCL&#8208;6) and miRNA&#8208;126&#8208;5p(miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p). The results showed that phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate alterations are found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which has a regular and oriented structure, excellent cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton, and high differentiation potential. The same trend is actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells is altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers. This work demonstrates the reason for the difference of cells between the two kinds of fibers and on fibers with different elastic modulus. These findings provide more insights for understanding the gene&#8208;level regulation of cell growth in tissue engineering.

         <title>Unveiling the Morphological and Physical Mechanism of Burn&#8208;in Loss Alleviation by Ternary Matrix Toward Stable and Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>

In a high&#8208;efficiency ternary matrix platform for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the operational stability enhancement strategy is proposed with carefully studied underlying reasons, in terms of morphology and photo&#8208;physics. Based on the &#8220;canceling&#8208;out&#8221; phenomenon, further ternary OPV blend design can be nourished by considering this principle during material combination, which can be useful in boosting both PCE and stability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (All&#8208;PSCs) are considered the most promising candidate in achieving both efficient and stable organic photovoltaic devices, yet the field has rarely presented an in&#8208;depth understanding of corresponding device stability while efficiency is continuously boosted via the innovation of polymer acceptors. Herein, a ternary matrix is built for all&#8208;PSCs with optimized morphology, improved film ductility and importantly, boosted efficiency and better operational stability than its parental binary counterparts, as a platform to study the underlying mechanism. The target system PQM&#8208;Cl:PTQ10:PY&#8208;IT (0.8:0.2:1.2) exhibits an alleviated burn&#8208;in loss of morphology and efficiency under light soaking, which supports its promoted device lifetime. The comprehensive characterizations of fresh and light&#8208;soaked active layers lead to a clear illustration of opposite morphological and physical degradation direction of PQM&#8208;Cl and PTQ10, thus resulting in a delicate balance at the optimal ternary system. Specifically, the enlarging tendency of PQM&#8208;Cl and shrinking preference of PTQ10 in terms of phase separation leads to a stable morphology in their mixing phase; the hole transfer kinetics of PQM&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT host is stabilized by incorporating PTQ10. This work succeeds in reaching a deep insight into all&#8208;PSC's stability promotion by a rational ternary design, which booms the prospect of gaining high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Functional Ultrathin Separators Proactively Stabilizing Zinc Anodes for Zinc&#8208;Based Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators for zinc&#8208;based energy storage are reported. The separators are composed of a high&#8208;strength cellulose nanofiber substrate and a zincophilic sites&#8208;rich decoration layer, in which the former one presents uniform nanoporous structure, ion&#8208;sieving ability, and ultrathin thickness and the latter one possesses high specific surface area and abundant zincophilic sites, and thus can proactively stabilize zinc anodes.








Abstract
Ultrathin separators are indispensable to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but their easy failure caused by zinc dendrites poses a great challenge. Herein, 23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators (FUSs), realizing superb electrochemical stability of zinc anodes and outstanding long&#8208;term durability of ultrathin separators, are reported. In the FUSs, an ultrathin but mechanically strong nanoporous membrane substrate benefits fast and flux&#8208;homogenized Zn2+ transport, while a metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposite decoration layer provides rich low&#8208;barrier zinc nucleation sites, thereby synergistically stabilizing zinc anodes to inhibit zinc dendrites and dendrite&#8208;caused separator failure. Investigation of the zinc affinity of the MOF&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposites unravels the high zincophilicity of heteroatom&#8208;containing C/Cu interfaces. Zinc anodes coupled with the FUSs present superior electrochemical stability, whose operation lifetime exceeds 2000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 600&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 40&#8211;50 times longer than that of the zinc anodes using glass&#8208;fiber separators. The reliability of the FUSs in ZIBs and zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors is also validated. This work proposes a new strategy to stabilize zinc anodes and provides theoretical guidance in developing ultrathin separators for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;based energy storage.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstitution Between Copper Single Atoms and Clusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate emerges to meet comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. Herein, the urea synthesis catalyzed by Cu1&#8211;CeO2 is reported. The dynamic reversible reconstitution of the catalyst configuration is monitored using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra and the Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Transform of clusters back to single&#8208;atom configurations occurs when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate has emerged to meet the comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. However, the identification of catalytic active sites and the design of efficient electrocatalysts remain a challenge. Herein, the synthesis of urea catalyzed by copper single atoms decorated on a CeO2 support (denoted as Cu1&#8211;CeO2) is reported. The catalyst exhibits an average urea yield rate of 52.84&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.6&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra demonstrate the reconstitution of copper single atoms (Cu1) to clusters (Cu4) during electrolysis. These electrochemically reconstituted Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Favorable C&#63743;N coupling reactions and urea formation on Cu4 are validated using operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Dynamic and reversible transformations of clusters to single&#8208;atom configurations occur when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Photothermal&#8208;Therapy&#8208;Assisted Immunomodulation via Multiresponsive Adjuvant Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;enzyme&#8208;near&#8208;infrared multi&#8208;responsive immune&#8208;adjuvant nanoparticle is fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy and photothermal&#8208;assisted manipulation of immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells for effective treatment of malignant tumor, which significantly inhibits the primary tumor and its metastasis, resulting in the dramatic enhancement of survival rate of lung metastatic tumor&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Multiresponsive adjuvant nanoparticles (RMmAGL) are fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy while regulating the behavior of tumor&#8208;associated immune cells for primary tumor eradication and metastasis inhibition. Core&#8211;satellite&#8208;like RMmAGL have a core of mannose&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (R837@MSN&#8208;mannose) connected via hydrazone bonds to satellites of glutamine (Glu)&#8208; and lysine (Lys)&#8208;comodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys). During therapy, the acidic environment in tumor tissue cleaves the hydrazone bonds to release AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys, which further accumulate in tumor cells. After internalization, photothermal agents (aggregated AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys) are generated in situ through the intratumoral enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction between Glu and Lys, resulting in tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy. The detachment of AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys also triggers the release of R837, which matured dendritic cells (DCs) via a vaccine&#8208;like mechanism along with the tumor&#8208;associated antigens generated by photothermal therapy. These matured DCs further activates surrounding T cells for immunotherapy. Moreover, the resulting free MSN&#8208;mannose serves as an artificial glycocalyx to continuously induce the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages from an immunosuppressive phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, thus further enhancing immunotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate significant inhibition of malignant tumors after therapy.

         <title>Intrinsic Dipole Arrangement to Coordinate Energy Levels for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered arrangement of methylamine dipoles is induced by the polar molecule to form a top&#8208;down macroscopic polarization of the film. Reorientation of dipoles contributes to forming a gradient energy band and changes the surrounding dielectric environment, facilitating efficient separation and directional transport of carriers. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells are significantly improved.








Abstract
Despite great progress in perovskite photovoltaics, it should be noted that the intrinsic disorder dipolar cations in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites exert negative effects on the energy band structure as well as the carrier separation and transfer dynamics. However, oriented polarization achieved by applying an external electric field may cause irreversible damage to perovskites. Herein, a unique and efficient strategy is developed to modulate the intrinsic dipole arrangement in perovskite films for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The spontaneous reorientation of dipolar cation methylamine is triggered by a polar molecule, constructing a vertical polarization during crystallization regulation. The oriented dipole determines a gradient energy&#8208;level arrangement in PSCs and more favorable energetics at interfaces, effectively enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and suppressing the nonradiative recombination. Besides, the dipole reorientation induces a local dielectric environment to remarkably reduce exciton binding energy, leading to an ultralong carrier diffusion length of up to 1708&#160;nm. Accordingly, the n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs achieve a significant increase in power conversion efficiency, reaching 24.63% with negligible hysteresis and exhibiting outstanding stabilities. This strategy also provides a facile route to eliminate the mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics for other novel photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Heteroanionic Zinc Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic compound (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx, ZOF) with an aliovalent F&#8208;doped wurtzite motif shows selective Zn2+ conductivity to regulate zinc migration and deposition. ZOF@Zn anode exhibits a low overpotential of 13.3&#160;mV at 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 in symmetric cells, and high stability of 169.7&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 in MnO2//Zn full batteries for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Although zinc&#8208;based batteries are promising candidates for eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices, their performance is severely retarded by dendrite formation. As the simplest zinc compounds, zinc chalcogenides, and halides are individually applied as a Zn protection layer due to high zinc ion conductivity. However, the mixed&#8208;anion compounds are not studied, which constrains the Zn2+ diffusion in single&#8208;anion lattices to their own limits. A heteroanionic zinc ion conductor (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx) coating layer is designed by in situ growth method with tunable F content and thickness. Strengthened by F aliovalent doping, the Zn2+ conductivity is enhanced within the wurtzite motif for rapid lattice Zn migration. ZnyO1&#8722;xFx also affords zincophilic sites for oriented superficial Zn plating to suppress dendrite growth. Therefore, ZnyO1&#8722;xFx&#8208;coated anode exhibits a low overpotential of 20.4&#160;mV for 1000&#160;h cycle life at a plating capacity of 1.0&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2 during symmetrical cell test. The MnO2//Zn full battery further proves high stability of 169.7 mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 for 1000 cycles. This work may enlighten the mixed&#8208;anion tuning for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Chelated Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy toward BiOCl Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanosheets for Boosting Photocatalytic Selective Aromatic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) with ultra&#8208;thin structure by chelating interaction of Bi3+ ions and acetate ions, and ion exchange between Cl&#8722; ions and acetate ions. The prepared BiOCl MSCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity stability and general adaptability for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.








Abstract
The photoresponse and photocatalytic efficiency of bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) are greatly limited by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. The construction of porous single&#8208;crystal BiOCl photocatalyst can effectively alleviate this issue and provide accessible active sites. Herein, a facile chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) using acetic acid and ammonia solution respectively as chelating agent and ionization promoter. The strong chelation between acetate ions and Bi3+ ions introduces acetate ions into the precipitated product to exchange with Cl&#8208; ions, resulting in large lattice mismatch, strain release, and formation of void&#8208;like mesopores. The prepared BiOCl MSCN photocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with 99% conversion and 98% selectivity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and superior general adaptability for various aromatic alcohols. The theoretical calculations and characterizations confirm that the superior performance is mainly attributed to the abundant oxygen vacancies, plenty of accessible adsorption/active sites and fast charge transport path without grain boundaries.

         <title>Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Piezodynamic Cancer Therapy Synergized with Energy Metabolism&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>

Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 nanosheets are developed for efficient cancer treatment via ultrasound&#8208;triggered piezodynamic cancer therapy. 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondrial&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium to significantly enhance their anticancer efficacy via mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic therapy. FX11, a potent glycolysis inhibitor that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism, is loaded into WS2 nanosheets to synergistically potentiate the piezodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Piezoelectric nanomaterials that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by piezoelectric polarization under an external mechanical force have emerged as an effective platform for cancer therapy. In this study, piezoelectric 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondria&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic cancer therapy. In addition, a glycolysis inhibitor (FX11) that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism is loaded into TPP&#8208; and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated WS2 nanosheet (TPEG&#8208;WS2) to potentiate its therapeutic efficacy. Upon US irradiation, the sono&#8208;excited electrons and holes generated in the WS2 are efficiently separated by piezoelectric polarization, which subsequently promotes the production of ROS. FX11&#8208;loaded&#160;TPEG&#8208;WS2 (FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2)&#160;selectively accumulates in the mitochondria of human breast cancer cells. In addition, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively inhibits the&#160;production of adenosine triphosphate . Thus, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 exhibits outstanding anticancer effects under US irradiation. An in vivo study using tumor&#8208;xenograft mice demonstrates that FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively accumulated in the tumors. Its&#160;tumor accumulation is visualized using in vivo computed tomography . Notably, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 with US irradiation remarkably suppresses the tumor growth of mice without systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates that the combination of piezodynamic therapy and energy metabolism&#8208;targeted chemotherapy using mitochondria&#8208;targeting 2D WS2 is a novel strategy for the selective and effective treatment of tumors.

         <title>Perovskite Grain&#8208;Boundary Manipulation Using Room&#8208;Temperature Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing &#8220;Ligaments&#8221; for Developing Highly Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.8% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain&#8208;boundary &#8220;ligaments&#8221; are developed to endow fragile perovskite grain boundaries with toughness, water resistance, and room temperature self&#8208;healing properties. Meanwhile, they can also passivate the defects and release the residual tensile strain in perovskite films. The resultant flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a record 23.84% power conversion efficiency and robust mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are the best candidates to complement traditional silicon SCs in portable power applications. However, their mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities are still unable to meet the practical demands because of the natural brittleness, residual tensile strain, and high defect density along the perovskite grain boundaries. To overcome these issues, a cross&#8208;linkable monomer TA&#8208;NI with dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, H&#8208;bonds, and ammonium is carefully developed. The cross&#8208;linking acts as &#8220;ligaments&#8221; attached on the perovskite grain boundaries. These &#8220;ligaments&#8221; consisting of elastomers and 1D perovskites can not only passivate the grain boundaries and enhance moisture resistance but also release the residual tensile strain and mechanical stress in 3D perovskite films. More importantly, the elastomer can repair bending&#8208;induced mechanical cracks in the perovskite film because of dynamic self&#8208;healing characteristics. The resultant flexible pero&#8208;SCs exhibit promising improvements in efficiency, and record values (23.84% and 21.66%) are obtained for 0.062&#160;and 1.004&#160;cm2&#160;devices; the flexible devices also show overall improved stabilities with T90&#160;&gt;20&#160;000&#160;bending cycles, operational stability with T90&#160;&gt;1248&#160;h, and ambient stability (relative humidity&#160;=&#160;30%) with T90&#160;&gt;3000&#160;h. This strategy paves a new way for the industrial&#8208;scale development of high&#8208;performance flexible pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Genetically Engineering Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated BTO Nanoparticles for MMP2&#8208;Activated Piezocatalysis&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane expressed &#945;PD&#8208;L1 with MMP2 responsive shielding domain is engineered to coat on BTO NPs, the resulting M@BTO NPs generate ROS and O2 to induce immunogenic cell death under ultrasound induced piezocatalysis, effectively switching &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumors to &#8220;immune&#8208;hot&#8221; tumors while achieving specific immune checkpoint blockade, providing a robust stimuli&#8208;responsive bioengineering system for augmenting tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) still suffers from low host response rate and non&#8208;specific distribution of immune checkpoint inhibitors, greatly compromising the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, cellular membrane stably expressing matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;activated PD&#8208;L1 blockades is engineered to coat ultrasmall barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticle for overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors. The resulting M@BTO NPs can significantly promote the BTO's tumor accumulation, while the masking domains on membrane PD&#8208;L1 antibodies are cleaved when exposure to MMP2 highly expressed in tumor. With ultrasound (US)&#160;irradiation, M@BTO NPs can simultaneously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2 based on BTO mediated piezocatalysis and water splitting, significantly promoting the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and improving the PD&#8208;L1 blockade therapy to the tumor, resulting in effective tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis suppression in a melanoma mouse model. This nanoplatform combines MMP2&#8208;activated genetic editing cell membrane with US responsive BTO for both immune stimulation and specific PD&#8208;L1 inhibition, providing a safe and robust strategy in enhancing immune response against tumor.

         <title>Durable and Adjustable Interfacial Engineering of Polymeric Electrolytes for Both Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes and High&#8208;Energy Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With surface in situ polymerization technology, solid polymeric ether&#8208;based electrolytes containing sulfonimide&#8208;based salts are designed as a high&#8208;performance cathode coating, enabling the durable compatibility with both Ni&#8208;rich LiNixCoyMnzO2 cathodes and metallic anodes, accompanying with anticorrosion of aluminum current collectors. This novel interface with high&#8208;voltage tolerance and adjustable components provides a new strategy toward long&#8208;term cyclability of high&#8208;voltage metal batteries.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries is crucial for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, the complicated interface problems in both cathode/anode electrodes preclude their practical applications hitherto. Herein, to simultaneously solve such interfacial limitations and obtain sufficient Li+ conductivity in the electrolyte, an ultrathin and adjustable interface is developed at the cathode side through a convenient surface in situ polymerization (SIP), achieving a durable high&#8208;voltage tolerance and Li&#8208;dendrite inhibition. The integrated interfacial engineering fabricates a homogeneous solid electrolyte with optimized interfacial interactions that contributes to tame the interfacial compatibility between LiNixCoyMnzO2 and polymeric electrolyte accompanied by anticorrosion of aluminum current collector. Further, the SIP enables a uniform adjustment of solid electrolyte composition by dissolving additives such as Na+ and K+ salts, which presents prominent cyclability in symmetric Li cells (&gt;300 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2). The assembled LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (4.3 V)||Li batteries show excellent cycle life with high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%). This SIP strategy is also investigated and verified in sodium metal batteries. It opens a new frontier for solid electrolytes toward high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;energy metal battery technologies.

         <title>A Nonswelling Hydrogel with Regenerable High Wet Tissue Adhesion for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonswelling hydrogels with regenerable high wet tissue adhesion are fabricated. Subsequently, neural microelectrode arrays and rapid&#8208;response strain sensors are integrated into the hydrogel to fabricate bifunctional tissue&#8208;interface bioelectronics. Additionally, these bioelectronics possess excellent electrical properties. Electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyography (EMG), and tissue movement information are accurately recorded by the bioelectronics, and tissue fatigue is successfully monitored.








Abstract
Reducing the swelling of tissue&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for maintaining stable tissue adhesion and inhibiting tissue inflammation. However, reported strategies for reducing swelling always result in a simultaneous decrease in the tissue adhesive strength of the hydrogel. Furthermore, once the covalent bonds break in the currently reported hydrogels, they cannot be rebuilt, and the hydrogel loses its tissue adhesive ability. In this work, a nonswelling hydrogel (named as &#8220;PAACP&#8221;) possessing regenerable high tissue adhesion is synthesized by copolymerizing and crosslinking poly(vinyl butyral) with acrylic acid, gelatin, and chitosan&#8208;grafted N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine. The tissue adhesive strength of the obtained PAACP reaches 211.4&#160;kPa, which is approximately ten times higher than that of the reported nonswelling hydrogels, and the hydrogel can be reused for multiple cycles. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel shows great potential in soft bioelectronics, as muscle fatigue is successfully monitored via the electrode array and strain sensor integrated on PAACP substrates. The success of these bioelectronics offers potential applicability in the long&#8208;term diagnosis of muscle&#8208;related health conditions and prosthetic manipulations.

         <title>13% Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells based on Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers with Pendent Y&#8208;Series Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regular and random double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent Y&#8208;series acceptors are designed and synthesized, in which the random copolymer provides a high efficiency of 13.02% compared to the regular polymer with an efficiency of 2.75% in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.








Abstract
Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent electron acceptors, including fullerene, rylene diimides, and nonfused acceptors, have been developed for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with efficiencies approaching 10%. In this work, Y&#8208;series electron acceptors have been firstly incorporated into double&#8208;cable polymers in order to further improve the efficiencies of SCOSCs. A highly crystalline Y&#8208;series acceptor based on quinoxaline core and the random copolymerized strategy are used to optimize the ambipolar charge transport&#160;and the nanophase separation of the double&#8208;cable polymers. As a result, an efficiency of 13.02% is obtained in the random double&#8208;cable polymer, representing the highest performance in SCOSCs, while the regular double&#8208;cable polymer only provides a low efficiency of 2.75%. The significantly enhanced efficiencies are attributed to higher charge carrier mobilities, better ordering conjugated backbones and Y&#8208;series acceptors in random double&#8208;cable polymers.

Soft Robotics
Wormlike robots can navigate through uneven terrain and constricted spaces, but it has proved difficult to completely avoid rigid components, limiting the compliance of such machines. In article 2210409, Hillel J. Chiel, Roger D. Quinn, Christoph Weder, Kathryn A. Daltorio, and co&#8208;workers report an earthworm&#8208;inspired robot that is based on soft polymer actuators. The robot moves through peristaltic locomotion and can wiggle itself through small openings.

Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production
In article number 2207765, Megalamane Siddaramappa Bootharaju, Jong Suk Yoo, Nanfeng Zheng, Taeghwan Hyeon, and co&#8208;workers show how gold doping selectively at the core of a 44&#8208;atom silver nanocluster can modulate the electronic structure and enhance the stability of the resulting gold&#8211;silver core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;nanostructure through synergistic effects. Increased interfacial charge transfer due to a favorably modified band alignment makes the core&#8211;shell nanocluster a promising cocatalyst for hydrogen generation from solar water splitting.

Artificial Fingertips
Human fingertips with intricate structures and delicate perspiration system help people in gripping, climbing, or even more complex activities. In article number 2209729, Dirk J. Broer, Danqing Liu, and co&#8208;workers report the design of a coating made of cholesteric liquid crystal networks to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible, as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the surface tribological property. The performance of this material shows its potential to be applied for robotic devices.

         <title>Probing the Mechanically Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase and the Implications in Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. This review summarizes the desirable mechanical properties of SEI, mechanical characterization methods, and previous optimization attempts. Inconsistencies in these efforts are clarified and the causes are explored. A research protocol is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.








Abstract
The inevitable volume expansion of secondary battery anodes during cycling imposes forces on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The battery performance is closely related to the capability of SEI to maintain intact under the cyclic loading conditions, which basically boils down to the mechanical properties of SEI. The volatile and complex nature of SEI as well as its nanoscale thickness and environmental sensitivity make the interpretation of its mechanical behavior many roadblocks. Widely varied approaches are adopted to investigate the mechanical properties of SEI, and diverse opinions are generated. The lack of consensus at both technical and theoretical levels has hindered the development of effective design strategies to maximize the mechanical stability of SEIs. Here, the essential and desirable mechanical properties of SEI, the available mechanical characterization methods, and important issues meriting attention for higher test accuracy are outlined. Previous attempts to optimize battery performance by tuning SEI mechanical properties are also scrutinized, inconsistencies in these efforts are elucidated, and the underlying causes are explored. Finally, a set of research protocols is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Robotics with Tailored Wettability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising tools in a variety of biomedical, sensing, and decontamination applications. The review encompasses the basic understanding, theory, and up&#8208;to&#8208;date developments related to SSRs with tailored wettabilities, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter&#8208;, micrometer&#8208;, and nanometer&#8208;scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand&#8208;new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications. With continued innovation, rational surface engineering is expected to endow SSRs with exceptional mobility and functionality, which can broaden their applications, enhance their penetration depth, reduce surface fouling, and inhibit bacterial adhesion.

         <title>Gate Dielectrics Integration for 2D Electronics: Challenges, Advances, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development of dielectrics for high&#8208;performance 2D devices. Adapting integration protocols of conventional high&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and emerging dielectrics with inert surface can significantly improve the dielectric film and interface quality. The advancement of novel dielectrics boosts overall performance of 2D devices and paves way toward next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have emerged both as an ideal platform for fundamental studies and as promising channel materials in beyond&#8208;silicon field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors due to their outstanding electrical properties and exceptional tunability via external field.

         <title>Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on 2D Materials and Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
A review of hardware security solutions using novel electronics, optical, and material properties of 2D materials and their corresponding heterostructure device configurations for Internet of Things platforms. The five quintessential security domains for discussion are physically unclonable functions, true random number generators, logic locking, hardware watermarking and anticounterfeiting, and hardware camouflaging.








Abstract
Hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem that accounts for billions of dollars in annual losses. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology offers security solutions, these are largely inadequate, inefficient, and often inconclusive, as well as resource intensive in time, energy, and cost, leading to tremendous room for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon&#8208;based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In recent years, 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generation, watermarking, anticounterfeiting, physically unclonable functions, and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) are summarized with accompanying discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives is also examined. Finally, the existing challenges for 2D materials, which must be overcome for large&#8208;scale deployment of 2D ICs to meet the security needs of the semiconductor industry, are discussed.

         <title>Excimer&#8208;Mediated Ultrafast Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay Enables Giant Photothermal Performance for Optimized Phototheranostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing organic photothermal materials (OPMs) with high photothermal performance for phototheranostic mainly focus on the manipulation of intramolecular nonradiative (intraNR) decay, which often requires quite complicated and time&#8208;consuming molecular engineering. In addition to intraNR decay, intermolecular nonradiative (interNR) decay is equally important and more convenient in governing photothermal performance. However, controlling interNR decay remains challenging due to the limited understanding of their origin and dynamics. Here, systemic investigation of intraNR and interNR decay directs the first demonstration of simple manipulation of interNR decay to produce a giant photothermal performance for optimized phototheranostic. Among three designed polymers with varying fluorine substitution, structure&#8208;performance studies reveal a dimer&#8208;initiated interNR decay to improve photothermal performance. Dimer is formed by intermolecular C&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H hydrogen bond. This finding inspires a simple aggregation control strategy to form excited dimer, namely excimer. It initiates an approximately 100&#8208;fold enhancement in interNR decay rate over conventional intraNR decay to produce ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency of 81% for efficient photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in vivo. This study provides insights into interNR decay in achieving a giant photothermal effect and paves a convenient way to develop high&#8208;performance OPMs.

         <title>Unveiling Strong Ion&#8211;Electron&#8211;Lattice Coupling and Electronic Antidoping in Hydrogenated Perovskite Nickelate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;ion intercalation at the atomic scale and the energy band structure in perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 are demonstrated by combining experimental results and theoretical calculations.&#160;The results show extremely enhanced NiO6 octahedra tilting/rotation and giant lattice expansion. Moreover, the electronic antidoping mechansim is found to dominate the metal&#8211;insulator transtion, contrary to the previously proposed redox reaction mechanism from Ni3+ to Ni2+.








Abstract
Despite being highly promising for applications in emergent electronic devices, decoding both the ion&#8211;electron&#8211;lattice coupling in correlated materials at the atomic scale and the electronic band structure remains a big challenge due to the strong and complex correlation among these degrees of freedom. Here, taking an epitaxial thin film of perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 as a model system, hydrogen&#8208;ion&#8208;induced giant lattice distortion and enhanced NiO6 octahedra tilting/rotation are demonstrated, which leads to a new robust hydrogenated HNdNiO3 phase with lattice expansion larger than 10% on a series of substrates. Moreover, under the effect of ion&#8211;electron synergistic doping, it is found that the proposed electronic antidoping, i.e., the doped electrons mainly fill the ground&#8208;state oxygen 2p holes instead of changing the Ni oxidation state from Ni3+ to Ni2+, dominates the metal&#8211;insulator transition. Meanwhile, lattice modification with enhanced Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond tilting or rotation mainly modifies the orbital density of states near the Fermi level. Last, by electric&#8208;field&#8208;controlled hydrogen&#8208;ion intercalation and its strong coupling to the lattice and electron charge, selective micrometer&#8208;scale patterns with distinct structural and electronic states are fabricated. The results provide direct evidence for a strong ion&#8211;electron&#8211;lattice coupling in correlated physics and exhibit its potential applications in designing novel materials and devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Copper Complex Enables Homogeneous Catalysis for High&#8208;Loading Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective catalysis based on metal complexes is proposed for optimizing liquid&#8208;involving reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Through size screening of the ligand, the CuL can selectively accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step of Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S on the premise of the catalytic efficiency of each step, thereby achieving long cycle lifespan under high sulfur loading and high current density.








Abstract
The practical viability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stipulates the use of a high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte. However, under such harsh conditions, the liquid&#8211;solid sulfur redox reaction is much retarded due to the poor sulfur and polysulfides utilization, leading to low capacity and fast fading. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled macrocyclic Cu(II) complex (CuL) is designed as an effective catalyst to homogenize and maximize the liquid&#8208;involving reaction. The Cu(II) ion coordinated with four N atoms features a planar dsp2${\mathrm{d}}_{{\mathrm{sp}}^{2}}$ hybridization, showing a strong bonding affinity toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) along the dz2${\mathrm{d}}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital via steric effects. Such a structure not only lowers the energy barrier of the liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2S4 to Li2S2) but also guides a 3D deposition of Li2S2/Li2S. As such, with a 1&#160;wt% electrolyte additive of CuL, a high initial capacity of 925&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and areal capacity of 9.62&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a low decay of 0.3%/cycle can be achieved under a high sulfur loading of 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L&#160;mgs&#8722;1. This work is expected to inspire the design of homogenous catalysts and accelerate the uptake of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Molecular Locking with All&#8208;Organic Surface Modifiers Enables Stable and Efficient Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated Methyl&#8208;Ammonium&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Modules</title>

A hydrophobic all&#8208;organic salt is reported to modify the top surface of large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free halide perovskite layers to achieve an active area efficiency of 19.28% (58.5&#160;cm2) with the retention of &#8776;80% efficiency after 7500&#160;h (313 days).








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is now over 19%, but issues with their stability persist owing to significant intrinsic point defects and a mass of surface imperfections introduced during the fabrication process. Herein, the utilization of a hydrophobic all&#8208;organic salt is reported to modify the top surface of large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free halide perovskite layers. Bearing two molecules, each of which is endowed with anchoring groups capable of exhibiting secondary interactions with the perovskite surfaces, the organic salt acts as a molecular lock by effectively binding to both anion and cation vacancies, substantially enhancing the materials&#8217; intrinsic stability against different stimuli. It not only reduces the ingression of external species such as oxygen and moisture, but also suppresses the egress of volatile organic components during the thermal stability testing. The treated PSCs demonstrate efficiency of 19.28% (active area of 58.5&#160;cm2) and 17.62% (aperture area of 64&#160;cm2) for the corresponding mini&#8208;module. More importantly, unencapsulated slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated mini&#8208;modules incorporating the all&#8208;organic surface modifier show &#8776;80% efficiency retention after 7500&#160;h (313 days) of storage under 30% relative humidity (RH). They also remarkably retain more than 90% of the initial efficiency for over 850&#160;h while being measured continuously.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Phase Recycling of Metals from Li&#8208;Ion Batteries in Rotating, Concentric&#8208;Liquid Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal mixtures from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are rapidly and selectively separated one&#8208;pot in a rotating, concentric&#8208;liquid reactor. In this reactor, vigorous stirring at interfacial regions does not cause mixing of the aqueous metal&#8208;feed and acceptor layers, while the organic extractants are allowed to shuttle between these layers multiple times.








Abstract
Efficient recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is essential for making their numerous applications sustainable. Hydrometallurgy&#8208;based separation methods are an indispensable part of the recycling process but remain limited by the extraction efficiency and selectivity, and typically require numerous binary liquid&#8211;liquid extraction steps in which the capacity of the extracting organic phase or partition coefficient of extracted metals become an overall bottleneck. Herein, rotating reactors are described, in which the aqueous feed, organic extractant, and aqueous acceptor phases are all present in the same rotating vessel and can be vigorously stirred and emulsified without the coalescence of aqueous layers. In this arrangement, the extractant molecules are not equilibrated with the feed and, instead, &#8220;shuttle&#8221; between the feed/extractant and the extractant/acceptor interfaces multiple times, with each such molecule ultimately transferring approximately ten metal ions. This shuttling allows for using extractant concentrations much lower than in previous designs even for extremely concentrated feeds and, simultaneously, ensures unprecedented speed and selectivity of the one&#8208;pot processes. These experimental results are accompanied by theoretical considerations of the selectivity versus speed trends as well as discussion of parameters essential for system upscaling.

         <title>Recruiting T&#8208;Cells toward the Brain for Enhanced Glioblastoma Immunotherapeutic Efficacy by Co&#8208;Delivery of Cytokines and Immune Checkpoint Antibodies with Macrophage&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Nanovesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanovesicles with a macrophage&#8208;mimicking membrane, co&#8208;delivering chemoattractant CXCL10 and immune checkpoint inhibitor aPD&#8208;L1 to orthotopic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are developed to pre&#8208;activate the immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy efficacy. This work provides a paradigm for GBM immunotherapy that enhances brain accumulation of aPD&#8208;L1 and avoids the negative impact of the immunosuppressive microenvironment of malignant tumors.








Abstract
Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) shows promising prospects for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) but with restricted results, mainly attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the limited antibody permeability of the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) in GBM. Here, nanovesicles with a&#160;macrophage&#8208;mimicking membrane are described, that co&#8208;deliver&#160;chemotactic CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), to pre&#8208;activate the immune microenvironment, and anti&#8208;programmed death ligand 1 antibody (aPD&#8208;L1), to interrupt the immune checkpoint, aiming to enhance the effect of GBM immunotherapy. Consequently, the tumor tropism of the macrophage membrane and the receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis of the angiopep&#8208;2 peptide allow&#160;the nanovesicle to effectively cross the BTB and target the GBM region, with 19.75&#8208;fold higher accumulation of antibodies compared to the free aPD&#8208;L1 group. The CPI therapeutic efficacy is greatly enhanced by CXCL10&#8208;induced T&#8208;cells recruitment with significant expansion of CD8+ T&#8208;cells and effector memory T&#8208;cells, leading to the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time, and long&#8208;term immune memory in orthotopic GBM mice. The nanovesicles, that relieve the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by CXCL10 to enhance aPD&#8208;L1 efficacy, may present a promising strategy for brain&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;templating synthesis method is presented with molten&#8208;salt protection to synthesize high&#8208;quality few&#8208;atoms&#8208;thin Mo2C nanosheets with a low concentration of defects. The fundamental electrochemical properties of the 2D Mo2C nanosheets show that the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Mo2C increases with decreasing thickness.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides (2D TMCs and MXenes) are promising candidates for applications of energy storage and catalysis. However, producing high&#8208;quality, large 2D flakes of Mo2C MXene has been challenging. Here, a new salt&#8208;assisted templating approach is reported that enables the direct synthesis of 2D Mo2C with low defect concentrations. KCl acts as a template to form an intermediate 2D product, facilitating Mo2C formation without coarsening upon melting. The thickness of the flakes produced can range from monolayer (0.36 nm) to 10 layers (4.55 nm), and the electrocatalytical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of 2D Mo2C is inversely proportional to its thickness. The monolayer Mo2C shows remarkable HER performance with a current density of &#8776;6800 mA cm&#8722;2 at 470 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and an ultrahigh turnover frequency of &#8776;17 500 s&#8722;1. This salt&#8208;assisted synthesis approach can also produce WC and V8C7 nanosheets, expanding the family of 2D carbides. The new pathway eliminates the need for layered ceramic precursors, making it a versatile approach to direct synthesis of MXene&#8208;like 2D carbides.

         <title>Skyrmion&#8208;Excited Spin Wave Fractal Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions exhibit unique, technologically relevant pseudo&#8208;particle behaviors which arise from their topological protection, including well&#8208;defined, three&#8208;dimensional dynamic modes that occur at microwave frequencies. During dynamic excitation, spin waves are ejected into the interstitial regions between skyrmions, creating&#160;the magnetic equivalent of a turbulent&#160;sea. However, since the spin waves in these systems have a well&#8208;defined length scale, and the skyrmions are on an ordered lattice, ordered structures from spin wave interference can precipitate from the chaos. This work uses small angle neutron scattering (SANS)&#160;to capture the dynamics in hybrid skyrmions and investigate the spin wave structure. Performing simultaneous ferromagnetic resonance and SANS, the diffraction pattern shows a large increase in low&#8208;angle&#160;scattering intensity which is present only in the resonance&#160;condition. This scattering pattern is best fit using a mass fractal model, which suggests the spin waves form a long&#8208;range fractal network. The fractal structure is constructed of fundamental units with a size that encodes the spin wave emissions and are constrained by the skyrmion lattice. These results offer critical insights into the nanoscale dynamics of skyrmions, identify a new dynamic spin wave fractal structure, and demonstrates SANS as a unique tool to probe high&#8208;speed dynamics.

         <title>Judicious Heteroatom Doping Produces High Performance Deep Blue/Near UV Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We present two multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters and show how further borylation of a deep blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, DIDOBNA&#8208;N, both blue shifts and narrows the emission producing a new near&#8208;UV MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N. DIDOBNA&#8208;N emits bright blue light (lPL = 444&#160;nm, FWHM = 64&#160;nm, FPL = 81%, td = 23 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The deep blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on this twisted MR&#8208;TADF compound shows a very high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 15.3% for a device with CIEy of 0.073. The fused planar MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N shows efficient and narrowband near UV emission (lPL = 402&#160;nm, FWHM = 19&#160;nm, FPL = 74.7%, td = 133 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The best OLED with MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N, doped in a co&#8208;host, shows the highest efficiency reported for a near UV OLED at 16.2%. With a CIEy coordinate of 0.049, this device also shows the bluest EL reported for a MR&#8208;TADF OLED to date.

         <title>Metallic Powder Promotes Nitridation Kinetics for Facile Synthesis of (oxy)nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing semiconductors (including metal nitrides, metal oxynitrides, and nitrogen&#8208;doped metal oxides) have been widely researched for their application in energy conversion and environmental purification because of their unique characteristics; however, their synthesis generally encounters significant challenges owing to sluggish nitridation kinetics. Herein, we have developed a metallic powder&#8208;assisted nitridation method that effectively promotes the kinetics of nitrogen insertion into oxide precursors and exhibits good generality. By employing metallic powders with low work functions as electronic modulators, a series of oxynitrides (i.e., LnTaON2 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd), Zr2ON2, and LaTiO2N) can be prepared at lower nitridation temperatures and shorter nitridation periods to obtain comparable or even lower defect concentrations compared to those of the conventional thermal nitridation method, leading to superior photocatalytic performance. Moreover, some novel nitrogen&#8208;doped oxides (i.e., SrTiO3&#8208;xNy and Y2Zr2O7&#8208;xNy) with visible&#8208;light responses can be exploited. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the nitridation kinetics are enhanced via the effective electron transfer from the metallic powder to the oxide precursors, reducing the activation energy of nitrogen insertion. The modified nitridation route developed herein is an alternative method for preparing (oxy)nitride&#8208;based materials for energy/environment&#8208;related heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Peroxynitrite Overproduction Disrupts Metabolic Homeostasis for Sensitizing Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor cells elicit metabolic reprogramming to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for escaping from immunosurveillance. Therefore, interrupting the metabolic adaption of tumor cells might be a promising strategy for TME immunomodulation, favoring immunotherapy. Herein, w e construct a tumor&#8208;specific ONOO&#8722; nanogenerator (APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO) that can selectively disrupt metabolic homeostasis in melanoma cells. Stimulated by melanoma&#8208;characteristic acid, glutathione, and tyrosinase, APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO could efficiently generate ONOO&#8722; through the in situ coupling of the produced O2&#8226;&#8722; and released NO. Metabolomics profiling reveals that the accumulated ONOO&#8722; induces great decrease of metabolites involved in the TCA cycle. Meanwhile, the aerobic glycolysis&#8208;produced lactate drops sharply both intracellularly and extracellularly under ONOO&#8722; stress. Mechanistically, ONOO&#8722; impairs the activity of glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase in glucose metabolism through S&#8208;nitrosylation. The metabolic alterations effectively reverse the immunosuppressive TME to evoke potent antitumor immune responses, including polarization of M2&#8208;like macrophages to M1 phenotype, reduction of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and restoration of CD8+ T cell infiltration. Combining APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO pretreatment with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 achieves a significant inhibition against both primary and metastatic melanomas without systemic toxicities. Collectively, w e develop a tumor&#8208;specific ONOO&#8722; overproduction approach and explore the possible mechanism of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;mediated TME immunomodulation, providing a new strategy for facilitating immunotherapy sensitivity.

Abstract
Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C materials have emerged as a promising alternative to platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, their low intrinsic activity and stability have been major impediments. Herein, we report a Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst with dense FeN4 sites on hierarchically porous carbons with highly curved surfaces (denoted as FeN4&#8208;hcC). The FeN4&#8208;hcC catalyst displayed exceptional ORR activity in acidic media, with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. When integrated into a membrane electrode assembly, the corresponding cathode displayed a high maximum peak power density of 0.592&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and demonstrated operating durability over 30000 voltage cycles under harsh H2/air conditions, outperforming previously reported Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the curved carbon support fine&#8208;tuned the local coordination environment, lowered the energies of the Fe d&#8208;band centers, and inhibited the adsorption of oxygenated species, which could enhance the ORR activity and stability. This work provides new insight into the carbon nanostructure&#8208;activity correlation for ORR catalysis. It also offers a new approach to designing advanced single&#8208;metal site catalysts for energy conversion applications.

&lt;p&gt;Fe-N-C materials have emerged as a promising alternative to platinum-group-metals for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, their low intrinsic activity and stability have been major impediments. Herein, we report a Fe-N-C electrocatalyst with dense FeN4 sites on hierarchically porous carbons with highly curved surfaces (denoted as FeN4-hcC). The FeN4-hcC catalyst displayed exceptional ORR activity in acidic media, with a high half-wave potential of 0.85&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. When integrated into a membrane electrode assembly, the corresponding cathode displayed a high maximum peak power density of 0.592&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and demonstrated operating durability over 30000 voltage cycles under harsh H2/air conditions, outperforming previously reported Fe-N-C electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the curved carbon support fine-tuned the local coordination environment, lowered the energies of the Fe d-band centers, and inhibited the adsorption of oxygenated species, which could enhance the ORR activity and stability.

         <title>Improving the Performance of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Organic Solar Cells via Introducing a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Dopant into the Upper Acceptor Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) solution&#8208;processed active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) is conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces and favorable charge&#8208;transport pathways. This technique also enables facile film morphology adjustment to enhance device performance by introducing a volatile additive or a third component to the D/A system. In this work, we add a wide&#8208;bandgap component poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) into the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration and improve charge transport. Such an n&#8208;type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK&#8208;doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases from 16.02% to 17.00% when 2.50 wt% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer for the PM6/BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;4F active layer and from 18.70% to 19.05% for the D18/L8&#8208;BO system when 0.50 wt% PVK is introduced. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so our results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs.

         <title>Direct Probing of Lattice&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Oxygen Release in LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3 without Electrochemical Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Since the recognition of a significant oxygen&#8208;redox contribution to enhancing the capacity of Li transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes, the oxygen release and subsequent structural variations together with capacity fading have been critical issues to achieve better electrochemical performance. As most previous reports dealt with the structural degradation of cathodes after electrochemical cycling, it has been fairly difficult to clarify how substantial the effect of lattice strain on the oxygen release would be while exclusively ruling out any electrochemical influences. By utilizing nanoindentation and mechanical surface polishing of single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, we scrutinize the local variations of both the atomic structure and oxygen content. Atomic&#8208;column&#8208;resolved imaging reveals that local Li&#8722;M (M = Co and Mn) disordering and further amorphization are induced by mechanical strain. Moreover, substantial oxygen deficiency in the regions with these structure changes is directly identified by spectroscopic analyses. Ab initio density functional theory calculations also demonstrate energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies under shear strain. Providing direct evidence of oxygen release as a consequence of lattice strain, the findings in this work suggest that efficient strain relaxation will be of great significance for longevity of the anion framework in layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Fabrication of 3D Oriented MOF Micropatterns with Anisotropic Fluorescent Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep X&#8208;ray lithography is used for the fabrication of 3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) micropatterns. MOF films with X&#8208;ray sensitivity are obtained by using a mixed&#8208;linker strategy; the orientation of MOF crystals is achieved via heteroepitaxial growth. Fluorescent guest molecules are immobilized and aligned within spatially controlled and oriented MOF crystals. Such MOF micropatterns show anisotropic optical responses suitable for photonic applications.








Abstract
Micropatterning crystalline materials with oriented pores is necessary for the fabrication of devices with anisotropic properties. Crystalline and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are ideal materials as their chemical and structural mutability enables precise tuning of functional properties for applications ranging from microelectronics to photonics. Herein, a patternable oriented MOF film is designed: by using a photomask under X&#8208;ray exposure, the MOF film decomposes in the irradiated areas, remaining intact in the unexposed regions. The MOF film acts simultaneously as a resist and as functional porous material. While the heteroepitaxial growth from aligned Cu(OH)2 nanobelts is used to deposit oriented MOF films, the sensitivity to radiation is achieved by integrating a brominated dicarboxylate ligand (Br2BDC) into a copper&#8208;based MOF Cu2L2DABCO (DABCO = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; L = BDC/Br2BDC). The lithographed samples act as diffraction gratings upon irradiation with a laser, thus confirming the quality of the extended MOF micropattern. Furthermore, the oriented MOF patterns are functionalized with fluorescent dyes. As a result, by rotating the polarization angle of the laser excitation, the alignment of the dye in the MOF is demonstrated. By controlling the functional response to light, this MOF patterning protocol can be used for the microfabrication of optical components for photonic devices.

         <title>A Unified Therapeutic&#8211;Prophylactic Tissue&#8208;Engineering Scaffold Demonstrated to Prevent Tumor Recurrence and Overcoming Infection toward Bone Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strength hydrogel doped with the photothermal material MoS2 and a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, gadolinium&#8208;complex, is reported. The ingenious design confers a tunable degradation rate of the hydrogel as well as satisfactory weakening of bacterial infection, inhibition of tumor activity, and inducing of in situ bone tissue regeneration in vivo.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma occurs in children and adolescents frequently and leads to a high fatality rate. Although surgical resection is the most common methods in clinic, patients always suffer from tumor metastasis and recurrence and it is difficult for them to self&#8208;repair large bone defects. Furthermore, the postoperative infection from bacteria triggers an inflammatory response and hinders the bone&#8208;repair process. This work demonstrates a gadolinium (Gd)&#8208;complex and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) co&#8208;doped N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA)/gelatin methacrylate (Gel&#8208;MA) multifunctional hydrogel (GMNG). The combination between NAGA and Gel&#8208;MA endows the GMNG with attractive mechanical properties and controllable degradation ability. The MoS2 improves the hydrogel system, which has excellent photothermal ability to kill tumor cells and inhibit bacterial infection both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the Gd&#8208;complex, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect can be used to monitor the position and degradation situation of the hydrogel. Notably, accompanied by the degradation of GMNG hydrogel, the gradually released Gd3+ from the hydrogel exhibits osteogenic property and could promote new bone formation efficiently in vivo. Therefore, this strategy supplies a method to prepare multifunctional bone&#8208;defect&#8208;repair materials and is expected to represent a significant guidance and reference to the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract
Effective photon management is critical to realize high power conversion efficiencies for thin crystalline Si (c&#8208;Si) solar cells. Standard few&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick bulk cells achieve light trapping with macroscopic surface textures covered by thin, continuous antireflection coatings. Such sizeable textures are challenging to implement on ultrathin cells. Here, we illustrate how nanoscale Mie&#8208;resonator&#8208;arrays with a bi&#8208;modal size distribution support multiple resonances that can work in concert to achieve simultaneous antireflection and light&#8208;trapping across the broad solar spectrum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of these light&#8208;trapping antireflection coatings (LARCs) on a 2.8&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick c&#8208;Si solar cell. The measured short&#8208;circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Manganese Atoms Stabilized on Ceria for Nitrous Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese atoms stabilized on ceria is the first highly active, selective, and stable material for ammonia oxidation to nitrous oxide. Atomic dispersion is achieved by simple impregnation and preserved over 70&#160;h on stream. Low&#8208;valent manganese species, complemented by the oxygen transfer ability of ceria, facilitate the supply of active oxygen species for the reaction, leading to the outstanding catalytic performance.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide, N2O, exhibits unique reactivity in oxidation catalysis, but the high manufacturing costs limit its prospective uses. Direct oxidation of ammonia, NH3, to N2O can ameliorate this issue but its implementation is thwarted by suboptimal catalyst selectivity and stability, and the lack of established structure&#8211;performance relationships. Systematic and controlled material nanostructuring offers an innovative approach for advancement in catalyst design. Herein low&#8208;valent manganese atoms stabilized on ceria, CeO2, are discovered as the first stable catalyst for NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two&#8208;fold higher productivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Detailed mechanistic, computational and kinetic studies reveal CeO2 as the mediator of oxygen supply, while undercoordinated manganese species activate O2 and facilitate N2O evolution via N&#63743;N bond formation between nitroxyl, HNO, intermediates. Synthesis via simple impregnation of a small metal quantity (1&#160;wt%) predominantly generates isolated manganese sites, while full atomic dispersion is achieved upon redispersion of sporadic oxide nanoparticles during reaction, as confirmed by advanced microscopic analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, manganese speciation is maintained, and no deactivation is observed over 70&#160;h on stream. CeO2&#8208;supported isolated transition metals emerge as a novel class of materials for N2O production, encouraging future studies to evaluate their potential in selective catalytic oxidations at large.

         <title>Programmably Controllable Delivery of Metastable Ferrous Ions for Multiscale Dynamic Imaging Guided Photothermal Primed Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmably controllable delivery system based on croconium dye (Croc)&#8211;ferrous ion (Fe2+) nanoprobes (CFNPs) is developed for multiscale dynamic imaging guided photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy. The complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe2+ is sketched in a programmably controllable manner, and the domino effect of the tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and chemodynamic therapy is revealed.








Abstract
Metallomodulation cell death strategies are extensively investigated for antitumor therapy, such as cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Undoubtedly, the accurate and specific elevation of metal ions levels in cancer cells is key to boosting their&#160;therapeutic index. Herein, a programmably controllable delivery system based on croconium dye (Croc)&#8211;ferrous ion (Fe2+) nanoprobes (CFNPs) is developed for multiscale dynamic imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The Croc, with kinds of electron&#8208;rich iron&#8208;chelating groups, can form the Croc&#8211;Fe2+ complex with a precise stoichiometry of 1:1 to steadily maintain the valence state of Fe2+. The CFNPs can achieve pH&#8208;responsive visualization and accurate Fe2+ release in cancerous tissues under the coactivation of &#8220;dual&#8208;key&#8221; stimulation of &#8220;acidity and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8221;. The acidic tumor microenvironment actuates NIR fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and photothermal properties of CFNPs. Sequentially, under exogenous NIR light, the CFNPs enable in vivo accurate visualization of Croc&#8211;Fe2+ complex delivery for photothermal primed Fe2+ release, thus achieving CDT of tumors. By leveraging multiscale dynamic imaging technologies, the complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe2+ is sketched in a programmably controllable manner, and the domino effect of tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and CDT is also revealed, endowing customized feedback of the therapeutic panorama within the disease microenvironment.

         <title>Highly Efficient Inherent Linearly Polarized Electroluminescence from Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient inherent linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diode (LP&#8208;LED) is constructed based on 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) single crystals (SCs) with an in&#8208;plane anisotropic property. The LP&#8208;LED exhibits excellent device performance with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.38% and degree of polarization (DOP) up to 0.74. Further, an interchip polarized optical communication system is demonstrated based on the LP&#8208;LED.








Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule organic single crystals (SCs) with an inherent in&#8208;plane anisotropic nature enable direct linearly polarized light emission without the need for spatially separated polarizers and complex optical structures. However, the device performance is severely restricted by the starvation of appropriate SC emitters and the difficulty in the construction of efficient SC electroluminescence (EL) devices, leading to a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) of usually smaller than 1.5%. Here, highly efficient inherent linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (LP&#8208;LEDs) are demonstrated by exploiting 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) SCs as intrinsically polarized emitters. The LP&#8208;LEDs exhibit a 2.5&#8208;fold enhanced maximum EQE of 3.38%, which approaches the theoretical limit for the DPA SC&#8208;based EL device and is the highest among organic SC&#8208;based LEDs reported thus far. More importantly, a high degree of polarization (DOP) up to 0.74 is achieved for the intrinsically polarized EL emission of the DPA SC&#8208;based LP&#8208;LEDs. By leveraging the highly efficient LP&#8208;LED, an interchip polarized optical communication system consisting of organic SCs is demonstrated for the first time. This work creates a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast new library of small&#8208;molecule organic SCs for LP&#8208;LEDs and carries broad implications for polarized optics and relevant optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Induced, Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Switching and Adjustable Dielectric Tunability in Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during film deposition causes &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching (although the films retain the antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase). This is correlated with low&#8208;pressure bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes that pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase&#8208;transition boundaries. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of PbZrO3 can be adjusted.








Abstract
Antiferroelectrics, which undergo a field&#8208;induced phase transition to ferroelectric order that manifests as double&#8208;hysteresis polarization switching, exhibit great potential for dielectric, electromechanical, and electrothermal applications. Compared to their ferroelectric cousins, however, considerably fewer efforts have been made to understand and control antiferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated that the polarization switching behavior of an antiferroelectric can be strongly influenced and effectively regulated by point defects. In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during deposition (and thus increasing adatom kinetic energy) causes unexpected &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching although the films remain in the expected antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase. This &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; switching is correlated with the creation of bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes which pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase boundaries, and thus effectively delay the phase transition under changing field. The effective pinning energy is extracted via temperature&#8208;dependent switching&#8208;kinetics studies. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of the PbZrO3 can be adjusted, including being able to convert between &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability near zero field.

     alt="Defect-Induced, Ferroelectric-Like Switching and Adjustable Dielectric Tunability in Antiferroelectrics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, decreasing oxygen pressure during film deposition causes &#8220;ferroelectric-like&#8221; polarization switching (although the films retain the antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase). This is correlated with low-pressure bombardment-induced point-defect complexes that pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase-transition boundaries. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of PbZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be adjusted.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiferroelectrics, which undergo a field-induced phase transition to ferroelectric order that manifests as double-hysteresis polarization switching, exhibit great potential for dielectric, electromechanical, and electrothermal applications. Compared to their ferroelectric cousins, however, considerably fewer efforts have been made to understand and control antiferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated that the polarization switching behavior of an antiferroelectric can be strongly influenced and effectively regulated by point defects. In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, decreasing oxygen pressure during deposition (and thus increasing adatom kinetic energy) causes unexpected &#8220;ferroelectric-like&#8221; polarization switching although the films remain in the expected antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase. This &#8220;ferroelectric-like&#8221; switching is correlated with the creation of bombardment-induced point-defect complexes which pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase boundaries, and thus effectively delay the phase transition under changing field. The effective pinning energy is extracted via temperature-dependent switching-kinetics studies. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of the PbZrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be adjusted, including being able to convert between &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability near zero field. This work reveals the important role and strong capability of defects to engineer antiferroelectrics for new performance and functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Nanoscale Exciton Transport in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells Enables Reduced Bimolecular Recombination of Free Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed&#8208;photoluminescence quantum yield is used to evaluate the domain size of bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;based organic solar cells. It is found that efficient exciton dynamics are correlated with highly reduced bimolecular recombination.








Abstract
The highest&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV)&#8208;based solar cells, made from blends of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting organic semiconductors, are often characterized by strongly reduced (non&#8208;Langevin) bimolecular recombination. Although the origins of the reduced recombination are debated, mechanisms related to the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state and free&#8208;carrier encounter dynamics controlled by the size of donor and acceptor domains are proposed as underlying factors. Here,&#160;a novel photoluminescence&#8208;based probe is reported to accurately quantify the donor&#8211;acceptor domain size in OPV blends. Specifically, the domain size is measured in high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) systems and a comparative conventional fullerene system. It is found that the NFA&#8208;based blends form larger domains but that the expected reductions in bimolecular recombination attributed to the enhanced domain sizes are too small to account for the observed reduction factors. Further, it is shown that the reduction of bimolecular recombination is correlated to enhanced exciton dynamics within the NFA domains. This indicates that the processes responsible for efficient exciton transport also enable strongly non&#8208;Langevin recombination in high&#8208;efficiency NFA&#8208;based solar cells with low&#8208;energy offsets.

         <title>Molecular Chameleon Carriers for Nucleic Acid Delivery: The Sweet Spot between Lipoplexes and Polyplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double pH&#8208;responsive lipo amino fatty acid carriers consist of cationizable polar aminoethylene motifs and at least two cationizable apolar lipidic units, containing a central tertiary amine that disrupts the hydrophobic character once protonated. The carriers form stable lipopolyplexes and mediate efficient in vitro and in vivo nucleic acid transfer, benefitting from pH&#8208;dependent structural changes for dynamic cargo delivery and release.








Abstract
Taking advantage of effective intracellular delivery mechanisms of both cationizable lipids and polymers, highly potent double pH&#8208;responsive nucleic acid carriers are generated by combining at least two lipo amino fatty acids (LAFs) as hydrophobic cationizable motifs with hydrophilic cationizable aminoethylene units into novel sequence&#8208;defined molecules. The pH&#8208;dependent tunable polarity of the LAF is successfully implemented by inserting a central tertiary amine, which disrupts the hydrophobic character once protonated, resulting in pH&#8208;dependent structural and physical changes. This &#8220;molecular chameleon character&#8221; turns out to be advantageous for dynamic nucleic acid delivery via lipopolyplexes. By screening different topologies (blocks, bundles, T&#8208;shapes, U&#8208;shapes), LAF types, and LAF/aminoethylene ratios, highly potent pDNA, mRNA, and siRNA carriers are identified, which are up to several 100&#8208;fold more efficient than previous carrier generations and characterized by very fast transfection kinetics. mRNA lipopolyplexes maintain high transfection activity in cell culture even in the presence of &#8805;90% serum at an ultra&#8208;low mRNA dose of 3 picogram (&#8776;2 nanoparticles/cell), and thus are comparable in potency to viral nanoparticles. Importantly, they show great in vivo performance with high expression levels especially in spleen, tumor, lungs, and liver upon intravenous administration of 1&#8211;3&#160;&#181;g luciferase&#8208;encoding mRNA in mice.

         <title>Light&#8208;Writing and Projecting Multicolor Fluorescent Hydrogels for On&#8208;Demand Information Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the vertical arrangement of multilayered chromatophores in chameleon skins, a conceptually new type of flexible NIR&#8208;light&#8208;triggered rewritable multicolor hydrogel system is developed. It enables not only the transient light&#8208;writing/self&#8208;erasing/rewriting display of arbitrary information, but also the sustainable light&#8208;projecting display of multicolor patterns, which enriches the diversification of information display and improves visual information interactive experience.








Abstract
Intelligent rewritable display systems have been long expected to reduce the heavy consumption of single&#8208;use or transient devices in the age of Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things. However, it remains challenging to construct such systems with integrated functionality of remote control, rapid activation, multicolor and multimode display. Herein, by learning from the unique multilayer arrangement of chromatophores in chameleon skins, a promising kind of rewritable hydrogel multicolor systems is presented that can combine the merits of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;writing and projecting modes for on&#8208;demand information display. Specifically, the systems have typical multilayer layout consisting of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)&#8208;sealed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film as photothermal control unit and embedded fluorescent hydrogels as multicolor display unit, in which thermoresponsive hydrogel is constrained within non&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Such rational structure design results in the establishment of one promising display mechanism via the cascading &#8220;light trigger&#8211;heat generation&#8211;fluorescence output&#8221; process. On this basis, rapid and reversible hand&#8208;written display of arbitrary information is achieved within 5&#160;s. Also, sustainable light&#8208;projecting display of predesigned multicolor patterns is demonstrated due to the multilayer design that ensures easy patterning of photothermal control or hydrogel display layer. This study brings functional&#8208;integrated merits for novel rewritable display systems and open new possibility to construct high&#8208;end products for information display/transmission.

         <title>Bottling Liquid&#8208;Like Minerals for Advanced Materials Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and scalable method to synthesize and isolate liquid&#8208;like mineral precursors is presented. The advantage of liquid&#8208;like precursors for materials synthesis is demonstrated for calcium carbonate minerals, exploring the effects of different organic and inorganic additives on the stability of the precursor phase. The method can be employed for, for example, mineral formation during restoration and conservation applications.








Abstract
Materials synthesis via liquid&#8208;like mineral precursors has been studied since their discovery almost 25 years ago, because their properties offer several advantages, for example, the ability to infiltrate small pores, the production of non&#8208;equilibrium crystal morphologies or mimicking textures from biominerals, resulting in a vast range of possible applications. However, the potential of liquid&#8208;like precursors has never been fully tapped, and they have received limited attention in the materials chemistry community, largely due to the lack of efficient and scalable synthesis protocols. Herein, the &#8220;scalable controlled synthesis and utilization of liquid&#8208;like precursors for technological applications&#8221; (SCULPT) method is presented, allowing the isolation of the precursor phase on a gram scale, and its advantage in the synthesis of crystalline calcium carbonate materials and respective applications is demonstrated. The effects of different organic and inorganic additives, such as magnesium ions and concrete superplasticizers, on the stability of the precursor are investigated and allow optimizing the process for specific demands. The presented method is easily scalable and therefore allows synthesizing and utilizing the precursor on large scales. Thus, it can be employed for mineral formation during restoration and conservation applications but can also open up pathways toward calcium carbonate&#8208;based, CO2&#8208;neutral cements.

         <title>A Biocompatible Supercapacitor Diode with Enhanced Rectification Capability toward Ion/Electron&#8208;Coupling Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A biocompatible supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is developed by employing molybdenum oxide as the working electrode. Benefiting from the size and charge dual ion&#8208;sieving effects of molybdenum oxide electrode, the as&#8208;built CAPode exhibits a record&#8208;high rectification ratio that is 10 times higher than those of reported systems, which enables the constructed CAPode to work well in ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operation circuits.








Abstract
The main challenge faced by the forthcoming human&#8211;computer interaction is that biological systems and electronic devices adopt two different information carriers, i.e., ions and electrons, respectively. To bridge the gap between these two systems, developing ion/electron&#8208;coupling devices for logic operation is a feasible and effective approach. Accordingly, herein a supercapacitor&#8208;based ionic diode (CAPode) that takes electrochemically amorphized molybdenum oxide as the working electrode is developed. Benefiting from its unique size and charge dual ion&#8208;sieving effects, the molybdenum oxide electrode exhibits a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of 136, which is over 10 times higher than those of reported systems. It also delivers an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 448 F g&#8315;1 and an excellent cycling stability of up to 20 000 cycles, greatly outperforming those of previous works. These excellent rectification capability and electrochemical performances allow the as&#8208;built CAPode to work well in AND and OR logic gates, validating great potential in ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations. More attractively, the superior biocompatibilities of molybdenum oxide and relevant constituent materials enable the constructed CAPode to be applied as bioelectronics without regard to biosafety, paving a new way toward forthcoming human&#8211;computer interaction.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.2% Efficiency Enabled by Solid Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of 3,5&#8208;dichlorobromobenzene can effectively tune the phase separation of PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl during film formation, results in a favorable phase separation and a reinforced molecular packing. Consequently, the binary organic solar cells exhibit 19.2% efficiency and superior photostability.








Abstract
Morphology optimization is critical for achieving high efficiency and stable bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, the use of 3,5&#8208;dichlorobromobenzene (DCBB) with high volatility and low cost to manipulate evolution of the BHJ morphology and improve the operability and photostability of OSCs is proposed. Systematic simulations reveal the charge distribution of DCBB and its non&#8208;covalent interaction with the active layer materials. The addition of DCBB can effectively tune the aggregation of PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl during film formation, resulting in a favorable phase separation and a reinforced molecular packing. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 19.2% (certified as 19.0% by the National Institute of Metrology) for DCBB&#8208;processed PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based OSCs, which is the highest reported value for binary OSCs, is obtained. Importantly, the DCBB&#8208;processed devices exhibit superior photostability and have thus considerable application potential in the printing of large&#8208;area devices, demonstrating outstanding universality in various BHJ systems. The study provides a facile approach to control the BHJ morphology and enhances the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>A Biodegradable, Waterproof, and Thermally Processable Cellulosic Bioplastic Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;dynamic covalent network&#8221; reconstruction strategy is proposed for the fabrication of sustainable cellulosic bioplastics. By introducing dynamic linkages between cellulose chains, this cellulosic bioplastic is imparted with good thermo&#8208;processability, competitive mechanical properties, excellent water and solvent resistance, as well as chemical and biological degradability. This approach provides a new route for developing sustainable and degradable bioplastics from resource&#8208;abundant biomass.








Abstract
The growing environmental concern over petrochemical&#8208;based plastics continuously promotes the exploration of green and sustainable substitute materials. Compared with petrochemical products, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of availability, cost, and biodegradability; however, cellulose's dense hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and highly ordered crystalline structure make it hard to be thermoformed. A strategy to realize the partial disassociation of hydrogen bonds in cellulose and the reassembly of cellulose chains via constructing a dynamic covalent network, thereby endowing cellulose with thermal processability as indicated by the observation of a moderate glass transition temperature (Tg&#160;=&#160;240&#160;&#176;C), is proposed. Moreover, the cellulosic bioplastic delivers a high tensile strength of 67&#160;MPa, as well as excellent moisture and solvent resistance, good recyclability, and biodegradability in nature. With these advantageous features, the developed cellulosic bioplastic represents a promising alternative to traditional plastics.

         <title>Skeletal Network Enabling New&#8208;Generation Thermoplastic Vulcanizates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new design concept of a skeletal network is pioneered to realize the upcycling of conventional vulcanizates. The resultant materials, integrated with the superior strength/elasticity of conventional vulcanizates and the extrudable reprocessability of thermoplastics, can exploit a feasible alternative toward a new generation of thermoplastic vulcanizates.








Abstract
Upcycling of cross&#8208;linked rubbers is pressing. The introduction of dynamic covalent bonds into the networks is a popular tactic for recycling thermosetting polymers, but it is very challenging to integrate engineering performance and continuous yet stable reprocessability. Based on traditional rubber formulations, herein, a straightforward strategy is presented for constructing a skeletal network (SN) through interfacial crosslinking and percolation of rubbery granules in a rubber matrix. Rapid exchange reactions involving dynamic interfacial sulfides realize repeated &#8220;fragmentation and healing&#8221; in the solid&#8208;state and consequent reconfiguration of the SN topology of the elastomer, thus endowing the resultant SN elastomer with continuous yet stable re&#8208;extrudability. These SN elastomers with hierarchical structures exhibit high gel contents, high resilience, low creep, and reinforcibility competitive to traditional vulcanizates. Specifically, SN elastomers exhibit better overall performance than commercial thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) materials. Overall, a new concept of thermoplastic vulcanizates is proposed, which will promote the sustainable development of rubbers.

         <title>PF6&#8722; Pseudohalides Anion Based Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for Stable X&#8208;Ray Detector to Attain Record Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work novelly introduces strong electronegative PF6&#8722; pseudohalides and synthesizes the metal&#8208;free MDABCO&#8208;NH4(PF6)3 perovskites to solve the problems of oxidation, corrosion, and uncontrolled ion migration in common I&#8208;based MFPs. Importantly, the advanced SC&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector achieves the highest sensitivity of 2078 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8208;2, an ultra&#8208;low LoD of 16.3 nGyair s&#8722;1, and superior environmental and operational stability for practical applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) possess excellent photophysical properties of perovskites while avoiding the introduction of toxic metal ions and organic solvents, and have been expanded to X&#8208;ray detection. However, iodine&#8208;based high&#8208;performance MFPs are tended to oxidation, corrosion, and uncontrolled ion migration, resulting in poor material stability and device performance. Herein, the strongly electronegative PF6&#8722; pseudohalide is used to fabricate the large&#8208;size MDABCO&#8208;NH4(PF6)3 (MDBACO = methyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) single crystals (SCs) for solving the problems of iodine ions. After the introduction of PF6&#8722; pseudohalides, the Coulomb interaction and hydrogen bonding strength are enhanced to alleviate the ion&#8208;migration and stability problems. Moreover, combined with theoretical calculations, PF6&#8722; pseudohalides increase the ion&#8208;migration barrier, and affect the contribution of its components to the energy band for a broadening bandgap. Meanwhile, the improved physical properties, such as large activation energy of ionic migration, high resistivity, and low current drift, further expand its application in low&#8208;dose and sensitive X&#8208;ray detection. Finally, the X&#8208;ray detector based on MDABCO&#8208;NH4(PF6)3 SCs achieves a sensitivity of 2078 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (highest among metal&#8208;free SCs&#8208;based detectors) and the lowest detectable dose rate (16.3 nGyair s&#8722;1). This work has expanded the selection of MFPs for X&#8208;ray detectors and somewhat advanced the development of high&#8208;performance devices.

         <title>Direct Observation of Quadrupolar Strain Fields forming a Shear Band in Metallic Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4D&#8208;STEM&#8208;based analysis to directly correlate local strain field and atomic nearest&#8208;neighbor packing at the nanometer scale along shear bands in metallic glasses is developed. The observation unveils residual strain fields with quadrupolar symmetry concentrated at dilated Eshelby inclusions. The strain fields percolate in a vortex&#8208;like manner building up the shear band. This provides a new understanding of the formation of shear bands in metallic glass.








Abstract
For decades, scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) techniques have been employed to analyze shear bands in metallic glasses and understand their formation in order to improve the mechanical properties of metallic glasses. However, due to a lack of direct information in reciprocal space, conventional S/TEM cannot characterize the local strain and atomic structure of amorphous materials, which are key to describe the deformation of glasses. For this work, 4&#8208;dimensional&#8208;STEM (4D&#8208;STEM) is applied to map and directly correlate the local strain and the atomic structure at the nanometer scale in deformed metallic glasses. Residual strain fields are observed with quadrupolar symmetry concentrated at dilated Eshelby inclusions. The strain fields percolate in a vortex&#8208;like manner building up the shear band. This provides a new understanding of the formation of shear bands in metallic glass.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Flux X&#8208;ray Detection by a Solution&#8208;Grown Perovskite CsPbBr3 Single&#8208;Crystal Semiconductor Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 with low defect density and good short&#8208;range order shows a record&#8208;high X&#8208;ray sensitivity of &gt;10 000 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 22 nGyair s&#8722;1. Under ultrahigh flux of synchrotron X&#8208;rays (106 to 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2 at 58.61&#160;keV), a good photocurrent linearity and reproducibility are achieved.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskites are promising for hard X&#8208;ray and gamma&#8208;ray detection, but there are limited reports on their performance under extremely intense X&#8208;rays. Here, a solution&#8208;grown all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal semiconductor detector capable of operating at ultrahigh X&#8208;ray flux of 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2 is reported. High&#8208;quality solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystals are fabricated into detectors with a Schottky diode structure of eutectic gallium indium/CsPbBr3/Au. A high reverse&#8208;bias voltage of 1000&#160;V (435&#160;V mm&#8722;1) can be applied with a small and stable dark current of &#8776;60&#8211;70 nA (&#8776;9&#8211;10 nA mm&#8722;2), which enables a high sensitivity larger than 10 000 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a simultaneous low detection limit of 22 nGyair s&#8722;1. The CsPbBr3 semiconductor detector shows an excellent photocurrent linearity and reproducibility under 58.61&#160;keV synchrotron X&#8208;rays with flux from 106 to 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2. Defect characterization by thermally stimulated current spectroscopy shows a similar low defect density of a synchrotron X&#8208;ray and a lab X&#8208;ray irradiated device. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that the excellent performance of the solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystal may be associated with its good short&#8208;range order, comparable to the spectrometer&#8208;grade melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3.

         <title>Versatile Microfluidics Separation of Colloids by Combining External Flow with Light&#8208;Induced Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for separating colloids distinguished only by slight differences in their surface morphology (e.g., roughness, porosity, or polymer), is reported. It relies on combining the drift by the pressure&#8208;driven shear flow of a photosensitive surfactant solution with a surface&#8208;properties&#8208;dependent positioning of the particles within the shear flow via local active flows induced under suitable illumination.








Abstract
Separation of particles by size, morphology, or material identity is of paramount importance in fields such as filtration or bioanalytics. Up to now separation of particles distinguished solely by surface properties or bulk/surface morphology remains a very challenging process. Here a combination of pressure&#8208;driven microfluidic flow and local self&#8208;phoresis/osmosis are proposed via the light&#8208;induced chemical activity of a photoactive azobenzene&#8208;surfactant solution. This process induces a vertical displacement of the sedimented particles, which depends on their size and surface properties .&#160;Consequently, different colloidal components&#160;experience different regions of the ambient microfluidic shear flow. Accordingly, a simple, versatile method for the&#160;separation of such can be achieved by elution times in a sense of particle chromatography. The concepts are illustrated via experimental studies, complemented by theoretical analysis, which include the separation of bulk&#8208;porous from bulk&#8208;compact colloidal particles and the separation of particles distinguished solely by slight differences in their surface physico&#8208;chemical properties.

         <title>Atomic Insights into the Cu Species Supported on Zeolite for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol via Low&#8208;Damage HAADF&#8208;STEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;damage HAADF&#8208;STEM imaging technique is employed for direct visualization and determination of Cu species in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite frameworks. The structure of the Cu species are revealed based on the microscopy evidence and also proved by the complementary spectroscopy results. The mono&#8208;Cu species stably anchored by Al pairs inside the zeolite channels are identified as the key structure for higher C1 oxygenates yield and methanol selectivity for direct oxidation of methane.








Abstract
Precise determination of the structure&#8208;property relationship of zeolite&#8208;based metal catalysts is critical for the development toward practical applications. However, the scarcity of real&#8208;space imaging of zeolite&#8208;based low&#8208;atomic&#8208;number (LAN) metal materials due to the electron&#8208;beam sensitivity of zeolites has led to continuous debates regarding the exact LAN metal configurations. Here, a low&#8208;damage high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) imaging technique is employed for direct visualization and determination of LAN metal (Cu) species in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite frameworks. The structures of the Cu species are revealed based on the microscopy evidence and also proved by the complementary spectroscopy results. The correlation between the characteristic Cu size in Cu/ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts and their direct oxidation of methane to methanol reaction properties is unveiled. As a result, the mono&#8208;Cu species stably anchored by Al pairs inside the zeolite channels are identified as the key structure for higher C1 oxygenates yield and methanol selectivity for direct oxidation of methane. Meanwhile, the local topological flexibility of the rigid zeolite frameworks induced by the Cu agglomeration in the channels is also revealed. This work exemplifies the combination of microscopy imaging and spectroscopy characterization serves as a complete arsenal for revealing structure&#8208;property relationships of the supported metal&#8208;zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Realization of 1.54&#8208;&#181;m Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Er3+/Yb3+Co&#8208;Doped CsPbCl3 Films</title>

         <dc:description>
Er3+ 1.54&#8208;&#181;m electroluminescence based on the CsPbCl3 perovskite films for photonic devices operating in the third telecommunication window is realized through energy transfer from Yb3+activated by CsPbCl3 via a quantum cutting process to Er3+. The obtained peak external quantum efficiency far exceeds that of the Er3+&#8208;based organic light emitting diode by two orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Erbium ions (Er3+, 1.54&#160;&#181;m) electric pumped light sources with excellent optical properties and a simple fabrication process are urgently desired to satisfy the development of silicon&#8208;based integration photonics. The previous Er&#8208;based electroluminescence devices are mainly based on Er&#8208;complexes or Er&#8208;doped oxide compounds, which usually suffer from low external quantum efficiency(EQE)or high applied voltage etc. In this work, a novel type of Er3+/Yb3+ co&#8208;doped lead&#8208;halide perovskite films (Er3+/Yb3+:CsPbCl3) with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 30.12% are prepared by a simple two&#8208;step solution&#8208;coating method and the corresponding light emitting diodes (Er&#8208;PeLEDs) are fabricated, which demonstrate an almost pure 1.54&#8208;&#181;m emission and a peak EQE up to 0.366% at a low applied voltage of 1.4 V. Strong negative thermal quenching effect may help Er&#8208;PeLEDs suppress Joule heating quenching. These excellent LED properties benefit mainly from the outstanding regulatory performance of acetate to perovskite films, the excellent semiconductor behavior and strong ionic property of the perovskite, and the involvement of Yb3+ ions, which can directly and efficiently transfer the exciton energy to Er3+ through a quantum cutting process. Overall, the realization of 1.54&#8208;&#181;m Er&#8208;PeLEDs offers new opportunities for silicon&#8208;based integrated light sources.

         <title>In Situ Grown Silver&#8211;Polymer Framework with Coordination Complexes for Functional Artificial Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF) is proposed, in which silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are in situ grown (for sensing) with simultaneous formation of metal&#8211;ligand coordination complexes (for actuating). The seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification at nano&#8208;/molecular levels in a single homogenous material platform simultaneously imparts multimodal sensation and excellent load&#8208;lifting into soft robots, thus fully mimicking sensory motions (proprio&#8208;/exteroception) of biological organisms.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sensing actuators are critical to artificial robots with biomimetic proprio&#8208;/exteroception properties of biological neuromuscular systems. Existing add&#8208;on approaches, which physically blend heterogeneous sensor/actuator components, fall short of yielding satisfactory solutions, considering their suboptimal interfaces, poor adhesion, and electronic/mechanical property mismatches. Here, a single homogeneous material platform is reported by creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF), thus realizing the seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification. The SPF&#8208;enabled elastomer is highly stretchable (1200%), conductive (0.076&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), and strong (0.76&#160;MPa in&#8208;strength), where the stretchable polymer matrix synthesis and in situ silver nanoparticles reduction are accomplished simultaneously. Benefiting from the multimodal sensing capability from its architecture itself (mechanical and thermal cues), self&#8208;sensing actuation (proprio&#8208;deformations and external stimuli perceptions) is achieved for the SPF&#8208;based pneumatic actuator, alongside an excellent load&#8208;lifting attribute (up to 3700 times its own weight), substantiating its advantage of the unified sensing&#8211;actuation feature in a single homogenous material. In view of its human somatosensitive muscular systems imitative functionality, the reported SPF bodes well for use with next&#8208;generation functional tissues, including artificial skins, human&#8211;machine interfaces, self&#8208;sensing robots, and otherwise dynamic materials.

         <title>Foldable Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Merging Electronic States between Defective and Perfect Perovskite Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging orbitals between the defect and perfect crystals within perovskites are found in chemosynthetic foldable hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) that convert discrete island trap states to continuous electronic states, and the mini module achieves high efficiency and fill factor.








Abstract
Defective and perfect sites naturally exist within electronic semiconductors, and considerable efforts to reduce defects to improve the performance of electronic devices, especially in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (ABX3), are undertaken. Herein, foldable hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) are developed, and they extend the wavefunctions of A&#8208;site cations of perovskite, which, as hybridized electronic states, link the trap states (defective site) and valence band edge (perfect site) between the naturally defective and perfect sites of the perovskite surface, finally converting the discrete trap states of the perovskite as the continuous valence band to reduce trap recombination. Tailoring the foldability of the HTMs tunes the wavefunctions between defective and perfect surface sites, allowing the power conversion efficiency of a small cell to reach 23.22% and that of a mini&#8208;module (6.5 &#215; 7&#160;cm, active area&#160;=&#160;30.24&#160;cm2) to reach as high as 21.71% with a fill factor of 81%, the highest value reported for non&#8208;spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based perovskite solar modules.

         <title>Bifunctional Gas Diffusion Electrode Enables In Situ Separation and Conversion of CO2 to Ethylene from Dilute Stream</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional gas diffusion electrode is reported for integrated CO2 separation and electrochemical conversion to ethylene from low concentration CO2 stream (10&#160;vol%), bypassing the prerequisite of energy&#8208;intensive incumbent CO2 capture and regeneration, compression, and transportation steps.








Abstract
The requirement of concentrated carbon dioxide (CO2) feedstock significantly limits the economic feasibility of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) which often involves multiple intermediate processes, including CO2 capture, energy&#8208;intensive regeneration, compression, and transportation. Herein, a bifunctional gas diffusion electrode (BGDE) for separation and eCO2R from a low&#8208;concentration CO2 stream is reported. The BGDE is demonstrated for the selective production of ethylene (C2H4) by combining high&#8208;density&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;derived porous carbon (HPC) as a physisorbent with polycrystalline copper as a conversion catalyst. The BGDE shows substantial tolerance to 10 vol% CO2 exhibiting a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;45% toward C2H4 at a current density of 80 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previous reports that utilized such partial pressure (PCO2 = 0.1 atm and above) and unaltered polycrystalline copper. Molecular dynamics simulation and mixed gas permeability assessment reveal that such selective performance is ensured by high CO2 uptake of the microporous HPC as well as continuous desorption owing to the molecular diffusion and concentration gradient created by the binary flow of CO2 and nitrogen (CO2|N2) within the sorbent boundary. Based on detailed techno&#8208;economic analysis, it is concluded that this in situ process can be economically compelling by precluding the C2H4 production cost associated with the energy&#8208;intensive intermediate steps of the conventional decoupled process.
