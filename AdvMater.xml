         <title>Boosting Electrochemical Styrene Transformation via Tandem Water Oxidation over Single&#8208;Atom Cr1/CoSe2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organics using water as the oxygen source is a prospective but challenging method to produce high value&#8208;added chemicals, especially the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its efficiency. Herein, we present a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single&#8208;atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at CoSe2 support (Cr1/CoSe2). Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under the potential of 1.6 VAg/AgCl, it achieves excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent. Isotopic tracing, isotope&#8208;labeled in&#8208;situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from Co to Cr sites serves as the bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co&#8208;oxidation of multi&#8208;species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Simultaneous electrochemical exfoliation and covalent functionalization of MoS2 membrane for ion sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) membranes exhibit good anti&#8208;swelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, we report a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication, which was accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium ion intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 was optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets was improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes were tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;&#160;90% and &gt;&#160;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes were attributed to the suitable channel widths that were tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions were also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the MoS2&#8208;amide layers while a double layer between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

         <title>Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off forming a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, the in&#8208;service formed defects will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, we present a dynamic healing interface (DHI) by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts a PCE to 12.05% for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for CsPbI2Br cell as well as 23.37% for FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Healing charge-selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state-of-the-art strategies are often static by one-off forming a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, the in-service formed defects will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, we present a dynamic healing interface (DHI) by incorporating a low-melting-point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non-radiative recombination, the DHI boosts a PCE to 12.05% for all-inorganic CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solar cell and 14.14% for CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br cell as well as 23.37% for FA&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell.

         <title>Structural Reconstruction of Catalysts in Electroreduction Reaction: Identifying, Understanding, and Manipulating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electroreduction transformation of small molecules (CO2, N2 and H2O) into chemical feedstocks offers a promising approach to eliminate carbon emissions and harness renewable energy. Most cathodic catalysts often undergo structural transformation under operating electroreduction condition. These structural reconstructions are reflected in the changes of their catalytic activity. In&#8208;depth understanding of the change of active sites and influence parameters of reconstructed behaviors are an essential precondition for the design of highly efficient catalysts. Despite the previous achievements, a comprehensive insight of the structural evolution mechanism in cathodic catalysts compared to anode ones under the reaction conditions are still lacking. Herein, we provide an overview of structural reconstruction for cathodic catalysts in terms of fundamental mechanisms, reconstruction process, advanced characterizations, and influence parameters. On this basis, the typical strategies for manipulating the structural reconfiguration of catalysts are also explicitly discussed from the catalyst structure and working environment. By delivering the mechanism, strategies, insights, and techniques, this review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural reconstruction of cathodic catalysts in electroreduction reaction and future guidelines for their rational development.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mid&#8208;infrared Biosensing in Aqueous Solutions with Graphene Plasmon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Identifying nanoscale biomolecules in aqueous solutions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides an in&#8208;situ and non&#8208;invasive method for exploring the structure, reactions, and transport of biologically active molecules. However, this remains a challenge due to the strong and broad infrared (IR) absorption of water which overwhelms the respective vibrational fingerprints of the biomolecules. In this work, we exploit a tunable IR transparent microfluidic system with graphene plasmon to identify &#8764;2&#160;nm thick protein molecules in physiological conditions. The acquired in&#8208;situ tunability make it possible to eliminate the IR absorption of water outside the graphene plasmonic hotspots by background subtraction. Most importantly, the ultrahigh confinement of graphene plasmons (confined to &#8764;15&#160;nm) permits the implementation of nanoscale sensitivity. Then, the deuterium effects on monolayer proteins are characterized within an aqueous solution. The tunable graphene plasmon&#8208;enhanced FTIR technology provides a novel platform for studying biological processes in an aqueous solution at the nanoscale.

         <title>Reinforced layered double hydroxide oxygen evolution electrocatalysts: polyoxometallic acid wet&#8208;etching approach and synergistic mechanism</title>

Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDH) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis (OER). However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance&#8208;influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, we report a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including three dimensional morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe and O vacancies and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. Our experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance&#8208;influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanism dominantly contribute to the step&#8208;like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH&#8208;PMo12(+) &#8214; Ni@NiFe LDH(&#8208;) for alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;electrode&#8208;stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure&#8208;activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.

&lt;p&gt;Nickel-iron based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDH) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis (OER). However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance-influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, we report a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including three dimensional morphological nanotailoring, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe and O vacancies and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters.

The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH-PMo12(+) &#8214; Ni@NiFe LDH(-) for alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM)-electrode-stack cells.

Abstract
A unique robotic medical platform is designed by utilizing cell robots as the active &#8220;trojan horse&#8221; of oncolytic adenovirus (OA), capable of tumor&#8208;selective binding and killing. The OA&#8208;loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA&#8208;infected 293T cells with cyclic&#8208;RGD peptide (cRGD) to specific bind with bladder cancer cells, followed with asymmetric immobilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release virus progeny to surrounding tumor site for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell&#8208;based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.

Abstract
Owing to the rapid developments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both experimental and computational investigative methodologies, the massive amounts of data generated have led the field of materials science into the fourth paradigm of data&#8208;driven scientific research. This transition requires the development of authoritative and up&#8208;to&#8208;date frameworks for data&#8208;driven approaches for material innovation. This review presents a critical discussion on the current advances in the data&#8208;driven discovery of materials with a focus on frameworks, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, material&#8208;specific databases, descriptors, and targeted applications in the field of inorganic materials. Frameworks for rationalizing data&#8208;driven material innovation are described, and a critical review of essential sub&#8208;disciplines is presented, including (i) advanced data&#8208;intensive strategies and machine&#8208;learning algorithms; (ii) material databases and related tools and platforms for data generation and management; (iii) commonly used molecular descriptors used in data&#8208;driven processes. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth discussion on the broad applications of material innovation, such as energy conversion and storage, environmental decontamination, flexible electronics, optoelectronics, superconductors, metallic glasses, and magnetic materials, is provided. Finally, how these sub&#8208;disciplines (with insights into the synergy of materials science, computational tools, and mathematics) support data&#8208;driven paradigms is outlined, and the opportunities and challenges in data&#8208;driven material innovation are highlighted.

         <title>Untangling the mechanisms of lattice distortions in biogenic crystals across scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomineralized structures are complex functional hierarchical assemblies composed of biomineral building blocks joined together by an organic phase. The formation of individual mineral units is governed by the cellular tissue component that orchestrates the process of biomineral nucleation, growth and morphogenesis. These processes are imprinted in the structural, compositional and crystallographic properties of the emerging biominerals on all scales. Measurement of these properties can provide crucial information on the mechanisms that are employed by the organism to form these complex three&#8208;dimensional architectures and to unravel principles of their functionality. Nevertheless, so far, this was only possible at the macroscopic scale, by averaging the properties of the entire composite assembly, or at the mesoscale, by looking at extremely small parts of the entire picture. In this study we employ the newly developed synchrotron&#8208;based Dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray Microscopy method to study the link between three&#8208;dimensional crystallographic properties of relatively large calcitic prisms in the shell of the mollusc Pinna nobilis and their local lattice properties with extremely high angular resolution down to 0.001&#176;. We unravel mechanistic links between variations in local lattice parameters and spacing, crystal orientation, chemical composition and the deposition process of the entire mineral unit.

         <title>Rational Development of a Polysaccharide&#8211;Protein&#8208;Conjugated Nanoparticle Vaccine Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants and Streptococcus pneumoniae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bivalent nanoparticle vaccine is rationally developed by conjugating capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 with the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. Immunization with this vaccine induces potent protective immune responses against both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and S. pneumoniae. This universal polysaccharide&#8211;protein&#8208;conjugated vaccine platform provides a new tool to fight against cocirculating viral and bacterial pathogens.








Abstract
The ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has led to millions of deaths worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) remains a major cause of mortality in underdeveloped countries. A vaccine that prevents both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and S. pneumoniae infection represents a long&#8208;sought &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;. Herein, a nanoparticle vaccine, termed SCTV01B, is rationally developed by using the capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae serotype 14 (PPS14) as the backbone to conjugate with the recombinant receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. The final formulation of conjugated nanoparticles in the network structure exhibits high thermal stability. Immunization with SCTV01B induces potent humoral and Type 1/Type 2 T helper cell (Th1/Th2) cellular immune responses in mice, rats, and rhesus macaques. In particular, SCTV01B&#8208;immunized serum not only broadly cross&#8208;neutralizes all SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern (VOCs), including the most recent Omicron variant, but also shows high opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) against S. pneumoniae serotype 14. Finally, SCTV01B vaccination confers protection against challenges with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 mouse&#8208;adapted strain and the original strain in established murine models. Collectively, these promising preclinical results support further clinical evaluation of SCTV01B, highlighting the potency of polysaccharide&#8208;RBD&#8208;conjugated nanoparticle vaccine platforms for the development of vaccines for COVID&#8208;19 and other infectious diseases.

Bandgap&#8208;stable and efficient CsPbBrxI3&#8722;x perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are demonstrated by adopting an in situ inorganic ligand exchange. This strategy enables bandgap&#8208;stable mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with nanocrystal colloidal stability exceeding 1&#160;year at ambient conditions. The PLEDs exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.4% and sixfold&#8208;enhanced operating stability relative to the most stable prior red perovskite LEDs having EQEs &gt;20%.








Abstract
Instability in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs) is a key issue limiting perovskite solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). One form of instability arises during the processing of MHP quantum dots using an antisolvent to precipitate and purify the dots forming surface traps that lead to decreased luminescence, compromised colloidal stability, and emission broadening. Here, the introduction of inorganic ligands in the antisolvents used in dot purification is reported in order to overcome this problem. MHPs that are colloidally stable for over 1&#160;year at 25&#160;&#176;C&#160;and 40% humidity are demonstrated and films that are stable under 100&#160;W cm&#8722;2 photoirradiation, 4&#215; longer than the best previously reported MHPs, are reported. In LEDs, the materials enable an EQE of 24.4% (average 22.5&#160;&#177; 1.3%) and narrow emission (full&#8208;width at half maximum of 30&#160;nm). Sixfold&#8208;enhanced operating stability relative to the most stable prior red perovskite LEDs having external quantum efficiency &gt;20% is reported.

         <title>A Semiconducting Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer as an Organic Electrochemical Transistor Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymers feature synthetically tailored porosity and thus show both efficient electronic and ion transport. It is shown that two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) can be patterned on the micrometer scale, and can be used as the active material for organic electrochemical transistors.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are devices with broad potential in bioelectronic sensing, circuits, and neuromorphic hardware. Their unique properties arise from the use of organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs) as the active channel. Typical OMIECs are linear polymers, where defined and controlled microstructure/morphology, and reliable characterization of transport and charging can be elusive. Semiconducting two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) present a new avenue in OMIEC materials development, enabling electronic transport along with precise control of well&#8208;defined channels ideal for ion transport/intercalation. To this end, a recently reported 2DP, TIIP, is synthesized and patterned at 10&#160;&#181;m resolution as the channel of a transistor. The TIIP films demonstrate textured microstructure and show semiconducting properties with accessible oxidation states. Operating in an aqueous electrolyte, the 2DP&#8208;OECT exhibits a device&#8208;scale hole mobility of 0.05 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and a &#181;C* figure of merit of 1.75 F cm&#8211;1 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. 2DP OMIECs thus offer new synthetic degrees of freedom to control OECT performance and may enable additional opportunities such as ion selectivity or improved stability through reduced morphological modulation during device operation.

         <title>Sr&#8208;Doped Superionic Hydrogen Glass: Synthesis and Properties of SrH22</title>

Abstract
Recently, several research groups announced reaching the point of metallization of hydrogen above 400&#160;GPa. Despite a notable progress, detecting superconductivity in compressed hydrogen remains an unsolved problem. Following the mainstream of extensive investigations of compressed metal polyhydrides, here we demonstrate that small doping by strontium leads to a dramatic reduction in the metallization pressure of molecular hydrogen to about 200&#160;GPa. Studying the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of the Sr&#8211;H system, we observed the formation of several new phases: C2/mSr3H13, pseudocubic SrH6, SrH9 with cubic F43m Sr sublattice, and pseudo tetragonal superionic P1SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content (96 at. %) discovered so far. High diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in the latter phase DH = 0.2&#8208;2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;9 m2/s indicate an amorphous state of the H&#8208;sublattice, whereas the strontium sublattice remains solid. Unlike Ca and Y, strontium forms molecular semiconducting polyhydrides, whereas calcium and yttrium polyhydrides are high&#8208;TC superconductors with an atomic H sublattice. Discovered SrH22, a kind of hydrogen sponge, opens a new class of materials with ultra&#8208;high content of hydrogen.

         <title>Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst in&#8208;situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium Metal &#8211; Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
This is the first report of a molybdenum carbide&#8208;based electrocatalyst for sulfur&#8208;based sodium metal batteries (SMBs/NMBs). MoC/Mo2C is in&#8208;situ grown on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50wt.%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8208;S. Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in&#8208;situ time&#8208;resolved Raman, XPS and optical analysis demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8208;S cathodes delivered among the most promising rate performance characteristics in literature, achieving 987 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, 818 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and 621 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64wt.%&#160;S,&#160;12.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) also show cycling stability, with anode degradation due to deep plating/stripping driving capacity decay. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that formation energy of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x &#8804; 4) on surface of MoC/Mo2C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x &#8804; 4) on MoC/Mo2C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides&#8217; surface.

         <title>Programming Cellular Alignment in Engineered Cardiac Tissue via Bioprinting Anisotropic Organ Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability to replicate the three&#8208;dimensional myocardial architecture found in human hearts is a grand challenge. Here, we report the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs). We first generated a bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs and printed aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features. Next, we printed aligned cardiac macrofilaments, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increased over time and exceeded the performance of spheroid&#8208;based cardiac tissues. Finally, we highlighted the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment. Our research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellularly alignment.

Here, we report the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). We first generated a bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs and printed aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features. Next, we printed aligned cardiac macrofilaments, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increased over time and exceeded the performance of spheroid-based cardiac tissues. Finally, we highlighted the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment. Our research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellularly alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Preparation of Amorphous SnO2&#8208;Encapsulated Multi&#8208;Phased Crystalline Cu Heterostructures for Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>

Abstract
Controlling the architectures and crystal phases of metal@semiconductor heterostructures is very important for modulating their physicochemical properties and enhancing their application performances. Here, we report a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize three types of amorphous SnO2&#8208;encapsulated crystalline Cu heterostructures, i.e., hemicapsule, yolk&#8208;shell and core&#8208;shell nanostructures, in which unconventional crystal phases (e.g., 2H, 4H, and 6H) and defects (e.g., stacking faults and twin boundaries), have been observed in the crystalline Cu cores. The hemicapsule Cu@SnO2 heterostructures, with voids that not only expose the Cu core with unconventional phases but also retain the interface between Cu and SnO2, show an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity towards the production of CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% in a wide potential window from &#8208;1.05 to &#8208;1.55&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the highest FE of CO2RR (95.3%) has been obtained at &#8208;1.45&#160;V (versus RHE). This work opens up a new way for the synthesis of new heterostructured nanomaterials with promising catalytic application.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Control with Curie Temperature above 400 K in a van der Waals Ferromagnet for Spintronic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The technological appeal of van der Waals ferromagnetic materials is the ability to control magnetism under external fields with desired thickness towards novel spintronic applications. For practically useful devices, ferromagnetism above room temperature or tunable magnetic anisotropy is highly demanded but remains challenging. To date, only a few layered materials exhibit unambiguous ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature via gating techniques or interface engineering. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy control and dramatic modulation of Curie temperature (Tc) up to 400 K are realized in layered Fe5GeTe2 via the high&#8208;pressure diamond&#8208;anvil&#8208;cell technique. Magnetic phases manifesting with in&#8208;plane anisotropic, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropic and nearly&#8208;isotropic magnetic states can be tuned in a controllable way, depicted by the phase diagram with a maximum Tc up to 360 K. Remarkably, the Tc can be gradually enhanced to above 400 K owing to the Fermi surface evolution during a pressure loading&#8208;deloading process. Such an observation sheds light on the understanding and control of emergent magnetic states in practical spintronic applications.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Cloning, Moir&#233; Flat Bands and Magic Lattice Constants in Epitaxial Monolayer Graphene</title>

Abstract
Tuning interactions between Dirac states in graphene has attracted enormous interest because it can modify the electronic spectrum of the two&#8208;dimensional material, enhance electron correlations, and give rise to novel condensed&#8208;matter phases such as superconductors, Mott insulators, Wigner crystals and quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Previous works predominantly focus on the flat band dispersion of coupled Dirac states from different twisted graphene layers. In this work, we&#160;propose a new route to realizing flat band physics in monolayer graphene under a periodic modulation from substrates. We&#160;take graphene/SiC heterostructure as a prototypical example and demonstrate experimentally that the substrate modulation leads to Dirac fermion cloning and consequently, the proximity of the two Dirac cones of monolayer graphene in momentum space. Our&#160;theoretical modeling captures the cloning mechanism of Dirac states and indicates that Moir&#233; flat bands can emerge at certain magic lattice constants of the substrate, specifically when the period of modulation becomes nearly commensurate with the (3&#215;3)R30&#8728;$(\sqrt {3}\times \sqrt {3})R30^{\circ }$ supercell of graphene. The results show that epitaxial single monolayer graphene on suitable substrates is a promising platform for exploring exotic many&#8208;body quantum phases arising from interactions between Dirac&#160;electrons.

         <title>Biomimetic and Biologically Compliant Soft Architectures via 3D and 4D Assembly Methods: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in soft material chemistry as it relates to direct ink writing and directed assembly through compressive buckling is discussed in relation to advances in 4D fabrication. The discussion focuses on the chemistry of important classes of soft materials, such as gels and elastomers, specifically in ways that allow new possibilities for biomimetic and biologically compliant forms of design.








Abstract
Recent progress in soft material chemistry and enabling methods of 3D and 4D fabrication&#8212;emerging programmable material designs and associated assembly methods for the construction of complex functional structures&#8212;is highlighted. The underlying advances in this science allow the creation of soft material architectures with properties and shapes that programmably vary with time. The ability to control composition from the molecular to the macroscale is highlighted&#8212;most notably through examples that focus on biomimetic and biologically compliant soft materials. Such advances, when coupled with the ability to program material structure and properties across multiple scales via microfabrication, 3D printing, or other assembly techniques, give rise to responsive (4D) architectures. The challenges and prospects for progress in this emerging field in terms of its capacities for integrating chemistry, form, and function are described in the context of exemplary soft material systems demonstrating important but heretofore difficult&#8208;to&#8208;realize biomimetic and biologically compliant behaviors.

         <title>Gradient Doping in Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites by Barium Ions for Efficient Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium ions are reported to effectively n&#8208;dope perovskites. Distribution of the barium ions and related n&#8208;doping effect is in a gradient across the perovskite film, resulting in a homojunction, which facilitates the separation and transport of the photogenerated carriers. Carrier diffusion length &gt;2&#160;&#181;m and boosted efficiencies of 21.2% for single&#8208;junction cell and 25.3% for all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell are achieved.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskites generally have a high density of unintentional p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping, which reduces the charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes, diffusion lengths, and device efficiencies. Here, a&#160;p&#8211;n&#160;homojunction across the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite is demonstrated, which results from a gradient doping by barium ions (Ba2+). It is reported that 0.1&#160;mol% Ba2+ can effectively compensate the p&#8208;doping of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites or even turns it to n&#8208;type without changing its bandgap. Ba2+ cations are found to stay at the interstitial sites and work as shallow electron donor. In addition, Ba2+ cations show a unique heterogeneous distribution in perovskite film. Most of the barium ions stay in the top 600&#160;nm region of the perovskite films and turn it into weakly n&#8208;type, while the bottom portion of the film remains as p&#8208;type. The gradient doping forms a homojunction from top to bottom of the perovskite films with a built&#8208;in field that facilitates extraction of photogenerated carriers, resulting in an increased carrier extraction length. This strategy enhances the efficiency of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite single&#8208;junction solar cells to over 21.0% and boosts the efficiencies of monolithic perovskite&#8211;perovskite tandem solar cells to 25.3% and 24.1%, for active areas of 5.9&#160;mm2&#160;and 0.94&#160;cm2, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Narrow-bandgap (NBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskites generally have a high density of unintentional p-type self-doping, which reduces the charge-carrier lifetimes, diffusion lengths, and device efficiencies. Here, a&#160;p&#8211;n&#160;homojunction across the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite is demonstrated, which results from a gradient doping by barium ions (Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). It is reported that 0.1&#160;mol% Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can effectively compensate the p-doping of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites or even turns it to n-type without changing its bandgap. Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations are found to stay at the interstitial sites and work as shallow electron donor. In addition, Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations show a unique heterogeneous distribution in perovskite film. Most of the barium ions stay in the top 600&#160;nm region of the perovskite films and turn it into weakly n-type, while the bottom portion of the film remains as p-type. The gradient doping forms a homojunction from top to bottom of the perovskite films with a built-in field that facilitates extraction of photogenerated carriers, resulting in an increased carrier extraction length. This strategy enhances the efficiency of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite single-junction solar cells to over 21.0% and boosts the efficiencies of monolithic perovskite&#8211;perovskite tandem solar cells to 25.3% and 24.1%, for active areas of 5.9&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;and 0.94&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabrication of Flexible Mesoporous Black Nb2O5 Nanofiber Films for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction into CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible mesoporous black Nb2O5&#8722;x nanofibers that contain abundant oxygen&#8208;vacancies are fabricated with an electrospinning technique followed by a room&#8208;temperature defect control strategy. The Nb2O5&#8722;x catalyst has a low bandgap width of 2.25 eV that broadens the&#160;light&#8208;absorption range from the ultraviolet to visible&#8208;light, and shows a unique reaction router for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 with a selectivity of 64.8%.








Abstract
Achieving high selectivity and conversion efficiency simultaneously is a challenge for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction into CH4. Here, a facile nanofiber synthesis method and a new defect control strategy at room&#8208;temperature are reported for the fabrication of flexible mesoporous black Nb2O5 nanofiber catalysts that contain abundant oxygen&#8208;vacancies and unsaturated Nb dual&#8208;sites, which are efficient towards photocatalytic production of CH4. The oxygen&#8208;vacancy decreases the bandgap width of Nb2O5 from 3.01&#8211;2.25&#160;eV, which broadens the&#160;light&#8208;absorption range from ultraviolet to visible&#8208;light, and the dual sites in the mesopores can easily adsorb CO2, so that the intermediate product of CO* can be spontaneously changed into *CHO. The formation of a highly stable Nb&#63743;CHO* intermediate at the dual sites is proposed to be the key feature determining selectivity. The preliminary results show that without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers, the nanofiber catalyst achieves 64.8% selectivity for CH4 production with a high evolution rate of 19.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light. Furthermore, the flexible catalyst film can be directly used in devices, showing appealing and broadly commercial applications.

         <title>Terahertz Chiral Metamaterials Enabled by Textile Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the polarization state of terahertz (THz) waves provides the basis for numerous THz applications but is challenging to realize. Leveraging a two&#8208;step textile manufacturing approach, a textile&#8208;based large&#8208;area and inexpensive chiral metamaterial is demonstrated for strong chiroptical responses at THz frequencies.








Abstract
Easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate, large&#8208;area, and inexpensive microstructures that realize control of the polarization of terahertz (THz) radiation are of fundamental importance to the development of the field of THz wave photonics. However, due to the lack of natural materials that can facilitate strong THz radiation&#8211;matter interactions, THz polarization components remain an undeveloped technology. Strong resonance&#8208;based responses offered by THz metamaterials have led to the recent development of THz metadevices, whereas, for polarization control devices, micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication techniques including aligned photolithography are generally required to create multilayer microstructures. In this work, leveraging a two&#8208;step textile manufacturing approach, a chiral metamaterial capable of exhibiting strong chiroptical responses at THz frequencies is demonstrated. Chiral&#8208;selective transmission and pronounced optical activity are experimentally observed. In sharp contrast to smart&#8208;clothing&#8208;related devices (e.g., textile antennas), the investigated chiral metamaterials gain their THz properties directly from the yarn&#8208;twisting enabled microhelical strings. It is envisioned that the interplay between meta&#8208;atom designs and textile manufacturing technology will lead to a new family of metadevices for complete control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of THz radiation.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Encoded Supramolecular Photothermal Nanomedicine for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>

Amino acid encoding can be a facile and potent means to design and construct supramolecular photothermal nanoagents with controlled therapeutic activities, offering an unprecedented opportunity for customized nanomedicine toward precision cancer therapy.








Abstract
Photothermal nanomedicine based on self&#8208;assembly of biological components, with excellent biosafety and customized performance, is vital significance for precision cancer therapy. However, the programmable design of photothermal nanomedicine remains extremely challenging due to the vulnerability and variability of noncovalent interactions governing supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Herein, it is reported that amino acid encoding is a facile and potent means to design and construct supramolecular photothermal nanodrugs with controlled therapeutic activities. It is found that the amount and type of amino acid dominates the assembled nanostructures, structural stability, energy&#8208;conversion pathway, and therapeutic mechanism of the resulting nanodrugs. Two optimized nanodrugs are endowed with robust structural integrity against disassembly along with high photothermal conversion efficiency, efficient cellular internalization, and enhanced tumor accumulation, which result in more efficient tumor ablation. This work demonstrates that design based on amino acid encoding offers an unprecedented opportunity for the construction of remarkable photoactive nanomedicines toward cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

Mucus penetrating and cell&#8208;binding polyzwitterionic micelles are developed as potent oral nanomedicine for cancer drug delivery.








Abstract
Orally administrable anticancer nanomedicines are highly desirable due to their easy and repeatable administration, but are not yet feasible because the current nanomedicine cannot simultaneously overcome the strong mucus and villi barriers and thus have very low bioavailability (BA). Herein, this work presents the first polymeric micelle capable of fast mucus permeation and villi absorption and delivering paclitaxel (PTX) efficiently to tumors with therapeutic efficacy even better than intravenously administered polyethylene glycol based counterpart or free PTX. Poly[2&#8208;(N&#8208;oxide&#8208;N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDEA), a water&#8208;soluble polyzwitterion, is highly nonfouling to proteins and other biomacromolecules such as mucin but can weakly bind to phospholipids. Therefore, the micelle of its block copolymer with poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (OPDEA&#8208;PCL) can efficiently permeate through the viscous mucus and bind to villi, which triggers transcytosis&#8208;mediated transepithelial transport into blood circulation for tumor accumulation. The orally administered micelles deliver PTX to tumors, efficiently inhibiting the growth of HepG2 and patient&#8208;derived hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts and triple&#8208;negative breast tumors. These results demonstrate that OPDEA&#8208;based micelles may serve as an efficient oral nanomedicine for delivering other small molecules or even large molecules.

         <title>Heterointerface Created on Au&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Loaded Unilamellar Hydroxide Electrocatalysts as a Highly Active Site for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material design for interface active sites to allow a novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is proposed. The Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded unilamellar layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide nanosheet electrocatalysts create interfacial active sites that exhibit interfacial direct O&#63743;O coupling and excellent OER performance.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical element for all sorts of reactions that use water as a hydrogen source, such as hydrogen evolution and electrochemical CO2 reduction, and novel design principles that provide highly active sites on OER electrocatalysts push the limits of their practical applications. Herein, Au&#8208;cluster loading on unilamellar exfoliated layered double hydroxide (ULDH) electrocatalysts for the OER is demonstrated to fabricate a heterointerface between Au clusters and ULDHs as an active site, which is accompanied by the oxidation state modulation of the active site and interfacial direct O&#63743;O coupling (&#8220;interfacial DOOC&#8221;). The Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded ULDHs exhibit excellent activities for the OER with an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that charge transfer from the Au clusters to ULDHs modifies the oxidation states of trivalent metal ions, which can be active sites on the ULDHs. The present study, supported by highly sensitive spectroscopy combining reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy and modulation&#8208;excitation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, indicates that active sites at the interface between the Au clusters and ULDHs promote a novel OER mechanism through interfacial DOOC, thereby achieving outstanding catalytic performance.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production by Seawater Electrolysis Coupling Sulfion Degradation</title>

         <dc:description>
Seawater electrolysis coupling sulfion degradation enables energy&#8208;saving and chlorine&#8208;free hydrogen production at low electricity expense while rapidly degrading sulfion pollutants to value&#8208;added sulfur for better sustainability.








Abstract
Electrolysis of costless and infinite seawater is a promising way toward grid&#8208;scale hydrogen production without causing freshwater stress. Practical potential of this technology, however, is hindered by low energy efficiency and anode corrosion by the detrimental chlorine chemistry in seawater in addition to unaffordable electricity expense. Herein, energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production is reported by chlorine&#8208;free seawater splitting coupling sulfion oxidation. It yields hydrogen at a low cell voltage of 0.97&#160;V, cutting the electricity consumption to 2.32&#160;kWh per m3 H2 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Compared to alkaline water electrolysis, the energy expense is primarily saved by 60% with 50% lower energy equivalent input. Benefiting from the ultralow cell voltage, the hazardous chlorine chemistry is fully avoided without anode corrosion regardless of Cl&#8722; crossover. Meanwhile, it also allows fast degradation of S2&#8722; pollutant from the water body to value&#8208;added sulfur with 80% efficiency, for further reducing hydrogen cost and protection of the ecosystem. Connecting such a hybrid seawater electrolyzer to a commercial solar cell can harvest the hydrogen from seawater with better sustainability. This work may offer new opportunities for low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from the unlimited ocean resources with environmental protection.

         <title>Distinct Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Dependent Behaviors for Single&#8208;Atom Palladium&#8208;On&#8208;Ceria Catalysts: Enhanced Stabilization and Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct behaviors of single Pd atoms dispersed on different crystal facets of CeO2 is investigated. In situ characterizations reveal that the oxygen defects on the different facets of CeO2 can affect the formation and stability of single atoms. Pd atoms dispersed on CeO2(100) exhibit higher sinter&#8208;resistant performance than those on CeO2(111), and a different selectivity in the N&#8208;alkylation reaction.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance, fully atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation industrial catalysts. However, it remains a great challenge to avoid the aggregation of isolated atoms into nanoparticles during the preparation and application of SACs. Here, the evolution of Pd species is investigated on different crystal facets of CeO2, and vastly different behaviors on the single&#8208;atomic dispersion of surface Pd atoms are surprisingly discovered. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;XPS (NAP&#8208;XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that, in a reducing atmosphere, more oxygen vacancies are generated on the (100) facet of CeO2, and Pd atoms can be trapped and thus feature atomic dispersion; by contrast, on the CeO2 (111) facet, Pd atoms will readily aggregate into clusters (Pdn). Furthermore, Pd1/CeO2(100) gives a high selectivity of 90.3% for the catalytic N&#8208;alkylation reaction, which is 2.8 times higher than that for Pdn/CeO2(111). This direct evidence demonstrates the crucial role of crystal&#8208;facet effects in the preparation of metal&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide SACs. This work thus opens an avenue for the rational design and targeted synthesis of ultrastable and sinter&#8208;resistant SACs.

         <title>The Molecular Ordering and Double&#8208;Channel Carrier Generation of Nonfullerene Photovoltaics within Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double carrier&#8208;generation channels are observed: one is the direct photogeneration in the nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) crystal region and the other is the traditional charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state channel in the mixing region. The channel from the NFA crystal provides a new avenue of zero energy loss carrier formation. The NFA molecular packing and geometry is key in influencing the photophysics of NFA solar cells.








Abstract
The success of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) solar cells lies in their unique physical properties beyond the extended absorption and suitable energy levels. The current study investigates the morphology and photophysical behavior of PBDB&#8208;T donor blending with ITIC, 4TIC, and 6TIC acceptors. Single&#8208;crystal study shows that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and side&#8208;chain interaction dictate molecular assembly, which can be carried to blended films, forming a multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology. Spontaneous carrier generation is seen in ITIC, 4TIC, and 6TIC neat films and their blended thin films using the PBDB&#8208;T donor, providing a new avenue of zero&#8208;energy&#8208;loss carrier formation. The molecular packing associated with specific contacts and geometry is key in influencing the photophysics, as demonstrated by the charge transfer and carrier lifetime results. The 2D layer of 6TIC facilitates the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;polaron conversion, and the largest photogenerated polaron yield is obtained. The new mechanism, together with the highly efficient blending region carrier generation, has the prospect of the fundamental advantage for NFA solar cells, from molecular assembly to thin&#8208;film morphology.

         <title>Piezoelectric Dynamics of Arterial Pulse for Wearable Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric dynamics of arterial pulse first elucidate the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and blood pressure waves. It is feasible to achieve wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring without motion artifacts, using a single piezoelectric sensor. This strategy may provide new insights on the development for wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectric arterial pulse wave dynamics are traditionally considered to be similar to those of typical blood pressure waves. However, achieving accurate continuous blood pressure wave monitoring based on arterial pulse waves remains challenging, because the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and their related blood pressure waves is unclear. To address this, the correlation between piezoelectric pulse waves and blood pressure waves is first elucidated via theoretical, simulation, and experimental analysis of these dynamics. Based on this correlation, the authors develop a wireless wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring system, with better portability than conventional systems that are based on the pulse wave velocity between multiple sensors. They explore the feasibility of achieving wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring without motion artifacts, using a single piezoelectric sensor. These findings eliminate the controversy over the arterial pulse wave piezoelectric response, and can potentially be used to develop a portable wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring device for the early prevention and daily control of hypertension.

         <title>Data Mining for Terahertz Generation Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work combines data, mined from a structural database of known materials,&#160;with first&#8208;principles calculations of molecular properties to predict high&#8208;performing organic nonlinear optical materials useful for the generation of terahertz frequency light. Four new terahertz generation crystals are discovered, synthesized, and tested, all of which show favorable terahertz generation properties.








Abstract
A data mining approach to discover and develop new organic nonlinear optical crystals that produce intense pulses of terahertz radiation is demonstrated. The Cambridge Structural Database is mined for non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials and these structural data are used in tandem with density functional theory calculations to predict new materials that efficiently generate terahertz radiation. This enables us to (in a relatively short time) discover, synthesize, and grow large, high&#8208;quality crystals of four promising materials and characterize them for intense terahertz generation. In a direct comparison to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic terahertz generation crystals, these new materials excel. The discovery and characterization of these novel terahertz generators validate the approach of combining data mining with density functional theory calculations to predict properties of high&#8208;performance organic materials, potentially for a host of exciting applications.

         <title>WET&#8208;Induced Layered Organohydrogel as Bioinspired &#8220;Sticky&#8722;Slippy Skin&#8221; for Robust Underwater Oil&#8208;Repellency</title>

         <dc:description>
A moss&#8208;inspired &#8220;sticky&#8722;slippy skin&#8221; composed of layered organohydrogel is reported, demonstrating an intriguing example of an easy&#8208;pasting anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling material through a one&#8208;step wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) process. Anti&#8208;swelling/anti&#8208;bending, acid/alkali resistance, environmental friendliness, adhesion simplicity, and substrate universality are integrated in one anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling material. The design strategy with integrated functions provides an important route for the development of multifunctional interfacial materials.








Abstract
Underwater superoleophobic surfaces featuring anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling properties are of great significance in widespread fields. However, their complicated engineering process and weak interfacial adhesion strength with underlying substrates severely hamper these ideal surfaces toward practical applications. Here, a moss&#8208;inspired sticky&#8722;slippy skin composed of layered organohydrogel is reported through a one&#8208;step wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy, which unprecedentedly integrates robust inherent adhesion with durable anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling properties. The sticky organogel layer can be simply attached to various substrates, from metals and plastics to glass, independent of any surface pretreatment. The slippy hydrogel layer enables stable underwater superoleophobicity and ultralow oil adhesion for diverse kinds of oils. The sticky&#8722;slippy skin features outstanding comprehensive properties including easy&#8208;pasting, anti&#8208;swelling/anti&#8208;bending, compatibility with commercial adhesives, acid/alkali resistance, environmental friendliness, and substrate universality. The design strategy with integrated functions provides a clue to accelerate the development of bioinspired multifunctional interfacial materials toward real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Anionic Lipid Nanoparticles Preferentially Deliver mRNA to the Hepatic Reticuloendothelial System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) capable of delivering therapeutic RNA to specific cells in the body are required if the immense potential of these plug&#8208;and&#8208;play technologies is to be realized. Using embryonic zebrafish as a predictive in vivo model and with a thorough understanding of the nano&#8211;biointeractions involved, LNPs capable of preferential messenger RNA delivery to hepatic reticuloendothelial system cells are rationally designed.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral technologies for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro, an approved LNP&#8208;based RNA interference therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, an LNP&#8208;based messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery platform is rationally designed to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice, and directly compared to LNP&#8211;mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro, RES&#8208;targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver&#8208;specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano&#8211;biointeractions involved.

         <title>Universal Solution Synthesis of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes Using Alkahest for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal solution synthesis of sulfide solid electrolytes is first demonstrated. The alkahest solvent, 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine&#8211;1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol, fully dissolves not only Li2S (or Na2S), P2S5, and LiCl, but also metal sulfides (e.g., GeS2 and SnS2), forming homogeneous solid electrolyte solutions. Solution&#8208;synthesized Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12 exhibit high ionic conductivities, and their applicability to all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
The wet&#8208;chemical processability of sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) provides intriguing opportunities for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Thus far, sulfide SEs are wet&#8208;prepared either from solid precursors suspended in solvents (suspension synthesis) or from homogeneous solutions using SEs (solution process) with restricted composition spaces. Here, a universal solution synthesis method for preparing sulfide SEs from precursors, not only Li2S, P2S5, LiCl, and Na2S, but also metal sulfides (e.g., GeS2 and SnS2), fully dissolved in an alkahest: a mixture solvent of 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol (EDT) (or ethanethiol). Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional dissolving power of EDA&#8211;EDT toward GeS2 is due to the nucleophilicity of the thiolate anions that is strong enough to dissociate the Ge&#63743;S bonds. Solution&#8208;synthesized Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12 exhibit high ionic conductivities (0.74, 1.3, and 0.10 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C, respectively), and their application for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is successfully demonstrated.

Here, a universal solution synthesis method for preparing sulfide SEs from precursors, not only Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, LiCl, and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, but also metal sulfides (e.g., GeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), fully dissolved in an alkahest: a mixture solvent of 1,2-ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) (or ethanethiol). Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional dissolving power of EDA&#8211;EDT toward GeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the nucleophilicity of the thiolate anions that is strong enough to dissociate the Ge&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S bonds. Solution-synthesized Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl, and Na&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit high ionic conductivities (0.74, 1.3, and 0.10 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30 &#176;C, respectively), and their application for all-solid-state batteries is successfully demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Dimensional Grain Boundary Stress Release for Flexible Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain boundary stress release strategy is proposed for high&#8208;stability flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics by the grain boundary penetration with borax 3D stretchable molecules. The full&#8208;dimensional grain boundary stress release enables the flexible perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination and an indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics are strong potential candidates to drive low&#8208;power off&#8208;grid electronics for indoor applications. Compared with rigid devices, flexible perovskite devices can provide a more suitable surface for indoor small electronic devices, enabling them have a broader indoor application prospect. However, the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite photovoltaics is an urgent issue solved. Herein, a kind of 3D crosslinking agent named borax is selected to carry out grain boundary penetration treatment on perovskite film to realize full&#8208;dimensional stress release. This strategy improves the mechanical and phase stabilities of perovskite films subjected to external forces or large temperature changes. The fabricated perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination, which is the highest one to date. The merit of low trap states under weak light makes the devices present a superior indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux (LED, 2956 K), which is currently the best flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaic device. This work provides a full&#8208;dimensional grain boundary stress release strategy for highly stable flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics.

         <title>A Transformable Amphiphilic and Block Polymer&#8722;Dendron Conjugate for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Retention with Cellular Homeostasis Perturbation via Membrane Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky transformation of a polymer&#8722;dendron conjugate can both meliorate its tumor tissue distribution and perturb cancer cellular homeostasis via the membrane flow process. This work presents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.








Abstract
Efficient penetration and retention of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues can be realized through rational design of drug delivery systems. Herein, a polymer&#8722;dendron conjugate, POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;p(GFLG&#8208;Dendron&#8208;Ppa) (GFLG&#8208;DP), is presented, which allows a cathepsin&#8208;B&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky structural transformation. The compositions and ratios are optimized through dissipative particle dynamics simulations. GFLG&#8208;DP displays tumor&#8208;specific transformation and the consequently released dendron&#8208;Ppa is found to effectively accumulate on the tumor cell membrane. The interaction between the dendron&#8208;Ppa and the tumor cell membrane results in intracellular and intercellular transport via membrane flow, thus achieving efficient deep penetration and prolonged retention of therapeutic agents in the solid tumor tissues. Meanwhile, the interaction of dendron&#8208;Ppa with the endoplasmic reticulum disrupts cell homeostasis, making tumor cells more vulnerable and susceptible to photodynamic therapy. This platform represents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.

         <title>In Situ Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Organoids and Extracellular Matrix Interactions via Phototransfer by Allyl Sulfide Exchange&#8208;Expansion Microscopy (PhASE&#8208;ExM)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for expansion microscopy is devised and applied to visualize organoids cultured in Matrigel and synthetic hydrogels. Several existing limitations associated with imaging of organoids are overcome, enabling super&#8208;resolution image acquisition, eliminating signal attenuation for whole organoid imaging, and facilitating capture and quantification of cell&#8211;matrix interactions of organoids.








Abstract
3D organoid models have recently seen a boom in popularity, as they can better recapitulate the complexity of multicellular organs compared to other in vitro culture systems. However, organoids are difficult to image because of the limited penetration depth of high&#8208;resolution microscopes and depth&#8208;dependent light attenuation, which can limit the understanding of signal transduction pathways and characterization of intimate cell&#8208;extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. To overcome these challenges, phototransfer by allyl sulfide exchange&#8208;expansion microscopy (PhASE&#8208;ExM) is developed, enabling optical clearance and super&#8208;resolution imaging of organoids and their ECM in 3D. PhASE&#8208;ExM uses hydrogels prepared via photoinitiated polymerization, which is advantageous as it decouples monomer diffusion into thick organoid cultures from the hydrogel fabrication. Apart from compatibility with organoids cultured in Matrigel, PhASE&#8208;ExM enables 3.25&#215; expansion and super&#8208;resolution imaging of organoids cultured in synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels crosslinked via allyl&#8208;sulfide groups (PEG&#8208;AlS) through simultaneous photopolymerization and radical&#8208;mediated chain&#8208;transfer reactions that complete in &lt;70 s. Further, PEG&#8208;AlS hydrogels can be in situ softened to promote organoid crypt formation, providing a super&#8208;resolution imaging platform both for pre&#8208; and post&#8208;differentiated organoids. Overall, PhASE&#8208;ExM is a useful tool to decipher organoid behavior by enabling sub&#8208;micrometer scale, 3D visualization of proteins and signal transduction pathways.

         <title>2D Functional Minerals as Sustainable Materials for Magneto&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of 2D natural minerals as sustainable materials for advanced optics is reported. The materials, possessing large size&#8208;to&#8208;thickness aspect ratio, sensitive magnetic response, and large optical bandgap, are massively produced by a green method in a recyclable fashion. These features allow fabrication of see&#8208;through color&#8208;tunable magneto&#8208;optical devices using a 2D mineral as the functional unit.








Abstract
Liquid crystal devices using organic molecules are nowadays widely used to modulate transmitted light, but this technology still suffers from relatively weak response, high cost, toxicity and environmental concerns, and cannot fully meet the demand of future sustainable society. Here, an alternative approach to color&#8208;tunable optical devices, which is based on sustainable inorganic liquid crystals derived from 2D mineral materials abundant in nature, is described. The prototypical 2D mineral of vermiculite is massively produced by a green method, possessing size&#8208;to&#8208;thickness aspect ratios of &gt;103,&#160;in&#8208;plane magnetization of &gt;10&#160;emu g&#8722;1, and an optical bandgap of &gt;3&#160;eV.&#160;These characteristics endow 2D vermiculite with sensitive magneto&#8208;birefringence response, been several orders of magnitude larger than organic counterparts, as well as capability of broad&#8208;spectrum modulation. The finding consequently permits the fabrication of various magnetochromic or mechanochromic devices with low or even zero&#8208;energy consumption during operation. This work creates opportunities for the application of sustainable materials in advanced optics.

         <title>The Development of Chiral Nanoparticles to Target NK Cells and CD8+ T Cells for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral nanoparticles (NPs) are developed as tumor immunoadjuvants for the treatment and prevention of cancer by stimulating both the innate and acquired immune responses. It is revealed that chiral NPs stimulate the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in natural killer (NK) cells, while the CD8+ T cells are activated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen cross presentation.








Abstract
The chirality of nanomaterials (nanoparticles, NPs) can influence their interaction with cells and biological systems. However, how chirality can exert impact on the immune response has yet to be investigated. Here, the immunological effect of chiral nanomaterials is investigated as a therapeutic and preventive option against tumors. Compared with achiral nanoparticles, chiral NPs with a g&#8208;factor of 0.44 are shown to enhance both innate and acquired immunity against tumor growth. It is also found that chiral NPs enhance the activation of CD8+ T and natural killer cells (CD69+ NK cells) by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, L&#8208;type NPs induce a 1.65&#8208;fold higher proportion of CD8+ T and CD69+ NK cells than D&#8208;type NPs. Next, the therapeutic and preventative effects of chiral NPs against tumors in a EG7.OVA tumor model are investigated. It is found that L&#8208;type NPs have a significant greater ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and prolong the survival time of model mice than D&#8208;type NPs. Mice treated with L&#8208;type NPs induce the activation of 84.98&#160;&#177; 6.63% CD8+ T cells and 33.62&#160;&#177; 3.41% of NK cells in tumor tissues; these are 1.62&#8208;fold and 1.39&#8208;fold higher than that seen in the mice treated with D&#8208;type NPs. Mechanistic studies reveal that chiral NPs exert mechanical force on bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and stimulate the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in NK cells. Synergistically, the CD8+ T cells are stimulated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen cross presentation. The force of interaction between L&#8208;type NPs and cells is higher than that for D&#8208;NPs, thus further promoting the activation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells and their infiltration into tumor tissue. These findings open up a new avenue for chiral nanomaterials to act as immunoadjuvants for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

         <title>Hydrogel Transformed from Nanoparticles for Prevention of Tissue Injury and Treatment of Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel&#8208;transformable nanoparticles responsive to physiologically/pathologically acidic microenvironments are engineered by self&#8208;assembly of a pH&#8208;sensitive multivalent host material and a multivalent guest polymer. Driven by protons, the pH&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest nanoparticles can transform into hydrogel. The transformable nanoparticles protect mice from induced gastric injury by in situ forming a hydrogel barrier. These nanoparticles can serve as transformable nanovehicles for treating inflammatory diseases.








Abstract
Functional hydrogels responsive to physiological and pathological signals have extensive biomedical applications owing to their multiple advanced attributes. Herein, engineering of functional hydrogels is reported via transformable nanoparticles in response to the physiologically and pathologically acidic microenvironment. These nanoparticles are assembled by a multivalent hydrophobic, pH&#8208;responsive cyclodextrin host material and a multivalent hydrophilic guest macromolecule. Driven by protons, the pH&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest nanoparticles can be transformed into hydrogel, resulting from proton&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of the host material, generation of a hydrophilic multivalent host compound, and simultaneously enhanced inclusion interactions between host and guest molecules. By in situ forming a hydrogel barrier, the orally delivered transformable nanoparticles protect mice from ethanol&#8208; or drug&#8208;induced gastric injury. In addition, this type of nanoparticles can serve as responsive and transformable nanovehicles for therapeutic agents to achieve triggerable and sustained drug delivery, thereby effectively treating typical inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis and arthritis in rats. With combined advantages of nanoparticles and hydrogels, together with their good in vivo safety, the engineered transformable nanoparticles hold great promise in tissue injury protection and site&#8208;specific/local delivery of molecular and cellular therapeutic agents.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched Nickel Phosphide for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic vacancy strategy is proposed for designing nickel&#8208;phosphide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR). The fabricated Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in 0.1&#160;m KOH and high Faradaic efficiency in all pH solutions.&#160;Computational analysis and operando characterizations suggest that the oxygen adsorption on Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi prefers to via an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; configuration, which facilitates the formation of the *OOH intermediate during the 2e ORR process.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR) pathway is becoming increasingly important due to the green production process. Here, cationic vacancies on nickel phosphide, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to regulate the catalyst's physicochemical properties, are introduced for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis. The as&#8208;fabricated Ni cationic vacancies (VNi)&#8208;enriched Ni2&#8722;xP&#8208;VNi electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable 2e ORR performance with H2O2 molar fraction of &gt;95% and Faradaic efficiencies of &gt;90% in all pH conditions under a wide range of applied potentials. Impressively, the as&#8208;created VNi possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 50 h, suppassing all the recently reported catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (SR&#8208;FTIR) combining theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the VNi&#8208;induced geometric and electronic structural optimization, thus promoting oxygen adsorption to the 2e ORR favored &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; configuration. It is believed that the demonstrated cation vacancy engineering is an effective strategy toward creating active heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision.

         <title>A Van der Waals Interface Hosting Two Groups of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple groups of magnetic skyrmions add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion&#8208;based ultrahigh&#8208;density memory devices. Vertical imprinting of magnetic skyrmions in 2D layered magnetic heterostructures are reported. Two sets of topological Hall effects are observed at low temperatures and these two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy.








Abstract
Multiple magnetic skyrmion phases add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion&#8208;based ultrahigh&#8208;density spin memory devices. Extending the field to 2D van der Waals magnets is a rewarding challenge, where the realizable degree of freedoms (e.g., thickness, twist angle, and electrical gating) and high skyrmion density result in intriguing new properties and enhanced functionality. In this work, a van der Waals interface, formed by two 2D ferromagnets Cr2Ge2Te6 and Fe3GeTe2 with a Curie temperature of &#8776;65 and &#8776;205 K, respectively, hosting two groups of magnetic skyrmions, is reported. Two sets of topological Hall effect signals are observed below 6s0 K when Cr2Ge2Te6 is magnetically ordered. These two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy, and supported by micromagnetic simulations. Interestingly, the magnetic skyrmions persist in the heterostructure with zero applied magnetic field. The results are promising for the realization of skyrmionic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures hosting multiple skyrmion&#160;phases.

These two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy, and supported by micromagnetic simulations. Interestingly, the magnetic skyrmions persist in the heterostructure with zero applied magnetic field. The results are promising for the realization of skyrmionic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures hosting multiple skyrmion&#160;phases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Functionality&#8208;Multiplexing Capability in Metasurface Design Based on Statistical Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning models are embedded in both gradient&#8208;based and nongradient optimization loops to automatically design multifunctional metasurfaces and push the design capacity even when the ideal optical response is not achievable by certain meta&#8208;atoms. Metasurface focusing lenses and holograms are experimentally demonstrated, with up to eight controllable responses subjected to different combinations of incident frequencies and polarizations.








Abstract
As 2D metamaterials, metasurfaces provide an unprecedented means to manipulate light with the ability to multiplex different functionalities in a single planar device. Currently, most pursuits of multifunctional metasurfaces resort to empirically accommodating more functionalities at the cost of increasing structural complexity, with little effort to investigate the intrinsic restrictions of given meta&#8208;atoms and thus the ultimate limits in the design. In this work, it is proposed to embed machine&#8208;learning models in both gradient&#8208;based and nongradient optimization loops for the automatic implementation of multifunctional metasurfaces. Fundamentally different from the traditional two&#8208;step approach that separates phase retrieval and meta&#8208;atom structural design, the proposed end&#8208;to&#8208;end framework facilitates full exploitation of the prescribed design space and pushes the multifunctional design capacity to its physical limit. With a single&#8208;layer structure that can be readily fabricated, metasurface focusing lenses and holograms are experimentally demonstrated in the near&#8208;infrared region. They show up to eight controllable responses subjected to different combinations of working frequencies and linear polarization states, which are unachievable by the conventional physics&#8208;guided approaches. These results manifest the superior capability of the data&#8208;driven scheme for photonic design, and will accelerate the development of complex devices and systems for optical display, communication, and computing.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Microsized Si Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Insights into the Polymer Configuration Conversion Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(hexaazatrinaphthalene) (PHATN) coating is constructed at the surface of a Si/C anode to design a high&#8208;performance microsized Si composite anode for Li&#8208;ion batteries. The Li&#8208;rich PHATN coating can form during the initial lithiation, promote interfacial diffusion kinetics for Li&#8208;ions, generate free space to accommodate the volume expansion of microsized Si, and mitigate possible side reactions.








Abstract
Microsized silicon particles are desirable Si anodes because of their low price and abundant sources. However, it is challenging to achieve stable electrochemical performances using a traditional microsized silicon anode due to the poor electrical conductivity, serious volume expansion, and unstable solid electrolyte interface. Herein, a composite microsized Si anode is designed and synthesized by constructing a unique polymer, poly(hexaazatrinaphthalene) (PHATN), at a Si/C surface (PCSi). The Li+ transport mechanism of the PCSi is elucidated by using in situ characterization and theoretical simulation. During the lithiation of the PCSi anode, &#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743; groups with high electron density in the PHATN first coordinate Li+ to form &#63743;C&#63743;N&#63743;Li bonds on both sides of the PHATN molecule plane. Consequently, the original benzene rings in the PHATN become active centers to accept lithium and form stable Li&#8208;rich PHATN coatings. PHATN molecules expand due to the change of molecular configuration during the consecutive lithiation process, which provides controllable space for the volume expansion of the Si particles. The PCSi composite anode exhibits a specific capacity of 1129.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, and exhibits compelling rate performance, maintaining 417.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 16.5 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>A Fibrin Site&#8208;Specific Nanoprobe for Imaging Fibrin&#8208;Rich Thrombi and Preventing Thrombus Formation in Venous Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoprobe loaded with Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Glu&#8722;Lys&#8722;Ala, Fe3O4, NIR fluorochrome, and Ketotifen fumarate is prepared, which can target fibrin&#8208;rich venous thrombi and assemble in it to help with the detection of fibrin&#8208;rich venous thromboembolism precisely through imaging. In addition, by inhabiting mast cell degranulation, this can prevent thrombosis without the risk of excessive bleeding.








Abstract
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a prevalent public health issue worldwide. Before treatment, spatiotemporally accurate thrombus detection is essential. However, with the currently available imaging technologies, this is challenging. Herein, the development of a novel fibrin&#8208;specific nanoprobe (NP) based on the conjugation of poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with the pentapeptide Cys&#8722;Arg&#8722;Glu&#8722;Lys&#8722;Ala (CREKA) for selective and semiquantitative imaging in vivo is presented. By integrating Fe3O4 and NIR fluorochrome (IR780), the NP can function as a highly sensitive sensor for the direct analysis of thrombi in vivo. The fibrin&#8208;specific NP distinguishes fibrin&#8208;rich thrombi from collagen&#8208;rich or erythrocyte&#8208;rich thrombi, which can be beneficial for future individually tailored therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, loading NPs with the ketotifen fumarate results in mast cell degranulation inhibition, and hence, NPs can prevent thrombosis without the risk of excessive bleeding. Thus, the use of fibrin&#8208;specific NPs may serve as a safe alternative approach for the detection and prevention of VTEs in susceptible populations in the future.

         <title>A Wearable All&#8208;Gel Multimodal Cutaneous Sensor Enabling Simultaneous Single&#8208;Site Monitoring of Cardiac&#8208;Related Biophysical Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acquisition of biophysical signals is demonstrated at one point on the body using a wearable all&#8208;gel&#8208;integrated multimodal sensor. The wearable all&#8208;gel multimodal sensor is easily attached to the wrist and simultaneously gathers blood pressure, electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and mechanomyogram signals related to cardiac and muscle health.








Abstract
The human cutaneous sensory organ is a highly evolved biosensor that is efficient, sensitive, selective, and adaptable. Recently, with the development of various materials and structures inspired by sensory organs, artificial cutaneous sensors have been widely studied. In this study, the acquisition of biophysical signals is demonstrated at one point on the body using a wearable all&#8208;gel&#8208;integrated multimodal sensor composed of four element sensors, inspired by the slow/rapid adapting functions of the skin sensory receptors. The gel&#8208;type sensors ensure flexibility, compactness, portability, adherence, and integrity. The wearable all&#8208;gel multimodal sensor is easily attached to the wrist and simultaneously gathers blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), and mechanomyogram (MMG) signals related to cardiac and muscle health. Human activity causes muscle contraction, which affects blood flow; therefore, the relationship between the muscle and heart is crucial for screening and predicting heart health. Cardiac health is monitored by obtaining the two types of phase time differences (i.e., &#916;tbe: BP and ECG, &#916;tem: ECG and MMG) generated during muscle movement. The suggested multimodal sensor has potential applicability in monitoring biophysical conditions and diagnosing cardiac&#8208;related health problems.

         <title>Soft Actuators Made of Discrete Grains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change actuators have been shown to achieve useful volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular systems are able to flow, jam, and exhibit unique bulk properties. In this work, granular actuators are introduced, where each grain is a phase&#8208;change actuator. Grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, in agglomerates for macro&#8208;actuation, can flow for freeform actuator printability, and exhibit compatibility with various granular assembly designs.








Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated the potential of actuators consisting of bulk elastomers with phase&#8208;changing inclusions for generating high forces and large volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular assemblies have been shown to enable tunable properties via different packings, dynamic moduli via jamming, and compatibility with various printing methods via suspension in carrier fluids. Herein, granular actuators are introduced, which represent a new class of soft actuators made of discrete grains. The soft grains consist of a hyperelastic shell and multiple solvent cores. Upon heating, the encapsulated solvent cores undergo liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase change, inducing rapid and strong volumetric expansion of the hyperelastic shell up to 700%. The grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, or in granular agglomerates for meso&#8208; and macroscale actuation, demonstrating the scalability of the granular actuators. Furthermore, the active grains can be suspended in a carrier resin or solvent to enable printable soft actuators via established granular material processing techniques. By combining the advantages of phase&#8208;change soft actuation and granularity, this work presents the opportunity to realize soft actuators with tunable bulk properties, compatibility with self&#8208;assembly techniques, and on&#8208;demand reconfigurability.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Stretchable and Fast Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Hydrogel in Cryogenic Environments for Artificial Nerve Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors propose an ionic hydrogel with outstanding self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and conductivity in cryogenic environments. The artificial nerve fiber (SSANF) is fabricated based on the ionic hydrogel through bionic structural design. The SSANF enables stable information and energy transmission when connected to the biomimetic intelligent robot, even under big deformation and &#8722;78.5&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials behave with irreplaceable advantages in biomimetic intelligent robots (BIR) for avoiding or reducing safety hazards and economic losses from accidental damage during service. However, the self&#8208;healing ability is unreservedly lost and even becomes rigid and fragile in the cryogenic environment where BIR are precisely needed. Here, the authors report a versatile ionic hydrogel with fast self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and stable conductivity, even at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. The hydrogel is systematically optimized to improve a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network nanostructure, coordinated achieving a quick self&#8208;healing ability within 10&#160;min, large deformation tolerance of over 7000%, superior conductivity of 11.76 S cm&#8722;1 and anti&#8208;freezing ability, which is difficult to obtain simultaneously. Such a hydrogel provides new opportunities for artificial electronic devices in harsh environments. As a prospective application, they fabricate an artificial nerve fiber by mimicking the structure and functions of the myelinated axon, exhibiting the property of fast and potential&#8208;gated signal transmission. This artificial nerve fiber is integrated into a robot for demonstrating a real&#8208;time high fidelity and high throughput information interaction under big deformation and cryogenic temperature. The hydrogel and bionic device will bring pioneering functions for robots and open a broad application scenario in extreme conditions.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area and Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Blade&#8208;Coating</title>

Blade&#8208;coating supersaturated CsPb(Br1&#8722;xClx)3 perovskite precursor leads to uniform films with small grains and strong photoluminescence emission. After incorporating the films as an emissive layer in the device, efficient sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with a peak external quantum efficiency reaching 10.3% can be a acheived, along with large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue LEDs up to 28 cm2 with uniform emission.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area fabrication of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) through mass&#8208;production techniques has attracted growing attention due to their potential applications in lighting. Several breakthroughs are made for red/infrared and green emissions. Nevertheless, large&#8208;area blue/sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs, a requisite color for lighting, have not yet been reported. Here, efficient and large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs are fabricated through blade&#8208;coating supersaturated precursors. The volume ratio of dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethylformamide is tuned to obtain a supersaturated CsPb(Br0.84Cl0.16)3 solution. Blade&#8208;coating this supersaturated precursor results in nucleation in the solution phase with much higher nucleation sites, and a faster crystallization rate. The uniform films formed by this approach exhibit smaller grain size, lower trap density, and higher radiative recombination rate. The peak external quantum efficiency of the blade&#8208;coated PeLEDs reaches 10.3% with sky&#8208;blue emission (489&#160;nm). Benefitting from the robustness of this blade&#8208;coating technique, large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs with a device area of 28 cm2 are also achieved with uniform emission. This work represents a significant step forward toward flat&#8208;panel lighting and full&#8208;color display for the PeLEDs.

         <title>Manipulating Crystallization Kinetics in High&#8208;Performance Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Cells via Cosolvent&#8208;Assisted Phase Transition</title>

         <dc:description>
An ethyl alcohol cosolvent strategy is applied for room&#8208;temperature blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells and minimodules. This approach delicately manipulates the balance between nucleation and crystal growth rate to guarantee high&#8208;quality perovskite films, thus achieving remarkable device performance both in small&#8208;area cells and minimodules with excellent VOC deficit and suppressed nonradiative recombination loss.








Abstract
Manipulating the perovskite solidification process, including nucleation and crystal growth, plays a critical role in controlling film morphology and thus affects the resultant device performance. In this work, a facile and effective ethyl alcohol (EtOH) cosolvent strategy is demonstrated with the incorporation of EtOH into perovskite ink for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules. Systematic real&#8208;time perovskite crystallization studies uncover the delicate perovskite structural evolutions and phase&#8208;transition pathway. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations both demonstrate that EtOH in the mixed&#8208;solvent system significantly promotes the formation of an FA&#8208;based precursor solvate (FA2PbBr4&#183;DMSO) during the trace&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted transition process, which finely regulates the balance between nucleation and crystal growth to guarantee high&#8208;quality perovskite films. This strategy efficiently suppresses nonradiative recombination and improves efficiencies in both 1.54 (23.19%) and 1.60&#160;eV (22.51%) perovskite systems, which represents one of the highest records for blade&#8208;coated PSCs in both small&#8208;area devices and minimodules. An excellent VOC deficit as low as 335&#160;mV in the 1.54&#160;eV perovskite system, coincident with the measured nonradiative recombination loss of only 77&#160;mV, is achieved. More importantly, significantly enhanced device stability is another signature of this approach.

         <title>Mulberry&#8208;Leaves&#8208;Derived Red&#8208;Emissive Carbon Dots for Feeding Silkworms to Produce Brightly Fluorescent Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots made from mulberry leaves have a strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence with an absolute quantum yield of 73% and a full width at half maximum of 20 nm, and they exhibit excellent biocompatibility and biosafety for feeding silkworms. These silkworms grow healthily, cocoon, become moths, mate, lay eggs, and reproduce normally. Both the silkworms and the cocoons show bright red fluorescence.








Abstract
Fluorescent silk has promising applications in dazzling textiles, biological engineering, and medical products, but the natural Bombyx mori silk has almost no fluorescence. Here carbon dots (CDs) made from mulberry leaves are reported, which have a strong near&#8208;infrared fluorescence with absolute quantum yield of 73% and a full width at half maximum of 20&#160;nm. After feeding with such CDs, silkworms exhibit bright red fluorescence, grow healthily, cocoon normally, and turn to moths finally. The cocoons are pink in daylight and show bright red fluorescence under ultraviolet light. After breaking out of such cocoons, the red&#8208;emissive moths can mate and lay fluorescent eggs which would hatch normally. The growth cycle of the second generation of the test silkworm is the same as that of the control group, which means such CDs have excellent biocompatiblility. Dissection and analyses on both the test silkworms and cocoons disclose the metabolic route of the CDs, that is, the fluorescent CDs are absorbed by silkworms from alimentary canals, then transferred to silk glands, and finally to cocoons, while those unabsorbed CDs are excreted with the feces. All experimental results confirm the excellent biocompatibility and fluorescence stability of such CDs.

         <title>A Library of ROS&#8208;Catalytic Metalloenzyme Mimics with Atomic Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;catalytic metalloenzyme mimics with 20 different types of atomic metal centers is synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and ROS products. These prepared biocatalysts not only show remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also clearly reveal that the catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of metal centers.








Abstract
Metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated centers supported by carbonaceous substrates have emerged as promising artificial metalloenzymes (AMEs) to mimic the biocatalytic effects of their natural counterparts. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined AMEs that contain different atomic metal&#63743;N centers but present similar physicochemical and coordination structures remains a substantial challenge. Here, 20 different types of AMEs with similar geometries and well&#8208;defined atomic metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated centers are synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products. Their oxidase (OXD)&#8208;, peroxidase (POD)&#8208;, and halogen peroxidase (HPO)&#8208;mimetic catalytic behaviors are systematically explored. The Fe&#8208;AME shows the highest OXD&#8208; and HPO&#8208;mimetic activities compared to the other AMEs due to its high vmax (0.927&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;6 m s&#8722;1) and low Km (1.070&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m), while the Cu&#8208;AME displays the best POD&#8208;like performance. Furthermore, theoretical calculation reveals that the ROS&#8208;catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of the metal centers. Benefiting from its facile adsorption of H2O2 molecule and lower energy barrier to generating &#8226;O2&#8722;, the Fe&#8208;AME displays higher ROS&#8208;catalytic performances than the Mn&#8208;AME. The engineered AMEs show not only remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also provide new guidance toward developing metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated biocatalysts for broad application fields.

         <title>Synergy between Palladium Single Atoms and Nanoparticles via Hydrogen Spillover for Enhancing CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Pd1 and PdNPs form a functional catalyst for enhancing photocatalytic CO2 methanation. Pd1 activate CO2, while PdNPs boost H2O dissociation. The H* produced by PdNPs migrates to Pd1 via hydrogen spillover to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer processes. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs stabilize intermediates, such as *CHO. Therefore, efficient photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 is highly favored.








Abstract
Selective photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon&#8208;neutral fuels such as methane (CH4) is extremely desirable but remains a challenge since sluggish multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer and various C1 intermediates are involved. Herein, a synergistic function between single Pd atoms (Pd1) and Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) for photocatalytic CO2 methanation is presented. The catalyst achieves a high selectivity of 97.8% for CH4 production with a yield of 20.3&#160;&#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. Mechanistic studies revealed that Pd1 sites activated CO2, while PdNPs sites boosted water (H2O) dissociation for increased H* coverage. The H* produced by PdNPs migrate to the Pd1 sites to promote multiple proton&#8211;electron coupling transfer via hydrogen spillover. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs effectively stabilized intermediates such as *CHO, thereby favoring the pathway for CH4 production. This work provides a new perspective into the development of selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion through the artful design of synergistic catalytic sites.

         <title>An Engineered Protein&#8722;Au Bioplaster for Efficient Skin Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of engineered protein&#8722;Au bioplaster with outstanding photothermal effect is developed. In this system, the adhesion performance can be enhanced significantly as prolonging irradiation time to achieve stable adhesion on skin surface. This further promotes the heat penetration into the skin tumor site for non&#8208;invasive thermal eradication of melanoma.








Abstract
Melanoma is the most lethal malignancy in skin cancer and may occur at any site and express melanocytes. Due to malignant melanoma's invasion and migration nature, conventional therapies make it challenging to remove the whole tumor tissue while undertaking the high risks of tumor recurrence. Regarding the emerging targeted therapies and immunotherapy, drug resistance and low immunotherapeutic activity remain significant challenges. It is thus becoming urgently important to develop alternative strategies for melanoma therapy. Herein, a novel bifunctional protein&#8208;based photothermal bioplaster (PPTB) is developed for non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy and skin tissue regeneration. The complexation of adhesive protein and gold nanorods (GNRs) endow the obtained PPTB with good biocompatibility, controllable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated adhesion performance, and high photothermal performance. Therefore, the PPTB bioagent facilitates skin adhesion and effectively transfers heat from skin to tumor. This behavior endows PPTB capability to eradicate skin tumors conveniently. Thus, the assembly strategy enables this hybrid bioplaster to hold great potential for skin&#8208;related tumor treatment.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D Electronic Transport in a 2D Magnetic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a 2D semiconductor of interest for its magnetic properties. Temperature&#8208; and gate&#8208;dependent transport exhibit an extreme anisotropy (ca. 102 to 105)&#8212;stronger than in any other 2D semiconductor&#8212;and the photocurrent shows clear signatures of 1D behavior. This work shows that CrSBr is a quasi&#8208;1D electronic system, a unique characteristic in the panorama of known 2D semiconductors.








Abstract
Electronic transport through exfoliated multilayers of CrSBr, a 2D semiconductor of interest because of its magnetic properties, is investigated. An extremely pronounced anisotropy manifesting itself in qualitative and quantitative differences of all quantities measured along the in&#8208;plane a and b crystallographic directions is found. In particular, a qualitatively different dependence of the conductivities &#963;a and &#963;b on temperature and gate voltage, accompanied by orders of magnitude differences in their values (&#963;b/&#963;a&#160;&#8776; 3 &#215; 102&#160;to 105 at low temperature and negative gate voltage) are observed, together with a different behavior of the longitudinal magnetoresistance in the two directions and the complete absence of the Hall effect in transverse resistance measurements. These observations appear not to be compatible with a description in terms of conventional band transport of a 2D doped semiconductor. The observed phenomenology&#8212;and unambiguous signatures of a 1D van Hove singularity detected in energy&#8208;resolved photocurrent measurements&#8212;indicate that electronic transport through CrSBr multilayers is better interpreted by considering the system as formed by weakly and incoherently coupled 1D wires, than by conventional 2D band transport. It is concluded that CrSBr is the first 2D semiconductor to show distinctly quasi&#8208;1D electronic transport properties.

&lt;p&gt;CrSBr is a 2D semiconductor of interest for its magnetic properties. Temperature- and gate-dependent transport exhibit an extreme anisotropy (ca. 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8212;stronger than in any other 2D semiconductor&#8212;and the photocurrent shows clear signatures of 1D behavior.

Sustainable Optics
Ores are everywhere on our earth and other planets, and many of them possess layered structures. In article 2110464, Baofu Ding, Bilu Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop a seawater&#8208;assisted green method to produce 2D minerals in large quantities from bulky ores. These 2D minerals are used as inorganic liquid crystals for color optics. This work creates novel opportunities of using abundant naturally minerals for advanced technological applications.

Artificial Nerve Fibers
Artificial nerve fibers with self&#8208;healing ability and stretchability in a cryogenic environment help construct fast and complex information interaction networks for bionic intelligent robots, as described by Zhou Li and co&#8208;workers in article number 2105416. Once accidental mechanical damage to the robot occurs, the artificial nerve fibers can autonomously recover their function and appearance in a short time. This is essential for robots to complete tasks in dynamic extreme environments.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction
In article number 2110552, Aleksandar Staykov, Miho Yamauchi, and co&#8208;workers report that Au&#8208;cluster&#8208;loaded unillamellar hydroxide catalysts drastically enhance the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electronic sates of a catalytic site can be finely tuned by the formation of a Au&#8208;cluster&#8211;hydroxide interface for the OER. Theoretical and advanced spectroscopic study advocates the cooperative mechanism of charge transfer and direct O&#8211;O coupling evoked at the interface.

         <title>2D Materials for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces current progress of 2D materials (2DM) application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) to deal with the limitation of ASSLBs. 2DMs are applied in the different composition of the ASSLBs to enhance its performance. By summarizing the properties, synthesis, application, and characterization, this review points out the future development direction of 2DMs application in ASSLBs.








Abstract
Although one of the most mature battery technologies, lithium&#8208;ion batteries still have many aspects that have not reached the desired requirements, such as energy density, current density, safety, environmental compatibility, and price. To solve these problems, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) based on lithium metal anodes with high energy density and safety have been proposed and become a research hotpot in recent years. Due to the advanced electrochemical properties of 2D materials (2DM), they have been applied to mitigate some of the current problems of ASSLBs, such as high interface impedance and low electrolyte ionic conductivity. In this work, the background and fabrication method of 2DMs are reviewed initially. The improvement strategies of 2DMs are categorized based on their application in the three main components of ASSLBs: The anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Finally, to elucidate the mechanisms of 2DMs in ASSLBs, the role of in situ characterization, synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, and other advanced characterization are discussed.

         <title>Flexible Electronics and Devices as Human&#8211;Machine Interfaces for Medical Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electronics and devices could potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics. Herein, the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces used in prosthetic and rehabilitation robots are summarized in five primary areas: sensing, recording, communication, actuation, and stimulation. The current challenges and outlook of these technologies in medical robotics are discussed.








Abstract
Medical robots are invaluable players in non&#8208;pharmaceutical treatment of disabilities. Particularly, using prosthetic and rehabilitation devices with human&#8211;machine interfaces can greatly improve the quality of life for impaired patients. In recent years, flexible electronic interfaces and soft robotics have attracted tremendous attention in this field due to their high biocompatibility, functionality, conformability, and low&#8208;cost. Flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces on soft robotics will make a promising alternative to conventional rigid devices, which can potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics in terms of rehabilitation feedback and user experience. In this review, the fundamental components of the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8208;machine interfaces are summarized by recent and renowned applications in five primary areas: physical and chemical sensing, physiological recording, information processing and communication, soft robotic actuation, and feedback stimulation. This review further concludes by discussing the outlook and current challenges of these technologies as a human&#8211;machine interface in medical robotics.

         <title>Future&#8208;Oriented Advanced Diarylethene Photoswitches: From Molecular Design to Spontaneous Assembly Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diarylethenes are a new type of photochromic molecules with attractive photofatigue resistance and reversibility. The result of a lot of effort has led to the rapid development of photoresponsive diarylethylenes for smart material applications. The recent advances in the design and assembly of diarylethylene as a multifunctional photoresponsive trigger unit are reviewed.








Abstract
Diarylethene (DAE) photoswitch is a new and promising family of photochromic molecules and has shown superior performance as a smart trigger in stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. During the past few decades, the DAE family has achieved a leap from simple molecules to functional molecules and developed toward validity as a universal switching building block. In recent years, the introduction of DAE into an assembly system has been an attractive strategy that enables the photochromic behavior of the building blocks to be manifested at the level of the entire system, beyond the DAE unit itself. This assembly&#8208;based strategy will bring many unexpected results that promote the design and manufacture of a new generation of advanced materials. Here, recent advances in the design and fabrication of diarylethene as a trigger in materials science, chemistry, and biomedicine are reviewed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 16, April 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve global mission of carbon neutrality, green hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting technology has attracted much attention. Developing efficient electrocatalysts working under industrially required current densities is essential for wide implementation of this technology. This review summarizes progress in design of high&#8208;current&#8208;density catalysts, key aspects determining high&#8208;current&#8208;density performance, multiscale catalyst design strategy, and future directions in this emerging field.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting technology for producing &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is important for the global mission of carbon neutrality. Electrocatalysts with decent performance at high current densities play a central role in the industrial implementation of this technology. This field has advanced immensely in recent years, as witnessed by many types of catalysts designed and synthesized toward industriallyrelevant current densities (&gt;200&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). By discussing recent advances in this field, several key aspects are summarized that affect the catalytic performance for high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysis, including dimensionality of catalysts, surface chemistry, electron transport path, morphology, and catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interplay. The multiscale design strategy that considers these aspects comprehensively for developing high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysts are highlighted. The perspectives on the future directions in this emerging field are also put forward.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride on Graphene with Giant Bandgap Renormalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable synthesis of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has remained a daunting challenge. An hBN/graphene&#8208;interface&#8208;mediated growth concept to enable scalable epitaxy of unidirectional high&#8208;quality monolayer hBN on graphene substrates is proposed and demonstrated. A uniform moir&#233; superlattice and robust deep&#8208;ultraviolet excitonic emission (around 6.12 eV) are achieved in such a monolayer hBN/graphene van der Waals heterostructure.








Abstract
Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been widely considered a fundamental building block for 2D heterostructures and devices.

     alt="Scalable Synthesis of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride on Graphene with Giant Bandgap Renormalization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controllable synthesis of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has remained a daunting challenge. An hBN/graphene-interface-mediated growth concept to enable scalable epitaxy of unidirectional high-quality monolayer hBN on graphene substrates is proposed and demonstrated. A uniform moir&#233; superlattice and robust deep-ultraviolet excitonic emission (around 6.12 eV) are achieved in such a monolayer hBN/graphene van der Waals heterostructure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been widely considered a fundamental building block for 2D heterostructures and devices. However, the controlled and scalable synthesis of hBN and its 2D heterostructures has remained a daunting challenge. Here, an hBN/graphene (hBN/G) interface-mediated growth process for the controlled synthesis of high-quality monolayer hBN is proposed and further demonstrated. It is discovered that the in-plane hBN/G interface can be precisely controlled, enabling the scalable epitaxy of unidirectional monolayer hBN on graphene, which exhibits a uniform moir&#233; superlattice consistent with single-domain hBN, aligned to the underlying graphene lattice. Furthermore, it is identified that the deep-ultraviolet emission at 6.12&#160;eV stems from the 1s-exciton state of monolayer hBN with a giant renormalized direct bandgap on graphene. This work provides a viable path for the controlled synthesis of ultraclean, wafer-scale, atomically ordered 2D quantum materials, as well as the fabrication of 2D quantum electronic and optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stretchable Redox&#8208;active Semiconducting Polymers for High&#8208;performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>

Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is an emerging device platform for next&#8208;generation bioelectronics owing to its uniquely high amplification and sensitivity to biological signals. For achieving seamless tissue&#8208;electronics interfaces for accurate signal acquisition, skin&#8208;like softness and stretchability are essential requirements, which have not yet been imparted onto high&#8208;performance OECTs, largely due to the lack of stretchable redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymers. Here, we report a stretchable semiconductor for OECT devices, namely poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5)yl thiophene) (p(g2T&#8208;T)), which gives exceptional stretchability over 200% strain and 5000 repeated stretching cycles, together with the OECT performance on par with the state of the art. Validated by the systematic characterizations and the comparisons of different polymers, the key design features of this polymer that enable the combination of high stretchability and high OECT performance are non&#8208;linear backbone architecture, moderate side&#8208;chain density, and sufficiently high molecular weight. Using this highly stretchable polymer semiconductor, we fabricated an intrinsically stretchable OECT with the high normalized transconductance (&#8764;223 S cm&#8722;1) and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram (ECG) recording that combines built&#8208;in amplification and unprecedented skin conformability.

         <title>Real&#8208;space crystal structure analysis by low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series TEM imaging of organic materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution</title>

Abstract
Structural analysis of beam&#8208;sensitive materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represents a significant challenge, as high resolution TEM (HRTEM) requires high electron doses that limits its applicability to stable inorganic materials. Beam sensitive materials, such as organic crystals (of key importance in pharmaceuticals, organic electronics, and biology) must be imaged under low dose conditions, leading to problematic contrast interpretation and the loss of fine structural details. Here, we describe HRTEM imaging of organic crystalline materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution of up to 1.6 &#197; that enabled the real&#8208;space study of crystal structures, as well as observation of co&#8208;existing polymorphs, crystal defects, and atoms. This is made possible by a low&#8208;dose focal series reconstruction (LD&#8208;FSR) methodology developed by us, which provides HRTEM images where contrast reflects true object structure and can be performed on contemporary cryo&#8208;EM instruments available to many research institutions. We imaged copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), perchlorinated analogue of CuPc, and indigo crystalline films. In the case of indigo crystals, we were able to observe co&#8208;existing polymorphs and individual atoms (carbonyl oxygen). In the case of CuPc, we observed several polymorphs, including a new one, for which we elucidated the crystal structure based on direct in&#8208;focus imaging, accomplishing real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation. Direct structural analysis of beam sensitive materials with high resolution that enables the real&#8208;space study of crystals can be transformative for structural science of organic materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Active Sensing based on Triboelectric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The demand of portable and wearable chemical or biosensors and their expeditious development in the recent years has created a scientific challenge in terms of their continuous powering. As a result, the mechanical energy harvesters such as piezoelectric and triboelectric generator (TEG) have been explored recently either as sensors or harvesters to store charge in small, but long&#8208;life, energy storage devices to power the sensors. The use of energy harvesters as sensor is particularly interesting as with such multifunctional operations it is possible to reduce the number devices needed in a system, which also helps overcome the integration complexities. In this regard, TEGs are promising, particularly for energy autonomous chemical and biological sensors, as they can be developed with wide variety of materials and their mechanical energy to electricity conversion can be modulated by various analytes. This review focusses on this interesting dimension of TEGs and presents various self&#8208;powered active chemical and biological sensors. A brief discussion about the development of TEG based physical, magnetic and optical sensors is also included. The influence of environmental factors, various figures of merit, and significance of TEG design are explained in context with the active sensing. Finally, the key applications, challenges and future perspective of chemical and biological detection via TEG are discussed with a view to drive further advances in the field of self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Tasking Flexible Sensor via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural disasters have been reported globally, and one source of severe damage to cities is flooding caused by locally heavy rain. Sharing of local weather information can save lives. However, it is difficult to collect local weather information in real&#8208;time because such data collection requires bulky, expensive sensors. For local, real&#8208;time monitoring of heavy rain and wind, a sensor system should be simple and low&#8208;cost so that it can be attached to a variety of surfaces, including roofs, vehicles, and umbrellas. To develop simple, low&#8208;cost multi&#8208;tasking sensors located on non&#8208;planar surfaces, we have devised a flexible rain sensor to monitor waterdrop volume and wind velocity. To monitor both simultaneously, a laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based superhydrophobic conductive film is introduced. Using the superhydrophobic surface, water dynamics are measured when waterdrops collide with the sensor surface, and obtained time series data are processed using &#8220;reservoir computing&#8221;, to extract volume and velocity from a single sensor as multi&#8208;tasking electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we show that the sensor measures continuous, long&#8208;term volume and wind change dynamics. The results demonstrate feasibility of multi&#8208;tasking electronics with reservoir computing to reduce sensor integration complexity with low power consumption for both sensor and signal processing.

         <title>Effective Passivation with Self&#8208;Organized Molecules for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% over the past decade and effective passivation for the interface with high trap density plays a significant role in this process. Here, we study two organic molecules as passivators and demonstrate that an advantageous molecular geometry and intermolecular ordering, aside from the functional moieties, are of great significance for effective and extensive passivation. Besides, the passivation molecules spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adjacent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which greatly reduce defect&#8208;assisted recombination throughout the whole perovskite/SnO2 interface. The champion device yields an in&#8208;lab PCE of 25.05% (certified 24.39%). Our investigation provides a more comprehensive understanding of passivation and a new avenue to achieve effective bottom&#8208;interface engineering for perovskite photovoltaic.

Abstract
A novel n&#8208;type copolymer dopant polystyrene&#8208;polyvinyl hexylpyridinium fluoride (PSpF) with fluoride anion is designed and synthesized by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. To our knowledge, it is the first polymeric fluoride dopant. Electrical conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1 and high power factor of 67 &#956;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved for PSpF doped polymer films, with a corresponding decrease in thermal conductivity as the PSpF concentration is increased, giving the highest ZT of 0.1. An especially high electrical conductivity of 58 S cm&#8211;1 at 88 &#176;C and outstanding thermal stability were recorded. Further, organic transistors of PSpF&#8208;doped thin films exhibit high electron mobility and Hall mobility of 0.86 and 1.70 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, respectively. The results suggest that polystyrene&#8208;polyvinyl pyridinium salt copolymers with fluoride anion are promising for high performance n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics. This work provides a new way to realize organic thermoelectrics with high conductivity relative to Seebeck coefficient, high power factor, thermal stability and broad processing window.

         <title>Highly Effective Stroke Therapy Enabled by Genetically Engineered Viral Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RGD&#8208;displaying phage (R&#8208;phage) is used to decorate silk fibroin protein microparticles. The resultant hybrid materials can not only promote adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of neural stem cells (NSCs), but also induce NSCs to differentiate preferentially into neurons. After being implanted into the stroke&#8208;induced cavities, they can induce both angiogenesis and neurogenesis to promote the brain&#8208;tissue regeneration for repairing the cavities.








Abstract
Stroke results in the formation of a cavity in the infarcted brain tissue. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis are poor in the cavity, preventing brain&#8208;tissue regeneration for stroke therapy. To regenerate brain tissue in the cavity, filamentous phages, the human&#8208;safe nanofiber&#8208;like bacteria&#8208;specific viruses, are genetically engineered to display many copies of RGD peptide on the sidewalls. The viral nanofibers, electrostatically coated on biocompatible injectable silk protein microparticles, not only promote adhesion, proliferation, and infiltration of neural stem cells (NSCs), but also induce NSCs to differentiate preferentially into neurons in basal medium within 3 d. After the NSC&#8208;loaded microparticles are injected into the stroke cavity of rat models, the phage nanofibers on the microparticles stimulate angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the stroke sites within two weeks for brain regeneration, leading to functional recovery of limb motor control of rats within 12 weeks. The viral nanofibers also brought about the desired outcomes for stroke therapy, such as reducing inflammatory response, decreasing thickness of astrocytes scars, and increasing neuroblasts response in the subventricular zone. As virtually any functional peptide can be displayed on the phage by genetic means, the phage nanofibers hold promise as a unique and effective injectable biomaterial for stroke therapy.

         <title>Acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range and Long&#8208;cycle proton Batteries</title>

Abstract
Proton conduction underlies many important electrochemical technologies. We report a family of new proton electrolytes: acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte (AiCE) prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, which can be made into thin&#8208;film (tens of microns) fluid&#8208;impervious membranes. The chosen example systems (sepiolite&#8208;phosphoric acid) rank top among the solid proton conductors in terms of proton conductivities (15 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#176;C, 0.023 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;82&#176;C), electrochemical stability window (3.35&#160;V), and reduced chemical activity. A proton battery was assembled using AiCE as the solid electrolyte membrane. Benefitting from the wider electrochemical stability window, reduced corrosivity, and excellent ionic selectivity of AiCE, the two main problems (gassing and cyclability) of proton batteries have been successfully solved. This work draws attention to the element cross&#8208;over problem in proton batteries and the generic &#8220;acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay&#8221; solid electrolyte approach with superfast proton transport, outstanding selectivity, and improved stability for room&#8208; to cryogenic&#8208;temperature protonic applications.

         <title>Steric Engineering Enables Efficient and Photostable wide&#8208;bandgap Perovskites for all&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (&#8764;1.8&#160;eV) perovskite is an crucial component to pair with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite in low&#8208;cost monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the stability and efficiency of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells are constrained by the light&#8208;induced halide segregation and by the large photovoltage deficit. Here we report a steric engineering to obtain high&#8208;quality and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites (&#8764;1.8&#160;eV) suitable for all&#8208;perovskite tandems. By alloying dimethylammonium and chloride into the mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, wide bandgaps are obtained with much lower bromide contents while the lattice strain and trap densities are simultaneously minimized. The wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells exhibit considerably improved performance and photostability, retaining &gt;90%&#160;of their initial efficiencies after 1000 hours of operation at maximum power point. With the triple&#8208;cation/triple&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites enabled by steric engineering, we further obtain a stabilized PCE of 26.0% in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Our strategy provides an avenue to fabricate efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap subcells for multi&#8208;junction photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Multimode Electron Tomography sheds light on synthesis, structure, and properties of complex metal&#8208;based nanoparticles</title>

Abstract
Electron tomography has become a cornerstone technique for the visualization of nanoparticle morphology in three dimensions. However, to obtain in&#8208;depth information about a nanoparticle beyond surface faceting and morphology, different electron microscopy signals must be combined. The most notable examples of these combined signals include annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) with different collection angles and the combination of ADF&#8208;STEM with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray or electron energy loss spectroscopies. This review summarizes the experimental and computational development of various multimode tomography techniques in connection to fundamental materials science challenges that multimode tomography has been instrumental to overcoming. Although the techniques can be applied to a wide variety of compositions, we restrict ourselves to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the sake of simplicity. Current challenges and future directions of multimode tomography are additionally discussed.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Solar Cells with 19.17% Efficiency Enabled by Introducing One Asymmetric Guest Acceptor</title>

Abstract
The ternary strategy has been widely identified as an effective approach to obtaining high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the non&#8208;radiative voltage loss lies between those of the two binary devices, which limits further efficiency improvements. Herein, we designed an asymmetric guest acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl and incorporated it into the PM1:L8&#8208;BO host blend. Compared with the L8&#8208;BO neat film, the L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;2F2Cl blend film shows higher photoluminescence quantum yield and larger exciton diffusion length. Introducing BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the host blend extends its absorption spectra, improves the molecular packing of host materials, and suppresses the non&#8208;radiative charge recombination of the ternary OSCs. Consequently, the PCE is improved up to 19.17% (certified value 18.7%), which represents the highest efficiency value reported for single&#8208;junction OSCs so far. The results show that improving the exciton behaviors is a promising approach to reducing the non&#8208;radiative voltage loss and realizing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Double&#8208;Lattice Packing of Pentagonal Gold Bipyramids in Supercrystals with Triclinic Symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentagonal gold bipyramids are self&#8208;assembled into extended superlattices. Multimodal analysis indicate the formation of supercrystals with a low&#8208;symmetry triclinic structure and with a two&#8208;particle unit cell. Computer simulations confirm that the structure corresponds to the densest possible packing. The supercrystals display a facet&#8208;dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications, and for fundamental studies of self&#8208;assembly processes.








Abstract
Pentagonal packing is a long&#8208;standing issue and a rich mathematical topic, brought to the fore by recent progress in nanoparticle design. Gold pentagonal bipyramids combine fivefold symmetry and anisotropy and their section varies along the length. In this work, colloidal supercrystals of pentagonal gold bipyramids are obtained in a compact arrangement that generalizes the optimal packing of regular pentagons in the plane. Multimodal investigations reveal a two&#8208;particle unit cell with triclinic symmetry, a lower symmetry than that of the building blocks. Monte Carlo computer simulations show that this lattice achieves the densest possible packing. Going beyond pentagons, further simulations show an odd&#8211;even effect of the number of sides on the packing: odd&#8208;sided bipyramids are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and require the double&#8208;lattice arrangement to recover inversion symmetry. The supercrystals display a facet&#8208;dependent optical response that is promising for sensing, metamaterials applications, and for fundamental studies of self&#8208;assembly processes.

         <title>Salt&#8208;assisted 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; Phase Transformation of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) has demonstrated great potentials in the fields of catalysis, electronics, energy storage and conversion, and condensed matter physics. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with unconventional metastable phases (e.g., 1T and 1T&#8242;) has attracted increasing research interest due to their unique and appealing physicochemical properties. However, there is still a lack of simple, universal, and controlled method for the preparation of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase TMD crystals, restricting their further fundamental study and practical applications. Here, we report a facile, one&#8208;step salt&#8208;assisted general strategy for the controlled phase transformation of commercially available TMDs with conventional 2H phase, yielding a large amount of metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;phase TMDs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2. It is found that the easily accessible metal salts, such as K2C2O4&#183;H2O, K2CO3, Na2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, KHCO3, NaHCO3 and NaC2O4, can be used to assist the 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; phase transformation, greatly simplifying the synthetic process for producing metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs. Importantly, this method can also be used to prepare 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMD alloys, such as 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2xSe2(1&#8208;x). This newly developed strategy is robust and highly effective, which could also be used for the phase engineering of other materials with various polymorphs.

         <title>Renal Clearable Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Early Detection of Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major complication in many clinical settings, it remains a diagnostic dilemma due to its reliance on insensitive assays or invasive biopsy. We herein report the development of an activatable polymeric nanoprobe (APNSO) for real&#8208;time in vivo near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and urinalysis of hepatic IRI. APNSO has the backbone comprising renal&#8208;clearable fluorophore fragments and the self&#8208;immolative structure units. In the presence of oxidative stress biomarker (superoxide anion, O2&#8226;&#8211;) during hepatic IRI, APNSO can be fluorescently activated for in vivo NIRF imaging and depolymerized to release renal&#8208;clearable fluorophore for urinalysis. By virtue of its high hepatic accumulation, sensitive response towards O2&#8226;&#8211;, and effective release of renal&#8208;clearable fluorophores, APNSO&#8208;based imaging and urinalysis detect hepatic IRI at least 7 h earlier than the typical clinical assays in mouse model. This study not only provides new opportunities for non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of hepatic IRI, but also reveals guidelines for development of optical nanosensors for early urinalysis.

         <title>Identification the Stable Pt Single Sites in the Environment of Ions: From Mechanism to Design Principle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For single atom (SA) based catalysis, it is urgent to understand the nature and dynamic evolution of SA active sites during the reactions. Herein, an example of Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS) displays interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via the synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy and theory calculations, results show that there exist two kinds of Pt sites: PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Ptads&#8208;S2 (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na2S, the S2&#8211; can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites, but left more stable PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40&#160;mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1). While in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Ptads&#8208;S2 sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity. Moreover, a Pt SA&#8208;ZCS&#8208;Sulfur composite is designed mainly covered by PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites accordingly (max: 79.09&#160;mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, 5% drop after 6 h and QE: 14.0% at 420&#160;nm), showing a beneficial strategy &#8220;from mechanism to design principle&#8221;.

While in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Pt&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Pt&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity. Moreover, a Pt SA-ZCS-Sulfur composite is designed mainly covered by Pt&lt;sub&gt;Zn-sub&lt;/sub&gt;-S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites accordingly (max: 79.09&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 5% drop after 6 h and QE: 14.0% at 420&#160;nm), showing a beneficial strategy &#8220;from mechanism to design principle&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Formation of Pixelated Elastic Films via Capillary Suction of Curable Elastomers in Templated Hele&#8208;Shaw Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural materials are highly organized into intricate and sophisticated hierarchical structures from which superior properties emerge. In the wake of biomimicry, there is a growing interest in designing architected materials in the laboratory as such structures could enable myriad functionalities in engineering. Yet, their fabrication remains challenging despite recent progress in additive manufacturing. In particular, soft materials are typically poorly suited to form the requisite structures consisting of regular geometries. Here we&#160;report a new frugal methodology to fabricate pixelated soft materials. Our&#160;approach is conceptually analogous to the watershed transform used in image analysis and allows the passive assembly of complex geometries through the capillary&#8208;mediated flow of curable elastomers in confined geometries. Emerging from sources distributed across a Hele&#8208;Shaw cell consisting of two parallel flat plates separated by an infinitesimally small gap, these flows eventually meet at the &#8220;dividing lines&#8221; thereby forming Voronoi tesselations. After curing is complete, these structures turn into composite elastic sheets. Rationalizing the fluid mechanics at play allows us to tailor the structural geometry of the newly formed sheets and thereby tune their local materials&#160;properties.

         <title>Engineered Exosomes with Independent Module/Cascading Function for the Therapy of Parkinson's Disease by Multi&#8208;Step Targeting and Multi&#8208;Stage Intervention Method</title>

Abstract
Current exosome engineering methods usually leads to the damage of exosome morphology and membrane, which cannot meet the complex needs of disease treatment. Herein, a concept of &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; is proposed to construct an engineered exosome nano&#8208;therapy platform including independent artificial module and natural module. Artificial module with movement/chemotaxis function is first synthesized, and then it is controllably combined with natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode through &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method. The whole process can not only maintain the activity of the natural exosome module, but also endow it with motion ability, so as to realize the purpose of &#8220;cascading function&#8221; in the process of disease treatment. The above engineered exosomes are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the multi&#8208;step targeting strategy of &#8220;disease microenvironment&#8208;damaged cells&#8208;diseased mitochondria&#8221; and the multi&#8208;stage intervention concept of &#8220;inhibiting deterioration and promoting repair&#8221; are proposed, so as to break through the bottleneck of the existing treatment of PD.

         <title>Polyiodide Confinement by Starch Enables Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery has been regarded as a promising energy storage system owing to its high energy/power density, safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the polyiodide shuttling results in serious active mass loss and Zn corrosion, which limits the cycling life of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. Inspired by the chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, we propose a structure confinement strategy to suppress the polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries by hiring starch due to its unique double&#8208;helix structure. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra demonstrate an I5&#8210;&#8208;dominated I&#8210;/I2 conversion mechanism when using starch. The I5&#8210; presents a much stronger bonding with starch than I3&#8210;, inhibiting the polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8208;I2 batteries, which is confirmed by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectra. Consequently, a high&#8208;reversible Zn&#8208;I2 battery with high Coulombic efficiency (&#8764;100% at 0.2 A g&#8210;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability (&gt;50,000 cycles) is realized. Simultaneously, the Zn corrosion triggered by polyiodide is effectively inhibited owing to the desirable shuttling&#8208;suppression by starch, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. This work provides a new understanding of the failure mechanism of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries and proposed a cheap but effective strategy to realize high&#8208;cyclability Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Long&#8208;Term Tumor Tracking with Incremental NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) is designed and synthesized for long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor progression in mice, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for noninvasive in vivo cell tracking. In contrast to current exogenous probes, the COE emission intensity increases with tumor growth, thereby harnessing advantages of both direct&#8208;labeling and indirect&#8208;labeling methods.








Abstract
The design and synthesis of the near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;II emissive conjugated oligoelectrolyte COE&#8208;BBT are reported. COE&#8208;BBT has a solubility in aqueous media greater than 50&#160;mg mL&#8722;1, low toxicity, and a propensity to intercalate lipid bilayers, wherein it exhibits a higher emission quantum yield relative to aqueous media. Addition of COE&#8208;BBT to cells provides two emission channels, at &#8776;500 and &#8776;1020&#160;nm, depending on the excitation wavelength, which facilitates in vitro confocal microscopy and in vivo animal imaging. The NIR&#8208;II emission of COE&#8208;BBT is used to track intracranial and subcutaneous tumor progression in mice. Of relevance is that the total NIR&#8208;II intensity increases over time. This phenomenon is attributed to a progressive attenuation of a COE&#8208;BBT self&#8208;quenching effect within the cells due to the expected dye dilution per cell as the tumor proliferates.

         <title>Semiconductor Contact&#8208;Electrification&#8208;Dominated Tribovoltaic Effect for Ultrahigh Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first semiconductor direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC&#8208;TENG) using gallium nitride and bismuth telluride is designed for ultrahigh power generation (40&#160;V, 2.56 A&#8201;m&#8722;2, 11.85 W&#8201;m&#8722;2). Compared to traditional polymer TENGs and previous centimeter&#8208;level SDC&#8208;TENGs, this work sets the normalized power density record for TENGs, which demonstrates the great potential of the tribovoltaic effect for energy harvesting and sensing.








Abstract
The semiconductor direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC&#8208;TENG) based on the tribovoltaic effect is promising for developing a new semiconductor energy technology with high power density.

&lt;p&gt;The first semiconductor direct-current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC-TENG) using gallium nitride and bismuth telluride is designed for ultrahigh power generation (40&#160;V, 2.56 A&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 11.85 W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Compared to traditional polymer TENGs and previous centimeter-level SDC-TENGs, this work sets the normalized power density record for TENGs, which demonstrates the great potential of the tribovoltaic effect for energy harvesting and sensing.

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor direct-current triboelectric nanogenerator (SDC-TENG) based on the tribovoltaic effect is promising for developing a new semiconductor energy technology with high power density. Here, the first SDC-TENG built using gallium nitride (GaN) and bismuth telluride (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for ultrahigh-power generation is reported.

The peak open-circuit voltage can reach up to 40&#160;V and the power density is 11.85 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (average value is 9.23 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is approximately 200 times higher than that of previous centimeter-level SDC-TENGs.

         <title>Record&#8208;Efficiency Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Organic Ions Interface Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) have attracted great attention because of their unique advantages in lightweight and portable electronics applications. However, their efficiencies are far inferior to those of their rigid counterparts due to the lack of strategies for fabricating a high&#8208;quality electron transport layer (ETL) at low temperature (&#8776;&#160;100&#176;C). Herein, a novel histamine diiodate (HADI) is designed based on theoretical study to modify the SnO2/perovskite interface. Systematic experimental results reveal that the HADI serves effectively as a multifunctional agent mainly in three aspects: (1) surface modification to realign the SnO2 conduction band upward to improve interfacial charge extraction; (2) passivating the buried perovskite surface, and (3) bridging between the SnO2 and perovskite layers for effective charge transfer. Consequently, the rigid MA&#8208;free PSCs based on the HADI&#8208;SnO2 ETLs display not only a high champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.79% and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.20&#160;V but also outstanding stability as demonstrated by the PSCs preserving 91% of their initial efficiencies after being exposed to ambient atmosphere for 1200 hours without any encapsulation. Furthermore, the solution&#8208;processed HADI&#8208;SnO2 ETL formed at low temperature (100&#176;C) was utilized in f&#8208;PSCs that achieved a PCE as high as 22.44%, the highest reported PCE for f&#8208;PSCs to date.

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions between Layered Indium Selenide for Integrated Photonic Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The primary mechanism of optical memoristive devices relies on the phase transitions between amorphous&#8208;crystalline states. The slow or energy hungry amorphous&#8208;crystalline transitions in optical phase&#8208;change materials are detrimental to the devices&#8217; scalability and performance. Leveraging the integrated photonic platform, we demonstrate a single nanosecond pulse triggered nonvolatile and reversible switching between two layered structures of indium selenide (In2Se3). High resolution pair distribution function reveals the detailed atomistic transition pathways between the layered structures. With inter&#8208;layer &#8220;shear glide&#8221; and isosymmetric phase transition, the switching between &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;structural states contain low re&#8208;configurational entropy, allowing reversible switching between layered structures. Broadband refractive index contrast, optical transparency, and volumetric effect in the crystalline&#8208;crystalline phase transition are experimentally characterized in molecular beam epitaxy&#8208;grown thin films and compared to ab&#8208;initial calculations. The nonlinear resonator transmission spectra measure incremental linear loss rate of 3.3&#160;GHz introduced by 1.5&#160;&#956;m long In2Se3 covered layer, resulting from the combinations of material absorption and scattering.

         <title>Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conduction, a Multifunctional Property in Organic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and dynamic tuning of organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors influence a myriad of functional properties: energy levels, conductivity, color, modulus, and volume for a diverse range of real&#8208;world applications. Several chemical and structural design approaches to modify OMIECs&#8217; properties are highlighted, and how various stimuli such as electrical, chemical, and optical inputs fundamentally change OMIECs&#8217; properties dynamically, along with how these changes can be utilized in device applications, is discussed.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) have gained recent interest and rapid development due to their versatility in diverse applications ranging from sensing, actuation and computation to energy harvesting/storage, and information transfer. Their multifunctional properties arise from their ability to simultaneously participate in redox reactions as well as modulation of ionic and electronic charge density throughout the bulk of the material. Most importantly, the ability to access charge states with deep modulation through a large extent of its density of states and physical volume of the material enables OMIEC&#8208;based devices to display exciting new characteristics and opens up new degrees of freedom in device design. Leveraging the infinite possibilities of the organic synthetic toolbox, this perspective highlights several chemical and structural design approaches to modify OMIECs&#8217; properties important in device applications such as electronic and ionic conductivity, color, modulus, etc. Additionally, the ability for OMIECs to respond to external stimuli and transduce signals to myriad types of outputs has accelerated their development in smart systems. This perspective further illustrates how various stimuli such as electrical, chemical, and optical inputs fundamentally change OMIECs&#8217; properties dynamically and how these changes can be utilized in device applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with High Performance for Three&#8208;Way Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique dual&#8208;site catalyst composed of Pt and Pd atoms located in neighboring positions on the surface of CeO2 is fabricated, which possesses outstanding TWC performance, especially for NO elimination. The enhancement can be attributed to the strong interactions between the Pt and Pd atoms by formation of Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Pd fine structures.








Abstract
In response to growing levels of air pollution and emission regulations, novel three&#8208;way catalysts (TWCs) with high efficiency are highly coveted. Herein, a multi&#8208;step heating strategy to fabricate a unique dual&#8208;site catalyst composed of strongly coupled Pt and Pd atoms located in neighboring positions on the surface of CeO2 is demonstrated. Outstanding three&#8208;way catalytic performance is demonstrated, especially for NO elimination. Based on comprehensive investigations, the enhancement is attributed to the strong interactions between the neighboring Pt and Pd atoms, which can separately serve as active sites for CO and NO adsorption, efficiently reducing the energy barrier and accelerating the reaction rate. These findings not only contribute to designing and constructing next&#8208;generation catalysts, but also provide a promising opportunity to improve fuel efficiency and control emissions.

Mechanical properties of biological systems provide useful information about the biochemical status of cells and tissues. Here we report an artificial tactile neuron enabling spiking representation of stiffness and spiking neural network (SNN)&#8208;based learning for disease diagnosis. An artificial spiking tactile neuron based on an ovonic threshold switch serving as an artificial soma and a piezoresistive sensor as an artificial mechanoreceptor is developed and shown to encode the elastic stiffness of pressed materials into spike frequency evolution patterns. SNN&#8208;based learning of ultrasound elastography images abstracted by spike frequency evolution rate enables the classification of malignancy status of breast tumors with a recognition accuracy up to 95.8%. The stiffness&#8208;encoding artificial tactile neuron and learning of spiking&#8208;represented stiffness patterns hold a great promise for the identification and classification of tumors for disease diagnosis and robot&#8208;assisted surgery with low power consumption, low latency, and yet high accuracy.

         <title>Strain Modulation for Light&#8208;Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising to penetrate photovoltaic market. However, wide bandgap perovskite absorber used in top&#8208;cell often suffers severe phase segregation under illumination, which restricts the operation lifetime of tandem solar cells. Here, we report a strain modulation strategy to fabricate light stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. By employing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the residual tensile strain in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber is successfully converted to compressive strain, which mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and phase segregation. Based on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite with compressive strain, the single junction solar cells with n&#8208;i&#8208;p layout yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.53% with the smallest voltage deficits of 440&#160;mV. These cells also maintain 83.60% of initial PCE after 2500&#8208;hours operation at maximum power point. Finally, we integrate these top cells with silicon bottom cells in a monolithic tandem device, which achieves the PCE of 26.95% and improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.

         <title>16.52% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with High Tolerance of the Photoactive Layer Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 16.52% efficiency all&#8208;polymer solar cell is achieved by morphology control of the photoactive layer through adding a low&#8208;cost polymer donor, PTQ10, into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend. Meanwhile, ternary devices exhibit a high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness, with high power conversion efficiencies of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thicknesses of &#8776;205 and &#8776;306&#160;nm, respectively.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have drawn growing attention and achieved tremendous progress recently, but their power conversion efficiency (PCE) still lags behind small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based PSCs due to the relative difficulty on morphology control of polymer photoactive blends. Here, low&#8208;cost PTQ10 is introduced as a second polymer donor (a third component) into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend to finely tune the energy&#8208;level matching and microscopic morphology of the polymer blend photoactive layer. The addition of PTQ10 decreases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, and increases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking coherence length and the ordered face&#8208;on molecular packing orientation, which improves the charge separation and transport in the photoactive layer. Moreover, the deeper highest occupied molecular orbital energy level of the PTQ10 polymer donor than PM6 leads to higher open&#8208;circuit voltage of the ternary all&#8208;PSCs. As a result, a PCE of 16.52% is achieved for ternary all&#8208;PSCs, which is one of the highest PCEs for all&#8208;PSCs. In addition, the ternary devices exhibit a high tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness with high PCEs of 15.27% and 13.91% at photoactive layer thickness of &#8776;205 and &#8776;306&#160;nm, respectively, which are the highest PCEs so far for all&#8208;PSCs with a thick photoactive layer.

         <title>A Tumor Microenvironments&#8208;Adapted Polypeptide Hydrogel/Nanogel Composite Boosts Antitumor Molecularly Targeted Inhibition and Immunoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironments&#8208;adapted composite consisting of a thermosensitive hydrogel and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel achieves sequential release of molecularly targeted drug and TGF&#8208;&#946; inhibitor in the tumor cells, blocks the proliferation of tumor cells, reverses the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition caused by elevated TGF&#8208;&#946;, and regulates the tumor immune microenvironments, thereby effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastases.








Abstract
Various macro/microscopic biomaterials have been developed for controlled drug delivery in the combination therapy of malignancies. However, uncertain loading ratio, release sequence, and spatiotemporal distribution of drugs hinder their synergistic therapeutic effects and clinical applications. In this work, a tumor microenvironments&#8208;adapted composite consisting of a thermosensitive hydrogel and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel is developed for precisely sequential drug release to enhance molecularly targeted therapy and amplify immune activation. LY3200882 (LY), a selective transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor, is encapsulated in the ROS&#8208;responsive nanogel and dispersed uniformly with regorafenib (REG) in a thermosensitive hydrogel (Gel/(REG+NG/LY)). After in situ administration, REG is preferentially released from the hydrogel to inhibit tumor growth and promote ROS generation, which triggers the subsequent on&#8208;demand release of LY from the nanogel. LY contributes to preventing the epithelial&#8211;mesenchymal transition and immune escape of tumor cells induced by elevated TGF&#8208;&#946;. In subcutaneous and orthotopic colorectal tumor bearing mouse models, Gel/(REG+NG/LY) effectively inhibits tumor growth and liver metastases by increasing the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells, reducing the recruitment of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and promoting the polarization of macrophages from M2 to M1 type, indicating the significant potential in improving the prognosis of advanced cancer patients.

         <title>Highly Stable Halide&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8211;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent thermodynamic mechanism of the lithiation/delithiation process of the Se cathode is revealed in the halide electrolyte system, benefiting from its wide electrochemical stability window and excellent stability toward Se. The highly mixed conductive character of the Se&#8211;Li3HoCl6 cathode ensures fast charge transfer and good performance of an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se cell.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;Se batteries are promising devices that can address the safety and electrochemical stability issues that arise from liquid&#8208;based systems. However, solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se/S batteries usually present poor cycling stability due to the high resistance interfaces and decomposition of solid electrolytes caused by their narrow electrochemical stability windows. Here, an integrated solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;Se battery based on a halide Li3HoCl6 solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity is presented. The intrinsic wide electrochemical stability window of the Li3HoCl6 and its stability toward Se and the lithiated species effectively inhibit degeneration of the electrolyte and the Se cathode by suppressing side reactions. The inherent thermodynamic mechanism of the lithiation/delithiation process of the Se cathode in solid is also revealed and confirmed by theoretical calculations. The battery achieves a reversible capacity of 402 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 750 cycles. The electrochemical performance, thermodynamic lithiation/delithiation mechanism, and stability of metal&#8208;halide&#8208;based Li&#8211;Se batteries confer theoretical study and practical applicability that extends to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Adaptive Biosensing and Neuromorphic Classification Based on an Ambipolar Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive neuromorphic sensor system can locally process and classify biosignals based on a single high&#8208;performance material. This material is an organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor (OMIEC) based on a conjugated polymer P&#8208;3O, exhibiting exceptional ambipolar transistor properties and high stability. This versatile material enables straightforward fabrication and integration of electronic components, including transistors, ambipolar inverters, memory devices, and dopamine sensors.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are central to bioelectronic applications such as biosensors, health&#8208;monitoring devices, and neural interfaces, and have facilitated efficient next&#8208;generation brain&#8208;inspired computing and biohybrid systems. Despite these examples, smart and adaptive circuits that can locally process and optimize biosignals have not yet been realized. Here, a tunable sensing circuit is shown that can locally modulate biologically relevant signals like electromyograms (EMGs) and electrocardiograms (ECGs), that is based on a complementary logic inverter combined with a neuromorphic memory element, and that is constructed from a single polymer mixed conductor. It is demonstrated that a small neuromorphic array based on this material effects high classification accuracy in heartbeat anomaly detection. This high&#8208;performance material allows for straightforward monolithic integration, which reduces fabrication complexity while also achieving high on/off ratios with excellent ambient p&#8208; and n&#8208;type stability in transistor performance. This material opens a route toward simple and straightforward fabrication and integration of more sophisticated adaptive circuits for future smart bioelectronics.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Programming of Liquid Metal&#8208;Composite Microstructures through Direct Ink Write 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D printing strategy to program liquid metal&#8211;composite microstructures on demand throughout a part is introduced. Elastomer composites are created with unique liquid metal (LM) microdroplet architectures including smooth to discrete transitions from spherical to needle&#8208;like microstructures, curvilinear microstructures, connected LM networks, and geometrically complex patterns. This approach can enable applications in soft electronics, robotics, and reconfigurable structures.








Abstract
Soft, elastically deformable composites with liquid metal (LM) droplets can enable new generations of soft electronics, robotics, and reconfigurable structures. However, techniques to control local composite microstructure, which ultimately governs material properties and performance, is lacking. Here a direct ink writing technique is developed to program the LM&#160;microstructure (i.e., shape, orientation, and connectivity) on demand throughout elastomer composites. In contrast to inks with rigid particles that have fixed shape and size, it is shown that emulsion inks with LM&#160;fillers enable in situ control of microstructure. This enables filaments, films, and 3D structures with unique LM microstructures that are generated on demand and locked in during printing. This includes smooth and discrete transitions from spherical to needle&#8208;like droplets, curvilinear microstructures, geometrically complex embedded inclusion patterns, and connected LM networks. The printed materials are soft (modulus &lt; 200 kPa), highly deformable (&gt;600 % strain), and can be made locally insulating or electrically conductive using a single ink by controlling the process conditions. These capabilities are demonstrated by embedding elongated LM droplets in a&#160;soft heat sink, which rapidly dissipates heat from high&#8208;power LEDs. These&#160;programmable microstructures can enable new composite paradigms for emerging technologies that demand mechanical compliance with multifunctional response.

         <title>Nanoscale Faceting and Ligand Shell Structure Dominate the Self&#8208;Assembly of Nonpolar Nanoparticles into Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superlattice formation by self&#8208;assembly in liquid is a nanoengineering technique with broad technological applications. Liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy reveals that faceted nanoparticles assemble differently on SiN surfaces with altered electrostatic and long&#8208;range attraction, demonstrating that the nanoscale morphology of the nanoparticles and the substrate's surface control the self&#8208;assembled superlattices.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale structures at liquid&#8211;solid interfaces occurs in a broad range of industrial processes and is found in various phenomena in nature. Conventional theory assumes spherical particles and homogeneous surfaces, but that model is oversimplified, and nanoscale in situ observations are needed for a more complete understanding. Liquid&#8208;phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;STEM) is used to examine the interactions that direct the self&#8208;assembly of superlattices formed by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in nonpolar liquids. Varying the molecular coating of the substrate modulates short&#8208;range attraction and leads to switching between a range of different geometric structures, including hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), simple hexagonal (sh), dodecahedral quasi&#8208;crystal (dqc), and body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) lattices, as well as random distributions. Langevin dynamics simulations explain the experimental results in terms of the interplay between nanoparticle faceting, ligand shell structure, and substrate&#8211;NP interactions.

         <title>Modularizable Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Based Open Surfaces Enable Programmable Chemical Transport and Feeding using Liquid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;infused porous surface is created as an open surface platform for droplet reactors, where the LC phase transition triggers the chemical reaction by releasing reactants from the surface. The LC surfaces also exhibit desirable levels of automation, responsiveness, controllability, and modularizability, which find potential use in a realm of droplet reactors, materials synthesis, and regenerative cell therapy.








Abstract
Droplet&#8208;based miniature reactors have attracted interest in both fundamental studies, for the unique reaction kinetics they enable, and applications in bio&#8208;diagnosis and material synthesis. However, the precise and automatic feeding of chemicals, important for the delicate reactions in these miniaturized chemical reactors, either requires complex, high&#8208;cost microfluidic devices or lacks the capability to maintain a pinning&#8208;free droplet movement. Here, the design and synthesis of a new class of liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based open surfaces, which enable a controlled chemical release via a programmable LC phase transition without sacrificing the free transport of the droplets, are reported. It is demonstrated that their intrinsic slipperiness and self&#8208;healing properties enable a modularizable assembly of LC surfaces that can be loaded with different chemicals to achieve a wide range of chemical reactions carried out within the droplets, including sequential and parallel chemical reactions, crystal growth, and polymer synthesis. Finally, an LC&#8208;based chemical feeding device is developed that can automatically control the release of chemicals to direct the simultaneous differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into endothelial progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes. Overall, these LC surfaces exhibit desirable levels of automation, responsiveness, and controllability for use in miniature droplet carriers and reactors.

         <title>Origin of the 2D electron gas at the SrTiO3 surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bulk SrTiO3 is a well&#8208;known band insulator and the most common substrate used in the field of complex oxide heterostructures. Its surface and interface with other oxides, however, have demonstrated a variety of remarkable behaviors distinct from those expected. Here using a suite of in situ techniques to monitor both the atomic and electronic structures of the SrTiO3 (001) surface prior to and during growth, we&#160;observe the disappearance and re&#8208;appearance of a 2D electron gas (2DEG) after the completion of each SrO and TiO2 monolayer, respectively. The 2DEG is identified with the TiO2 double layer present at the initial SrTiO3 surface, which gives rise to a surface potential and mobile electrons due to vacancies within the TiO2 &#8722; x adlayer. Much like the electronic reconstruction discovered in other systems, two atomic planes are required, here supplied by the double layer. The combined in situ scattering / spectroscopy findings resolve a number of longstanding issues associated with complex oxide interfaces, facilitating the employment of atomic&#8208;scale defect engineering in oxide&#160;electronics.

         <title>Nanostructured Metallic Glass in Highly Upgraded Energy State Contributing to Efficient Catalytic Performance</title>

Abstract
Metallic glasses (MGs), with high density of low coordination sites and high Gibbs free energy state, are novel promising and competitive candidates in the family of electrochemical catalysts. However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer&#8208;sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, were reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. In this work, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni&#8208;P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni&#8208;P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey&#8208;like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni&#8208;P NG require potential of mere 1.36&#160;V at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, with a Tafel slope of 13&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, which is the best UOR performance in Ni&#8208;based alloys. The present work demonstrates that the nanostructurization of MGs provides a universal and effective pathway to upgrade the energy state of MGs for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in energy conversion.

         <title>Defective Fe Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks Enhance Metabolic Profiling for High&#8208;accuracy Diagnosis of Human Cancers</title>

Abstract
Cancers heavily threaten human life, therefore, the high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis is vital to protect human beings from the suffer of cancers. While the biopsy and imaging methods have been widely used as current technologies for cancer diagnosis, new detection platform by metabolic analysis is expecting due to the significant advantages of fast, simple, and cost&#8208;effective with low body&#8208;intolerance. However, the signal of molecule biomarkers is too weak to acquire high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis. Herein, we developed precisely engineered metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS), allowing favourable charge transfer within molecule&#8208;substrate interface and mitigated thermal dissipation by adjusting the phonon scattering with metal nodes. Consequently, we achieved a surprising signal enhancement of &#8764;10,000&#8208;fold, resulting in diagnosis of three major cancers (liver/lung/kidney cancer) with area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve (AUC) of 0.908&#8208;0.964 and accuracy of 83.2%&#8208;90.6%, which promises a universal detection tool for large&#8208;scale clinical diagnosis of human cancers.

         <title>SEEDING to Enable Sensitive Electrochemical Detection of Biomarkers in Undiluted Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors have shown great potential for simple, fast, and cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic tools. However, direct analysis of complex biological fluids such as plasma has been limited by the loss of sensitivity caused by biofouling. By increasing surface area, the nanostructured electrode can improve detection sensitivity. However, like a double&#8208;edged sword, a large surface area increases the non&#8208;specific adsorption of contaminating proteins. The use of nanoporous structures may prevent fouling proteins. However, there is no straightforward approach for creating nanostructured and nanoporous surfaces compatible with microfabricated thin&#8208;film electrodes. Herein, we demonstrate the preferential etching of chloride and surfactant&#8208;assisted anisotropic gold reduction to create homogeneous, nanostructured, and nanoporous gold electrodes, yielding 190&#160;&#177; 20 times larger surface area within a minute without using templates. We named this process Surfactant&#8208;based Electrochemical Etch&#8208;Deposit Interplay for Nanostructure/Nanopore Growth (SEEDING). SEEDING on electrodes enhanced the sensitivity and anti&#8208;biofouling capabilities of amperometric biosensors, enabling direct analysis of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs) in complex biofluids with a limit of detection of 300 tEVs/&#956;L from undiluted plasma and good discrimination between patients with prostate cancer from healthy ones with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 in urine and 0.90 in plasma samples.

         <title>A Magnetically Separable Pd Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Selective Hydrogenation of Phenylacetylene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically separable single&#8208;atom catalyst, Pd1/Ni@G, is fabricated via anchoring atomically dispersed Pd single atoms on the shell of magnetic core&#8211;shell particles that consist of a Ni&#8208;nanoparticles core and a graphene sheets shell (Ni@G). The obtained Pd1/Ni@G catalyst displays robust catalytic performance for selective hydrogenation of phenylacetylene with efficient activity and selectivity, as well as good stability, and it can be promptly recycled from the liquid reaction systems due to its magnetic separability.








Abstract
Selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes plays a crucial role in the synthesis of fine chemicals. However, how to achieve high selectivity and effective separation of the catalyst and substrate while obtaining high activity is the key for this reaction. In this work, a Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst is anchored to the shell of magnetic core&#8211;shell particles that consist of a Ni&#8208;nanoparticles core and a graphene sheets shell (Ni@G) for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, delivering 93% selectivity to styrene at full conversion with a robust turnover frequency of 7074 h&#8722;1 under mild reaction conditions (303 K, 2&#160;bar H2). Moreover, the catalyst can be recovered promptly from the liquid phase due to its magnetic separability, which makes it present good stability for enduring five cycles. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that H2 and substrates are activated by atomically dispersed Pd atoms and Ni@G hybrid support, respectively. The hydrogenation reaction occurs on the surface of Ni@G via hydrogen spillover from the metal to the support. Such a strategy opens an avenue for designing highly active, selective, and magnetically recyclable catalysts for selective hydrogenation in liquid reaction systems.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Functionalized n&#8208;Type Polymer with High Electron Mobility for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
n&#8208;Type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) with high electron mobility are scarce and highly challenging to develop. As a result, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#956;C*) of n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) lags far behind the p&#8208;type analogs, restraining the development of OECT&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors. Here, we report two n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) polymers based on fused bithiophene imide dimer f&#8208;BTI2 as the acceptor unit and thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene (TVT) as the donor co&#8208;unit. The cyanation of TVT enables polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN with simultaneously enhanced ion uptake ability, film structural order and charge transport property. As a result, we were able to obtain a high volumetric capacitance (C*) of 170&#177;22&#160;F cm&#8722;3 and a record OECT electron mobility (&#956;e,OECT) of 0.24 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN, subsequently achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#956;C* of 41.3 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 12.8 S cm&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode OECTs. In contrast, only a moderate &#956;C* of 1.50 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 was measured for the non&#8208;cyanated polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT. These remarkable results demonstrate the great power of cyano functionalization of polymer semiconductors in developing n&#8208;type OMIECs with substantial electron mobility in aqueous environment for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OECTs.

         <title>A Heterogeneously Integrated Spiking Neuron Array for Multimode&#8208;Fused Perception and Object Classification</title>

Abstract
Multimode&#8208;fused sensing in the somatosensory system helps people obtain comprehensive object properties and make accurate judgments. However, building such multisensory systems with conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology presents serious device integration and circuit complexity challenges. Here, we report a multimode&#8208;fused spiking neuron (MFSN) with a compact structure to achieve human&#8208;like multisensory perception. The MFSN heterogeneously integrates a pressure sensor to process pressure and a NbOx&#8208;based memristor to sense temperature. Using this MFSN, multisensory analog information can be fused into one spike train, showing excellent data compression and conversion capabilities. Moreover, both pressure and temperature information are distinguished from fused spikes by decoupling the output frequencies and amplitudes, supporting multimodal tactile perception. Then, we fabricate a 3&#215;3 MFSN array and feed the fused frequency patterns into a spiking neural network for enhanced tactile pattern recognition. Finally, we simulate a larger MFSNs for classifying objects with different shapes, temperatures and weights, validating the feasibility of our MFSNs for practical applications. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MFSNs enable the building of multimodal sensory systems and contribute to the development of highly intelligent robotics.

Abstract
Natural enzyme&#8208;based catalytic cascades hold great promise for cancer therapy, but their clinical utility is greatly hindered by the loss of their functions during in vivo delivery. Herein, we report a plasmonic tri&#8208;enzyme integrated metal&#8208;organic framework (plasEnMOF) nanoplatform with high&#8208;efficiency enzyme cascades for synergistic starvation, thermodynamic and plasmonic hyperthermia tri&#8208;modal therapy of hypoxic tumors. This plasEnMOFs are created with encapsulation of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) plasmonic Au nanorods and natural enzymes &#8210; catalase (CAT), glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) within zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) MOFs. As a tri&#8208;enzyme cascade system, the plasEnMOFs effectively deplete intratumoral glucose and generate toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) for starvation therapy and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with the plasmonic hyperthermia therapy (PHT). We also demonstrate the enhanced glucose consumption and ROS generation by the NIR&#8208;II plasmonic photothermal effect. The improved chemo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;tolerance of the encapsulated natural enzymes within the protective ZIF&#8208;8 MOFs is evidenced. With the integrated enzyme cascades and NIR&#8208;II photothermal effects, our plasEnMOFs are demonstrated with exceptional therapeutic effects on 4T1 xenograft tumors through the combined starvation/CDT/PHT therapy. This work highlights the superiority of natural enzyme cascade systems integrated in plasmonic MOFs for high&#8208;efficiency enzymatic cancer therapy.

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diode utilizing europium&#8208;activated calcium oxide phosphor with external quantum efficiency of up to 54.7%</title>

Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence materials with broadband emissions are necessary for the development of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based light sources. However, most known NIR emitting materials are limited by their low external quantum efficiency. Here, we report how the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of europium&#8208;activated calcium oxide (CaO:Eu) NIR phosphor can be significantly improved and stabilized at operating temperatures of LEDs. A carbon paper wrapping technology was innovatively developed and used during the solid&#8208;state sintering to promote the reduction of Eu3+ into Eu2+. In parallel, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice were repaired utilizing GeO2 decomposition. Through this process, a record high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#176;C. The as&#8208;fabricated NIR&#8208;LEDs reach a photoelectric efficiency of 100 mA@23.4% and an output power of 100 mA@319.5 mW, which are also the record values reported so far. This discovery of high&#8208;performance phosphors will open new research avenues for broadband NIR LEDs light sources in a variety of photonics applications.

         <title>The Intrinsic Thermodynamic Difficulty and a Step&#8208;Guided Mechanism for the Epitaxial Growth of Uniform Multilayer MoS2 with Controllable Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On epitaxial substrates with moderate surface interactions, density functional theory calculations show that a step with appropriate height can not only promote simultaneous nucleation of thickness&#8208;matched MoS2 domains with aligned edges but also suppresses the nucleation of thinner MoS2 domains, by which uniform multilayer MoS2 with targeted thickness can be grown.








Abstract
Multilayer MoS2 shows superior performance over the monolayer MoS2 for electronic devices while the growth of multilayer MoS2 with controllable and uniform thickness is still very challenging. It is revealed by calculations that monolayer MoS2 domains are thermodynamically much more favorable than multilayer ones on epitaxial substrates due to the competition between surface interactions and edge formation, leading accordingly to a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth pattern and non&#8208;continuously distributed multilayer domains with uncontrollable thickness uniformity. The thermodynamics model also suggests that multilayer MoS2 domains with aligned edges can significantly reduce their free energy and represent a local minimum with very prominent energy advantage on a potential energy surface. However, the nucleation probability of multilayer MoS2 domains with aligned edges is, if not impossible, extremely rare on flat substrates. Herein, a step&#8208;guided mechanism for the growth of uniform multilayer MoS2 on an epitaxial substrate is theoretically proposed. The steps with proper height on sapphire surface are able to guide the simultaneous nucleation of multilayer MoS2 with aligned edges and uniform thickness, and promote the continuous growth of multilayer MoS2 films. The proposed mechanism can be reasonably extended to grow multilayer 2D materials with uniform thickness on epitaxial substrates.

         <title>Rapid Surface Display of mRNA Antigens by Bacteria&#8208;Derived Outer Membrane Vesicles for a Personalized Tumor Vaccine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An mRNA delivery platform by genetically engineering with surface decoration of RNA binding protein, L7Ae, and lysosomal escape protein, listeriolysin O (OMV&#8208;LL) is presented. This platform provides a delivery technology distinct from lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for personalized mRNA tumor vaccination, and with a &#8220;Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Display&#8221; strategy that enables its versatile application in mRNA vaccines.








Abstract
Therapeutic mRNA vaccination is an attractive approach to trigger antitumor immunity. However, the mRNA delivery technology for customized tumor vaccine is still limited. In this work, bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are employed as an mRNA delivery platform by genetically engineering with surface decoration of RNA binding protein, L7Ae, and lysosomal escape protein, listeriolysin O (OMV&#8208;LL). OMV&#8208;LL can rapidly adsorb box C/D sequence&#8208;labelled mRNA antigens through L7Ae binding (OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA) and deliver them into dendritic cells (DCs), following by the cross&#8208;presentation via listeriolysin O&#8208;mediated endosomal escape. OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA significantly inhibits melanoma progression and elicits 37.5% complete regression in a colon cancer model. OMV&#8208;LL&#8208;mRNA induces a long&#8208;term immune memory and protects the mice from tumor challenge after 60 days. In summary, this platform provides a delivery technology distinct from lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for personalized mRNA tumor vaccination, and with a &#8220;Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Display&#8221; strategy that enables its versatile application in mRNA vaccines.

         <title>Automated laser&#8208;transfer synthesis of high&#8208;density microarrays for infectious disease screening</title>

Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) is a rapid laser&#8208;patterning technique for high&#8208;throughput combinatorial synthesis directly on glass slides. A lack of automation and precision limited LIFT applications to simple proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept syntheses of fewer than 100 compounds. Here, we report an automated synthesis instrument that combines laser transfer and robotics for parallel synthesis in a microarray format with up to 10000 individual reactions/cm2. An optimized pipeline for amide bond formation is the basis for preparing complex peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences in high yield with high reproducibility. The resulting peptide arrays are of higher quality than commercial peptide arrays. More than 4800 15&#8208;residue peptides resembling the entire Ebola virus proteome on a microarray were synthesized to study the antibody response of an Ebola virus infection survivor. We identified known and unknown epitopes that serve now as a basis for Ebola diagnostic development. The versatility and precision of the synthesizer is demonstrated by in situ synthesis of fluorescent molecules via Schiff base reaction and multi&#8208;step patterning of precisely definable amounts of fluorophores. This automated laser transfer synthesis approach opens new avenues for high&#8208;throughput chemical synthesis and biological screening.

         <title>PET&#8208;CT Imaging of Polymeric Nanoparticle Tumor Accumulation in Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Several FDA/EMA&#8208;approved nanomedicines have demonstrated improved pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles compared to their conventional chemotherapeutic counterparts. The next step to increase therapeutic efficacy depends on tumor accumulation, which can be highly heterogeneous. A clinical tool for patient stratification is urgently awaited. Therefore, we radiolabeled a docetaxel&#8208;entrapping polymeric nanoparticle (89Zr&#8208;CPC634) and performed positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in seven patients with solid tumors with two different doses of CPC634: an on&#8208;treatment (containing 60 mg m&#8722;2 docetaxel) and a diagnostic (1&#8208;2 mg docetaxel) dose (NCT03712423). Pharmacokinetic half&#8208;life for 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 was mean 97.0 &#177;14.4 hours on&#8208;treatment, and 62.4 &#177;12.9 hours for the diagnostic dose (p = 0.003). At these doses accumulation was observed in 46% and 41% of tumor lesions with a median accumulation in positive lesions 96 hours post&#8208;injection of 4.94 and 4.45%IA kg&#8722;1 (p = 0.91), respectively. In conclusion, PET/CT imaging with a diagnostic dose of 89Zr&#8208;CPC634 accurately reflects on&#8208;treatment tumor accumulation and thus opens the possibility for patient stratification in cancer nanomedicine with polymeric nanoparticles.

         <title>Native ligand carbonization renders common platinum nanoparticles highly durable for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction: annealing temperature matters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current protocols for synthesizing monodisperse platinum (Pt) nanoparticles typically involve the use of hydrocarbon molecules as surface&#8208;capping ligands. Utilizing Pt nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, these ligands must be removed in order to expose surface sites. Here, highly durable ORR catalysts are realized without ligand removal; instead, the native ligands are converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells by simple thermal annealing. Strikingly, the annealing temperature is a critical factor dictating the ORR performance of Pt catalysts. Pt nanoparticles treated at 500&#160;&#176;C show a very poor ORR activity, whereas those annealed at 700&#160;&#176;C become highly active along with exceptional stability. In&#8208;depth characterization reveals that thermal treatment from 500 to 700&#160;&#176;C gradually opens up the porosity in carbon shells through graphitization. Importantly, such graphitic&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Pt catalysts exhibit a superior ORR stability, largely retaining the activity after 20,000 cycles in a membrane electrode assembly. Moreover, this ligand carbonization strategy can be extended to modify commercial Pt/C catalysts with substantially enhanced stability. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of boosting the ORR performance of common Pt nanoparticles by harnessing the native surface ligands, offering a robust approach of designing highly durable catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells.

         <title>Engineering Hibiscus&#8208;Like Riboflavin/ZIF&#8208;8 Microsphere Composites to Enhance Transepithelial Corneal Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Novel engineering hydrangea&#8208;like RF@ZIF&#8208;8 microsphere composites with outstanding trans&#8208;epithelial corneal cross&#8208;linking (TE&#8208;CXL) efficacy are prepared using one pot methods. The obtained biocompatible composites display excellent tolerance, remarkable corneal permeation, improved CXL efficacy than conventional CXL protocol without corneal epithelium debridement, suggesting a promising nanomedicine for corneal cross&#8208;linking.








Abstract
Riboflavin&#8208;5&#8208;phosphate (RF) is the most commonly used photosensitizer in corneal cross&#8208;linking (CXL), but its hydrophilicity and negative charge limit its penetration through the corneal epithelium into the stroma. To enhance the corneal permeability of RF and promote its efficacy in the treatment of keratoconus, novel hibiscus&#8208;like RF@ZIF&#8208;8 microsphere composites [6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF (nanoflake)] are prepared using ZIF&#8208;8 nanomaterials as carriers, which are characterized by their hydrophobicity, positive potential, biocompatibility, high loading capacities, and large surface areas. Both hematoxylin and eosin endothelial staining and TUNEL assays demonstrate excellent biocompatibility of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF. In in vivo studies, the 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF displayed excellent corneal permeation, and outstanding transepithelial CXL (TE&#8208;CXL) efficacy, slightly better than the conventional CXL protocol. Furthermore, the special hibiscus&#8208;like structures of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF meant that it has better TE&#8208;CXL efficacy than that of 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NP (nanoparticles) due to the larger contact area with the epithelium and the shorter RF release passage. These results suggest that the 6RF@ZIF&#8208;8 NF are promising for transepithelial corneal cross&#8208;linking, avoiding the need for epithelial debridement.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling, Robust, and Adhesive Extracellular Matrix&#8208;Mimicking Hydrogel Used as Intraoral Dressing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extracellular matrix&#8208;mimicking hydrogel wound dressing is designed as tooth extraction adhesive wound dressing for intraoral application. The hydrogel exhibits excellent anti&#8208;swelling efficiency, along with consistent mechanical and adhesive robustness in aqueous environments. In vitro and in vivo tooth extraction models demonstrate the stability of hydrogels as physical and antibacterial barriers for intraoral wounds, leading to continuous protection and effective healing acceleration.








Abstract
Due to the wet and dynamic environment of the oral cavity, the healing of intraoral wounds, such as tooth extraction wounds, requires stable and firm wound dressings. In clinical practice, cotton balls and gauzes, sponge plugs, or sutures are used to treat extraction wounds, but none of these means can continuously isolate the wound from the intraoral environment and facilitate ideal healing conditions. Herein, inspired by the natural extracellular matrix, a family of wound dressings is developed for intraoral wound repair. Infiltrating a ductile long&#8208;chain hydrogel network into a prefabricated, sturdy macromolecular meshwork and in situ crosslinking endowed the composite hydrogel with controllable swelling behaviors and robust mechanical properties. The macromolecular meshwork functioned as the backbone to support the composite and restricts the swelling of the long&#8208;chain hydrogel network. In vitro tests verified that this wound dressing can provide durable protection for intraoral wounds against complex irritations. Furthermore, accelerated wound healing occurred when the wound dressing is applied in vivo on a canine tooth extraction model, due to the effective reduction of acute inflammation. These results suggest that this family of bioinspired hydrogels has great potential for application as intraoral wound dressing.

&lt;p&gt;Due to the wet and dynamic environment of the oral cavity, the healing of intraoral wounds, such as tooth extraction wounds, requires stable and firm wound dressings. In clinical practice, cotton balls and &lt;b&gt;gauze&lt;/b&gt;s, sponge plugs, or sutures are used to treat extraction wounds, but none of these means can continuously isolate the wound from the intraoral environment and facilitate ideal healing conditions. Herein, inspired by the natural extracellular matrix, a family of wound dressings is developed for intraoral wound repair. Infiltrating a ductile long-chain hydrogel network into a prefabricated, sturdy macromolecular meshwork and in situ crosslinking endowed the composite hydrogel with controllable swelling behaviors and robust mechanical properties. The macromolecular meshwork functioned as the backbone to support the composite and restricts the swelling of the long-chain hydrogel network. In vitro tests verified that this wound dressing can provide durable protection for intraoral wounds against complex irritations. Furthermore, accelerated wound healing occurred when the wound dressing is applied in vivo on a canine tooth extraction model, due to the effective reduction of acute inflammation. These results suggest that this family of bioinspired hydrogels has great potential for application as intraoral wound dressing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyvalent Peptide CD40 Nano&#8208;agonist for Targeted Modulation of Dendritic Cells and Amplified Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Targeted immunomodulation through biomolecule&#8208;based nanostructures, especially to dendritic cells (DCs) holds great promise for effective cancer therapy. However, construction of high&#8208;performance agonist by mimicking natural ligand to activate immune cell signaling is a great challenge so far. Here, we describe a peptide&#8208;based nano&#8208;agonist towards CD40 (PVA&#8208;CD40) with preorganized interfacial topological structure that activates lymph node DCs efficiently and persistently, achieving amplified immune therapeutic efficacy. The on&#8208;site fabrication of PVA&#8208;CD40 is realized through the click conjugation of two functional peptides including the &#8220;CD40 anchoring arm&#8221; and the &#8220;assembly&#8208;driving motor&#8221;. The resultant polyvalent interface rapidly triggers the receptor oligomerization and downstream signaling. Strikingly, one shot administration of PVA&#8208;CD40 elicits maturation period of DCs up to 2.3&#8208;fold comparing to that of CD40 antibody. Finally, combining the PVA&#8208;CD40 with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in subsequent inhibition of tumour growth in both B16F10 and 4T1 mice tumour models with survival rate up to 37%, whilst none of the mice survive in clinically relevant CD40 mAb and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 combination&#8208; treated group. We envision that the fabrication of antibody&#8208;like superstructures in vivo provides an efficient platform for modulating the duration of immune response to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy.

However, construction of high-performance agonist by mimicking natural ligand to activate immune cell signaling is a great challenge so far. Here, we describe a peptide-based nano-agonist towards CD40 (PVA-CD40) with preorganized interfacial topological structure that activates lymph node DCs efficiently and persistently, achieving amplified immune therapeutic efficacy. The on-site fabrication of PVA-CD40 is realized through the click conjugation of two functional peptides including the &#8220;CD40 anchoring arm&#8221; and the &#8220;assembly-driving motor&#8221;. The resultant polyvalent interface rapidly triggers the receptor oligomerization and downstream signaling. Strikingly, one shot administration of PVA-CD40 elicits maturation period of DCs up to 2.3-fold comparing to that of CD40 antibody. Finally, combining the PVA-CD40 with anti-PD-1 antibody results in subsequent inhibition of tumour growth in both B16F10 and 4T1 mice tumour models with survival rate up to 37%, whilst none of the mice survive in clinically relevant CD40 mAb and anti-PD-1 combination- treated group.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Phonon Coupling in Ferromagnetic Monolayer Chromium Tribromide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8211;phonon coupling in monolayer chromium tribromide is investigated via Raman spectroscopy in combination with first principle calculations. The experimental Curie temperature and phonon shifts are in good agreement with numerical simulations. This work demonstrates how magnetic exchange interactions affect the phonon vibrations and establishes the missing guidelines for the design of the 2D magnetic materials and related devices.








Abstract
Novel 2D magnets exhibit intrinsic electrically tunable magnetism down to the monolayer limit, which has significant value for nonvolatile memory and emerging computing device applications. In these compounds, spin&#8211;phonon coupling (SPC) typically plays a crucial role in magnetic fluctuations, magnon dissipation, and ultimately establishing long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. However, a systematic understanding of SPC in 2D magnets that combines theory and experiment is still lacking. In this work, monolayer chromium tribromide is studied to investigate SPC in 2D magnets via Raman spectroscopy and first principle calculations. The experimental Curie temperature and phonon shifts are found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Specifically, it is demonstrated how magnetic exchange interactions affect phonon vibrations, which helps establish design fundamentals for 2D magnetic materials and other related devices.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Active Control of Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Q Terahertz Photonic Topological Cavities</title>

Abstract
Rapid scaling of semiconductor devices has led to an increase in the number of processor cores and integrated functionalities onto a single chip to support the growing demands of high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;volume consumer electronics. To meet this burgeoning demand require an improved interconnect capacities in terms of bandwidth density and active tunability for enhanced throughput and energy efficiency. Low&#8208;loss terahertz silicon interconnects with larger bandwidth offers a solution for existing inter/intra chip bandwidth density and energy efficiency bottleneck. Here, we present a low&#8208;loss terahertz topological interconnect&#8208;cavity system that can actively route signals through sharp bends, by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106. The topologically protected large Q factor cavity enables energy&#8208;efficient optical control showing 50&#160;dB modulation. We further demonstrate the dynamic control of the critical coupling between the topological interconnect&#8208;cavity for on&#8208;chip active tailoring of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation through complete suppression of the back reflections. The on&#8208;chip topological cavity is CMOS&#8208;compatible and highly desirable for hybrid electronic&#8208;photonic technologies for sixth (6G) generation terahertz communication devices. Ultra&#8208;high&#8208;Q cavity also paves the path for designing topological lasers, quantum circuits, and nonlinear topological photonics.

         <title>Mesoporous Single Crystals with Fe&#8208;Rich Skin for Ultralow Overpotential in Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A screw&#8208;dislocation&#8208;driven spiral growth with micelle adsorption to synthesize mesoporous single&#8208;crystal hydroxides, in which abundant edge sites and single&#8208;crystal properties boost oxygen evolution reaction catalysis, is presented. An ultralow &#951;10 of 185&#160;mV, turnover frequency based on Fe atom as high as 16.9 s&#8211;1 at an overpotential of 350&#160;mV, and excellent catalysis stability are achieved.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction in water splitting and metal&#8211;air batteries, and transition metal hydroxides have demonstrated the most electrocatalytic efficiency. Making the hydroxides thinner for more surface commonly fails to increase the active site number, because the real active sites are the edges. Up to now, the overpotentials of most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (&#951;10) are still larger than 200&#160;mV. Herein, a novel design of mesoporous single crystal (MSC) with an Fe&#8208;rich skin to boost the OER is shown. The edges around the mesopores provide lots of real active sites and the Fe modification on these sites further improves the intrinsic activity. As a result, an ultralow &#951;10 of 185&#160;mV is achieved, and the turnover frequency based on Fe atoms is as high as 16.9 s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 350&#160;mV. Moreover, the catalyst has an excellent catalytic stability, indicated by a negligible current drop after 10&#8239;000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The catalyst enables Zn&#8211;air batteries to run stably over 270 h with a low charge voltage of 1.89&#160;V. This work shows that MSC materials can provide new opportunities for the design of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Volumetric Bioprinting of Organoids and Optically Tuned Hydrogels to Build Liver&#8208;Like Metabolic Biofactories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven volumetric bioprinting enables the layerless fabrication of constructs embedding human liver organoids. Bioresins with tunable refractive index allow printing of centimeter&#8208;scale tissue analogs at high cell density in below 20 s. Organoids mature into hepatocytic structures with native&#8208;like polarization. Bioprinted mathematically defined architectures modulate liver functions such as ammonia detoxification in a geometry&#8208;dependent manner, opening new possibilities for liver biofabrication.








Abstract
Organ&#8208; and tissue&#8208;level biological functions are intimately linked to microscale cell&#8211;cell interactions and to the overarching tissue architecture.

&lt;p&gt;Visible-light-driven volumetric bioprinting enables the layerless fabrication of constructs embedding human liver organoids. Bioresins with tunable refractive index allow printing of centimeter-scale tissue analogs at high cell density in below 20 s. Organoids mature into hepatocytic structures with native-like polarization. Bioprinted mathematically defined architectures modulate liver functions such as ammonia detoxification in a geometry-dependent manner, opening new possibilities for liver biofabrication.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organ- and tissue-level biological functions are intimately linked to microscale cell&#8211;cell interactions and to the overarching tissue architecture. Together, biofabrication and organoid technologies offer the unique potential to engineer multi-scale living constructs, with cellular microenvironments formed by stem cell self-assembled structures embedded in customizable bioprinted geometries. This study introduces the volumetric bioprinting of complex organoid-laden constructs, which capture key functions of the human liver.

Optically tuned bioresins enable refractive index matching of specific intracellular structures, countering the disruptive impact of cell-mediated light scattering on printing resolution. This layerless, nozzle-free technique poses no harmful mechanical stresses on organoids, resulting in superior viability and morphology preservation post-printing. Bioprinted organoids undergo hepatocytic differentiation showing albumin synthesis, liver-specific enzyme activity, and remarkably acquired native-like polarization.

         <title>Topological Antiferromagnetic Van der Waals Phase in Topological Insulator/Ferromagnet Heterostructures Synthesized by a CMOS&#8208;Compatible Sputtering Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Study of topological magnetic phases formed in topological insulators coupled with a ferromagnet is performed on a high&#8208;quality c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented Bi2Te3 thin film grown using a magnetron sputtering process. A topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 is revealed in the interface of Bi2Te3 coupled with the ferromagnet, Ni80Fe20. The Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is found to contain Ni&#8722;Te bonds and shows evidence of the formation of the topological AFM compound NiBi2Te4.








Abstract
Breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry by introducing magnetic order, thereby opening a gap in the topological surface state bands, is essential for realizing useful topological properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. In this work, a novel topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is created at the interface of a sputtered, c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented, topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructure&#8212;Bi2Te3/Ni80Fe20 because of diffusion of Ni in Bi2Te3 (Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3). The AFM property of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interfacial layer is established by observation of spontaneous exchange bias in the magnetic hysteresis loop and compensated moments in the depth profile of the magnetization using polarized neutron reflectometry. Analysis of the structural and chemical properties of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is carried out using selected&#8208;area electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies, in parallel with first&#8208;principles calculations, indicate a solid&#8208;state chemical reaction that leads to the formation of Ni&#8722;Te bonds and the presence of topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) compound NiBi2Te4 in the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interface layer. The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is &#8776;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway toward industrial complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;process&#8208;compatible sputtered&#8208;MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change&#8208;Enabled, Rapid, High&#8208;Resolution Direct Ink Writing of Soft Silicone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel direct ink writing (DIW) method for 3D printing high&#8208;resolution soft silicones, enabled by the fast control of phase&#8208;change ink's flow behavior is presented. Printed filaments with a diameter of 50 &#181;m set a new benchmark in DIW of soft silicone. This technology exhibits excellent performances in the fabrication of flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape&#8208;memory bionic devices.








Abstract
Soft silicone is an ideal flexible material for application, e.g., in soft robotics, flexible electronics, bionics, or implantable biomedical devices. However, gravity&#8208;driven sagging, filament stretching, and deformation can cause inevitable defects during rapid manufacturing, making it hard to obtain complex, high&#8208;resolution 3D silicone structures with direct ink writing (DIW) technology. Here, rapid DIW of soft silicone enabled by a phase&#8208;change&#8208;induced, reversible change of the ink's hierarchical microstructure is presented. During printing, the silicone&#8208;based ink, containing silica nanoparticles and wax microparticles, is extruded from a heated nozzle into a cold environment under controlled stress. The wax phase change (solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid) during printing rapidly destroys and rebuilds the particle networks, realizing fast control of the ink flow behavior and printability. This high&#8208;operating&#8208;temperature DIW method is fast (maximum speed &#8776;3100&#160;mm min&#8722;1) and extends the DIW scale range of soft silicone. The extruded filaments have small diameters (50&#160;&#177; 5&#160;&#181;m), and allow for large spans (&#8776;13&#8208;fold filament diameter) and high aspect ratios (&#8776;1), setting a new benchmark in the DIW of soft silicone. Printed silicone structures exhibit excellent performance as flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape&#8208;memory bionic devices, illustrating the potential of the new 3D printing strategy.

         <title>Supported Lipid Bilayers Coupled to Organic Neuromorphic Devices Modulate Short&#8208;Term Plasticity in Biomimetic Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomembrane&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is fabricated and the short&#8208;term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such devices pave the way to synapse&#8208;resembling platforms to investigate neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.








Abstract
Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental process for neuronal communication and is involved in neurodegeneration. This process has been recently exploited to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation bioelectronic platforms. Neuromorphic devices have emerged as ideal candidates in mimicking brain functionalities, thanks to their ionic&#8208;to&#8208;electronic signal transduction, biocompatibility, and their ability to display short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory as biological synapses. However, these devices still fail in bridging the gap between electronics and biological systems due to the lack of biomimetic features. Here, a biomembrane&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is implemented and the supported&#8208;lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;mediated short&#8208;term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such biomimetic neuromorphic devices pave the way toward the implementation of synapses&#8208;resembling in vitro platforms to investigate and characterize neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Reconfiguration&#8208;Induced NiS/NiFe2O4 Composite for Performance&#8208;Enhanced Zinc&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase&#8208;reconfiguration process is fulfilled by a facile vacancy fabrication and a rapid aggregation of NiS on NiFe2O4. At the dense interface of the substrate and the in situ reconfigurable phase, the activated Ni atom shared by two phases in the interface can adsorb OH more easily and therefore affords a Zn&#8722;air battery (ZAB) with outstanding performance.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The phase-reconfiguration process is fulfilled by a facile vacancy fabrication and a rapid aggregation of NiS on NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. At the dense interface of the substrate and the in situ reconfigurable phase, the activated Ni atom shared by two phases in the interface can adsorb OH more easily and therefore affords a Zn&#8722;air battery (ZAB) with outstanding performance.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Uniform 1&#8208;nm&#8208;Level Amorphous Carbon Layers from 3D Conformal Polymer Brushes. A &#8220;Next&#8208;Generation&#8221; Cu Diffusion Barrier?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uniform 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level of amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer as a diffusion barrier for Cu interconnects is obtained by the &#8220;self&#8208;limited&#8221; grafting of a polystyrene brush on oxide dielectric followed by UV crosslinking then carbonization. This approach for generating large area, ultra&#8208;uniform, and ultrathin polymer coatings shows promise for many new research directions and for a broad array of applications.








Abstract
A reliable method for preparing a conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer with a thickness of 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level, is tested as a possible Cu diffusion barrier layer for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density semiconductor device miniaturization. A polystyrene brush of uniform thickness is grafted onto 4&#8208;inch SiO2/Si wafer substrates with &#8220;self&#8208;limiting&#8221; chemistry favoring such a uniform layer. UV crosslinking and subsequent carbonization transforms this polymer film into an ultrathin a&#8208;C layer without pinholes or hillocks. The uniform coating of nonplanar regions or surfaces is also possible. The Cu diffusion &#8220;blocking ability&#8221; is evaluated by time&#8208;dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests using a metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure. A 0.82&#160;nm&#8208;thick a&#8208;C barrier gives TDDB lifetimes 3.3&#215; longer than that obtained using the conventional 1.0&#160;nm&#8208;thick TaNx diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a&#8208;C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom&#8208;scale thickness, and, when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.

         <title>Peritoneum&#8208;Inspired Janus Porous Hydrogel with Anti&#8208;Deformation, Anti&#8208;Adhesion, and Pro&#8208;Healing Characteristics for Abdominal Wall Defect Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peritoneum&#8208;inspired Janus porous poly(vinyl alchohol) (PVA) hydrogel patch with unique asymmetric cell&#8208;adhesion behaviors and excellent anti&#8208;swelling characteristics demonstrates anti&#8208;adhesion, pro&#8208;healing, and anti&#8208;deformation properties simultaneously, leading to superior repair effect of abdominal wall defects.








Abstract
Implantable meshes used in tension&#8208;free repair operations facilitate treatment of internal soft&#8208;tissue defects. However, clinical meshes fail to achieve anti&#8208;deformation, anti&#8208;adhesion, and pro&#8208;healing properties simultaneously, leading to undesirable surgery outcomes. Herein, inspired by the peritoneum, a novel biocompatible Janus porous poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel (JPVA hydrogel) is developed to achieve efficient repair of internal soft&#8208;tissue defects by a facile yet efficient strategy based on top&#8208;down solvent exchange. The densely porous and smooth bottom&#8208;surface of JPVA hydrogel minimizes adhesion of fibroblasts and does not trigger any visceral adhesion, and its loose extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like porous and rough top&#8208;surface can significantly improve fibroblast adhesion and tissue growth, leading to superior abdominal wall defect treatment to commercially available PP and PCO meshes. With unique anti&#8208;swelling property (maximum swelling ratio: 6.4%), JPVA hydrogel has long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;deformation performance and maintains high mechanical strength after immersion in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) for 14 days, enabling tolerance to the maximum abdominal pressure in an internal wet environment. By integrating visceral anti&#8208;adhesion and defect pro&#8208;healing with anti&#8208;deformation, the JPVA hydrogel patch shows great prospects for efficient internal soft&#8208;tissue defect repair.

         <title>A Bioinspired Five&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozyme for Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A melamine&#8208;mediated pyrolysis activation strategy is reported for the fabrication of a single&#8208;atom iron nanozyme containing a five&#8208;coordinated structure (FeN5). The catalytic efficiency of FeN5 with optimized coordination structure is significantly higher than traditional four&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom iron nanozyme (FeN4) and Fe3O4 nanozyme. As a proof of concept, FeN5 SAzyme achieves effective killing of tumor cells, and significantly prolongs the survival of mice in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) represent a new research frontier in the biomedical fields. The rational design and controllable synthesis of SAzymes with well&#8208;defined electronic and geometric structures are essential for maximizing their enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity and therapeutic efficacy but remain challenging. Here, a melamine&#8208;mediated pyrolysis activation strategy is reported for the controllable fabrication of iron&#8208;based SAzyme containing five&#8208;coordinated structure (FeN5), identified by transmission electron microscopy imaging and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses. The FeN5 SAzyme exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity owing to the optimized coordination structure, and the corresponding catalytic efficiency of Fe&#8208;species in the FeN5 SAzyme is 7.64 and 3.45 &#215; 105 times higher than those in traditional FeN4 SAzyme and Fe3O4 nanozyme, respectively, demonstrated by steady&#8208;state kinetic assay. In addition, the catalytic mechanism is jointly disclosed by experimental results and density functional theory studies. The as&#8208;synthesized FeN5 SAzyme demonstrates significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo due to the excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity under tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Stepwise Energy Transfer: Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence from Doped Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process with an intermediate dye is presented, which provides a universal strategy for tuning the luminescence peak by a large margin. Therefore, bright NIR luminescence with a lifetime up to 0.2 s at 810 nm is achieved based on a new triphenylene&#8208;dye&#8208;doped polymer (TP@PVA) with a blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s.








Abstract
Organic near infrared (NIR) persistent&#8208;luminescence systems with bright and long&#8208;lived emission are highly valuable for applications in communication, imaging, and sensors. However, realizing these materials (especially lifetime over 0.1 s) is a challenge, mainly because of non&#8208;radiative quenching of their long&#8208;lived excitons. Herein, a universal strategy of stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for a bright NIR system with remarkable persistent luminescence (up to 0.2 s at 810&#160;nm) is presented, based on a new triphenylene&#8208;dye&#8208;doped polymer (triphenylene&#8208;2&#8208;ylboronic acid@poly(vinyl alcohol) (TP@PVA)) with a persistent blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s.

It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS&#8208;FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS&#8208;FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.

&lt;p&gt;A stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process with an intermediate dye is presented, which provides a universal strategy for tuning the luminescence peak by a large margin. Therefore, bright NIR luminescence with a lifetime up to 0.2 s at 810 nm is achieved based on a new triphenylene-dye-doped polymer (TP@PVA) with a blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic near infrared (NIR) persistent-luminescence systems with bright and long-lived emission are highly valuable for applications in communication, imaging, and sensors. However, realizing these materials (especially lifetime over 0.1 s) is a challenge, mainly because of non-radiative quenching of their long-lived excitons. Herein, a universal strategy of stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for a bright NIR system with remarkable persistent luminescence (up to 0.2 s at 810&#160;nm) is presented, based on a new triphenylene-dye-doped polymer (triphenylene-2-ylboronic acid@poly(vinyl alcohol) (TP@PVA)) with a persistent blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s. This persistent NIR luminescence is demonstrated for application not only in NIR anti-counterfeiting but also NIR bioimaging with penetrating a piece of skin as thick as 2.0&#160;mm. By co-doping a red dye (such as Nile red) and an NIR dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) into this doped PVA film, the shortage of spectral overlap between TP emission and Cy7 absorbance is successfully solved, through a stepwise FRET process involving triplet to singlet (TS)-FRET from TP to the intermediate red dye and then singlet to singlet (SS)-FRET to Cy7. It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS-FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS-FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Electron Polarization of Nanozymes with a Human Self&#8208;Generated Electric Field for Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A human self&#8208;generated electric&#8208;field&#8208;promoted system for improving cancer catalytic therapy is designed. The human self&#8208;generated electric field increases the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the covalent organic framework nanozyme by about fourfold to produce hydroxyl radicals for efficient cancer therapy.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production efficiencies of the nanocatalysts are highly desired for cancer therapy, but currently the ROS generation efficiency is still far from defecting the tumors. Therefore, improving their ROS generation ability is highly desirable for cancer therapy. Herein, inspired by the electrostatic preorganization effect during the catalysis of natural protein enzymes, a human self&#8208;driven catalysis&#8208;promoting system, TENG&#8208;CatSystem is developed, to improve catalytic cancer therapy. The TENG&#8208;CatSystem is mainly composed of three elements: a human self&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as the electric field stimulator to provide electric pulses with high biosafety, a nanozyme comprising a 1D ferriporphyrin covalent organic framework coated on a carbon nanotube (COF&#8208;CNT) to generate ROS, and a COF&#8208;CNT&#8208;embedded conductive hydrogel that can be injected into the tumor tissues to increase local accumulation of COF&#8208;CNT and decrease the electrical impedances of tissues. Under the human self&#8208;generated electric field provided by the wearable TENG, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the COF&#8208;CNT is fourfold higher than that without an electric field. Highly malignant 4T1 breast carcinoma in mice is significantly suppressed using the TENG&#8208;CatSystem. The human self&#8208;driven TENG&#8208;CatSystem not only demonstrates high catalytic ROS generation efficiency for improved cancer therapy, but also offers a new therapeutic mode for self&#8208;driven at&#8208;home therapy.

         <title>Thermalization of Fluorescent Protein Exciton&#8211;Polaritons at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong exciton&#8211;photon coupling is demonstrated using a red fluorescent protein &#8220;mScarlet&#8221; integrated with a microcavity. The strongly coupled exciton&#8211;polariton system demonstrates nonlinear response along with thermalization and cooling at room temperature. The effective temperature, Teff&#160;&#8776; 350 K close to the lattice temperature indicates strongly thermalized exciton&#8211;polaritons.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have recently emerged as a serious contender for realizing ultralow threshold room temperature exciton&#8211;polariton condensation and lasing. This contribution investigates the thermalization of FP microcavity exciton&#8211;polaritons upon optical pumping under ambient conditions. Polariton cooling is realized using a new FP molecule, called mScarlet, coupled strongly to the optical modes in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. Interestingly, at the threshold excitation energy (fluence) of &#8776;9 nJ per pulse (15.6 mJ cm&#8722;2), an effective temperature is observed, Teff&#160;&#8776; 350 &#177; 35 K close to the lattice temperature indicative of strongly thermalized exciton&#8211;polaritons at equilibrium. This efficient thermalization results from the interplay of radiative pumping facilitated by the energetics of the lower polariton branch and the cavity Q&#8208;factor. Direct evidence for dramatic switching from an equilibrium state into a metastable state is observed for the organic cavity polariton device at room temperature via deviation from the Maxwell&#8211;Boltzmann statistics at k&#8214;&#160;= 0 above the threshold. Thermalized polariton gases in organic systems at equilibrium hold substantial promise for designing room temperature polaritonic circuits, switches, and lattices for analog simulation.

         <title>Ultrafast Sub&#8208;100 fs All&#8208;Optical Modulation and Efficient Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Weyl Semimetal Niobium Phosphide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weyl semimetals are topological materials with promising electronic and optical properties. This work thoroughly characterizes the nonlinear optical properties of the Weyl semimetal niobium phosphide by using third&#8208;harmonic generation and nondegenerate pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy. A measured third&#8208;harmonic generation efficiency of 10&#8722;4% and an ultrafast change in reflectivity of close to 1% paves the way for the coming Weyl&#8208;semimetal&#8208;based nanophotonics.








Abstract
Since their experimental discovery in 2015, Weyl semimetals have generated a large amount of attention due their intriguing physical properties that arise from their linear electron dispersion relation and topological surface states. In particular, in the field of nonlinear (NL) optics and light harvesting, Weyl semimetals have shown outstanding performances and achieved record NL conversion coefficients. In this context, the first steps toward Weyl semimetal nanophotonics are performed here by thoroughly characterizing the linear and NL optical behavior of epitaxially grown niobium phosphide (NbP) thin films, covering the visible to the near&#8208;infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite the measured high linear absorption, third&#8208;harmonic generation studies demonstrate high conversion efficiencies up to 10&#8722;4% that can be attributed to the topological electron states at the surface of the material. Furthermore, nondegenerate pump&#8211;probe measurements with sub&#8208;10 fs pulses reveal a maximum modulation depth of &#8776;1%, completely decaying within 100 fs and therefore suggesting the possibility of developing all&#8208;optical switching devices based on NbP. Altogether, this work reveals the promising NL optical properties of Weyl semimetal thin films, which outperform bulk crystals of the same material, laying the grounds for nanoscale applications, enabled by top&#8208;down nanostructuring, such as light&#8208;harvesting, on&#8208;chip frequency conversion, and all&#8208;optical processing.

         <title>A Quadri&#8208;Dimensional Manipulable Laser with an Intrinsic Chiral Photoswitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser emission with optically dynamic controllable wavelength, wavefront, spin, and orbital angular momentum is achieved, enabled by an intrinsic chiral photoswitch with excellent thermal stability and fatigue&#8208;resistance, thereby exploiting a new way toward information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.








Abstract
Dynamic and multi&#8208;dimensional manipulation of laser emission with light allows for optical coding, computing, and imaging photonic chips. However, the coupling balance between photonic resonance and transmission is a formidable challenge due to the uncontrollable chiral microcavity with photo&#8208;reversibility, which is limited to the multi&#8208;freedom of the laser with sustainable and repeatable output beams. Herein, a helical superstructure system with a unique intrinsic chiral photoswitch is developed for resolving the always pendent problems on organized defects in the microcavity. The unique intrinsic chirality based on the photoswitchable system allows laser emission with a sharp and narrow band&#8208;width, with both remarkable thermodynamic stability and robust fatigue&#8208;resistance. A quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser, featuring wavelength&#8208;tunability, wavefront&#8208;shaping, spin angular momentum (SAM), and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is successfully established with the assistance of the photoresponsive intrinsic chiral superstructure with photoreversibility. This technology marks an important milestone, and sketches a future framework for the realms of nanophotonic information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic and multi-dimensional manipulation of laser emission with light allows for optical coding, computing, and imaging photonic chips. However, the coupling balance between photonic resonance and transmission is a formidable challenge due to the uncontrollable chiral microcavity with photo-reversibility, which is limited to the multi-freedom of the laser with sustainable and repeatable output beams. Herein, a helical superstructure system with a unique intrinsic chiral photoswitch is developed for resolving the always pendent problems on organized defects in the microcavity. The unique intrinsic chirality based on the photoswitchable system allows laser emission with a sharp and narrow band-width, with both remarkable thermodynamic stability and robust fatigue-resistance. A quadri-dimensional manipulable laser, featuring wavelength-tunability, wavefront-shaping, spin angular momentum (SAM), and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is successfully established with the assistance of the photoresponsive intrinsic chiral superstructure with photoreversibility. This technology marks an important milestone, and sketches a future framework for the realms of nanophotonic information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoengineered Neutrophils as a Cellular Sonosensitizer for Visual Sonodynamic Therapy of Malignant Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineered neutrophil sonosensitizers are developed for visual sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of solid malignant tumors. Acouscyte/O2 not only has an enhanced multilevel active targeting but also provides oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, maintain the appearance, and real&#8208;time multimode imaging, which provides a promising theranostic strategy for solid malignant tumors.








Abstract
The rapid evolution of cell&#8208;based theranostics has attracted extensive attention due to their unique advantages in biomedical applications. However, the inherent functions of cells alone cannot meet the needs of malignant tumor treatment. Thus endowing original cells with new characteristics to generate multifunctional living cells may hold a tremendous promise. Here, the nanoengineering method is used to combine customized liposomes with neutrophils, generating oxygen&#8208;carrying sonosensitizer cells with acoustic functions, which are called Acouscyte/O2, for the visual diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Specifically, oxygen&#8208;carried perfluorocarbon and temoporfin are encapsulated into cRGD peptide modified multilayer liposomes (C&#8208;ML/HPT/O2), which are then loaded into live neutrophils to obtain Acouscyte/O2. Acouscyte/O2 can not only carry a large amount of oxygen but also exhibits the ability of long circulation, inflammation&#8208;triggered recruitment, and decomposition. Importantly, Acouscyte/O2 can be selectively accumulated in tumors, effectively enhancing tumor oxygen levels, and triggering anticancer sonodynamics in response to ultrasound stimulation, leading to complete obliteration of tumors and efficient extension of the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with minimal systemic adverse effects. Meanwhile, the tumors can be monitored in real time by temoporfin&#8208;mediated fluorescence imaging and perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;microbubble&#8208;enhanced ultrasound imaging. Therefore, the nanoengineered neutrophils, i.e., Acouscyte/O2, are a new type of multifunctional cellular drug, which provides a new platform for the diagnosis and sonodynamic therapy of solid malignant tumors.

         <title>Electrostatically Driven Polarization Flop and Strain&#8208;Induced Curvature in Free&#8208;Standing Ferroelectric Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic and elastic interactions between the constituent layers in free&#8208;standing ferroelectric superlattices can lead to new polarization arrangements and macroscopic curvature of the sample. In this work, the complex domain structure of ferroelectric microtubes and its response to mechanical deformation is studied using a variety of techniques, paving the way for a combined strain and electrostatic approach to engineering highly responsive materials.








Abstract
The combination of strain and electrostatic engineering in epitaxial heterostructures of ferroelectric oxides offers many possibilities for inducing new phases, complex polar topologies, and enhanced electrical properties. However, the dominant effect of substrate clamping can also limit the electromechanical response and often leaves electrostatics to play a secondary role. Releasing the mechanical constraint imposed by the substrate can not only dramatically alter the balance between elastic and electrostatic forces, enabling them to compete on par with each other, but also activates new mechanical degrees of freedom, such as the macroscopic curvature of the heterostructure. In this work, an electrostatically driven transition from a predominantly out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized to an in&#8208;plane polarized state is observed when a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice with a SrRuO3 bottom electrode is released from its substrate. In turn, this polarization rotation modifies the lattice parameter mismatch between the superlattice and the thin SrRuO3 layer, causing the heterostructure to curl up into microtubes. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based scanning X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, Raman scattering, piezoresponse force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the crystalline structure and domain patterns of the curved superlattices are investigated, revealing a strong anisotropy in the domain structure and a complex mechanism for strain accommodation.

         <title>Folding and Fracture of Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene Grown on a Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented and long graphene folds are spontaneously formed in chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal graphene film on a Cu(111) foil surface, and this is triggered by the formation of highly ordered bunched Cu steps under the graphene. Such folds are fractured into &#8220;back&#8208;and&#8208;forth&#8221; subfold patterns at bunched Cu step edge regions, with cracks propagating along zigzag or armchair directions.








Abstract
A single&#8208;crystal graphene film grown on a Cu(111) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has ribbon&#8208;like fold structures. These graphene folds are highly oriented and essentially parallel to each other. Cu surface steps underneath the graphene are along the &lt;110&gt;&#160;and &lt;211&gt;&#160;directions, leading to the formation of the arrays of folds. The folds in the single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into alternating patterns. A &#8220;joint&#8221; (an AB&#8208;stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few&#8208;layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal SLG film is simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.

         <title>Highly Conducting and Stretchable Double&#8208;Network Hydrogel for Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue&#8208;like soft bioelectronics requires electrodes with muscle&#8208;like mechanical properties together with high electrical conductivity. However, existing hydrogels cannot well balance the two sides. In this work, an in situ aggregation and densification method is used to make hydrogels with both high electrical conductivity and high stretchability, and the hydrogel is verified to be effective for subcutaneous electromyographic signal recording and nerve stimulation.








Abstract
Conducting polymer hydrogels are promising materials in soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties and the capability of electrical interaction with tissues. However, it is challenging to balance electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability: pure conducting polymer hydrogels are highly conductive, but they are brittle; while incorporating the conducting network with a soft network to form a double network can improve the stretchability, its electrical conductivity significantly decreases. Here, the problem is addressed by concentrating a poorly crosslinked precursor hydrogel with a high content ratio of the conducting polymer to achieve a densified double&#8208;network hydrogel (5.5&#160;wt% conducting polymer), exhibiting both high electrical conductivity (&#8776;10 S cm&#8211;1) and a large fracture strain (&#8776;150%), in addition to high biocompatibility, tissue&#8208;like softness, low swelling ratio, and desired electrochemical properties for bioelectronics. A surface grafting method is further used to form an adhesive layer on the conducting hydrogel, enabling robust and rapid bonding on the tissues. Furthermore, the proposed hydrogel is applied to show high&#8208;quality physiological signal recording and reliable, low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation based on an in vivo rat model. This method provides an ideal strategy for rapid and reliable tissue&#8208;device integration with high&#8208;quality electrical communications.

         <title>Magnetic Soft Millirobots 3D Printed by Circulating Vat Photopolymerization to Manipulate Droplets Containing Hazardous Agents for In Vitro Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulating vat photopolymerization (CVP) platform is developed to print magnetic soft millirobots (MSMRs) with high magnetic loading and high uniformity. CVP is able to 3D print MSMRs with true initial 3D geometry and the capability of reversible 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transformation for locomotion and object manipulation. The CVP&#8208;printed MSMRs are used for automated in vitro diagnostics of carbapenemase&#8208;producing Enterobacteriaceae.








Abstract
3D printing via vat photopolymerization (VP) is a highly promising approach for fabricating magnetic soft millirobots (MSMRs) with accurate miniature 3D structures; however, magnetic filler materials added to resin either strongly interfere with the photon energy source or sediment too fast, resulting in the nonuniformity of the filler distribution or failed prints, which limits the application of VP. To this end, a circulating vat photopolymerization (CVP) platform that can print MSMRs with high uniformity, high particle loading, and strong magnetic response is presented. After extensive characterization of materials and 3D printed parts, it is found that SrFe12O19 is an ideal magnetic filler for CVP and can be printed with 30% particle loading and high uniformity. By using CVP, various tethered and untethered MSMRs are 3D printed monolithically and demonstrate the capability of reversible 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transformation and liquid droplet manipulation in 3D, an important task for in vitro diagnostics that are not shown with conventional MSMRs. A fully automated liquid droplet handling platform that manipulates droplets with MSMR is presented for detecting carbapenem antibiotic resistance in hazardous biosamples as a proof of concept, and the results agree with the benchmark.

         <title>Constructing Structurally Ordered High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles on Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Mesoporous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally ordered high&#8208;entropy alloy (OHEA) nanoparticles (NPs) are constructed on a 2D nitrogen&#8208;rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA&#8208;mNC) through ligand&#8208;assisted interfacial assembly with NH3 annealing. The atom&#8208;resolved chemical identification confirms the ordered structure of HEA NPs with an L12 phase. The OHEA&#8208;mNC catalyst affords a greatly enhanced oxygen reduction performance compared with disordered HEA and Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
Recent efforts have observed nanoscaled chemical short&#8208;range order in bulk high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Simultaneously inspired with the nanostructuring technology, HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with complete chemical order may be achieved. Herein, structurally ordered HEA (OHEA) NPs are constructed on a novel 2D nitrogen&#8208;rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA&#8208;mNC) by combining a ligand&#8208;assisted interfacial assembly with NH3 annealing. Characterization results show that the resultant materials possess an ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure with large mesopores (&#8776;10&#160;nm), where structurally ordered HEA NPs with an L12 phase are homogeneously dispersed. The atom&#8208;resolved chemical analyses explicitly determine the location of each atomic site. When being evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction, the OHEA&#8208;mNC NPs afford a greatly enhanced catalytic performance, including a large half&#8208;wave potential (0.90&#160;eV) and a high durability (0.01&#160;V decay after 10 000 cycles) compared with the disordered HEA and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The excellent performance is attributed to the enhanced mass transfer rate, improved electron conductivity, and the presence of the stable chemically ordered HEA phase, as revealed by both the experimental results and theoretical calculation. This study suggests a highly feasible process to achieve structurally ordered HEA NPs with advanced mesoporous function in the electrochemical field.

         <title>Stable and Solution&#8208;Processable Cumulenic sp&#8208;Carbon Wires: A New Paradigm for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cumulenic sp&#8208;carbon wires are employed in large&#8208;area electronics. Transistors based on solution&#8208;processed polycrystalline thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene show ideal p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect behavior, a reliable hole mobility exceeding 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and promising stability in dark conditions, paving the way to a vast library of sp&#8208;hybridized molecular semiconductors.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed, large&#8208;area, and flexible electronics largely relies on the excellent electronic properties of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon molecules, either in the form of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and polymers or graphene and carbon nanotubes. Carbon with sp&#8208;hybridization, the foundation of the elusive allotrope carbyne, offers vast opportunities for functionalized molecules in the form of linear carbon atomic wires (CAWs), with intriguing and even superior predicted electronic properties. While CAWs represent a vibrant field of research, to date, they have only been applied sparingly to molecular devices. The recent observation of the field&#8208;effect in microcrystalline cumulenes suggests their potential applications in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors but concerns surrounding the stability and electronic performance have precluded developments in this direction. In the present study, ideal field&#8208;effect characteristics are demonstrated for solution&#8208;processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene, the shortest semiconducting CAW. Films are deposited through a scalable, large&#8208;area, meniscus&#8208;coating technique, providing transistors with hole mobilities in excess of 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, as well as promising operational stability under dark conditions. These results offer a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast class of molecular semiconductors for organic electronics based on sp&#8208;hybridized carbon systems and create a previously unexplored paradigm.

         <title>Microfluidic Oxidation of Graphite in Two Minutes with Capability of Real&#8208;Time Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow preparation of graphite oxide and the following post&#8208;treatment are achieved in microchannels, allowing the completion of the oxidization in &#8776;2 min and the capability of on&#8208;line monitoring of the oxidation process with Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Graphite oxide and its exfoliated counterpart, graphene oxide, are important precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of graphene&#8208;based materials and many relevant applications. The current batch&#8208;style preparation of graphite oxide suffers from safety concern, long reaction time, and nonuniform product quality, due to the large volume of reactors and slow energy exchange. Reaction in microchannels can largely enhance the oxidization efficiency of graphite due to the enhanced mass transfer and extremely quick energy exchange, by which the controllable oxidization of graphite is achieved in &#8776;2 min. Comprehensive characterizations show that the graphene oxide obtained through the microfluidic strategy has features like those prepared in laboratory beakers and industrial reactors, yet with the higher oxidization degree and more epoxy groups. More importantly, the microfluidic preparation allows for on&#8208;line monitoring of the oxidization by Raman spectroscopy, ready for the dynamical control of reaction condition and product quality. The capability of continuous preparation is also demonstrated by showing the assembly of fibers and reduction of graphene oxide in microfluidic channels, and the applicability of graphene oxide prepared from the microfluidic strategy for thermally and electrically conductive films.

A flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine microbattery with &gt;1500&#160;mWh cm&#8722;3 volumetric energy density and &gt;2000 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 areal energy density is developed by a simple and effective strategy where an iodine cathode is generated in situ during charging. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power&#8208;source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.








Abstract
Currently, reported aqueous microbatteries (MBs) only show unsatisfactory electrochemical performance (&#8804;120 mWh cm&#8722;3 volumetric energy density and &lt;1000&#160;&#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 areal energy density) and it remains challenging to develop durable aqueous MBs that can simultaneously offer both high volumetric and areal energy density. Herein, an in situ electrodeposition strategy is adopted to construct a flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine MB (ZIDMB). Notably, the fabrication process well avoids the use of common additives (such as binders, conductive agents, and toxic solvent) and also bypasses subsequent time&#8208;consuming procedures such as grinding, coating, drying, etc., thus greatly simplifying the manufacture of the ZIDMB. Meanwhile, owing to the suppression of the shuttle effect of triiodide ions and the high ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte, the ZIDMB can simultaneously deliver record&#8208;high volumetric and areal energy densities of 1647.3 mWh cm&#8722;3 and 2339.1 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2, thus achieving values at least 13.5&#8208; and 2.3&#8208;fold better than those of best available aqueous MBs, respectively. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power&#8208;source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.

         <title>Jammed Micro&#8208;Flake Hydrogel for Four&#8208;Dimensional Living Cell Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>

Single&#8208;component jammed micro&#8208;flake hydrogels (MFHs)&#160;are developed as cell&#8208;laden bioinks for 4D bioprinting. Cytocompatible&#160;MFH&#160;bioinks without the need of additional fillers are rheologically favorable for bioprinting via smooth direct ink writing. A controllable cross&#8208;linking gradient in the 3D printed bioconstructs is achieved, enabling predefined shape transformations. 4D tissue engineering is demonstrated in a 4D cartilage&#8208;like tissue regeneration study.








Abstract
4D bioprinting is promising to build cell&#8208;laden constructs (bioconstructs) with complex geometries and functions for tissue/organ regeneration applications. The development of hydrogel&#8208;based 4D bioinks, especially those allowing living cell printing, with easy preparation, defined composition, and controlled physical properties is critically important for 4D bioprinting. Here, a single&#8208;component jammed micro&#8208;flake hydrogel (MFH) system with heterogeneous size distribution, which differs from the conventional granular microgel, has been developed as a new cell&#8208;laden bioink for 4D&#160;bioprinting. This jammed cytocompatible MFH features scalable production and straightforward composition with shear&#8208;thinning, shear&#8208;yielding, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. As such, it can be smoothly printed into stable 3D&#160;bioconstructs, which can be further cross&#8208;linked to form a gradient in cross&#8208;linking density when a photoinitiator and a UV absorber are incorporated. After being subject to shape morphing, a variety of complex bioconstructs with well&#8208;defined configurations and high cell viability are obtained. Based on this system, 4D&#160;cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation is demonstrated as a&#160;proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The establishment of this versatile new 4D bioink system may open up a&#160;number of applications in tissue engineering.

         <title>Open&#8208;Shell Nanosensitizers for Glutathione Responsive Cancer Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;based nanosensitizer (Cu(II)NS) is synthesized for sonodynamic therapy. Cu(II)NS has an unpaired electron (open shell) with a doublet ground state and little sonosensitivity. Overexpressed glutathione in tumors can reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), leading to a singlet ground state and recuperative sonosensitivity. Through regulating the valence states of Cu, tumor therapy with enhanced therapeutic index is achieved.








Abstract
Deleterious effects to normal tissues and short biological half&#8208;life of sonosensitizers limit the applications of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, a new sonosensitizer (Cu(II)NS) is synthesized that consists of porphyrins, chelated Cu2+, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to overcome the challenges of SDT. As Cu2+ contains 27&#160;electrons, Cu(II)NS has an unpaired electron (open shell), resulting in a doublet ground state and little sonosensitivity. Overexpressed glutathione in the tumor can reduce Cu2+ to generate Cu(I)NS, leading to a singlet ground state and recuperative sonosensitivity. Additionally, PEG endows Cu(II)NS with increased blood biological half&#8208;life and enhanced tumor accumulation, further increasing the effect of SDT. Through regulating the valence state of Cu, cancer SDT with enhanced therapeutic index is achieved.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metaphosphate&#8208;Like Terminals Enable High&#8208;Capacity MXene Anodes for Ultrafast Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals for Nb4C3 MXene, which double the specific capacity of Nb4C3 MXene for ultrafast Na+ storage, are constructed. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities to alleviate the energy&#8722;power trade&#8208;off often faced by energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, so&#8208;called MXenes, are noted as ideal fast&#8208;charging cation&#8208;intercalation electrode materials, which nevertheless suffer from limited specific capacities. Herein, it is reported that constructing redox&#8208;active phosphorus&#8722;oxygen terminals can be an attractive strategy for Nb4C3 MXenes to remarkably boost their specific capacities for ultrafast Na+ storage. As revealed, redox&#8208;active terminals with a stoichiometric formula of PO2&#8208; display a metaphosphate&#8208;like configuration with each P atom sustaining three P&#63743;O bonds and one P&#63742;O dangling bond. Compared with conventional O&#8208;terminals, metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals empower Nb4C3 (denoted PO2&#8208;Nb4C3) with considerably enriched carrier density (fourfold), improved conductivity (12.3&#8208;fold at 300 K), additional redox&#8208;active sites, boosted Nb redox depth, nondeclined Na+&#8208;diffusion capability, and buffered internal stress during Na+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Consequently, compared with O&#8208;terminated Nb4C3, PO2&#8208;Nb4C3 exhibits a doubled Na+&#8208;storage capacity (221.0 mAh g&#8208;1), well&#8208;retained fast&#8208;charging capability (4.9&#160;min at 80% capacity retention), significantly promoted cycle life (nondegraded capacity over 2000 cycles), and justified feasibility for assembling energy&#8722;power&#8208;balanced Na&#8208;ion capacitors. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities for developing simultaneously high&#8208;capacity and fast&#8208;charging electrodes, alleviating the energy&#8722;power tradeoff typical for energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Engineering Macrophage Exosome Disguised Biodegradable Nanoplatform for Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biodegradable glioblastoma&#8208;tumor&#8208;targeted delivery system CSI@Ex&#8208;A is successfully fabricated for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. The AS1411 engineered macrophage exosome endows CSI@Ex&#8208;A with efficient BBB penetration and good cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting capability. The GSH depletion and O2&#8208;self&#8208;supplying enhanced sonodynamic therapy is achieved.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) exhibits high tissue penetration and negligible radiation damage to normal tissues, and thus emerges as a promising cancer therapeutic modality for glioblastoma (GBM). However, the blood&#8722;brain barrier (BBB) and hypoxic microenvironment greatly limit the SDT efficiency. In this work, a biodegradable nanoplatform (termed as CSI) is fabricated by encapsulating catalase (CAT) into silica nanoparticles (CAT@SiO2) for tumor hypoxia relief, and then loaded with the sonosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG). Inspired by the ability of macrophages to cross the BBB, CSI is further coated with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified macrophage exosomes to form CSI@Ex&#8208;A, which possesses efficient BBB penetration and good cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting capability. After tumor cell endocytosis, highly expressed glutathione (GSH) triggeres biodegradation of the nanoplatform and the released CAT catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. The GSH depletion and O2 self&#8208;supplying effectively enhances the SDT efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the resulting CSI@Ex&#8208;A exhibits good biocompatibility and long circulation time. These findings demonstrate that CSI@Ex&#8208;A may serve as a competent nanoplatform for GBM therapy, with potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Observation of Near&#8208;Intrinsic Exciton Linewidth in Monolayer WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic exciton linewidth in monolayer WS2 is achieved at room temperature by coupling it with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. The dielectric nanosphere is designed to boost the dynamic competition between WS2 exciton and trion decay channels and rebuild the excitonic relaxation processes with suppressed exciton nonradiative recombination. A tunable exciton linewidth is also demonstrated.








Abstract
The homogeneous exciton linewidth, which captures the coherent quantum dynamics of an excitonic state, is a vital parameter in exploring light&#8211;matter interactions in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). An efficient control of the exciton linewidth is of great significance, and in particular of its intrinsic linewidth, which determines the minimum timescale for the coherent manipulation of excitons. However, such a control is rarely achieved in TMDs at room temperature (RT). While the intrinsic A exciton linewidth is down to 7 meV in monolayer WS2, the reported RT linewidth is typically a few tens of meV due to inevitable homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening effects. Here, it is shown that a 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic linewidth can be observed at RT when monolayer WS2 is coupled with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. By boosting the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels in WS2 through the nanosphere&#8208;supported Mie resonances, the coherent linewidth can be tuned from 35 down to 7.18 meV. Such modulation of exciton linewidth and its associated mechanism are robust even in presence of defects, easing the sample quality requirement and providing new opportunities for TMD&#8208;based nanophotonics and optoelectronics.

         <title>An MXene&#8208;Based Metal Anode with Stepped Sodiophilic Gradient Structure Enables a Large Current Density for Rechargeable Na&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deposition&#8208;regulation strategy for Na scaffold is reported to induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of anode. The sodiophilic gradient structure of the new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based scaffold significantly improves the affordability for high current density and areal capacity during the charging/discharging process of a Na&#8722;O2 battery.








Abstract
The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium&#8208;metal batteries such as Na&#8211;O2 batteries. Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (&gt;10 mA cm&#8722;2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h&#8208;Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80&#8722;250&#160;&#181;m). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h&#8208;Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na&#8208;based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm&#8722;2) and a high cut&#8208;off capacity (40 mAh cm&#8722;2). Moreover, a Na&#8211;O2 battery with an h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137&#160;V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8722;1 and 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. This deposition&#8208;regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffolds for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Prussian Blue Nanozyme as a Pyroptosis Inhibitor Alleviates Neurodegeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent intrinsic reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging properties, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) reduces the production of mitochondrial ROS induced by 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), inhibits the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and downstream pyroptosis of microglia, and further rescues the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP&#8208;induced cell and mouse models of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current pharmacological interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unsatisfactory in clinical settings. Inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis represents a potential therapeutic target for the alleviation of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis agonists or antagonists may transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the identification of specific compounds that inhibit pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) is revealed as a pyroptosis inhibitor to alleviate the neurodegeneration in mouse and cell models of PD. PBzyme protects the microglia and neurons against 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). PBzyme alleviates motor deficits, attenuates the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential, and rescues dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of PBzyme reduces dopaminergic degeneration and inhibits neuroinflammation in an MPTP&#8208;induced PD mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that PBzyme reduces the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes and caspase&#8208;1 by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby downregulating gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage as well as inflammatory factor production, and eventually leading to the inhibition of microglia pyroptosis. Overall, this work highlights the neuroprotective effects of PBzyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor and provides valuable mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of electron channels leads to a low Li source utilization for contact prelithiation, and the resultant &#8220;dead Li&#8221; greatly degrades battery performance. Creating more electron channels at the Li source/anode interface not only dissipates the local current density to stabilize the electron channels, but also promotes the reaction kinetics, thus supporting an improved Li utilization for contact prelithiation.








Abstract
Contact prelithiation is strongly considered for compensating the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, exhibiting great potential for ultralong cycle life of working batteries and the application of large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems. However, the utilization of the sacrificial Li source for contact prelithiation is low (&lt;65%). Herein the fundamental mechanism of contact prelithiation is described from the perspective of the Li source/anode interfaces by regulating the initial contact state, and a clear illustration of the pathogeny for capacity attenuation is successfully delivered. Specifically, creating plentiful electron channels is an access to making contact prelithiation with a higher Li utilization, as the mitigated local current density that reduces the etching of Li dissolution and SEI extension on electron channels. A vacuum thermal evaporation for depositing the Li film enables the contact interface to possess an adequate electron channel construction, rendering a Li utilization of 91.0%, and the dead Li yield is significantly reduced in a working battery.

         <title>Micrometer&#8208;Sized SiMgyOx with Stable Internal Structure Evolution for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ element doping approach developed in this research provides not only a promising material (SiMgyOx) as high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion battery anodes with superior properties and low industrialization cost for commercial applications, but also insights on the reasonable structural design of micrometer&#8208;sized alloying anode materials for restraining internal cracks and improving electrochemical performance.








Abstract
In recent years, micrometer&#8208;sized Si&#8208;based anode materials have attracted intensive attention in the pursuit of energy&#8208;storage systems with high energy and low cost. However, the significant volume variation during repeated electrochemical (de)alloying processes will seriously damage the bulk structure of SiOx microparticles, resulting in rapid performance fade. This work proposes to address the challenge by preparing in situ magnesium&#8208;doped SiOx (SiMgyOx) microparticles with stable structural evolution against Li uptake/release. The homogeneous distribution of magnesium silicate in SiMgyOx contributes to building a bonding network inside the particle so that it raises the modulus of lithiated state and restrains the internal cracks due to electrochemical agglomeration of nano&#8208;Si. The prepared micrometer&#8208;sized SiMgyOx anode shows high reversible capacities, stable cycling performance, and low electrode expansion at high areal mass loading. A 21700 cylindrical&#8208;type cell based on the SiMgyOx&#8208;graphite anode and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode demonstrates a 1000&#8208;cycle operation life using industry&#8208;recognized electrochemical test procedures, which meets the practical storage requirements for consumer electronics and electric vehicles. This work provides insights on the reasonable structural design of micrometer&#8208;sized alloying anode materials toward realization of high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Plasma&#8208;Assisted Doping Engineering to Stabilize Metallic Phase MoSe2 for Fast and Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting a novel plasma&#8208;assisted doping&#8208;triggered phase&#8208;transition engineering, stabilized P&#8208;doped metallic phase selenide molybdenum (MoSe2) nanoflower composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs) with expanded interlayer spacing, metallic electronic conductivity, facilitated Na+ adsorption, and reduced Na+ diffusion barrier are fabricated for high&#8208;performance sodium storage. The underlying mechanism analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
Metallic&#8208;phase selenide molybdenum (1T&#8208;MoSe2) has become a rising star for sodium storage in comparison with its semiconductor phase (2H&#8208;MoSe2) owing to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity and unimpeded Na+ diffusion structure. However, the thermodynamically unstable nature of 1T phase renders it an unprecedented challenge to realize its phase control and stabilization. Herein, a plasma&#8208;assisted P&#8208;doping&#8208;triggered phase&#8208;transition engineering is proposed to synthesize stabilized P&#8208;doped 1T phase MoSe2 nanoflower composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs). Mechanism analysis reveals significantly decreased phase&#8208;transition energy barriers of the plasma&#8208;induced Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich MoSe2 from 2H to 1T owing to its low crystallinity and reduced structure stability. The vacancy&#8208;rich structure promotes highly concentrated P doping, which manipulates the electronic structure of the MoSe2 and urges its phase transition, acquiring a high transition efficiency of 91% accompanied with ultrahigh phase stability. As a result, the P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs deliver an exceptional high reversible capacity of 510.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with no capacity fading over 1000 cycles at 5000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for sodium storage. The underlying mechanism of this phase&#8208;transition engineering verified by profound analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Reunderstanding the Reaction Mechanism of Aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn Batteries with Sulfate Electrolytes: Role of the Zinc Sulfate Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;new Zn4SO4&#183;(OH)6&#183;xH2O (ZSH)&#8208;assisted deposition and dissolution reaction model is proposed and validated for aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn batteries in mild sulfate electrolytes. It is shown that MnO2 is not a compulsory cathode; and various metal oxides, including ZSH, ZnO, MgO, and CaO, can be used as the cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn batteries have garnered extensive attention for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, the charge&#8208;storage chemistry of Zn&#8211;Mn batteries remains controversial. Prevailing mechanisms include conversion reaction and cation (de)intercalation in mild acid or neutral electrolytes, and a MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8722;deposition reaction in strong acidic electrolytes. Herein, a Zn4SO4&#183;(OH)6&#183;xH2O (ZSH)&#8208;assisted deposition&#8722;dissolution model is proposed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and capacity origin in Zn&#8211;Mn batteries based on mild acidic sulfate electrolytes. In this new model, the reversible capacity originates from a reversible conversion reaction between ZSH and ZnxMnO(OH)2 nanosheets in which the MnO2 initiates the formation of ZSH but contributes negligibly to the apparent capacity. The role of ZSH in this new model is confirmed by a series of operando characterizations and by constructing Zn batteries using other cathode materials (including ZSH, ZnO, MgO, and CaO). This research may refresh the understanding of the most promising Zn&#8211;Mn batteries and guide the design of high&#8208;capacity aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Reconfigurable Quasi&#8208;Nonvolatile Memory/Subthermionic FET Functions in Ferroelectric&#8211;2D Semiconductor vdW Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new principle for ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor (FeFET) functional reconfiguration by controlling the behaviors of interfacial oxygen vacancies in a prototype 2D van der Waals FeFET is proposed and proved. FeFET with large counterclockwise hysteresis and negative capacitance FET free of hysteresis are realized for memory (neural computing) and low&#8208;power computing, respectively. It paves a new path toward both in&#8208;memory computing and transistor&#8208;memory monolithic integration.








Abstract
The functional reconfiguration of transistors and memory in homogenous ferroelectric devices offers significant opportunities for implementing the concepts of in&#8208;memory computing and logic&#8208;memory monolithic integration. Thus far, reconfiguration is realized through programmable doping profiles in the semiconductor channel using multiple&#8208;gate operation. This complex device architecture limits further scaling to match the overall chip requirements. Here, reconfigurable memory/transistor functionalities in a ferroelectric&#8208;gated van der Waals transistor by controlling the behavior of ferroelectric oxygen vacancies at the interface are demonstrated. Short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory functions are demonstrated by modulating the border oxygen vacancy distribution and the associated charge dynamics. The quasi&#8208;nonvolatile long&#8208;term memory exhibits data retention of over 105 s and endurance of up to 5 &#215; 105 cycles, verifying its applicability as a potential device platform for neuromorphic networks. More importantly, by modulating the ferroelectricity of the interfacial domains with the interactions of oxygen vacancies, a hysteresis&#8208;free logic transistor is realized with a subthermionic subthreshold swing down to 46&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, which resembles a negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistor. The new concept of achieving functional reconfiguration with prior device performance in a single&#8208;gate ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is of great advantage in future integrated circuit applications.

         <title>Intelligent Gold Nanoparticles with Oncogenic MicroRNA&#8208;Dependent Activities to Manipulate Tumorigenic Environments for Synergistic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional spherical nucleic acids are developed to utilize and manipulate the tumorigenic genetic environment, and are able to perform tumor&#8208;specific chain activities including oncogenic miRNAs (miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;155) inhibition, miR&#8208;21&#8208;dependent photothermal therapy, and miR&#8208;155&#8208;triggered chemotherapy for effective, accurate, and sustained tumor treatment.








Abstract
Tumorigenic environments, especially aberrantly overexpressed oncogenic microRNAs, play a critical role in various activities of tumor progression. However, developing strategies to effectively utilize and manipulate these oncogenic microRNAs for tumor therapy is still a challenge. To address this challenge, spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consisting of gold nanoparticles in the core and antisense oligonucleotides as the shell are fabricated. Hybridized to the oligonucleotide shell is a DNA sequence to which doxorubicin is conjugated (DNA&#8208;DOX). The oligonucleotides shell is designed to capture overexpressed miR&#8208;21/miR&#8208;155 and inhibit the expression of these oncogenic miRNAs in tumor cells after tumor accumulation to manipulate genetic environment for accurate gene therapy. This process further induces the aggregation of these SNAs, which not only generates photothermal agents to achieve on&#8208;demand photothermal therapy in situ, but also enlarges the size of SNAs to enhance the retention time in the tumor for sustained therapy. The capture of the relevant miRNAs simultaneously triggers the intracellular release of the DNA&#8208;DOX from the SNAs to deliver tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro results indicate that this combination strategy has excellent tumor inhibition properties with high survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice, and can thus be a promising candidate for effective tumor treatment.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates: A Promising Perspective on a Dual&#8208;Gate Antiambipolar Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable logic circuits are achieved using a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor. Suitable top&#8208; and bottom&#8208;gate voltages demonstrate five logic gate operations: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR. Additionally, by varying the drain voltage, it is possible to electrically switch two logic gates. Thus, the proposed device concept provides a way of realizing multifunctional logic circuits using a simple circuit design.








Abstract
Electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits are promising candidates for realizing new computation architectures, such as artificial intelligence and neuromorphic devices. In this study, multiple logic gate operations are attained based on a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG&#8208;OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;&#8208;shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom&#8208;gate, top&#8208;gate, and drain voltages. This distinctive feature enables multiple logic gate operations with &#8220;only a single DG&#8208;OAAT,&#8221; which are not obtainable in conventional transistors. Five logic gate operations, which correspond to AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR, are demonstrated by adjusting the bottom&#8208;gate and top&#8208;gate voltages. Moreover, varying the drain voltage makes it possible to reversibly switch two logic gates, e.g., NAND/NOR and OR/XOR. In addition, the DG&#8208;OAATs show a high degree of stability and reliability. The logic gate operations are observed even months later. The hysteresis in the transfer curves is also negligible. Thus, the device concept is promising for realizing multifunctional logic circuits with a simple transistor configuration. Hence, these findings are expected to surpass the current limitations in complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor devices.

Conformal Amorphous Carbon
Ultrathin Cu diffusion barriers with high conformality have gained great attention for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density semiconductor device miniaturization. In article number 2110454, Sun Hwa Lee, Rodney S. Ruoff, Ki&#8208;Bum Kim, Sang Ouk Kim, and co&#8208;workers introduce a handy and reliable method for the preparation of conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) barrier layers with nanometer&#8208;level thickness. A polystyrene brush layer is grafted onto a 3D copper structure with self&#8208;limiting chemistry, and subsequent carbonization yields large&#8208;area uniform 1 nm&#8208;level a&#8208;C layers with excellent Cu blocking performance.

Exciton Linewidth
Due to strong multiparticle interactions in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides at room temperature, their homogeneous exciton linewidths are significantly broadened, degrading the quality of their excitonic mode and emission. In article number 2108721, Yuebing Zheng and co&#8208;workers achieve near&#8208;intrinsic exciton linewidth in monolayer WS2 at room temperature, approaching the theoretical limit at 0 K. A dielectric nanosphere is designed to boost the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels, rebuilding the excitonic relaxation processes with suppressed exciton nonradiative recombination.

Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistors
In article number 2200032, Hang Luo, Jian Sun, and co&#8208;workers report how a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor (FeFET) can work as both a hysteresis&#8208;free low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistor and a memory device for neural computing. The functions are reconfigured and controlled by modulating the behaviors of the interfacial oxygen vacancies. The frontispiece shows the chips consisting of the reconfigurable FeFET devices.

Volumetric Bioprinting
Volumetric bioprinting shapes organoid&#8208;laden constructs into centimeter&#8208;scale assemblies that mimic native liver function. In article number 2110054, Riccardo Levato and co&#8208;workers report the development of a hydrogel&#8208;based bioresin with tunable optical properties to minimize scattering in light&#8208;based printing and ensure high resolution. Organoid viability and maturation is preserved by the shear&#8208;stress&#8208;free printing, and salient liver functions mature in response to the 3D bioprinted architecture.

4D Bioprinting
For bioprinting of 4D living tissues, in article number 2109394, Eben Alsberg and co&#8208;workers devise a cell&#8208;laden bioink featuring high&#8208;resolution printing, physiological&#8208;trigger&#8208;enabled shape morphing, and long&#8208;term cell viability and function. With this system, they demonstrate that the printed cell&#8208;rich bioconstructs can exert multidirectional reshaping in a controlled manner and transform and develop into tissues with sophisticated structures. The system is anticipated to advance bioprinting to a horizon that enables 4D biomimetic tissue engineering.

         <title>3D Continuously Porous Graphene for Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D continuously porous graphene formed by folding a single&#8208;sheet graphene into a 3D porous architecture has well&#8208;retained 2D properties of graphene and novel functionalities from 3D structure, representing a distinct class of graphene materials with numerous unique and extraordinary properties. A comprehensive review of 3D continuously porous graphene and their applications in energy conversion and storage is provided.








Abstract
Constructing bulk graphene materials with well&#8208;reserved 2D properties is essential for device and engineering applications of atomically thick graphene. In this article, the recent progress in the fabrications and applications of sterically continuous porous graphene with designable microstructures, chemistries, and properties for energy storage and conversion are reviewed. Both template&#8208;based and template&#8208;free methods have been developed to synthesize the 3D continuously porous graphene, which typically has the microstructure reminiscent of pseudo&#8208;periodic minimal surfaces. The 3D graphene can well preserve the properties of 2D graphene of being highly conductive, surface abundant, and mechanically robust, together with unique 2D electronic behaviors. Additionally, the bicontinuous porosity and large curvature offer new functionalities, such as rapid mass transport, ample open space, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electric/thermal conductivity. Particularly, the 3D curvature provides a new degree of freedom for tailoring the catalysis and transport properties of graphene. The 3D graphene with those extraordinary properties has shown great promises for a wide range of applications, especially for energy conversion and storage. This article overviews the recent advances made in addressing the challenges of developing 3D continuously porous graphene, the benefits and opportunities of the new materials for energy&#8208;related applications, and the remaining challenges that warrant future study.

         <title>Fermi Level Pinning Dependent 2D Semiconductor Devices: Challenges and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New and in&#8208;depth insight into the fundamental mechanism of Fermi level pinning in 2D semiconductor devices is presented in this review. The related device characteristics and contact strategies utilizing both the Fermi level pinning and depinning are introduced.








Abstract
Motivated by the high expectation for efficient electrostatic modulation of charge transport at very low voltages, atomically thin 2D materials with a range of bandgaps are investigated extensively for use in future semiconductor devices. However, researchers face formidable challenges in 2D device processing mainly originated from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) structure of ultrathin 2D materials. As major challenges, untunable Schottky barrier height and the corresponding strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) at metal interfaces are observed unexpectedly with 2D vdW materials, giving rise to unmodulated semiconductor polarity, high contact resistance, and lowered device mobility. Here, FLP observed from recently developed 2D semiconductor devices is addressed differently from those observed from conventional semiconductor devices. It is understood that the observed FLP is attributed to inefficient doping into 2D materials, vdW gap present at the metal interface, and hybridized compounds formed under contacting metals. To provide readers with practical guidelines for the design of 2D devices, the impact of FLP occurring in 2D semiconductor devices is further reviewed by exploring various origins responsible for the FLP, effects of FLP on 2D device performances, and methods for improving metallic contact to 2D materials.

         <title>Critical Review on Low&#8208;Temperature Li&#8208;Ion/Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely and critical review on fundamental mechanisms, recent advances, and design strategies of electrolytes, electrodes, and battery structures for low&#8208;temperature Li batteries is provided.








Abstract
With the highest energy density ever among all sorts of commercialized rechargeable batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have stimulated an upsurge utilization in 3C devices, electric vehicles, and stationary energy&#8208;storage systems. However, a high performance of commercial LIBs based on ethylene carbonate electrolytes and graphite anodes can only be achieved at above &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, which restricts their applications in harsh environments. Here, a comprehensive research progress and in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors leading to the poor low&#8208;temperature performance of LIBs is provided; the distinctive challenges on the anodes, electrolytes, cathodes, and electrolyte&#8211;electrodes interphases are sorted out, with a special focus on Li&#8208;ion transport mechanism therein. Finally, promising strategies and solutions for improving low&#8208;temperature performance are highlighted to maximize the working&#8208;temperature range of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 15, April 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to first provide an overview of the history and parameters of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) materials and analyze the fundamental principles toward rational design of PBAs, and then evaluate the prospects and challenges for PBAs for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hoping to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial reality.








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted wide attention for their application in the energy storage and conversion field due to their low cost, facile synthesis, and appreciable electrochemical performance. At the present stage, most research on PBAs is focused on their material&#8208;level optimization, whereas their properties in practical battery systems are seldom considered. This review aims to first provide an overview of the history and parameters of PBA materials and analyze the fundamental principles toward rational design of PBAs, and then evaluate the prospects and challenges for PBAs for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hoping to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial reality.

         <title>On&#8208;chip Liquid Metal Plug Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Gallium based liquid metal non&#8208;spherical droplets (plugs) have seen increasing demand recently mainly because their high aspect ratios make them beneficial for a wide range of applications including microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidics, sensor technology, radio frequency (RF) devices, actuators and switches. However, reproducibility of the generation of such plugs as well as precise control over their size are yet challenging. In this work, we present a simple on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator using a commercially available 3D microprinter and replicated the plug generator in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) via soft lithography. We generated liquid metal plugs via a combination of electrochemical oxidation, design of well&#8208;defined constrictions based on Laplace pressure, and the application of modulated voltage control signals. We show that plugs of various aspect ratios can be generated reproducibly for channel widths of 0.5&#160;mm, 0.8&#160;mm and 1.5&#160;mm with constriction widths of 0.1&#160;mm at 6&#160;V. We compared Laplace pressure&#8208;controlled plugs in constricted channels to modulated&#8208;voltage generated plugs in straight channels showing that our technique provides significantly enhanced reproducibility and control over the size and spacing between the plugs. This work paves the way to sub&#8208;mm liquid metal plugs generated directly on&#8208;chip for on&#8208;demand MEMS and microfluidic applications.

         <title>Transition Metal Carbo&#8208;Chalcogenide &#8220;TMCC&#8221; a New Family of Two&#8208;dimensional Materials</title>

Abstract
Here we report a new family of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs), which can be considered a combination of two well&#8208;known families, TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs), at the atomic level. Single sheets are successfully obtained from multilayered Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C using electrochemical lithiation followed by sonication in water. The parent multilayered TMCCs are synthesized using a simple, scalable solid&#8208;state synthesis followed by a topochemical reaction. Superconductivity transition is observed at 7.55 K for Nb2S2C. The delaminated Nb2S2C outperforms both multilayered Nb2S2C and delaminated NbS2 as an electrode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Ab initio calculations predict the elastic constant of TMCC to be over 50% higher than that of TMDC.

         <title>Pushing the Natural Frontier: Progress on the Integration of Biomaterial Cues towards Combinatorial Biofabrication and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The engineering of fully functional, biological&#8208;like tissues requires biomaterials to direct cellular events to a near&#8208;native, 3&#8208;Dimensional niche extent. Natural biomaterials are generally seen as a safe option for cell support, but their biocompatibility and biodegradability can be just as limited as their bioactive/biomimetic performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineering of fully functional, biological-like tissues requires biomaterials to direct cellular events to a near-native, 3-Dimensional niche extent. Natural biomaterials are generally seen as a safe option for cell support, but their biocompatibility and biodegradability can be just as limited as their bioactive/biomimetic performance. Furthermore, integrating different biomaterial cues and their final impact on cellular behavior is a complex equation where the outcome might be very different from the sum of individual parts. This review critically analyses recent progress on biomaterial-induced cellular responses, from simple adhesion to more complex stem cell differentiation, looking at the ever-growing possibilities of natural materials modification. Starting with a discussion on native material formulation and the inclusion of cell-instructive cues, we delve into the roles of shape and mechanical stimuli, the susceptibility to cellular remodeling, and the often-overlooked impact of cellular density and cell-cell interactions within constructs. Along the way, synergistic and antagonistic combinations reported in vitro and in vivo are singled out, identifying needs and current lessons on the development of natural biomaterial libraries to solve the cell-material puzzle efficiently.

         <title>Ultrathin van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrTe3 for Fabrication of in&#8208;plane CrTe3/CrTe2 Monolayer Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultrathin Van der Waals (vdW) magnets are heavily pursued for potential applications in developing high&#8208;density miniaturized electronic/spintronic devices as well as for topological physics in low&#8208;dimensional structures. Despite the rapid advances in ultrathin ferromagnetic vdW magnets, the antiferromagnetic counterparts as well as the antiferromagnetic junctions are much less studied owing to the difficulties in both material fabrication and magnetism characterization. Ultrathin CrTe3 layers have been theoretically proposed to be an vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor with intrinsic intralayer antiferromagnetism. Herein, the epitaxial growth of monolayer and bilayer CrTe3 on graphite surface was demonstrated. The structure, electronic and magnetic properties of the monolayer CrTe3 were characterized by combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The CrTe3 monolayers can be further utilized for fabrication of a lateral heterojunction consisting of monolayer CrTe2 and monolayer CrTe3 with atomically sharp and seamless interface. Since monolayer CrTe2 is a metallic vdW magnets, such a heterostructure present the first in&#8208;plane magnetic metal&#8208;semiconductor heterojunction made of two vdW materials. The successful fabrication of ultrathin antiferromagnetic CrTe3 as well as the magnetic heterojunction will stimulate the development of miniaturized antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on vdW materials.

         <title>Coupling localized laser writing and nonlocal recrystallization in perovskite crystals for reversible multi&#8208;dimensional optical encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The abilities to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) with high spatial resolution have been of primary importance for applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics, while the emerging metal halide perovskites offer novel material platforms where diverse photonic functionalities and fine structuring are constantly explored. Herein, micro&#8208;PL patterns consisting of highly luminescent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in non&#8208;luminescent perovskite crystals are directly fabricated by focused femtosecond laser irradiation. The further modulation with a moisture field leads to the selective dissolution of the laser&#8208;destabilized perovskite structures as density functional theory simulations revealed, thus allowing for facile control of the reversible PL from the recrystallization of the CsPbBr3 NCs. By leveraging the coupled laser writing and moisture modulation, multimodal information encryption is realized by reversible encryption&#8208;reading and repeatable erasing&#8208;refreshing. This optical storage mechanism is also extended to three&#8208;dimensional and four&#8208;dimensional by realizing spatially and temporally resolved optical encryption. The coupled multi&#8208;field modulation on perovskite crystals could enable potential applications in optical storage and encryption, and offer a novel solution for the creation and manipulation of localized PL structures with high temporal and spatial resolutions.

         <title>Electrochemical On&#8208;site Switching the Directional Liquid Transport on the Conical Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Directional liquid transport (DLT), especially those proceed on the conical fiber (DLT&#8208;CF), is an important mass&#8208;transfer process widely used in both natural organisms and practical applications. However, on&#8208;site switching the DLT&#8208;CF remains a challenge due to the non&#8208;tunable driving force imparted by the structural gradient, which greatly limits its application. Here, unprecedently, we developed a facile electrochemical strategy for reaching the on&#8208;site switchable DLT&#8208;CF, featured as the in situ control and the fast response. Depending on the poised electric potential, the droplet can either move directionally or be pinned at any position for a tunable duration time, exhibiting completely different moving characteristics from the traditional DLT&#8208;CF with no control. It is proposed that the surface hysteresis resistance, closely related to both the surface hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and the droplet topology on fiber, can be largely altered electrochemically. The tunable hysteresis resistance works synergistically with the conical structure induced Laplace pressure to on&#8208;site tune the forces acting on the droplet, leading to various controllable DLTs&#8208;CF, including those with the tunable distance and direction, the array manipulation and assembly line processing of droplets. The strategy is applicable for versatile liquids, offering a general approach for the controllable liquid transport in fibrous systems.

         <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anode Enabled by Designed Ultra&#8208;Thin MgF2 Nanosheets Encapsulated inside Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene&#8208;Like Hollow Nanospheres</title>

Abstract
Uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth and dramatic volume change during cycling have long been severely impeding the practical applications of Li metal as the ultimate anode. Herein, we ingeniously fabricate ultra&#8208;thin MgF2 nanosheets encapsulated inside nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;like hollow nanospheres (MgF2 NSs@NGHSs) to address these problems by a perfect combination of atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The uniform and continuous Li&#8208;Mg solid&#8208;solution inner layer formed by the MgF2 nanosheets can reduce the nucleation overpotential and induce selective deposition of Li into the cavities of NGHSs. Furthermore, the Li deposition behavior and mechanism of the hybrid host are comprehensively explored by in situ optical microscopy at the macroscopic level, in situ transmission electron microscopy at the microscopic level, and theoretical calculations at the atomic level, respectively. Benefiting from a synergistic modulation strategy of nanosheet seed&#8208;induced nucleation and Li&#8208;confined growth, the designed composite manifests an endurance of 590 cycles for asymmetric cells and a lifespan over 1330 h for corresponding symmetric cells. When applied in LiFePO4 full cells, it provides a reversible capacity of 90.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

         <title>Rigidity&#8208;tuned full&#8208;color Emission: Uncommon Luminescence Change from Polymer free&#8208;volume Variations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Probing the rigidity change of microenvironments via tracking embedded molecular fluorophore emissions represents a robust approach to monitor various polymer microstructural evolutions and biomolecular events with a high spatiotemporal resolution. However, reported fluorophores exclusively blue&#8208;shift their emissions (termed as &#8220;rigidochromism&#8221;) or merely alter intensities upon rigidification, suffering from inferior sensitivities, low&#8208;contrast outputs and attenuated biocompatibilities. Here, we develop phenanthridine&#8208;fused triazatruxene fluorophores (PTFs) with pronounced bathochromic emission (up to 135&#160;nm) towards rigidifying media at a low loading of 5&#160;ppm without sacrificing the quantum&#8208;yields and lifetime. PTFs effectively interact with polymeric matrixes through polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and form charge&#8208;transfer complexes, resulting to a remarkable fluorescent color change from blue to red&#8208;orange over matrix rigidifying. Such a unique anti&#8208;rigidochromism enables a highly sensitive rigidity detection (i.e., a subtle polymer molecular&#8208;weight change (as low as 1000&#160;Da versus up to 10&#160;kDa for conventional probes) could result to obvious emission color changes). PTFs are able to non&#8208;invasively detect polymerization kinetics and in&#8208;situ optically report polymer degradations. The broadly (nearly full&#8208;spectrum) tunable emission and the efficient coupling between anti&#8208;rigidochromism and polymer hierarchical structures/topologies render fluorescence with controlled wavelength and chirality, leading to an unprecedented free&#8208;volume&#8208;based data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology with a super&#8208;high&#8208;security level.

PTFs are able to non-invasively detect polymerization kinetics and &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; optically report polymer degradations. The broadly (nearly full-spectrum) tunable emission and the efficient coupling between anti-rigidochromism and polymer hierarchical structures/topologies render fluorescence with controlled wavelength and chirality, leading to an unprecedented free-volume-based data encryption and anti-counterfeiting technology with a super-high-security level.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>MOF&#8208;COF &#8220;Alloy&#8221; Membrane for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>

Abstract
Molecular sieving membranes from metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for separating olefin/paraffin mixture, a critical demand in sustainable chemical processes and a grand challenge in molecular separations. Currently, the inherent lattice flexibility of MOFs severely compromises their precise sieving ability. Here, we demonstrate a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of &#8220;alloy&#8221; membranes (AMs) which are fabricated by incorporating quaternary ammonium functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) matrix. The Coulomb force between the COFs and ZIF&#8208;8 restricts the linker rotation of ZIF&#8208;8, generating a distinct alloying effect, by which the lattice rigidity of ZIF&#8208;8 can be conveniently tuned through varying the content of COFs, similar to the flexible&#8208;to&#8208;rigid transition in aluminum alloy manufacturing. Such alloying effect confers AMs superior propylene/propane separation performance, with a propylene/propane separation factor surpassing 200 and a propylene permeance of 168 GPU. Hopefully, the &#8220;alloy&#8221; membrane concept and the concomitant alloying effect can update the connotation of mixed matrix membranes and stimulate the re&#8208;envisioning about the design paradigm and development of advanced membranes for energy&#8208;efficient separations.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular sieving membranes from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for separating olefin/paraffin mixture, a critical demand in sustainable chemical processes and a grand challenge in molecular separations. Currently, the inherent lattice flexibility of MOFs severely compromises their precise sieving ability. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of &#8220;alloy&#8221; membranes (AMs) which are fabricated by incorporating quaternary ammonium functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) matrix. The Coulomb force between the COFs and ZIF-8 restricts the linker rotation of ZIF-8, generating a distinct alloying effect, by which the lattice rigidity of ZIF-8 can be conveniently tuned through varying the content of COFs, similar to the flexible-to-rigid transition in aluminum alloy manufacturing.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Artificial Nanocilia Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) is a powerful route to construct higher&#8208;order structures. However, the programmed self&#8208;assembly of NPs into non&#8208;close&#8208;packed, three&#8208;dimensional (3D), shape&#8208;morphing nanocilia arrays remains elusive, whereas dynamically actuated nanometer cilia are universal in living systems. Here, we present a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy that can direct magnetic NPs into a highly ordered responsive artificial nanocilia actuator with exquisite nanometer 3D structural arrangements. The self&#8208;assembled artificial NP cilia can maintain their structural integrity through the interplay of interparticle interactions. Interestingly, the nanocilia can exhibit a field&#8208;responsive actuation motion through &#8220;rolling and sliding&#8221; between assembled NPs rather than bending of the entire ciliary beam. We demonstrate that oleic acid coated over the NPs acts as a lubricating bearing and enables the rolling/sliding&#8208;based actuation of the cilia.

         <title>Are Liquid Metals Bulk Conductors?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the wide variety of electromechanical responses of liquid metal stretchable electronics reported in the literature are reviewed. Complementing this review with&#160;our&#160;own measurements, the relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that of a bulk conductor. Then, possible explanations for the discrepancies are dicussed and suggestions are provided on experimental design for future research.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have potential in wide&#8208;reaching applications including wearables, personal health monitoring, and soft robotics. Many recent advances in stretchable electronics leverage liquid metals, particularly eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn). A variety of EGaIn electromechanical behaviors have been reported, ranging from bulk conductor responses to effectively strain&#8208;insensitive responses. However, numerous measurement techniques have been used throughout the literature, making it difficult to directly compare the various proposed formulations. Here, the electromechanical responses of EGaIn found in the literature is reviewed and pure EGaIn is investigated using three electrical resistance measurement techniques: four point probe, two point probe, and Wheatstone bridge. The results indicate substantial differences in measured electromechanical behavior between the three methods, which can largely be accounted for by correcting for a fixed offset corresponding to the resistances of various parts of the measurement circuits. Yet, even accounting for several of these sources of experimental error, the average relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that predicted by the commonly used bulk conductor assumption, referred to as Pouillet's law. Building upon recent theories proposed in the literature, possible explanations for the discrepancies are discussed. Finally, suggestions are provided on experimental design to enable reproducible and interpretable research.

         <dc:description>
Materials with tunable optical properties play a vital role in wearable epidermal sensors with visible readouts, especially in health monitoring. The recent progress, fabrication, and applications of these materials for wearable epidermal sensors are summarized and discussed. A summary of the key challenges and perspectives for the next generation wearable devices is also proposed.








Abstract
Advances in wearable epidermal sensors have revolutionized the way that physiological signals are captured and measured for health monitoring. One major challenge is to convert physiological signals to easily readable signals in a convenient way. One possibility for wearable epidermal sensors is based on visible readouts. There are a range of materials whose optical properties can be tuned by parameters such as temperature, pH, light, and electric fields. Herein, this review covers and highlights a set of materials with tunable optical properties and their integration into wearable epidermal sensors for health monitoring. Specifically, the recent progress, fabrication, and applications of these materials for wearable epidermal sensors are summarized and discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the next generation wearable devices are proposed.

         <title>Gires&#8211;Tournois Immunoassay Platform for Label&#8208;Free Bright&#8208;Field Imaging and Facile Quantification of Bioparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gires&#8211;Tournois immunoassay platform (GTIP) for label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles is proposed. Bioparticles on GTIP slow down the velocity of reflected light, leading to vivid color change according to the local particle density and maximizing chromatic contrast. The particle distribution and density are analyzed through 2D raster&#8208;scanning&#8211;based chromaticity analysis.








Abstract
Bright&#8208;field imaging of nanoscale bioparticles is a challenging task for optical microscopy because the light&#8211;matter interactions of bioparticles are weak on conventional surfaces due to their low refractive index and small size. Alternatively, advanced imaging techniques, including near&#8208;field microscopy and phase microscopy, have enabled visualization and quantification of the bioparticles, but they require assistance of sophisticated/customized systems and post&#8208;processing with complex established algorithms. Here, a simple and fast immunoassay device, Gires&#8211;Tournois immunoassay platform (GTIP) is presented, which provides unique color dynamics in response to optical environment changes and thus enables the label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles using conventional optical microscopy. Bioparticles on GTIP slow down the velocity of reflected light, leading to vivid color change according to the local particle density and maximizing chromatic contrast for high spatial distinguishability. The particle distribution and density on the surface of the resonator are readily analyzed through 2D raster&#8208;scanning&#8208;based chromaticity analysis. GTIP offers multiscale sensing capability for target analytes that possess different refractive indices and sizes.

         <title>Hidden Local Symmetry Breaking in Silver Diamondoid Compounds is Root Cause of Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Typically, conventional structure transitions occur from a low symmetric state to a higher symmetry state upon warming. Here, we report an unexpected local symmetry breaking in the tetragonal diamondoid compound AgGaTe2, which upon warming evolves continuously from an undistorted ground state to a locally distorted state while retaining average crystallographic symmetry. This distorted state, caused by the weak sd3 orbital hybridization of tetrahedral Ag atoms, causes their displacement off the tetrahedron center and promotes a global distortion of the crystal structure resulting in strong acoustic&#8211;optical phonon scattering and an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.26 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 850 K in AgGaTe2. Our findings explain the underlying reason for the unexpectedly low thermal conductivities of silver&#8208;based compounds compared to copper&#8208;based analogs and provide a guideline to suppressing heat transport in diamondoid and other materials.

         <title>Hypothesis Learning in Automated Experiment: Application to Combinatorial Materials Libraries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypothesis learning approach based on conavigation of the hypothesis and experimental spaces toward physics discovery via active learning of competing hypotheses is developed. This approach is illustrated for exploring concentration&#8208;induced phase transition in Sm&#8208;doped BiFeO3 using a piezoresponse force microscopy, and can be extended to other characterization and synthesis experiments.








Abstract
Machine learning is rapidly becoming an integral part of experimental physical discovery via automated and high&#8208;throughput synthesis, and active experiments in scattering and electron/probe microscopy. This, in turn, necessitates the development of active learning methods capable of exploring relevant parameter spaces with the smallest number of steps. Here, an active learning approach based on conavigation of the hypothesis and experimental spaces is introduced. This is realized by combining the structured Gaussian processes containing probabilistic models of the possible system's behaviors (hypotheses) with reinforcement learning policy refinement (discovery). This approach closely resembles classical human&#8208;driven physical discovery, when several alternative hypotheses realized via models with adjustable parameters are tested during an experiment. This approach is demonstrated for exploring concentration&#8208;induced phase transitions in combinatorial libraries of Sm&#8208;doped BiFeO3 using piezoresponse force microscopy, but it is straightforward to extend it to higher&#8208;dimensional parameter spaces and more complex physical problems once the experimental workflow and hypothesis generation are available.

         <title>A High&#8208;Fidelity Skin&#8208;Attachable Acoustic Sensor for Realizing Auditory Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable acoustic sensor for realizing auditory electronic skin, with wide auditory field of bandwidth (15&#8211;10&#8239;000&#160;Hz) and acoustic&#8208;pressure (29&#8211;134&#160;dBSPL), is presented. The sensor shows high sensing fidelity without distortion for human&#8208;audible sounds, and even loud or low&#8208;frequency sounds that human ears cannot detect. The sensor demonstrates successful sound&#8208;recognition applications for Internet of Things.








Abstract
Wearable auditory sensors are critical in user&#8208;friendly sound&#8208;recognition systems for smart human&#8211;machine interaction and the Internet of Things. However, previously reported wearable sensors have limited sound&#8208;sensing quality as a consequence of a poor frequency response and a narrow acoustic&#8208;pressure range. Here, a skin&#8208;attachable acoustic sensor is presented that has higher sensing accuracy in wider auditory field than human ears, with flat frequency response (15&#8211;10&#8239;000&#160;Hz) and a good range of linearity (29&#8211;134 dBSPL) as well as high conformality to flexible surfaces and human skin. This high sound&#8208;sensing quality is achieved by exploiting the low residual stress and high processability of polymer materials in a diaphragm structure designed using acousto&#8208;mechano&#8208;electric modeling. Thus, this acoustic sensor shows high acoustic fidelity by sensing human&#8208;audible sounds, even loud sounds and low&#8208;frequency sounds that human ears cannot detect without distorting them. The polymer&#8208;based ultrasmall (&lt;9 mm2) and thin sensor maintains sound&#8208;detection quality on flexible substrates and in a wide temperature range (25 to 90&#160;&#176;C). The acoustic sensor shows a significant potential of auditory electronic skin, by recognizing voice successfully when the sensor attached on human skin is connected to a commercial mobile device running the latest artificial intelligence assistant.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Self&#8208;adaptive Thermal Metasurface</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging metamaterials have served as an efficient strategy for the realization of unconventional heat control and management using structural thermal properties, and many functional thermal meta&#8208;devices have been investigated. However, thermal functions are usually fixed or limited in the switching range. Thus far, real&#8208;time thermal regulation has been elusive for thermal metamaterials because of deterministic artificial meta&#8208;structures and uncontrollable phase transitions, coupled with the absence of dynamic adaptability. Here, we report a self&#8208;adaptive metasurface platform to implement programable thermal functions via the automatic evolution of thermoelectric heat sources and real&#8208;time control of the driven voltage. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept smart platform experimentally demonstrated arbitrary switches between elaborate thermal patterns consolidated into an active thermoelectric element matrix. Further, thermal pixels and feedback control systems were integrated into printed circuit boards, resulting in self&#8208;adaptability to any thermal requirements. This study sets up a new paradigm for arbitrary transitions between exquisite thermal patterns and is expected to pave the way for real&#8208;time thermal management in a programing formation.

         <title>Synergic Reaction Kinetics over Adjacent Ruthenium Sites for Superb Hydrogen Generation in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating adjacent Ru nanoparticles and single atoms onto defective carbon as hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst achieves ultralow overpotential and high intrinsic activity. The activity origin is the synergistic electronic regulations that facilitate water dissociation and reduce energy barriers of hydroxide/hydrogen desorption over adjacent Ru sites, resulting in an optimized reaction kinetics for alkaline hydrogen generation.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based electrocatalysts as platinum (Pt) alternatives in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are promising. However, achieving efficient reaction processes on Ru catalysts is still a challenge, especially in alkaline media. Here, the well&#8208;dispersed Ru nanoparticles with adjacent Ru single atoms on carbon substrate (Ru1,n&#8208;NC) is demonstrated to be a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The obtained Ru1,n&#8208;NC exhibits ultralow overpotential (14.8&#160;mV) and high turnover frequency (1.25&#160;H2&#160;s&#8208;1 at &#8722;0.025&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), much better than the commercial 40 wt.% Pt/C. The analyses reveal that Ru nanoparticles and single sites can promote each other to deliver electrons to the carbon substrate. Eventually, the electronic regulations bring accelerated water dissociation and reduced energy barriers of hydroxide/hydrogen desorption on adjacent Ru sites, then an optimized reaction kinetics for Ru1,n&#8208;NC is obtained to achieve superb hydrogen generation in alkaline media. This work provides a new insight into the catalyst design in simultaneous optimizations of the elementary steps to obtain ideal HER performance in alkaline media.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of activating the oxygen oxidation activity by construction of overwhelming nonbonding oxygen states, it is more crucial to enhance the reversibility of lattice oxygen redox reactions of layered battery electrodes through modulating transition metal (TM) &#63743;O covalency, which concurrently suppresses the phase transition and irreversible TM migration, thus leading to the improved structural stability and electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Utilizing reversible lattice oxygen redox (OR) in battery electrodes is an essential strategy to overcome the capacity limitation set by conventional transition metal redox. However, lattice OR reactions are often accompanied with irreversible oxygen oxidation, leading to local structural transformations and voltage/capacity fading. Herein, it is proposed that the reversibility of lattice OR can be remarkably improved through modulating transition metal&#8211;oxygen covalency for layered electrode of Na&#8208;ion batteries. By developing a novel layered P2&#8208;Na0.6Mg0.15Mn0.7Cu0.15O2 electrode, it is demonstrated that the highly electronegative Cu dopants can improve the lattice OR reversibility to 95% compared to 73% for Cu&#8208;free counterpart, as directly quantified through high&#8208;efficiency mapping of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering. Crucially, the large energetic overlap between Cu 3d and O 2p states dictates the rigidity of oxygen framework, which effectively mitigates the structural distortion of local oxygen environment upon (de)sodiation and leads to the enhanced lattice OR reversibility. The electrode also exhibits a completely solid&#8208;solution reaction with an ultralow volume change of only 0.45% and a reversible metal migration upon cycling, which together ensure the improved electrochemical performance. These results emphasize the critical role of transition metal&#8211;oxygen covalency for enhancing the reversibility of lattice OR toward high&#8208;capacity electrodes employing OR chemistry.

         <title>A Dendritic Polymer&#8208;Based Nanosystem Mediates Drug Penetration and Irreversible Endoplasmic Reticulum Stresses in Tumor via Neighboring Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy based on dual&#8208;responsive nanosystem for combination therapy is developed to promote drug penetration in tumors through amplifying the neighboring effect, which may shed light on overcoming the tumor extracellular matrix barrier and eradicating solid tumors.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;based cancer therapeutics are generally impeded by poor drug penetration into solid tumors due to their dense tumor extracellular matrix (ECM). Herein, pH/redox&#8208;responsive dendritic polymer&#8208;based NPs are developed to amplify the neighboring effect for improving drug penetration and driving cell apoptosis via combination therapy. Pyropheophorbide a (Ppa) is conjugated with PEGylated dendritic peptides via disulfide bonds and doxorubicin (DOX) encapsulated in the conjugate to construct dual&#8208;responsive NPs, PDPP@D. Delayed released DOX and Ppa from PDPP@D exert their combination therapeutic effect to induce cell apoptosis, and then they are liberated out of dying cells to amplify the neighboring effect, resulting in their diffusion through the dense ECM and penetration into solid tumors. Transcriptome studies reveal that PDPP@D leads to irreversible stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibits cell protection through blocking the IRE1&#8208;dependent survival pathway and unleashing the DR5&#8208;mediated caspase activity to promote cell death. The strategy of amplifying the neighboring effect of NPs through combination therapy may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration and eradicating solid tumors.

         <title>Sequential Phase Conversion&#8208;Induced Phosphides Heteronanorod Arrays for Superior Hydrogen Evolution Performance to Pt in Wide pH Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a sequential phase conversion, Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5 nanorods are induced from Ni3S2 nanofilm rooted on nickel foam. Benefiting from the optimized electronic structure and heterophase collaboration, such nickel phosphide exhibits unprecedented pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction activity, superior to Pt/C and nearly all the reported transition metal phosphides.








Abstract
Developing an efficient and non&#8208;precious pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst is highly desirable for hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting but remains a significant challenge. Herein, a hierarchical structure composed of heterostructured Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5 nanorod arrays rooted on Ni3S2 film (Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5@Ni3S2) via a simultaneous corrosion and sulfidation is built followed by a phosphidation treatment toward the metallic nickel foam. The combination of theoretical calculations with in/ex situ characterizations unveils that such a unique sequential phase conversion strategy ensures the strong interfacial coupling between Ni2P and Ni12P5 as well as the robust stabilization of 1D heteronanorod arrays by Ni3S2 film, resulting in the promoted water adsorption/dissociation energy, the optimized hydrogen adsorption energy, and the enhanced electron/proton transfer ability accompanied with an excellent stability. Consequently, Ni2P&#8208;Ni12P5@Ni3S2/NF requires only 32, 46, and 34&#160;mV overpotentials to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH, 0.5 m H2SO4, and 1.0 m phosphate&#8208;buffered saline electrolytes, respectively, exceeding almost all the previously reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work may pave a new avenue for the rational design of non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts toward pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution catalysis.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Robust and Extensible Fibrous Mechanical Sensors for Wearable Smart Healthcare</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductive microfibers possess a large strain range (&#8776;700%) and high strength (&#8776;17.6&#160;MPa) because of the robust core fiber made from a new type of polyurethane polymer and CNTs layers, which simultaneously show a high strain resolution and a large detection range (from 0.0075% to 400%). The microfibers are capable of monitoring 11 health&#8208;related physiological signals.








Abstract
Fibrous material with high strength and large stretchability is an essential component of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic devices. Wearable electronic systems require a material that is strong to ensure durability and stability, and a wide range of strain to expand their applications. However, it is still challenging to manufacture fibrous materials with simultaneously high mechanical strength and the tensile property. Herein, the ultra&#8208;robust (&#8776;17.6&#160;MPa) and extensible (&#8776;700%) conducting microfibers are developed and demonstrated their applications in fabricating fibrous mechanical sensors. The mechanical sensor shows high sensitivity in detecting strains that have high strain resolution and a large detection range (from 0.0075% to 400%) simultaneously. Moreover, low frequency vibrations between 0 and 40&#160;Hz are also detected, which covers most tremors that occur in the human body. As a further step, a wearable and smart health&#8208;monitoring system has been developed using the fibrous mechanical sensor, which is capable of monitoring health&#8208;related physiological signals, including muscle movement, body tremor, wrist pulse, respiration, gesture, and six body postures to predict and diagnose diseases, which will promote the wearable telemedicine technology.

         <title>A Photoelectric Spiking Neuron for Visual Depth Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a photoelectric spiking neuron for visual depth perception based on the Ag/TaOx/indium tin oxide memristive spiking encoder with high biological plausibility as well as ultralow power consumption. The biological visual systems are built and can estimate the depth of field based on the spiking rate difference, and consequently adapt its focus to optimize performances in visual tasks.








Abstract
The biological visual system encodes optical information into spikes and processes them by the neural network, which enables the perception with high throughput of visual processing with ultralow energy budget. This has inspired a wide spectrum of devices to imitate such neural process, while precise mimicking such procedure is still highly required. Here, a highly bio&#8208;realistic photoelectric spiking neuron for visual depth perception is presented. The firing spikes generated by the TaOX memristive spiking encoders have a biologically similar frequency range of 1&#8211;200&#160;Hz and sub&#8208;micro watts power. Such spiking encoder is integrated with a photodetector and a network of neuromorphic transistors, for information collection and recognition tasks, respectively. The distance&#8208;dependent response and eye fatigue of biological visual systems have been mimicked based on such photoelectric spiking neuron. The simulated depth perception shows a recognition improvement by adapting to sights at different distances. The results can advance the technologies in bioinspired or robotic systems that may be endowed with depth perception and power efficiency at the same time.

The biological visual systems are built and can estimate the depth of field based on the spiking rate difference, and consequently adapt its focus to optimize performances in visual tasks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biological visual system encodes optical information into spikes and processes them by the neural network, which enables the perception with high throughput of visual processing with ultralow energy budget. This has inspired a wide spectrum of devices to imitate such neural process, while precise mimicking such procedure is still highly required. Here, a highly bio-realistic photoelectric spiking neuron for visual depth perception is presented. The firing spikes generated by the TaO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; memristive spiking encoders have a biologically similar frequency range of 1&#8211;200&#160;Hz and sub-micro watts power. Such spiking encoder is integrated with a photodetector and a network of neuromorphic transistors, for information collection and recognition tasks, respectively. The distance-dependent response and eye fatigue of biological visual systems have been mimicked based on such photoelectric spiking neuron. The simulated depth perception shows a recognition improvement by adapting to sights at different distances. The results can advance the technologies in bioinspired or robotic systems that may be endowed with depth perception and power efficiency at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photonic&#8208;Crafting of Non&#8208;Volatile and Rewritable Antiferromagnetic Spin Textures with Drastic Difference in Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two bistable and reversibly controllable antiferromagnetic states in strained BFO film are discovered. These two non&#8208;volatile antiferromagnetic states are successfully patterned with a non&#8208;contact approach combining both optical and magnetic methods. The written antiferromagnetic pattern is electrically readable with at least 30% signal difference. This work promises an alternative route toward practical applications of antiferromagnetic spintronics.








Abstract
Antiferromagnetic spintronics is an emerging field of non&#8208;volatile data storage and information processing. The zero net magnetization and zero stray fields of antiferromagnetic materials eliminate interference between neighbor units, leading to high&#8208;density memory integrations. However, this invisible magnetic character at the same time also poses a great challenge in controlling and detecting magnetic states in antiferromagnets. Here, two antiferromagnetic spin states close in energy in strained BiFeO3 thin films at room temperature are discovered. It can be reversibly switched between these two non&#8208;volatile antiferromagnetic states by a moderate magnetic field and a non&#8208;contact optical approach. Importantly, the conductivity of the areas with each antiferromagnetic textures is drastically different. It is conclusively demonstrated the capability of optical writing and electrical reading of these newly discovered bistable antiferromagnetic states in the BiFeO3 thin films.

Smart Contact lens (SCL) platforms have emerged as a promising interface between the eye and electronic devices for personalized healthcare applications. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in material synthesis, device manufacturing, and system integrations of SCLs and provides recent progress and future opportunities of SCL as an effective diagnostic and therapeutic tool.








Abstract
The eye is one of the most complex organs in the human body, containing rich and critical physiological information (e.g., intraocular pressure, corneal temperature, and pH) as well as a library of metabolite biomarkers (e.g., glucose, proteins, and specific ions). Smart contact lenses (SCLs) can serve as a wearable intelligent ocular prosthetic device capable of noninvasive and continuous monitoring of various essential physical/biochemical parameters and drug loading/delivery for the treatment of ocular diseases. Advances in SCL technologies and the growing public interest in personalized health are accelerating SCL research more than ever before. Here, the current status and potential of SCL development through a comprehensive review from fabrication to applications to commercialization are discussed. First, the material, fabrication, and platform designs of the SCLs for the diagnostic and therapeutic applications are discussed. Then, the latest advances in diagnostic and therapeutic SCLs for clinical translation are reviewed. Later, the established techniques for wearable power transfer and wireless data transmission applied to current SCL devices are summarized. An outlook, future opportunities, and challenges for developing next&#8208;generation SCL&#160;devices are also provided. With the rise in interest of SCL development, this comprehensive and essential review can serve as a new paradigm for the SCL&#160;devices.

         <title>Recent Progress and Future Advances on Aqueous Monovalent&#8208;Ion Batteries towards Safe and High&#8208;Power Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries have gained tremendous attention from the scientific community due to their fast charging capability, resulting from the outstanding ionic conductivity of aqueous electrolytes (twice as high as for organic electrolytes), and the smaller hydrated ionic radius and lower hydration free energy of monovalent ions compared with those of multivalent ions.








Abstract
Aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries have been rapidly developed recently as promising energy storage devices in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their fast charging capability and high power densities. In recent years, Prussian blue analogues, polyanion&#8208;type compounds, and layered oxides have been widely developed as cathodes for aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries because of their low cost and high theoretical capacity. Furthermore, many design strategies have been proposed to expand their electrochemical stability window by reducing the amount of free water molecules and introducing an electrolyte addictive. This review highlights the advantages and drawbacks of cathode and anode materials, and summarizes the correlations between the various strategies and the electrochemical performance in terms of structural engineering, morphology control, elemental compositions, and interfacial design. Finally, this review can offer rational principles and potential future directions in the design of aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Readily Scalable, Clinically Demonstrated, Antibiofouling Zwitterionic Surface Treatment for Implantable Medical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple process has been developed to treat the surfaces of implantable medical devices with zwitterionic materials to reduce hospital acquired infection and complications. The process meets the regulatory and scalability requirements to treat real&#8208;world devices. Long&#8208;term catheterized patients who replaced conventional catheters with surface&#8208;treated catheters report improved urinary tract condition and quality of life.








Abstract
Unlike growth on tissue, microbes can grow freely on implantable devices with minimal immune system intervention and often form resilient biofilms that continuously pump out pathogenic cells. The efficacy of antibiotics used to treat infection is declining due to increased rates of pathogenic resistance. A simple, one&#8208;step zwitterionic surface modification is developed to significantly reduce protein and microbial adhesion to synthetic materials and demonstrate the successful modification of several clinically relevant materials, including recalcitrant materials such as elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane. The treated surfaces exhibit robust adhesion resistance against proteins and microorganisms in both static and flow conditions. Furthermore, the surface treatment prevents the adhesion of mammalian fibroblast cells while displaying no cytotoxicity. To demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the novel technology in the real&#8208;world, a surface&#8208;treated, commercial silicone foley catheter is developed that is cleared for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (K192034). 16&#160;long&#8208;term catheterized patients received surface&#8208;treated catheters and completed a Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI&#8208;I) questionnaire. 10&#160;out of 16&#160;patients described their urinary tract condition post implantation as &#8220;much better&#8221; or &#8220;very much better&#8221; and 72% (n&#160;=&#160;13) of patients desire to continue using the surface&#8208;treated catheter over conventional latex or silicone catheters.

         <title>The Universal Growth of Ultrathin Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal growth of ultrathin perovskite single crystals is realized by designing an oriented solvent microenvironment induced by the interfacial electric field originated from the charge separation between solid and liquid phases. Such a strategy can fabricate a wide range of high&#8208;quality ultrathin perovskite single crystals, from layered to nonlayered, organic to inorganic, and toxic to low&#8208;toxic lead&#8208;free perovskite. Notably, the realization of high quality and diversity of ultrathin perovskites will facilitate both fundamental studies and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Perovskites have engaged significant attention owing to rich species and remarkable physical properties as well as optoelectronic applications. Compared to bulk counterparts, ultrathin perovskites exhibit more available compositions due to the breaking of bulk lattice limitation.

     alt="The Universal Growth of Ultrathin Perovskite Single Crystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The universal growth of ultrathin perovskite single crystals is realized by designing an oriented solvent microenvironment induced by the interfacial electric field originated from the charge separation between solid and liquid phases. Such a strategy can fabricate a wide range of high-quality ultrathin perovskite single crystals, from layered to nonlayered, organic to inorganic, and toxic to low-toxic lead-free perovskite. Notably, the realization of high quality and diversity of ultrathin perovskites will facilitate both fundamental studies and optoelectronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskites have engaged significant attention owing to rich species and remarkable physical properties as well as optoelectronic applications. Compared to bulk counterparts, ultrathin perovskites exhibit more available compositions due to the breaking of bulk lattice limitation. Coupled with crystal lattice relaxation and quantum confinement, infinite intriguing properties of ultrathin perovskites deserve to be explored. Developing ultrathin perovskites with alterable composition and structure is a necessity to fully explore this versatile family. Herein, a universal strategy is conceived via constructing oriented solvent microenvironment induced by the interfacial electric field originated from the charge separation between solid and liquid phases, which is conducive to controlling the precursor distribution and makes crystals preferentially nucleate and grow in the preferentially lateral mode. From layered to nonlayered, organic to inorganic, and toxic to low-toxic lead-free perovskite, a full-range synthesis is achieved of ultrathin perovskites. This work opens up opportunities both for ultrathin perovskite exploration through compositional engineering and for device miniaturization in energy conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nano&#8208;Memristors with 4&#160;mV&#160;Switching Voltage Based on Surface&#8208;Modified Copper Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of memristors operating at low switching voltages can be very useful to avoid signal amplification in many types of circuits. Here, 400&#160;nm&#8208;thick dalkyl&#8208;dithiophosphoric modified copper nanoparticles (DDP&#8208;CuNPs) based nano&#8208;memristors (&lt;50 nm2) exhibiting volatile threshold&#8208;type resistive switching at an ultralow switching voltage of &#8776;4&#160;mV, and with an ultralow variability, are reported.








Abstract
The development of memristors operating at low switching voltages &lt;50&#160;mV&#160;can be very useful to avoid signal amplification in many types of circuits, such as those used in bioelectronic applications to interact with neurons and nerves. Here, it is reported that 400&#160;nm&#8208;thick films made of dalkyl&#8208;dithiophosphoric (DDP) modified copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) exhibit volatile threshold&#8208;type resistive switching (RS) at ultralow switching voltage of &#8776;4&#160;mV. The RS is observed in small nanocells with a lateral size of &lt;50&#160;nm&#8211;2, during hundreds of cycles, and with an ultralow variability. Atomistic calculations reveal that the switching mechanism is related to the modification of the Schottky barriers and insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition when ionic movement is induced via external bias. The devices are also used to model integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire neurons for spiking neural networks and it is concluded that circuits employing DDP&#8208;CuNPs consume around ten times less power than similar neurons implemented with a memristor that switches at 40&#160;mV.

         <title>Process&#8208;Aid Solid Engineering Triggers Delicately Modulation of Y&#8208;Series Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, high volatile, and asymmetric halogen benzene derivate, 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;chlorobenzene, is applied as process&#8208;aid solid to manipulate the blend nanomorphology and enhance the crystallinity in Y&#8208;series small molecule&#8208;based photoactive layer system. A champion power conversion efficiency of 17.0% is yielded, which is one of the highest performances for thick&#8208;film organic solar cells.








Abstract
Volatile solids with symmetric&#160;&#960;&#8208;backbone are intensively implemented on manipulating the nanomorphology for improving the operability and stability of organic solar cells. However, due to the isotropic stacking, the announced solids with symmetric geometry cannot modify the microscopic phase separation and component distribution collaboratively, which will constrain the promotion of exciton splitting and charge collection efficiency. Inspired by the superiorities of asymmetric configuration, a novel process&#8208;aid solid (PAS) engineering is proposed. By coupling with BTP core unit in Y&#8208;series molecule, an asymmetric, volatile 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;chlorobenzene solid can induce the anisotropic dipole direction, elevated dipole moment, and interlaminar interaction spontaneously. Due to the synergetic effects on the favorable phase separation and desired component distribution, the PAS&#8208;treated devices feature the evident improvement of exciton splitting, charge transport, and collection, accompanied by the suppressed trap&#8208;assisted recombination. Consequently, an impressive fill factor of 80.2% with maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5% in the PAS&#8208;treated device is achieved. More strikingly, the PAS&#8208;treated devices demonstrate a promising thickness&#8208;tolerance character, where a record PCE of 17.0% is yielded in PAS devices with a 300&#160;nm thickness photoactive layer, which represents the highest PCE for thick&#8208;film organic solar cells.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Exchange Driven Phase Transition in CsPbI3 Nanowires for Fabricating Epitaxial Perovskite Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state anion exchange is conducted in Y&#8208;CsPbI3/CsPbBr3 nanowire crossbar structures, driving an indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap phase transition in Y&#8208;CsPbI3 nanowires. The heterojunction created by phase transition is epitaxial, with sharp interface and excellent thermal stability. A threshold&#8208;dominating anion exchange mechanism is proposed in these 1D nanowires, fundamentally different from the gradient&#8208;domination mechanism in 3D perovskites.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange in halide perovskites provides a unique pathway of bandgap engineering for fabricating heterojunctions in low&#8208;cost photovoltaics and optoelectronics. However, it remains challenging to achieve robust and sharp perovskite heterojunctions, due to the spontaneous anion interdiffusion across the heterojunction in 3D perovskites. Here, it is shown that the anionic behavior in 1D perovskites is fundamentally different, that the anion exchange can readily drive an indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap phase transition in CsPbI3 nanowires (NWs) and greatly lower the phase transition temperature. In addition, the heterojunction created by phase transition is epitaxial in nature, and its chemical composition can be precisely controlled upon postannealing. Further study of the phase transition dynamics reveals a threshold&#8208;dominating anion exchange mechanism in these 1D NWs rather than the gradient&#8208;dominating mechanism in 3D systems. The results provide important insights into the ionic behavior in halide perovskites, which is beneficial for applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), and other semiconductor devices.

         <title>Atomically Sharp Lateral Superlattice Heterojunctions Built&#8208;In Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanoporous Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D lateral superlattice heterostructure with unprecedented single&#8208;bond band discontinuities and heterocomponent dimensions down to one nanometer is realized by the coupling of interdigitated nanoribbons into a nitrogen&#8208;doped nanoporous graphene structure. The atomic scale band discontinuities at the nanoporous heterojunctions endow this nanomaterial with a multifunctionality that can be relevant for photodetection, excitonic solar cells, water splitting, or selective nanosieving.








Abstract
Nanometer scale lateral heterostructures with atomically sharp band discontinuities can be conceived as the 2D analogues of vertical Van der Waals heterostructures, where pristine properties of each component coexist with interfacial phenomena that result in a variety of exotic quantum phenomena. However, despite considerable advances in the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, controlling their covalent interfaces and band discontinuities with atomic precision, scaling down components and producing periodic, lattice&#8208;coherent superlattices still represent major challenges. Here, a synthetic strategy to fabricate nanometer scale, coherent lateral superlattice heterojunctions with atomically sharp band discontinuity is reported. By merging interdigitated arrays of different types of graphene nanoribbons by means of a novel on&#8208;surface reaction, superlattices of 1D, and chemically heterogeneous nanoporous junctions are obtained. The latter host subnanometer quantum dipoles and tunneling in&#8208;gap states, altogether expected to promote interfacial phenomena such as interribbon excitons or selective photocatalysis.

         <title>Perspective of 2D Integrated Electronic Circuits: Scientific Pipe Dream or Disruptive Technology?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (FETs) are affected by time&#8208;dependent changes in their performance, which must be minimized for industrial&#8208;scale applications. In this work, the stability of circuits based on 2D transistors is evaluated. The results suggest that the performance parameters of certain material combinations for 2D FETs are already close to Si technologies. Furthermore, parameter variability criteria are formulated to evaluate the future development of 2D technologies.








Abstract
Within the last decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating transistors utilizing 2D semiconductors. Also, small circuits consisting of a few transistors have been demonstrated, including inverters, ring oscillators, and static random access memory cells. However, for industrial applications, both time&#8208;zero and time&#8208;dependent variability in the performance of the transistors appear critical. While time&#8208;zero variability is primarily related to immature processing, time&#8208;dependent drifts are dominated by charge trapping at defects located at the channel/insulator interface and in the insulator itself, which can substantially degrade the stability of circuits. At the current state of the art, 2D transistors typically exhibit a few orders of magnitude higher trap densities than silicon devices, which considerably increases their time&#8208;dependent variability, resulting in stability and yield issues. Here, the stability of currently available 2D electronics is carefully evaluated using circuit simulations to determine the impact of transistor&#8208;related issues on the overall circuit performance. The results suggest that while the performance parameters of transistors based on certain material combinations are already getting close to being competitive with Si technologies, a reduction in variability and defect densities is required. Overall, the criteria for parameter variability serve as guidance for evaluating the future development of 2D technologies.

         <title>A Sulfur&#8208;Tolerant MOF&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalyst for Efficient Oxidation of NO and Hg0</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst (denoted Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C) is theoretically predicted and fabricated by controlled metal&#8211;organic framework pryrolysis for oxidation of NO and Hg0, aiming at multipollutants removal in coal&#8208;fired power plants. Strikingly, the Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C exhibits sulfur resistance in catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg0, where SO2 boosts the catalytic cycle of NO oxidation over Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C through accelerating the regeneration of active sites.








Abstract
Catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg0 is a crucial step to eliminate multiple pollutants from emissions from coal&#8208;fired power plants. However, traditional catalysts exhibit low catalytic activity and poor sulfur resistance due to low activation ability and poor adsorption selectivity. Herein, a single&#8208;atom Fe decorated N&#8208;doped carbon catalyst (Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C), with abundant Fe1&#8208;N4 sites, based on a Fe&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework is developed to oxidize NO and Hg0. The results demonstrate that the Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C has ultrahigh catalytic activity for oxidizing NO and Hg0 at low and room temperature. More importantly, Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C exhibits robust sulfur resistance as it preferably adsorbs reactants over sulfur oxides, which has never been achieved before with traditional catalysts. Furthermore, SO2 boosts the catalytic oxidation of NO over Fe1&#8208;N4&#8208;C through accelerating the circulation of active sites. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe1&#8208;N4 active sites result in a low energy barrier and high adsorption selectivity, providing detailed molecular&#8208;level understanding for its excellent catalytic performance. This is the first report on NO and Hg0 oxidation over single&#8208;atom catalysts with strong sulfur tolerance. The outcomes demonstrate that single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising candidates for catalytic oxidation of NO and Hg0 enabling cleaner coal&#8208;fired power plant operations.

         <title>Carbon Dots as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for the Treatment of Cancer&#8208;Related Anemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the adverse effects of erythropoietin (EPO) on cancer patient survival, it is necessary to develop new agents for cancer&#8208;related anemia treatment. Therefore, novel carbon dots, J&#8208;CDs, derived from jujube are designed. J&#8208;CDs specifically promote the proliferation of erythroid cells by stimulating the self&#8208;renewal of erythroid progenitor cells. Moreover, J&#8208;CDs have no discernible effects on tumor proliferation, unlike EPO.








Abstract
Due to the adverse effects of erythropoietin (EPO) on cancer patient survival, it is necessary to develop new agents that can be used to efficiently manage and treat cancer&#8208;related anemia. In this study, novel distinctive carbon dots, J&#8208;CDs, derived from jujube are designed, synthesized, and characterized. Based on the obtained results, this material comprises sp2 and sp3 carbon atoms, as well as oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;based groups, and it specifically promotes the proliferation of erythroid cells by stimulating the self&#8208;renewal of erythroid progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, J&#8208;CDs have no discernible effects on tumor proliferation and metastasis, unlike EPO. Transcriptome profiling suggests that J&#8208;CDs upregulate the molecules involved in hypoxia response, and they also significantly increase the phosphorylation levels of STAT5, the major transducer of signals for erythroid progenitor cell proliferation. Overall, this study demonstrates that J&#8208;CDs effectively promote erythrocyte production without affecting tumor proliferation and metastasis; thus, they may be promising agents for the treatment of cancer&#8208;related anemia.

         <title>Multiple 2D Phase Transformations in Monolayer Transition Metal Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically resolved multiple 2D phase transformations (MoS2&#160;&#8594; Mo4S6, MoSe2&#160;&#8594; L&#8208;, Z&#8208;Mo6Se6) is observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides under in situ heating with stoichiometry control by electron beam irradiation. Through chalcogen sliding and reconstruction mechanisms, phase transformations are well manipulated to fabricate diphase heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces, which will pave the way to phase engineered optoelectronics.








Abstract
Phase transformation lies at the heart of materials science because it allows for the control of structural phases of solids with desired properties. It has long been a challenge to manipulate phase transformations in crystals at the nanoscale with designed interfaces and compositions. Here in situ electron microscopy is employed to fabricate novel 2D phases with different stoichiometries in monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2. The multiphase transformations: MoS2&#160;&#8594; Mo4S6 and MoSe2&#160;&#8594; Mo6Se6 which are highly localized with atomically sharp boundaries are observed. Their atomic mechanisms are determined as chalcogen 2H &#8596; 1T sliding, cation shift, and commensurate lattice reconstructions, resulting in decreasing direct bandgaps and even a semiconductor&#8211;metal transition. These results will be a paradigm for the manipulation of multiphase heterostructures with controlled compositions and sharp interfaces, which will guide the future phase engineered electronics and optoelectronics of metal chalcogenides.

         <title>Raising the Intrinsic Safety of Layered Oxide Cathodes by Surface Re&#8208;Lithiation with LLZTO Garnet&#8208;Type Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Garnet&#8208;type solid electrolyte LLZTO supplies lithium ions to retard the oxygen release of oxide cathode during heating. LLZTO acts bifunctionally to solve the safety issues from flammable liquid electrolytes and high&#8208;capacity layered cathodes at high SOC. Consequently, LiCoO2/graphite cell with 1 wt% LLZTO addition achieves significantly enhanced safety performances.








Abstract
Battery safety concerns are becoming more and more prominent with the increasing demands of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with higher energy density. The greatest threat to battery safety derives from the easy release of oxygen from the high&#8208;capacity layered oxide cathodes at highly delithiated states and subsequent exothermic reactions with reductive agents in batteries. Herein, it is demonstrated that solid electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) can supply lithium ions to re&#8208;lithiate the charged LiCoO2 at elevated temperatures. Such a re&#8208;lithiation process can lower the state&#8208;of&#8208;charge of LiCoO2, and thus, inherently postpones its structural decomposition and the associated release of oxygen during the heating process. The LiCoO2/graphite full cell with 1&#160;wt% addition of LLZTO demonstrates remarkably enhanced safety performances. This work proposes a strategy that through the adoption of solid electrolytes to solve safety issues raised from both flammable liquid electrolytes and high capacity cathodes, to achieve intrinsically safe LIBs or solid&#8208;state batteries.

High&#8208;quality and solution&#8208;processible chlorine&#8208;doped ultrathin graphene (Cl&#8208;G) nanosheets are fabricated through a handy yet eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical exfoliation process. The as&#8208;made all&#8208;solid&#8208;state MSC built by using Cl&#8208;G via a facile mask&#8208;assisted method delivers a large reversible capacity and ultrasteady charge/discharge performance, with the capacitance being maintained at 98.1% even after 250&#8201;000 cycles.








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;constructed micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) have received considerable attention recently, as part of the prospective wearable and portable electronics, owing to their distinctive merits of well&#8208;tunable power output, robust mechanical flexibility, and long cyclability. In the current work, the focus is on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality and solution&#8208;processible chlorine&#8208;doped graphene (Cl&#8208;G) nanosheets through a handy yet eco&#8208;friendly electrochemical exfoliation process. The Cl&#8208;G is characteristic of the large lateral size of &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m, abundant nanopores with sizes of as small as 2&#160;nm, as well as numerous steps from the rugged surface. Arising from the rich chemical functionalities and structure defects, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state MSC built by using Cl&#8208;G via a facile mask&#8208;assisted method delivers a large reversible capacity and ultrasteady charge/discharge performance, with the capacitance being maintained at 98.1% even after 250&#8201;000 cycles. The Cl&#8208;G&#8208;MSC with EMIMBF4/PVDF&#8208;HFP as the electrolyte displays a large volumetric capacitance up to 160 F cm&#8722;3 at the scan rate of 5&#160;mV s&#8722;1 and high volumetric energy density of 97.9&#160;mW h cm&#8722;3 at the power density of 3.4 W cm&#8722;3. The device can also output a high voltage up to 3.5&#160;V and robust capability with 94.8% of capacitance retention upon 10&#8201;000 cycles.

         <title>Molecular Programming of NIR&#8208;IIb&#8208;Emissive Semiconducting Small Molecules for In Vivo High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging Beyond 1500&#8201;nm</title>

An atom&#8208;programming on semiconducting oligomers tunes NIR&#8208;II emission beyond 1500&#160;nm with high brightness. With this strategy, whole&#8208;body vessel, biliary tract, and bladder of living mice are clearly monitored at emission wavelengths over 1500&#160;nm. Utilizing NIR&#8208;II nanoparticles, NIR&#8208;II microscopic imaging of in vivo deep&#8208;brain at a high depth of 870&#160;&#181;m and ultrafast hemodynamics are achieved in high resolution.








Abstract
Materials with long&#8208;wavelength second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission are highly desired for in vivo dynamic visualizating of microstructures in deep tissues. Herein, by employing an atom&#8208;programming strategy, a series of highly fluorescent semiconducting oligomers (SOMs) with tunable NIR&#8208;IIb emissions are developed for bioimaging applications. After self&#8208;assembly into nanoparticles (NPs), they show good brightness, high photostability, and satisfactory biocompatibility. The SOM NPs are applied as probes for high&#8208;resolution imaging of whole&#8208;body and hind&#8208;limb blood vessels, biliary tract, and bladder with their emissions over 1500&#160;nm. This work demonstrates an atom&#8208;programming strategy for constructing semiconducting small molecules with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence for deep&#8208;tissue imaging, affording new insight for advancing molecular design of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

Abstract
A stretchable and self&#8208;healable conductive material with high conductivity is critical to high&#8208;performance wearable electronics and integrated devices for applications where large mechanical deformation is involved. While there has been great progress in developing stretchable and self&#8208;healable conducting materials, it remains challenging to concurrently maintain and recover such functionalities before and after healing. Here, a highly stretchable and autonomic self&#8208;healable conducting film consisting of a conducting polymer (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) and a soft&#8208;polymer (poly(2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid), PAAMPSA) is reported. The optimal film exhibits outstanding stretchability as high as 630% and high electrical conductivity of 320 S cm&#8722;1, while possessing the ability to repair both mechanical and electrical breakdowns when undergoing severe damage at ambient conditions. This polymer composite film is further utilized in a tactile sensor, which exhibits good pressure sensitivity of 164.5 kPa&#8722;1, near hysteresis&#8208;free, an ultrafast response time of 19&#160;ms, and excellent endurance over 1500 consecutive presses. Additionally, an integrated 5 &#215; 4 stretchable and self&#8208;healable organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) array with great device performance is successfully demonstrated. The developed stretchable and autonomic self&#8208;healable conducting film significantly increases the practicality and shelf life of wearable electronics, which in turn, reduces maintenance costs and build&#8208;up of electronic waste.

         <title>Structural Modularization of Cu2Te Leading to High Thermoelectric Performance near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By structurally&#8208;functionally modularizing Cu2Te with multiple point defects, mosaic nanograins, and crystal&#8208;amorphicity duality, high thermoelectric performance is obtained near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel limit. This work presents a case of paradigm shift from the band edge to the mobility edge in thermoelectric materials research.








Abstract
To date, thermoelectric materials research stays focused on optimizing the material's band edge details and disfavors low mobility. Here, the paradigm is shifted from the band edge to the mobility edge, exploring high thermoelectricity near the border of band conduction and hopping. Through coalloying iodine and sulfur, the plain crystal structure is modularized of liquid&#8208;like thermoelectric material Cu2Te with mosaic nanograins and the highly size mismatched S/Te sublattice that chemically quenches the Cu sublattice and drives the electronic states from itinerant to localized. A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art figure of merit of 1.4 is obtained at 850 K for Cu2(S0.4I0.1Te0.5); and remarkably, it is achieved near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel limit unlike mainstream thermoelectric materials that are band conductors.

     alt="Structural Modularization of Cu2Te Leading to High Thermoelectric Performance near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel Limit"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By structurally-functionally modularizing Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te with multiple point defects, mosaic nanograins, and crystal-amorphicity duality, high thermoelectric performance is obtained near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel limit. This work presents a case of paradigm shift from the band edge to the mobility edge in thermoelectric materials research.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, thermoelectric materials research stays focused on optimizing the material's band edge details and disfavors low mobility. Here, the paradigm is shifted from the band edge to the mobility edge, exploring high thermoelectricity near the border of band conduction and hopping. Through coalloying iodine and sulfur, the plain crystal structure is modularized of liquid-like thermoelectric material Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te with mosaic nanograins and the highly size mismatched S/Te sublattice that chemically quenches the Cu sublattice and drives the electronic states from itinerant to localized. A state-of-the-art figure of merit of 1.4 is obtained at 850 K for Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;); and remarkably, it is achieved near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel limit unlike mainstream thermoelectric materials that are band conductors. Broadly, pairing structural modularization with the high performance near the Mott&#8211;Ioffe&#8211;Regel limit paves an important new path towards the rational design of high-performance thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hierarchically Encoded Data Storage Device with Controlled Transiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically encoded data storage device consisting of resistive switching memory, electromagnetic (EM) metamaterial, and diffractive optical element is reported in this paper. The storage devices can be used to store hybrid information including electronic information, EM information, and optical information. It also exhibits controllable degradation manners in vitro and in vivo, which expands the applications in bio&#8208;implantable electronics.








Abstract
In the era of information explosion, high&#8208;security and high&#8208;capacity data storage technology attracts more and more attention. Physically transient electronics, a form of electronics that can physically disappear with precisely controlled degradation behaviors, paves the way for secure data storage. Herein, the authors report a silk&#8208;based hierarchically encoded data storage device (HEDSD) with controlled transiency. The HEDSD can store electronic, photonic, and optical information simultaneously by synergistically integrating a resistive switching memory (ReRAM), a terahertz metamaterial device, and a diffractive optical element, respectively. These three data storage units have shared materials and structures but diverse encoding mechanisms, which increases the degree of complexity and capacity of stored information. Silk plays an important role as a building material in the HEDSD thanks to its excellent mechanical, optical, and electrical properties and controlled transiency as a naturally extracted protein. By controlling the degradation rate of storage units of the silk&#8208;based HEDSD, different degradation modes of the HEDSD, and multilevel information encryption/decryption have been realized. Compared with the conventional memory devices, as&#8208;reported silk&#8208;based HEDSD can store multilevel complex information and realize multilevel information encryption and decryption, which is highly desirable to fulfill the future demands of secure memory systems and implantable storage devices.

         <title>Recent Progress on Self&#8208;Healable Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing electronic materials based on conducting polymers are reviewed. Tunable electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, high stability in air and aqueous media, low cost, lightweight, flexibility, and, in some cases, biocompatibility make these materials attractive for numerous applications, such as energy harvesting devices, wearable and stretchable electronics, electronic skin, and implantable devices.








Abstract
Materials able to regenerate after damage have been the object of investigation since the ancient times. For instance, self&#8208;healing concretes, able to resist earthquakes, aging, weather, and seawater have been known since the times of ancient Rome and are still the object of research. During the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in self&#8208;healing electronic materials, for applications in electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) for health monitoring, wearable and stretchable sensors, actuators, transistors, energy harvesting, and storage devices. Self&#8208;healing materials based on conducting polymers are particularly attractive due to their tunable high conductivity, good stability, intrinsic flexibility, excellent processability and biocompatibility. Here recent developments are reviewed in the field of self&#8208;healing electronic materials based on conducting polymers, such as poly 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT), polypyrrole (PPy), and polyaniline (PANI). The different types of healing, the strategies adopted to optimize electrical and mechanical properties, and the various possible healing mechanisms are introduced. Finally, the main challenges and perspectives in the field are discussed.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Tailored Surface Oxide on Cu&#8211;Ga Intermetallics Enhances CO2 Reduction Selectivity to Methanol at Ultralow Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8211;Ga&#8208;based intermetallics exhibit extremely high Faradaic efficiency toward methanol (78%) in an electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. The operando generates gallium oxide, identified as the active material, mapped via potential&#8208;dependent in situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared, and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic techniques. The best catalyst shows long&#8208;term stability with high current density in a gas diffusion electrode based flow cell.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is performed on two intermetallic compounds formed by copper and gallium metals (CuGa2 and Cu9Ga4). Among them, CuGa2 selectively converts CO2 to methanol with remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 77.26% at an extremely low potential of &#8722;0.3&#160;V vs RHE. The high performance of CuGa2 compared to Cu9Ga4 is driven by its unique 2D structure, which retains surface and subsurface oxide species (Ga2O3) even in the reduction atmosphere. The Ga2O3 species is mapped by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) techniques and electrochemical measurements. The eCO2RR selectivity to methanol are decreased at higher potential due to the lattice expansion caused by the reduction of the Ga2O3, which is probed by in situ XAFS, quasi in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and ex situ XPS measurements. The mechanism of the formation of methanol is visualized by in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy and the source of the carbon of methanol at the molecular level is confirmed from the isotope&#8208;labeling experiments in presence of 13CO2. Finally, to minimize the mass transport limitations and improve the overall eCO2RR performance, a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode is used in the flow cell configuration.

         <title>Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;Silicon Tandem Solar Cells: From the Lab to Fab?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reviews the recent developments in the field of perovskite&#8208;silicon tandems, explores the feasibility to elevate efficiency to &gt;32%, analyzes the upscaling technology being compatible with the current silicon technology, and discusses the pathways to prolong its stability.








Abstract
This review focuses on monolithic 2&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells and discusses key scientific and technological challenges to address in view of an industrial implementation of this technology. The authors start by examining the different crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) technologies suitable for pairing with perovskites, followed by reviewing recent developments in the field of monolithic 2&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;silicon tandems. Factors limiting the power conversion efficiency of these tandem devices are then evaluated, before discussing pathways to achieve an efficiency of &gt;32%, a value that small&#8208;scale devices will likely need to achieve to make tandems competitive. Aspects related to the upscaling of these device active areas to industry&#8208;relevant ones are reviewed, followed by a short discussion on module integration aspects. The review then focuses on stability issues, likely the most challenging task that will eventually determine the economic viability of this technology. The final part of this review discusses alternative monolithic perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem designs. Finally, key areas of research that should be addressed to bring this technology from the lab to the fab are highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;This work reviews the recent developments in the field of perovskite-silicon tandems, explores the feasibility to elevate efficiency to &amp;gt;32%, analyzes the upscaling technology being compatible with the current silicon technology, and discusses the pathways to prolong its stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review focuses on monolithic 2-terminal perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells and discusses key scientific and technological challenges to address in view of an industrial implementation of this technology. The authors start by examining the different crystalline silicon (c-Si) technologies suitable for pairing with perovskites, followed by reviewing recent developments in the field of monolithic 2-terminal perovskite-silicon tandems. Factors limiting the power conversion efficiency of these tandem devices are then evaluated, before discussing pathways to achieve an efficiency of &amp;gt;32%, a value that small-scale devices will likely need to achieve to make tandems competitive. Aspects related to the upscaling of these device active areas to industry-relevant ones are reviewed, followed by a short discussion on module integration aspects. The review then focuses on stability issues, likely the most challenging task that will eventually determine the economic viability of this technology. The final part of this review discusses alternative monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem designs. Finally, key areas of research that should be addressed to bring this technology from the lab to the fab are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Functional liquid crystals have great potential for a variety of new applications in the fields of energy, water, photonics, actuation, sensing, and biotechnology. Recent advances in functional liquid&#8208;crystalline materials based on polymers, supramolecular complexes, gels, colloids, and inorganic&#8208;based hybrids are reviewed, from design strategies, advanced measurements, and computational simulations to functionalization of these materials and interfaces.








Abstract
Liquid crystals have been intensively studied as functional materials. Recently, integration of various disciplines has led to new directions in the design of functional liquid&#8208;crystalline materials in the fields of energy, water, photonics, actuation, sensing, and biotechnology. Here, recent advances in functional liquid crystals based on polymers, supramolecular complexes, gels, colloids, and inorganic&#8208;based hybrids are reviewed, from design strategies to functionalization of these materials and interfaces. New insights into liquid crystals provided by significant progress in advanced measurements and computational simulations, which enhance new design and functionalization of liquid&#8208;crystalline materials, are also discussed.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Micro&#8208;LEDs Exhibiting High Output Power and High Modulation Bandwidth Simultaneously</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A parallel&#8208;arrayed planar (PAP) strategy is proposed and applied for fabricating AlGaN&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;&#8208;LEDs). The simultaneously demonstrated ultrahigh light output power, high wall&#8208;plug efficiency, and high modulation bandwidth shed light on the tremendous potential of the PAP strategy for fabricating DUV LEDs for multifunctional applications.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) solar&#8208;blind communication (SBC) shows distinct advantages of non&#8208;line&#8208;of&#8208;sight propagation and background noise negligibility over conventional visible&#8208;light communication. AlGaN&#8208;based DUV micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;&#8208;LEDs) are an excellent candidate for a DUV&#8208;SBC light source due to their small size, low power consumption, and high modulation bandwidth. A long&#8208;haul DUV&#8208;SBC system requires the light source exhibiting high output power, high modulation bandwidth, and high rate, simultaneously. Such a device is rarely reported. A parallel&#8208;arrayed planar (PAP) approach is here proposed to satisfy those requirements. By reducing the dimensions of the active emission mesa to micrometer scale, DUV &#181;&#8208;LEDs with ultrahigh power density are created due to their homogeneous injection current and enhanced planar isotropic light emission. Interconnected PAP &#181;&#8208;LEDs with a diameter of 25&#160;&#181;m are produced. This device has an output power of 83.5&#160;mW with a density of 405 W cm&#8722;2 at 230&#160;mA, a wall&#8208;plug efficiency (WPE) of 4.7% at 155&#160;mA, and a high &#8722;3&#160;dB modulation bandwidth of 380&#160;MHz. The remarkable high output power and efficiency make those devices a reliable platform to develop high&#8208;modulation&#8208;bandwidth wireless communication and to meet the requirements for bio&#8208;elimination.

         <title>Direct Observation of Strong Anomalous Hall Effect and Proximity&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetic State in SrIrO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic state&#8212;rarely observed in 5d&#8208;based transition metal oxides due to the generally weak electron&#8211;electron correlation&#8212;is induced in SrIrO3 by proximity to ferromagnetic insulating LaCoO3. Electrical transport allows the ferromagnetism of SrIrO3 to be probed selectively, revealing a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy and enabling the direct observation of a strong, intrinsic, and positive anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
The 5d iridium&#8208;based transition metal oxides have gained broad interest because of their strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, which favors new or exotic quantum electronic states. On the other hand, they rarely exhibit more mainstream orders like ferromagnetism due to generally weak electron&#8211;electron correlation strength. Here, a proximity&#8208;induced ferromagnetic (FM) state with TC&#160;&#8776; 100 K and strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy is shown in a SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure via interfacial charge transfer by using a ferromagnetic insulator in contact with SIO. Electrical transport allows to selectively probe the FM state of the SIO layer and the direct observation of a strong, intrinsic, and positive anomalous Hall effect (AHE). For T&#160;&#8804; 20 K, the AHE displays unusually large coercive and saturation field, a fingerprint of a strong pseudospin&#8211;lattice coupling. A Hall angle, &#963;xyAHE/&#963;xx, larger by an order of magnitude than in typical 3d metals and an FM net moment of about 0.1 &#956;B/Ir, is reported. This emphasizes how efficiently the nontrivial topological band properties of SIO can be manipulated by structural modifications and the exchange interaction with 3d TMOs.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrocatalytic conversion and adsorption of polysulfides are realized by combining a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived porous carbon structure and introducing a conductive catalyst Mo2C. The synergistic effect of physical confinement and electrocatalysis improves the utilization rate and stability of S. It shows the excellent rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycle life (503 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles).








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries, as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na&#8208;S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfide shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro&#8208; and&#160;mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and&#160;accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transformation of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Urine&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Initiated Composite Hydrogel Patch Reconfiguration Propels Scarless Memory Repair and Reinvigoration of the Urethra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urine&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch featuring robust antiswelling is engineered, which can respond to Ca2+ in urine to trigger structure reconfiguration and antiswelling for enhancing mechanical stiffness and realizing scarless memory repair via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation, and accelerating angiogenesis especially when combining with moderate photo&#8208;provoked reactive oxygen species birth.








Abstract
The harsh urine microenvironment (UME), as an inherent hurdle, endangers and renders urethral repair unreachable. Innovatively, the unfavorable UME is utilized as the design source to construct a UME&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch for realizing scarless memory repair, wherein laser&#8208;excited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mechanical strength elevation using chemically crosslinked silicon quantum dots are accessible. Intriguingly, the proposed composite scaffolds can respond to Ca2+ in urine, cause structure reconfiguration, and repress swelling to further enhance scaffold stiffness. Systematic experiments validate that ROS birth and unexpected stiffness elevation in such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds can realize scarless memory repair of the urethra in vivo. Comprehensive mechanism explorations uncover that the activations of cell proliferation and collagen&#8208;related genes (e.g., MMP&#8208;1 and COL3A1) and the dampening of fibrosis&#8208;related (e.g., TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) and mechanosensitive genes (e.g., YAP/TAZ) are responsible for the scarless memory repair of such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, decreasing fibrosis and inflammation, and accelerating angiogenesis. The design rationales (e.g., UME&#8208;initiated structure reconfiguration and antiswelling) can serve as an instructive and general approach for urethra repair.

         <title>Polymerized Small Molecular Acceptor with Branched Side Chains for All Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 16.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X have been synthesized. By optimizing the length of branched alkyl chains, PY&#8208;HD (2&#8208;hexyldecyl substitution)&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) delivers a high efficiency of 16.76%, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.949&#160;V, and an extremely low non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of 0.18&#160;V, representing the highest efficiency for binary all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of small molecule acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based organic solar cells have already exceeded 18%. However, the development of polymer acceptors still lags far behind their SMA counterparts mainly due to the lack of efficient polymer acceptors. Herein, a series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X (with X being the branched alkyl chain) are&#160;designed and synthesized by employing the same central core with the SMA L8&#8208;BO but with different branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. It is found that the molecular packing of SMA&#8208;HD featuring 2&#8208;hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY&#8208;HD is similar to L8&#8208;BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high&#8208;order molecular assembly in SMA&#8208;HD molecules. When combined with PM6, PY&#8208;HD&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) exhibits a high PCE of 16.41%, representing the highest efficiency for the binary all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, the side&#8208;chain modification on the pyrrole site position further improves the performance of the all&#8208;PSCs, and the PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device delivers a new record high efficiency of 16.76% (certified as 16.3%). The work provides new insights for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship of polymer acceptors and paves a feasible avenue to develop efficient conjugated polymer acceptors.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Artificial Hybrid Nanocells for Boosted Vascular Regeneration in Ischemic Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of stem cell&#8208;based therapeutics faces some bottleneck problem in the progression of cellular approaches. This study introduces a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery system that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions, providing superior effects on targeting ischemic tissues and spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration in ischemic tissues.








Abstract
Restoration of sufficient blood supply for the treatment of ischemia remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Here, a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery technology is introduced that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions for the spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration. Specifically, a copper&#8208;containing protein is successfully prepared using a recombinant protein scaffold based on a de novo design strategy, which facilitates the timely release of nitric oxide and improved accumulation of particles within ischemic tissues. Through closely mimicking physiological cues, the authors demonstrate the benefits of bioactive factors secreted from hypoxic stem cells on promoting angiogenesis. Following this cell&#8208;mimicking manner, artificial hybrid nanosized cells (Hynocell) are constructed by integrating the hypoxic stem cell secretome into nanoparticles with surface coatings of cell membranes fused with copper&#8208;containing protein. The Hynocell, hybridized with different cell&#8208;derived components, provides synergistic effects on targeting ischemic tissues and promoting vascular regeneration in acute hindlimb ischemia and acute myocardial infarction models. This study offers new insights into the utilization of nanotechnology to potentiate the development of cell&#8208;free therapeutics.

         <title>A 3D Hierarchical Host with Enhanced Sodiophilicity Enabling Anode&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous carbon particles with open channels allow rapid Na&#8208;ion flux, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles on the carbon surface induce uniform Na deposition owing to the enhanced Na binding energy. The hierarchical host enables superior cycling performance as Na&#8208;metal anodes under extremely high current conditions as well as demonstration of anode&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as a compliment to lithium&#8208;metal batteries for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium (Na). Herein, a 3D nanostructured porous carbon particle containing carbon&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (PC&#8208;CFe) is employed as a highly reversible Na&#8208;metal host. PC&#8208;CFe has a unique 3D hierarchy based on sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized carbon particles, ordered open channels, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (CFe) on the surface. PC&#8208;CFe achieves high reversibility of Na plating/stripping processes over 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 with 10 mAh cm&#8211;2 in Na//Cu asymmetric cells, as well as over 14&#160;400 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in Na//Na symmetric cells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior cycling performance of PC&#8208;CFe stems from the stronger adsorption of Na on the surface of the CFe, providing initial nucleation sites more favorable to Na deposition. Moreover, the full cell with a PC&#8208;CFe host without Na metal and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) maintains a high capacity of 103 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 even after 100 cycles, demonstrating the operation of anode&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Inhaled mRNA Nanoformulation with Biogenic Ribosomal Protein Reverses Established Pulmonary Fibrosis in a Bleomycin&#8208;Induced Murine Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reverse established pulmonary fibrosis, an inhaled nanoformulation is developed with biogenic ribosomal protein for co&#8208;delivering the mRNA of matrix metalloproteinase 13 and keratinocyte growth factor. The nanoformulation&#8208;mediated treatment accelerates the clearance of overwhelming collagen and the alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization in fibrotic foci, which synergistically restores alveolar integrity and improves pulmonary function of the bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model.








Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a lethal respiratory disease with few treatment options, occurs due to repetitive microinjuries to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and progresses with an overwhelming deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), ultimately resulting in fibrotic scars and destroyed the alveolar architecture. Here, an inhaled ribosomal protein&#8208;based mRNA nanoformulation is reported for clearing the intrapulmonary ECM and re&#8208;epithelializing the disrupted alveolar epithelium, thereby reversing established fibrotic foci in IPF. The nanoformulation is sequentially assembled by a ribosomal protein&#8208;condensed mRNA core, a bifunctional peptide&#8208;modified corona and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) with a PEGylated shielding shell. When inhaled via a nebulizer, the nanoformulations carried by microdrops are deposited in the alveoli, and penetrate into fibrotic foci, where the outer KGFs are detached after matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) triggering. The RGD motif&#8208;grafted cores then expose and specifically target the integrin&#8208;elevated cells for the intracellular delivery of mRNA. Notably, repeated inhalation of the nanoformulations accelerates the clearance of locoregional collagen by boosting the intralesional expression of MMP13 and alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization mediated by KGFs, which synergistically ameliorates the lung function of a bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model. Therefore, this work provides an alternative mRNA&#8208;inhalation delivery strategy, which shows great potential for the treatment of IPF.

         <title>Meniscus&#8208;Assisted Coating with Optimized Active&#8208;Layer Morphology toward Highly Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solution&#8208;printing strategy based on meniscus&#8208;assisted coating for all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) is presented. The champion device based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.53%, which is attributable to the enhanced crystallinity and nanofiber network morphology. It is worth mentioning that 15.53% is the highest PCE reported for solution&#8208;printing&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Morphology control is the key to engineering highly efficient solution&#8208;processed solar cells. Focusing on the most promising application&#8208;oriented photovoltaic all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), herein a facile and effective meniscus&#8208;assisted&#8208;coating (MAC) strategy is reported for preparing high&#8208;quality blend films with enhanced crystallinity and an interpenetrating nanofiber network morphology. The all&#8208;PSCs based on MAC exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties with efficiencies exceeding 15%, which is the best performance of solution&#8208;printing&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, as well as better stability. The crystallization kinetics of the polymer blend film is investigated by in situ UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, and the result explains the linear relationship between the meniscus advance speed and the crystallinity (crystallization rate) of the polymer. To verify the compatibility and universality of this strategy, the MAC strategy is applied to the other three binary systems. By precisely controlling the meniscus advancing speed, 1 cm2 all&#8208;PSC devices whose efficiencies exceed 12% are fabricated. Such progress demonstrates that the application of the MAC strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Cellular Acoustic Absorber of Graphene Ultrathin Drums</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient acoustic absorber is realized by integrating ultrathin graphene membranes into commercial polymer sponges, to fulfill the outstanding resonance properties of 2D graphene sheets in acoustic absorption and satisfy the urgent demands in acoustic absorption from noise protection, instruments to building design, and acoustic devices.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D graphene sheets exhibit unparalleled in&#8208;plane stiffness and large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elasticity, thereby providing strong mechanical resonance for nanomechanical devices. The exceptional resonance behavior of ultrathin graphene, which promises the fabrication of superior acoustic absorption materials, however, remains unfulfilled for the lack of applicable form and assembly methods. Here, a highly efficient acoustic absorber is presented, wherein cellular networks of ultrathin graphene membranes are constructed into polymer foams. The ultrathin graphene drums exhibit strong resonances and efficiently dissipate sound waves in a broad frequency range. A record specific noise reduction coefficient (51.3 at 30&#160;mm) is achieved in the graphene&#8208;based acoustic absorber, fully realizing the superior resonance properties of graphene sheets. The scalable method facilely transforms commercial polymer foams to superior acoustic absorbers with a &#8776;320% enhancement in average absorption coefficient across wide frequencies from 200 to 6000&#160;Hz. The graphene acoustic absorber offers a convenient method to exploit the extraordinary resonance properties of 2D sheets, opening extensive new applications in noise protection, building design, instruments and acoustic devices.

         <title>An Advanced High&#8208;Entropy Fluorophosphate Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy effect is delicately introduced into fluorophosphate cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries by in situ partial substitution of active V central atom, preparing a high&#8208;entropy carbon&#8208;free Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 cathode, suppressing the occurrence of detrimental phase transition process in the low&#8208;voltage region, and further lifting up the mean working voltage of pristine Na3V2(PO4)2F3, enhancing sodium storage behavior, rate capability, and cycle performance.








Abstract
Impossible voltage plateau regulation for the cathode materials with fixed active elemental center is a pressing issue hindering the development of Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy substitution strategy, to alter the detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing the central active V atom, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. The as&#8208;prepared carbon&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE&#8208;NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81&#160;V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is attributed by the diverse transition&#8208;metal elemental substitution in high&#8208;entropy crystalline. More importantly, high&#8208;entropy introduction can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low&#8208;voltage region, further lifting up the mean working voltage to realize a full Na&#8208;ion storage at the high voltage plateau. Coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HE&#8208;NVPF//HC SIB full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 5 C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg&#8722;1. This route means the unlikely potential regulation in NASICON&#8208;type crystal with unchangeable active center becomes possible, inspiring new ideas on elevating the mean working voltage for SIB cathodes.

         <title>High&#8208;Polarizability Organic Ferroelectric Materials Doping for Enhancing the Built&#8208;In Electric Field of Perovskite Solar Cells Realizing Efficiency over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride):dabcoHReO4 as a perovskite dopant can be partially polarized by the built&#8208;in electric field of perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) itself, which produces an additional electric field, thus promoting the charge&#8208;carrier transportation. A promising 24.23% power conversion efficiency (PCE) (certified PCE of 23.45%) and robust operational stability are obtained.








Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) intensity of silicon heterojunction solar cells can be easily enhanced by selective doping to obtain high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), while it is challenging for perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Herein, an effective method is reported to enhance the BEF of FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite by doping an organic ferroelectric material, poly(vinylidene fluoride):dabcoHReO4 (PVDF:DH) with high polarizability, that can be driven even by the BEF of the device itself. The polarization of PVDF:DH produces an additional electric field, which is maintained permanently, in a direction consistent with that of the BEF of the pero&#8208;SC. The BEF superposition&#160;can more sufficiently drive the charge&#8208;carrier transport and extraction, thus suppressing the nonradiative recombination occurring in the pero&#8208;SCs. Moreover, the PVDF:DH dopant benefits the formation of a mesoporous PbI2 film, via a typical two&#8208;step processing method, thereby promoting perovskite growth with high crystallinity and a few defects. The resulting pero&#8208;SC shows a promising PCE of 24.23% for a 0.062 cm2 device (certified PCE of 23.45%), and a remarkable PCE of 22.69% for a 1 cm2 device, along with significantly improved moisture resistances and operational stabilities.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Infused Porous Surfaces for Manipulation of Underwater Gas Bubble Transport and Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of thermotropic liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;infused porous surfaces capable of on&#8208;demand immobilization, transport, and release of gas bubbles via a LC phase transition is reported. Their use in the design of cyanobacteria&#8208;inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen level in biomimetic cell cultures is demonstrated.








Abstract
Biomimetic artificial surfaces that enable the manipulation of gas bubble mobility have been explored in a wide range of applications in nanomaterial synthesis, surface defouling, biomedical diagnostics, and therapeutics. Although many superhydrophobic surfaces and isotropic&#8208;lubricant&#8208;infused porous surfaces have been developed to manipulate gas bubbles, the simultaneous control over the adhesion and transport of gas bubbles underwater remains a challenge. Thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs), a class of structured fluids, provide an opportunity to tune the behavior of gas bubbles through LC mesophase transitions using a variety of external stimuli. Using this central idea, the design and synthesis of LC&#8208;infused porous surfaces (LCIPS) is reported and the effects of the LC mesophase on the transport and adhesion of gas bubbles on LCIPS immersed in water elucidated. LCIPS are demonstrated to be a promising class of surfaces with an unprecedented level of responsiveness and functionality, which enables the design of cyanobacteria&#8208;inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen levels in biomimetic cell cultures.

         <title>Plasmonic Active &#8220;Hot Spots&#8221;&#8208;Confined Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity for CH4 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalytic CO2 reduction is proposed and realized in the well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; can not only generate high&#8208;energy hot electrons, but also adsorb intermediate products of CO and protons, thereby resulting in high photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CH4 production.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures have tremendous potential to be applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, since their localized surface plasmon resonance can collect low&#8208;energy&#8208;photons to derive energetic &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; for reducing the CO2 activation&#8208;barrier. However, the hot electron&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is usually limited by poor efficiency and low selectivity for producing kinetically unfavorable hydrocarbons. Here, a new idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalysis is proposed to overcome this drawback. W18O49 nanowires on the outer surface of Au nanoparticles&#8208;embedded TiO2 electrospun nanofibers are assembled to obtain lots of Au/TiO2/W18O49 sandwich&#8208;like substructures in the formed plasmonic heterostructure. The short distance (&lt; 10&#160;nm) between Au and adjacent W18O49 can induce an intense plasmon&#8208;coupling to form the active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the substructures. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; are capable of not only gathering the incident light to enhance &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; generation and migration, but also capturing protons and CO through the dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;active&#8208;sites (Au&#8208;O&#8208;Ti and W&#8208;O&#8208;Ti) at the Au/TiO2/W18O49 interface, as evidenced by systematic experiments and simulation analyses. Thus, during photocatalytic CO2 reduction at 43&#177; 2&#8197;&#176;C,&#160;these active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; enriched in the well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure can synergistically confine the hot&#8208;electron, proton, and CO intermediates for resulting in the CH4 and CO production&#8208;rates at &#8776;35.55 and &#8776;2.57&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, and the CH4&#8208;product selectivity at &#8776;93.3%.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;Derivative Decorated Hierarchical Porous Host Enabling Ultrahigh Rates and Superior Long&#8208;Term Cycling of Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elaborate design is reported to fabricate novel 3D host for Zn metal anodes by assembling carbon nanotubes and graphene into a hierarchical porous structure, followed by decorating with Zn&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework derivatives, which enables a significant boost on both charging/discharging rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance for Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their high intrinsic capacity, high safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, uncontrollable dendrite growth and adverse side reactions of Zn anodes seriously hinder their further application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous graphene&#8208;carbon nanotubes scaffold decorated with metal&#8211;organic framework derived ZnO/C nanoparticles (3D&#8208;ZGC) is fabricated as the host for dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal composite anodes. The zincophilic ZnO/C nanoparticles act as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to induce homogeneous Zn deposition. The mechanically robust 3D scaffold with high conductivity not only suppresses the formation of dendritic Zn by reducing the local current density and homogenizing Zn2+ ion flux, but also inhibits volume changes during the long&#8208;term plating/stripping process. As a result, the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anodes afford unprecedented Zn plating&#8208;stripping stability at an ultrahigh current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 for 1500 cycles with low overpotential (&lt;65&#160;mV) when used in a symmetric cell. When coupled with MnO2 cathodes, the assembled Zn@3D&#8208;ZGC//MnO2 full batteries deliver an enhanced cycling stability for up to 6000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8208;1, demonstrating the potential of the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anode for advanced Zn metal batteries.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Metasurface&#8208;Enabled Multiple Vortex Emissions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining an orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing metalens array and semiconductor microlasers, the simultaneous generation of a vortex emission array with versatile topological charges is experimentally demonstrated, paving an essential step toward on&#8208;chip integrated OAM sources.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integrated micro&#8208; and nanoscale vortex lasers are key elements for addressing the exponentially growing demand for information capacity. Although tunable vortex microlasers have been reported, each laser pulse still possesses one particular topological charge and requires additional multiplexing. In this study, the simultaneous generation of coherent laser arrays with different topological charges by combining metalenses with semiconductor microlasers is demonstrated. A TiO2 vortex metalens converts two orbital angular momentum beams into the same diffraction&#8208;limit spot with opposite circular polarizations through spin&#8208;to&#8208;orbital conversion. Consequently, the microlaser emission at the focal spot, which can be decomposed into two circularly polarized beams, is collimated into vortex microlaser beams with two different topological charges through a time&#8208;reversal process. This concept is extended to a 2 &#215; 2 metalens array by introducing off&#8208;axis terms, and eight topological charges are produced simultaneously. This research is a significant step toward the on&#8208;chip integration of micro&#8208; and nanolasers.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dual&#8208;Type Signal Vector Sensor for Smart Robotics and Automatic Vehicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered dual&#8208;type signal vector sensor is designed by integrating an alternating&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a direct&#8208;current TENG, which achieves a high sensing precision and stability, and provides an effective movement direction recognition method by self&#8208;powered switching of signal type in real&#8208;time motion monitoring of a mechanical arm and automatic steering wheel.








Abstract
Automatic control systems are the most efficient technology for reducing labor cost while improving work efficiency. Vector motion monitoring is indispensable for the normal operation of automatic control systems. Here, a self&#8208;powered dual&#8208;type signal triboelectric nanogenerator (DS&#8208;TENG) is designed through integrating an alternating&#8208;current TENG and a direct&#8208;current TENG, which can monitor vector movement in real time based on pulse signal counts. As a result, the DS&#8208;TENG avoids the shortcoming of traditional self&#8208;powered sensors based on signal amplitude that is sensitive to the working environment, achieves a high sensing precision, and maintains stability after reciprocating motion of 500&#160;000 cycles. Moreover, it realizes effective movement direction recognition by self&#8208;powered switching of signal type in reverse movement. This dual&#8208;type signal TENG exhibits high precision and automatic direction recognition in vector motion monitor and trajectory tracker, paving the way for the application of the self&#8208;powered TENG sensor in automatic control systems in the future.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Organic Photocatalyst Discovered for Highly Efficient Additive&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Grafting of Polymers from Proteins at Ambient and Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) is reported, which enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven additive&#8208;free &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. A variety of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates are prepared under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation. It is believed that this PC will be widely employed for photocatalysis in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Since the pioneering discovery of a protein bound to poly(ethylene glycol), the utility of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates (PPCs) is rapidly expanding to currently emerging applications. Photoinduced energy/electron&#8208;transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization is a very promising method to prepare structurally well&#8208;defined PPCs, as it eliminates high&#8208;cost and time&#8208;consuming deoxygenation processes due to its oxygen tolerance. However, the oxygen&#8208;tolerance behavior of PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization is not well&#8208;investigated in aqueous environments, and thereby the preparation of PPCs using PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization needs a substantial amount of sacrificial reducing agents or inert&#8208;gas purging processes. Herein a novel water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) is reported, which enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven additive&#8208;free &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. Interestingly, the developed PC shows unconventional &#8220;oxygen&#8208;acceleration&#8221; behavior for a variety of acrylic and acrylamide monomers in aqueous conditions without any additives, which are apparently distinct from previously reported systems. With such a PC, &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations are successfully performed from protein in ambient buffer conditions under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation, which result in various PPCs that have neutral, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic polyacrylates, and polyacrylamides. It is believed that this PC will be widely employed for a variety of photocatalysis processes in aqueous environments, including the living cell system.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Integration of Silicon Nanomembranes with 2D Materials for Bioresorbable, Wireless Neurochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, wireless, and bioresorbable neurochemical system designed to determine various concentrations of neurotransmitters as well as to monitor peripheral physiologies (temperature, pH, electrical activity) in a simultaneous manner is presented. An extensive range of studies covers modifications of nanoscale materials and system&#8208;level electronics, enabling the production of exceptional performance.








Abstract
Although neurotransmitters are key substances closely related to evaluating degenerative brain diseases as well as regulating essential functions in the body, many research efforts have not been focused on direct observation of such biochemical messengers, rather on monitoring relatively associated physical, mechanical, and electrophysiological parameters. Here, a bioresorbable silicon&#8208;based neurochemical analyzer incorporated with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is introduced as a completely implantable brain&#8208;integrated system that can wirelessly monitor time&#8208;dynamic behaviors of dopamine and relevant parameters in a simultaneous mode. An extensive range of examinations of molybdenum/tungsten disulfide (MoS2/WS2) nanosheets and catalytic iron nanoparticles (Fe NPs) highlights the underlying mechanisms of strong chemical and target&#8208;specific responses to the neurotransmitters, along with theoretical modeling tools. Systematic characterizations demonstrate reversible, stable, and long&#8208;term operational performances of the degradable bioelectronics with excellent sensitivity and selectivity over those of non&#8208;dissolvable counterparts. A complete set of in vivo experiments with comparative analysis using carbon&#8208;fiber electrodes illustrates the capability for potential use as a clinically accessible tool to associated neurodegenerative diseases.

Hygroscopic chemistry enables fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is a common safety risk that is extremely serious in energy storage devices. Here, a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor achieved by the self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte is reported, in which hygroscopic solute spontaneously absorbs water from the air as the solvent to recover the disenabled supercapacitor even after burning.

High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is an extremely serious safety risk in energy storage devices; which can be avoided by replacing their components with nonflammable materials. However; these devices are still destroyed by the high&#8208;temperature decomposition; lacking reliability. Here, a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor is further demonstrated that recovers after burning with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. Using fire&#8208;tolerant electrodes and separator with a semiopen device configuration; hygroscopic CaCl2 in the air (&#8220;CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221;) is designed as a self&#8208;healable electrolyte; which loses its water solvent at high temperatures but spontaneously absorbs water from the air to recover by itself at low temperatures. The supercapacitor is disenabled at 500 &#176;C; while it recovers after cooling in the air. Especially; it even recovers after burning at around 647 &#176;C with enhanced performance. The study offers a self&#8208;healing strategy to design high&#8208;safety; high&#8208;reliability; and fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors; which inspires a promising way to deal with general fire&#8208;related risks.

&lt;p&gt;Hygroscopic chemistry enables fire-tolerant supercapacitors with a self-healable &#8220;solute-in-air&#8221; electrolyte. High-temperature-induced fire is a common safety risk that is extremely serious in energy storage devices.

         <title>2D FeOCl: A Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor Synthesized via Temperature&#8208;Oscillation Chemical Vapor Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale antiferromagnetic semiconductor FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized by developing a temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport method. The semiconducting characteristics, strong in&#8208;plane anisotropies, and spin&#8722;phonon coupling effect of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. This study provides a high&#8208;quality low&#8208;symmetry van der Waals magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronic devices.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) transition&#8208;metal oxyhalides with low symmetry, novel magnetism, and good stability provide a versatile platform for conducting fundamental research and developing spintronics. Antiferromagnetic FeOCl has attracted significant interest owing to its unique semiconductor properties and relatively high N&#233;el temperature. Herein, good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized using the universal temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport (TO&#8208;CVT) method. The crystal structure, bandgap, and anisotropic behavior of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. The absorption spectrum and electrical measurements reveal that 2D FeOCl is a semiconductor with an optical bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV and a resistivity of &#8776;10&#8722;1&#160;&#937; m at 295 K, and the bandgap increases with decreasing thickness. Strong in&#8208;plane optical and electrical anisotropies are observed in 2D FeOCl flakes, and the maximum resistance anisotropic ratio reaches 2.66 at 295 K. Additionally, the lattice vibration modes are studied through temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectra and first&#8208;principles density functional calculations. A significant decrease in the Raman frequencies below the N&#233;el temperature is observed, which results from the strong spin&#8722;phonon coupling effect in 2D FeOCl. This study provides a high&#8208;quality low&#8208;symmetry vdW magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronics.

         <title>From p&#8208; to n&#8208;Type Mixed Conduction in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Polymers through Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecular design criteria for isoindigo&#8208;based semiconducting polymers is presented and their versatility is showcased for the development of mixed conductors relevant to organic bioelectronic applications. Through rational choice of the isoindigoid motif and an appropriate comonomer, efficient hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transport materials are developed and strategies for further optimization are identified, including the development of ambipolar mixed conductors.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic and electronic conductors are of significant interest for bioelectronic applications. Here, three different isoindigoid building blocks are used to obtain polymeric mixed conductors with vastly different structural and electronic properties which can be further fine&#8208;tuned through the choice of comonomer unit. This work shows how careful design of the isoindigoid scaffold can afford highly planar polymer structures with high degrees of electronic delocalization, while subtle structural modifications can control the dominant charge carrier (hole or electron) when probed in organic electrochemical transistors. A combination of experimental and computational techniques is employed to probe electrochemical, structural, and mixed ionic and electronic properties of the polymer series which in turn allows the derivation of important structure&#8211;property relations for this promising class of materials in the context of organic bioelectronics. Ultimately, these findings are used to outline robust molecular&#8208;design strategies for isoindigo&#8208;based mixed conductors that can support efficient p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type, and ambipolar transistor operation in an aqueous environment.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Auxetic Hierarchical Mechanical Metamaterials for Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents novel 2D and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior that can be fully controlled through design parameters. The proposed hierarchical systems can also form composites capable of shape morphing where the initial structures can assume arbitrary predefined shapes.








Abstract
Shape morphing and the possibility of having control over mechanical properties via designed deformations have attracted a lot of attention in the materials community and led to a variety of applications with an emphasis on the space industry. However, current materials normally do not allow to have a full control over the deformation pattern and often fail to replicate such behavior at low scales which is essential in flexible electronics. Thus, in this paper, novel 2D&#160;and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials using mutually&#8208;competing substructures within the system that are capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior are proposed. Using experiments (3D microprinted polymers) supported by computer simulations, it is shown that such ability can be controlled through geometric design parameters. Finally it is demonstrated that the considered structure can form a composite capable of shape morphing allowing it to deform to a predefined shape.

         <title>Design Rules of a Sulfur Redox Electrocatalyst for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection are proposed as two rules for the rational design of sulfur redox electrocatalysts. The former promotes the tight anchoring of polysulfides onto the SmMn2O5 catalyst, while the latter reduces the overpotential of the sulfur redox reaction, fundamentally accelerating the conversion of liquid&#8208;phase polysulfides to solid&#8208;phase discharge product and thus suppressing the shuttling.








Abstract
Seeking an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides to insoluble products is crucial to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries and thus increase their practical energy density. Mn&#8208;based mullite (SmMn2O5) is used as a model catalyst for the sulfur redox reaction to show how the design rules involving lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection improve catalyst performance. Theoretical simulation shows that the positions of Mn and O active sites on the (001) surface are a good match with those of Li and S atoms in polysulfides, resulting in their tight anchoring to each other. Fundamentally, dz2 and dx2&#8722;y2 around the Fermi level are found to be crucial for strongly coupling with the p&#8208;orbitals of the polysulfides and thus decreasing the redox overpotential. Following the theoretical calculation, SmMn2O5 catalyst is synthesized and used as an interlayer in a Li&#8211;S battery. The resulted battery has a high cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 0.5 C and more promisingly a high areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved with a sulfur loading of &#8776;5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 under the condition of a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) value &#8776;4.6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1.

         <title>Hybrid&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Decorated Prussian Blue for Effective Cancer Immunotherapy via Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages Polarization and Hypoxia Relief</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane camouflage hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption (Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ) to form TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, notably reduces in vivo reticuloendothelial system uptake, enhances tumor accumulation, inhibits tumor growth, induces tumor&#8208;associated macrophage polarization, facilitates cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration, and alleviates hypoxia microenvironment for improved cancer immunotherapy efficacy.








Abstract
Both tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and hypoxia condition severely restrict the antitumor potency during cancer immunotherapy. It is essential to overcome the two issues for improving therapeutic efficacy. In this study, a hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption is built, to form Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ. It can facilitate cellular internalization via mannose&#8208;receptor mediated endocytosis and induce TAM polarization via iron ion/HCQ release with HMPB degradation. The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane is camouflaged on the Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ surface, denoted as TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, to reduce in vivo reticuloendothelial system uptake, enhance tumor accumulation, and mitigate hypoxia. The in vivo results indicate that TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ notably inhibits tumor growth, induces TAM polarization, facilitates cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration, and alleviates hypoxia microenvironment. The rational design may provide a new pathway to modulate the tumor microenvironment for promoting cancer immunotherapy effects.

         <title>Heterojunction Annealing Enabling Record Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage in Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterojunction post&#8208;annealing treatment is utilized to suppress the nonradiative recombination for a highly competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 520&#160;mV in Sb2Se3 thin&#8208;film solar cells. The VOC deficit of the device is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cells.








Abstract
Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) thin&#8208;film solar cells have undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit still remains as the biggest bottleneck, as even the world&#8208;record device suffers from a large VOC deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) is subjected to a post&#8208;annealing treatment using a rapid thermal process. It is found that nonradiative recombination near the Sb2Se3/CdS HTJ, including interface recombination and space charge region recombination, is greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb2Se3/CdS thin&#8208;film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record VOC of 0.52&#160;V is successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated VOC deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.

         <title>Antifreezing Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ternary Hydrogen Bonding for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible and antifreezing polysaccharide hydrogel is realized in situ with Zn(ClO4)2 salts through the Hofmeister effect. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions can form weak hydrogen bonds with both water and polymer chains to decrease the electrolyte freezing point and endow the hydrogel with good mechanical flexibility, thus enabling the zinc&#8208;ion batteries with high performance ranging from &#8722;30 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The new&#8208;generation flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries require enhanced mechanical properties and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications. This fundamentally means that it is desired that the hydrogel electrolyte possesses antifreezing merits to resist flexibility loss and performance decrease at subzero temperatures. Herein, a highly flexible polysaccharide hydrogel is realized in situ and is regulated in zinc&#8208;ion batteries through the Hofmeister effect with low&#8208;concentration Zn(ClO4)2 salts to satisfy the abovementioned requirements. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions, water, and polymer chains can form ternary and weak hydrogen bonding (HB), which enables the polymer chains to have improved mechanical properties, breaks the HB of water to remarkably decrease the electrolyte freezing point, and reduces the amounts of free water for effective side reactions and dendrite inhibition. Consequently, even at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, the Zn(ClO4)2 in situ optimized hydrogel electrolyte features a high ionic conductivity of 7.8 mS cm&#8722;1 and excellent flexibility, which enables a Zn/polyaniline (PANI) battery with a reversible capacity of 70&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 under 5 A g&#8722;1 for 2500 cycles, and renderd the flexible full battery with excellent cycling performances under different bending angles. This work provides a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance antifreezing flexible batteries via the Hofmeister effect.

         <title>Selective Center Charge Density Enables Conductive 2D Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks with Exceptionally High Pseudocapacitance and Energy Density for Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with prototypical of 2D Co&#8208;catecholate is proposed. The lower electron cloud density of the metal&#8208;ion center in the Z&#8208;axis provides the ability to attract a group of electron donors, leading to exceptionally high pseudocapacitance and energy density.








Abstract
Conductive 2D conjugated metal&#8722;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) are attractive electrode materials due to their high intrinsic electrical conductivities, large specific surface area, and abundant unsaturated bonds/functional groups. However, the 2D c&#8208;MOFs reported so far have limited charge storage capacity during electrochemical charging and discharging, and the energy density is still unsatisfactory. In this work, a strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with the prototypical of 2D Co&#8208;catecholate (Co&#8208;CAT) is proposed. Electrochemical mechanism studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that dual redox sites are achieved with the quinone groups (CAT) and metal&#8208;ion linkages (Co&#8722;O) serving as the active sites of pseudocapacitive cation (Na+) and redox electrolyte species (SO32&#8722;). The resultant electrode delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 1160 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and a special self&#8208;discharge rate (86.8% after 48&#160;h). Moreover, the packaged asymmetric device exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy density of 158 W h kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 2000 W kg&#8722;1 and an excellent self&#8208;discharge rate of 80.6% after 48 h. This success will provide a new perspective for the performance enhancement for the 2D&#8208;MOF&#8208;based energy storage devices.

The resultant electrode delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 1160 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a special self-discharge rate (86.8% after 48&#160;h). Moreover, the packaged asymmetric device exhibits a state-of-the-art energy density of 158 W h kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the power density of 2000 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an excellent self-discharge rate of 80.6% after 48 h. This success will provide a new perspective for the performance enhancement for the 2D-MOF-based energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Redox Couple Strategy Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes by Suppressing Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen release is the main reason for capacity decay of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. A novel redox couple strategy is proposed here to fundamentally solve this problem. As a proof of concept, the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple can significantly suppress oxygen release by chemically reducing surface O22&#8722; back into immobile O2&#8722;, thereby achieving the long&#8208;term cycling stability of Li&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The poor cycling stability and fast voltage fading resulting from oxygen release during charging, however, severely hinders their practical application. Herein, a strategy of introducing an additional redox couple is proposed to eliminate the persistent problem of oxygen release. As a proof of concept, the cycling stability of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, which is a typical LMRO cathode, is substantially enhanced with the help of the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple, and the capacity shows no decay with a retention of 100% after 700 cycles at 1C, far superior to the bare counterpart (61.7%). The surface peroxide ions (O22&#8722;) are readily chemically reduced back to immobile O2&#8722; by S2&#8722; during charging, accompanied by the formation of SO32&#8722;, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the oxygen lattice and eventually inhibiting the release of oxygen. More importantly, the S2&#8722; ions are regenerated during the following discharging process and participate in the chemical redox reaction again. The findings shed light on a potential direction to tackle the poor cycling stability of high&#8208;energy anion&#8208;redox cathode materials for rechargeable metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism in Perylene Diimide Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductors with negligible spin&#8211;orbital couplings are potential materials for spintronics. Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is revealed in perylene diimide (PDI) semiconductor with high mobility. PDI ferromagnets show Curie temperature of more than 400 K and saturation magnetization above 1 emu g&#8722;1. This work paves a new way to realize room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.








Abstract
The development of pure organic magnets with high Curie temperatures remains a challenging task in material science. Introducing high&#8208;density free radicals to strongly interacting organic molecules may be an effective method to this end. In this study, a solvothermal approach with excess hydrazine hydrate is used to concurrently reduce and dissolve rigid&#8208;backbone perylene diimide (PDI) crystallites into the soluble dianion species with a remarkably high reduction potential. The as&#8208;prepared PDI powders comprising radical anion aggregates are fabricated by a subsequent self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous oxidation process. The results of magnetic measurements show that the PDI powders exhibit room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and a Curie temperature higher than 400 K, with a vast saturation magnetization that reaches &#8776;1.2 emu g&#8722;1. Elemental analysis along with the diamagnetic signal of the ablated residue are used to rule out the possibility that the magnetism is due to metal contamination. The findings suggest that the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering can survive at room&#8208;temperature in organic semiconductors, and offers a new optional way to create room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.

         <title>Unconventional Doping Effect Leads to Ultrahigh Average Thermoelectric Power Factor in Cu3SbSe4&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the advantage of unconventional doping, high carrier mobility is maintained in Cu3SbSe4&#8722;xCuAlSe2&#160;composites, which is much higher than that of other Cu3SbSe4&#8208;based thermoelectrics doped by conventional methods. Consequently, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19&#160;&#956;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;is obtained in the temperature range of 300&#8211;723&#160;K among Cu&#8208;based diamond&#8208;like thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials are typically highly degenerate semiconductors, which require high carrier concentration. However, the efficiency of conventional doping by replacing host atoms with alien ones is restricted by solubility limit, and, more unfavorably, such a doping method is likely to cause strong charge&#8208;carrier scattering at ambient temperature, leading to deteriorated electrical performance. Here, an unconventional doping strategy is proposed, where a small trace of alien atoms is used to stabilize cation vacancies in Cu3SbSe4&#160;by compositing with CuAlSe2, in which the cation vacancies rather than the alien atoms provide a high density of holes. Consequently, the hole concentration enlarges by six&#160;times but the carrier mobility is well maintained. As a result, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;in the temperature range of 300&#8211;723&#160;K is attained. Finally, with further reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a peak zT value of 1.4&#160;and a record&#8208;high average zT value of 0.72&#160;are achieved within the diamond&#8208;like compounds. This new doping strategy not only can be applied for boosting the average power factor for thermoelectrics, but more generally can be used to maintain carrier mobility for a variety of semiconductors that need high carrier concentration.

         <title>Interpretation of Rubidium&#8208;Based Perovskite Recipes toward Electronic Passivation and Ion&#8208;Diffusion Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rb+&#8208;based perovskite recipes are widely adopted in a large amount of significant advancements regarding perovskite solar cells with several performance records. Combining seminal theoretical calculations with cutting&#8208;edge experimental characterizations, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in doping concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is thoroughly investigated.








Abstract
Rubidium cation (Rb+) addition is witnessed to play a pivotal role in boosting the comprehensive performance of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, the origin of such success derived from irreplaceable superiorities brought by Rb+ remains ambiguous. Herein, grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;including atomic models are adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb+ distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution, covering both the grain interiors and boundaries, is thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron&#8208;based grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior are expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb+ addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability is elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb+ concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high&#8208;efficiency cascade&#8208;incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.

Herein, grain-boundary-including atomic models are adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution, covering both the grain interiors and boundaries, is thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron-based grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge-carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior are expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability is elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high-efficiency cascade-incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diverging Expressions of Anharmonicity in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy is used to compare the anharmonic expressions in the structural dynamics of two halide perovskites. In Cs2AgBiBr6, clear normal modes are observed in all measured temperatures. Contrary to this, the Raman spectrum of CsPbBr3 exhibits a breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture above 200 K. Implications of these diverging behaviors on the electronic properties of the crystals is discussed.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;based halide perovskite crystals are shown to have strongly anharmonic structural dynamics. This behavior is important because it may be the origin of their exceptional photovoltaic properties. The double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6, has been recently studied as a lead&#8208;free alternative for optoelectronic applications. However, it does not exhibit the excellent photovoltaic activity of the lead&#8208;based halide perovskites. Therefore, to explore the correlation between the anharmonic structural dynamics and optoelectronic properties in lead&#8208;based halide perovskites, the structural dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6 are investigated and are compared to its lead&#8208;based analog, CsPbBr3. Using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman measurements, it is found that both materials are indeed strongly anharmonic. Nonetheless, the expression of their anharmonic behavior is markedly different. Cs2AgBiBr6 has well&#8208;defined normal modes throughout the measured temperature range, while CsPbBr3 exhibits a complete breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture above 200&#160;K. It is suggested that the breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture implies that the average crystal structure may not be a proper starting point to understand the electronic properties of the crystal. In addition to our&#160;main findings, an unreported phase of Cs2AgBiBr6 is also discovered below&#160;&#8776;37&#160;K.

         <title>Synergistic Energy Absorption Mechanisms of Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of architected materials based on liquid crystal elastomers is reported. The synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship and with a number of layers for multilayered structures. The study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.








Abstract
A unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#8208;based architected materials is reported. The architected materials consist of repeating unit cells of bistable tilted LCE beams sandwiched between stiff supports. The viscoelastic behavior of the LCE causes the energy absorption to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship, which can be modulated by changing the degree of mesogen alignment and the loading direction relative to the director. For a strain rate of 600 s&#8722;1, the unit cell exhibits up to a 5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 energy absorption density, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the same structure fabricated from poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer and is comparable to the dissipation from irreversible plastic deformation exhibited by denser metals. For a multilayered structure of unit cells, nonuniform buckling of the different layers produces additional viscoelastic dissipation. This synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with the number of layers. The sequence of cell collapse can be controlled by grading the beam thickness to further promote viscous dissipation and enhance the energy absorption density. It is envisioned that the study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.

         <title>Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Actuators and Waveguides that Operate at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant approach is described for conversion of elastic molecular crystals into flexible actuators that operate in low&#8208;temperature environments. These materials are tested in micromechanical actuation operations such as soft gripping of delicate objects, autonomous motion over flat surfaces, and measurement of temperature.








Abstract
Applications in extreme conditions, such as those encountered in space exploration, require lightweight materials that can retain their elasticity in extremely cold environments. However, cryogenic treatment of most soft polymeric and elastomeric materials results in complete loss of their ability for elastic flow, whereby such materials that are normally ductile become stiff, brittle, and prone to cracking. Here, a facile method for preparation of hybrid organic crystalline materials that are not only cryogenically robust but are also capable of large, recoverable, and reversible deformation at low temperatures is reported. To that end, flexible organic crystals are first mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating and combined with a thermally responsive polymer. The resulting hybrid materials respond linearly and reversibly to temperatures from &#8722;15 to &#8722;120 &#176;C without fatigue in air as well as in cold vacuum. The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that are inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost&#8208;effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low&#8208;temperature environmental settings.

         <title>Catalytic Kinetics Regulation for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrogen Oxidation by Ru&#8208;Nanoclusters&#8208;Coupled Mn3O4 Catalysts Decorated with Atomically Dispersed Ru Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms are designed as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with excellent FE and remarkable NO3&#8722; yields. The coexistence of Ru clusters and singe&#8208;atom Ru are considered to regulate catalytic kinetics among reaction&#8208;available N2, *OH accessibility, and transfer of electrons for optimized performance.








Abstract
Electrochemical N2 oxidation reaction (NOR), using water and N2 in the atmosphere, represents a sustainable approach for nitric production to replace the conventional industrial synthesis with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Meanwhile, owing to chemical inertness of N2 and sluggish kinetics for 10&#8208;electron transfer, emerging electrocatalysts remain largely underexplored. Herein, Ru&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms (Ru&#8211;Mn3O4) are designed and explored as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with an excellent Faraday efficiency (28.87%) and a remarkable NO3&#8208; yield (35.34&#160;&#181;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat.), respectively. Experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the outstanding activity is ascribed to the coexistence of Ru clusters and single&#8208;atom Ru. The synergistic effect between the Ru clusters and Mn3O4 can effectively activate the chemically inert N2, lowering the kinetic barrier for the vital breakage of N&#8801;N. The intensive *OH supply and enhanced conductivity are used to regulate the catalytic kinetics for optimized performance. This work provides brand&#8208;new ideas for the rational design of electrocatalysts in complicated electrocatalytic reactions with multiple dynamics&#8208;different steps.

         <title>Bioinspired Lipoproteins of Furoxans&#8211;Oxaliplatin Remodel Physical Barriers in Tumor to Potentiate T&#8208;Cell Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abnormal tumor vasculature and dense tumor stroma constitute a formidable physical barrier that strikingly limits the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Herein, a stromal&#8208;cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system loading a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is designed, which profoundly paves the way for CTL infiltration in tumors and synergizes immune&#8208;checkpoint&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;mediated anticancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anticancer immunotherapy. Herein, a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is synthesized and a stroma&#8208;cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S&#8208;LFO) is designed, aiming to facilitate CTL infiltration in tumors for anticancer immunotherapy. S&#8208;LFO treatment significantly promotes tumor vessel normalization and eliminates multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96&#8208;fold, 5.02&#8208;fold, and 8.65&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells, their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and granzyme B&#8208;expressing subtypes when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S&#8208;LFO with an antiprogrammed death ligand&#8208;1 produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extends survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTL infiltration for anticancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anticancer immunotherapy. Herein, a reduction-sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is synthesized and a stroma-cell-accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S-LFO) is designed, aiming to facilitate CTL infiltration in tumors for anticancer immunotherapy. S-LFO treatment significantly promotes tumor vessel normalization and eliminates multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96-fold, 5.02-fold, and 8.65-fold increase of CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, their interferon-&#947;- and granzyme B-expressing subtypes when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S-LFO with an antiprogrammed death ligand-1 produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extends survivals in three murine tumor models.

Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
In article number 2109330, Zhenyi Zhang and co&#8208;workers report plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalytic CO2 reduction over a well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure. The active &#8220;hot spot&#8221; can synergistically confine hot electrons, CO, and protons, thereby leading to high photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CH4 production.

Nanomedicine
In article number 2107506, Xinyi Jiang and co&#8208;workers introduce an inhaled nanoformulation that is developed with biogenic ribosomal protein for mRNA delivery. The variety of isoelectric points of ribosomal proteins endows them with flexible positive charge properties, by which negatively charged mRNA is efficiently condensed to form a nanocomplex in a biomimetic fashion.

Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries
Cathode materials are decisive for the development of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In article number 2110108, Xing&#8208;Long Wu and co&#8208;workers present a high&#8208;entropy Na3V2(PO4)2F3&#8208;based cathode for advanced SIBs. The high&#8208;entropy effect endows this cathode material with a lowered Na+ migration barrier and enhanced electronic conductivity, which jointly promote charge transport and sodium&#8208;storage ability in the phosphate cathode, thereby enhancing the average operating voltage and energy density of the SIB.

         <title>Graphitic Aza&#8208;Fused &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Networks: Construction, Engineering, and Task&#8208;Specific Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the construction and application of graphitic aza&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks is summarized. The correlation between compositional and structural engineering and optimization of the performance is highlighted for covalent triazine frameworks, covalent quinazoline networks, and hexaazatriphenylene networks in the fields of gas adsorption, membrane&#8208;based separation, thermo&#8208;/electro&#8208;/photocatalysis, and energy storage.








Abstract
2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks linked by aza&#8208;fused units represent a pivotal category of graphitic materials with stacked nanosheet architectures. Extensive efforts have been directed at their fabrication and application since the discovery of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs). Besides the triazine cores, tricycloquinazoline and hexaazatriphenylene linkages are further introduced to tailor the structures and properties. Diverse related materials have been developed rapidly, and a thorough outlook is necessitated to unveil the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships across multiple subcategories, which is pivotal to guide the design and fabrication toward enhanced task&#8208;specific performance. Herein, the structure types and development of related materials including CTFs, covalent quinazoline networks, and hexaazatriphenylene networks, are introduced. Advanced synthetic strategies coupled with characterization techniques provide powerful tools to engineer the properties and tune the associated behaviors in corresponding applications. Case studies in the areas of gas adsorption, membrane&#8208;based separation, thermo&#8208;/electro&#8208;/photocatalysis, and energy storage are then addressed, focusing on the correlation between structure/property engineering and optimization of the corresponding performance, particularly the preferred features and strategies in each specific field. In the last section, the underlying challenges and opportunities in construction and application of this emerging and promising material category are discussed.

         <title>Designing Next Generation of Persistent Luminescence: Recent Advances in Uniform Persistent Luminescence Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) possess long&#8208;lasting afterglow after the excitation ceases, demonstrating merits for various applications. The recent rapid progress of uniform PLNPs boosts their biomedical applications. This review highlights milestones of uniform PLNPs syntheses, analyzes key strategies for enhancing their optical properties, and envisions the challenges and potential future directions of uniform PLNPs for novel applications.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence is a unique optical process where long&#8208;lasting afterglow persists after the cessation of excitation. Nanoscale persistent luminescent materials are getting increased research interest from various fields due to their unique optical property. In recent years, inspiring achievements have been made to produce uniform persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) in a controllable manner, unleashing their fascinating potential, surpassing other types of luminescent materials in a wide variety of application such as high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detection. In this review, the evolution of uniform PLNPs, from their bulk phosphor counterparts, to the &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; preparation of nanoscale persistent luminescent materials, to the recent &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthesis of uniform PLNPs is first summarized. The respective milestones of uniform PLNPs prepared by templated synthesis, aqueous synthesis, and colloidal synthesis are highlighted. The key optical properties that can be enhanced in uniform PLNPs, including increasing the persistent luminescence intensity, tuning the excitation irradiance, as well as the emission wavelengths are then analyzed. Detailed strategies to enhance each optical property are also discussed in various sections. Finally, future challenges are highlighted with respect to the perspectives on the development of next&#8208;generation PLNPs with novel applications.

Finally, future challenges are highlighted with respect to the perspectives on the development of next-generation PLNPs with novel applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Growth of 2D Materials at the Wafer Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces various 2D van der Waals layered materials and summarizes their wafer&#8208;scale growth processes, including strategies for mono&#8208;orientated film growth. Applications of these materials in integrated devices and new epitaxial technologies are discussed, as well as the required future research directions in this very important field.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth has become a critical bottleneck for scaling up applications of van der Waal (vdW) layered 2D materials in high&#8208;end electronics and optoelectronics. Most vdW 2D materials are initially obtained through top&#8208;down synthesis methods, such as exfoliation, which can only prepare small flakes on a micrometer scale. Bottom&#8208;up growth can enable 2D flake growth over a large area. However, seamless merging of these flakes to form large&#8208;area continuous films with well&#8208;controlled layer thickness and lattice orientation is still a significant challenge. This review briefly introduces several vdW layered 2D materials covering their lattice structures, representative physical properties, and potential roles in large&#8208;scale applications. Then, several methods used to grow vdW layered 2D materials at the wafer scale are reviewed in depth. In particular, three strategies are summarized that enable 2D film growth with a single&#8208;crystalline structure over the whole wafer: growth of an isolated domain, growth of unidirectional domains, and conversion of oriented precursors. After that, the progress in using wafer&#8208;scale 2D materials in integrated devices and advanced epitaxy is reviewed. Finally, future directions in the growth and scaling of vdW layered 2D materials are discussed.

         <title>Advancing the Mechanical Performance of Glasses: Perspectives and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 14, April 7, 2022. </description>

The mechanical performance of glassy materials presents a major challenge in modern glass science and technology. With a focus on visually transparent, inorganic and hybrid glasses, a perspective on the most recent developments in the field is provided herein, emphasizing the importance of translating fundamental insight from glass physics into future applications.








Abstract
Glasses are materials that lack a crystalline microstructure and long&#8208;range atomic order. Instead, they feature heterogeneity and disorder on superstructural scales, which have profound consequences for their elastic response, material strength, fracture toughness, and the characteristics of dynamic fracture. These structure&#8211;property relations present a rich field of study in fundamental glass physics and are also becoming increasingly important in the design of modern materials with improved mechanical performance. A first step in this direction involves glass&#8208;like materials that retain optical transparency and the haptics of classical glass products, while overcoming the limitations of brittleness. Among these, novel types of oxide glasses, hybrid glasses, phase&#8208;separated glasses, and bioinspired glass&#8211;polymer composites hold significant promise. Such materials are designed from the bottom&#8208;up, building on structure&#8211;property relations, modeling of stresses and strains at relevant length scales, and machine learning predictions. Their fabrication requires a more scientifically driven approach to materials design and processing, building on the physics of structural disorder and its consequences for structural rearrangements, defect initiation, and dynamic fracture in response to mechanical load. In this article, a perspective is provided on this highly interdisciplinary field of research in terms of its most recent challenges and opportunities.

         <title>A Facile &#8220;Double&#8208;Catalysts&#8221; Approach to Directionally Fabricate Pyridinic N&#63743;B&#8208;Pair&#8208;Doped Crystal Graphene Nanoribbons/Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The dominantly pyridinic N&#63743;B pair is rationally fabricated on hierarchically structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons/amorphous carbon by a &#8220;double&#8208;catalysts&#8221; strategy. As experiments and density functional theory demonstrated, the pyridinic N&#63743;B plays a key role for the highly catalytic performance (half&#8208;wave potential, 0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, electron transfer number, &#8776;3.94), comparable to commercial Pt/C and superior to most of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. 








Abstract
Carbon material is a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Doping of heteroatoms, the most widely used modulating strategy, has attracted many efforts in the past decade. Despite all this, the catalytic activity of heteroatoms&#8208;modulated carbon is hard to compare to that of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, a &#8220;double&#8208;catalysts&#8221; (Fe salt, H3BO3) strategy is presented to directionally fabricate porous structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons (GNs)/amorphous carbon doped by pyridinic N&#63743;B pairs. The porous structure and GNs accelerate ion/mass and electron transport, respectively. The N percentage in pyridinic N&#63743;B pairs accounts for &#8776;80% of all N species. The pyridinic N&#63743;B pair drives the ORR via an almost 4e&#8722; transfer pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and onset potential (0.876 V vs RHE) in the alkaline solution. The ORR catalytic performance of the as&#8208;prepared carbon catalysts approximates commercial Pt/C and outperforms most prior carbon&#8208;based catalysts. The assembled Zn&#8211;air battery exhibits a high peak power density of 94 mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory simulation reveals that the pyridinic N&#63743;B pair possesses the highest catalytic activity among all the potential configurations, due to the highest charge density at C active sites neighboring B, which enhances the interaction strength with the intermediates in the p&#8208;band center.

         <title>Engineering Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking Covalent Organic Frameworks as Pyroptosis Inducers for Boosting Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is constructed by dispersing active sites into the COF backbone. In contrast to their corresponding bulk species, these enzyme&#8208;mimicking COFs can serve as H2O2 homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, thus exhibiting excellent chemodynamic therapy and pyroptosis efficacy, favorable for boosting cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The engineering of a series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs), COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Fe, and COF&#8208;909&#8208;Ni, as pyroptosis inducers, remodeling the tumor microenvironment to boost cancer immunotherapy, is reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that these COFs can serve as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, and they not only exhibit excellent superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;mimicking activity and convert superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) to H2O2 to facilitate H2O2 generation, but also possess outstanding glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;mimicking activity and deplete glutathione (GSH) to alleviate the scavenging of H2O2. Meanwhile, the outstanding photothermal therapy properties of these COFs can accelerate the Fenton&#8208;like ionization process to facilitate their chemodynamic therapy efficiency. One member, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, can robustly induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;dependent pyroptosis and remodel the tumor microenvironment to trigger durable antitumor immunity, thus promoting the response rate of &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint blockade and successfully restraining tumor metastasis and recurrence.

The 3D nanocomposite structure of the plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside LiMetal is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
The 3D nanocomposite structure of plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside amorphous Li matrix, is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. With ether&#8208;based DOLDME&#8208;LiTFSI electrolyte, LiF and Li2O nanocrystals are formed and embedded in a thin but tough amorphous polymer in the SEI exoskeleton. The fast Li&#8208;stripping directions are along [1&#175;10] or [121&#175;], which produces eight exposed {111} planes at halfway charging. Full Li stripping produces completely sagging, empty SEI husks that can sustain large bending and buckling, with the smallest bending radius of curvature observed approaching tens of nanometers without apparent damage. In the 2nd round of Li plating, a thin LiBCC sheet first nucleates at the current collector, extends to the top end of the deflated SEI husk, and then expands its thickness. The apparent zero wetting angle between LiBCC and the SEI interior means that the heterogeneous nucleation energy barrier is zero. Due to its complete&#8208;wetting property and chemo&#8208;mechanical stability, the SEI largely prevents further reactions between the Li metal and the electrolyte, which explains the superior performance of Li&#8208;metal batteries with ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, uneven refilling of the SEI husks results in dendrite protrusions and some new SEI formation during the 2nd plating. A strategy to form bigger SEI capsules during the initial cycle with higher energy density than the following cycles enables further enhanced Coulombic efficiency to above 99%.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Lipid Nanotherapeutic Boost for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase III clinical trials of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Here, dual&#8208;targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer. T&#8208;iLNTB boosts chemotherapeutic effect in cancer cells, increases an immunogenic cell death and reprograms tumor myeloid cells, consequently, recruits T cells and boosts responsiveness to immunotherapeutics. T&#8208;iLNTB can become a novel therapeutic modality in cancer.








Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO1) is shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1&#8208;targeted therapeutics can become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1&#8208;inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell&#8208; and cancer cell&#8208;dual targeted HO1&#8208;inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed using RNAi&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles. T&#8208;iLNTB&#8208;mediated HO1&#8208;inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T&#8208;iLNTB induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold&#8208;to&#8208;Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy. Finally, ex vivo study proves that HO1&#8208;inhibition directly affects tumor macrophage differentiation. This study demonstrates the potential of T&#8208;iLNTB as a novel therapeutic modality for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Field Simulations of Tunable Polar Topologies in Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric/Paraelectric Multilayers with Ultrahigh Energy&#8208;Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free ferroelectric/paraelectric trilayers with tunable polar topologies are designed. Relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208;, and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors are achievable by tailoring the topology with diverse dynamics. Ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage density above 170 J cm&#8211;1 and efficiency of 95% are exhibited in polar vortices. This strategy exemplifies a new paradigm to enhance energy storage via topology engineering.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are emerging energy&#8208;storage components that require both high energy&#8208;storage density and high efficiency. The conventional approach to energy&#8208;storage enhancement is polar nanodomain engineering via chemical modification. Here, a new approach of domain engineering is proposed by exploiting the tunable polar topologies that have been observed recently in ferroelectric/paraelectric multilayer films. Using phase&#8208;field simulations, it is demonstrated that vortex, spiral, and in&#8208;plane polar structures can be stabilized in BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (BFO/STO) multilayers by tailoring the strain state and layer thickness. Various switching dynamics are realized in these polar topologies, resulting in relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208;, and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors, respectively. Ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage densities above 170 J cm&#8722;3 and efficiencies above 95% are achievable in STO/BFO/STO trilayers. This strategy should be generally implementable in other multilayer dielectrics and offers a new avenue to enhancing energy storage by tuning the polar topology and thus the polarization characteristics.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Deposited and Patternable Conductive Polymer Thin&#8208;Film Electrodes for Microbial Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive polymer&#8208;based thin&#8208;film coating that significantly enhances biotic current densities in microbial bioelectronic devices is reported. The coating is comprehensively characterized, and low&#8208;cost processing and patterning of the coating and the deposition of different microbial strains on a single substrate are demonstrated. This coating can help advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.








Abstract
Microbial bioelectronic devices integrate naturally occurring or synthetically engineered electroactive microbes with microelectronics. These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic&#8211;abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics is reported. The coating is based on a blend of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) crosslinked with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current&#8208;producing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, this material produces a 178&#8208;fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin&#8208;film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. The chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings are characterized and the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor based microbial sensors are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Crystalline Layers for Printable Direct Conversion X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>

Thick crystalline quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers can be fabricated by a &#8220;hot&#8208;casting&#8221; method yielding an exceptional uniformity. As a result, high performance photodiodes using the quasi&#8208;2D layers are developed on both rigid and flexible substrates that respond sensitively to X&#8208;ray photons. This study paves the path toward printable direct conversion X&#8208;ray imager development.








Abstract
Polycrystalline perovskite film&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector is an appealing technology for assembling large scale imager by printing methods. However, thick crystalline layer without trap and solvent residual is challenging to fabricate. Here, the authors report a solution method to produce high quality quasi&#8208;2D perovskite crystalline layers and detectors that are suitable for X&#8208;ray imaging. By introducing n&#8208;butylamine iodide into methylammonium lead iodide precursor and coating at elevated temperatures, compact and crystalline layers with exceptional uniformity are obtained on both rigid and flexible substrates. Photodiodes built with the quasi&#8208;2D layers exhibit a low dark current and stable operation under constant electrical field over 96 h in dark, and over 15 h under X&#8208;ray irradiation. The detector responds sensitively under X&#8208;ray, delivering a high sensitivity of 1214&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a sensitivity gain is observed when operated under higher fields. Finally, high resolution images are demonstrated using a single pixel device that can resolve 80&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m features. This work paves the path for printable direct conversion X&#8208;ray imager development.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Storing DNA&#8208;Based Nanocomplex for Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanocomplex incorporating persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles is prepared, which realizes tumor&#8208;site glutathione&#8208;activating photodynamic therapy (PDT) of breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. Laser&#8208;free PDT is specifically initiated in the glutathione&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells and completes in a way of self&#8208;supplying O2 and self&#8208;irradiating.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic strategy that is dependent on external light irradiation that faces a major challenge in cancer treatment due to the poor tissue&#8208;penetration depths of light irradiation. Herein, a DNA nanocomplex that integrates persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) is developed, which realizes tumor&#8208;site glutathione&#8208;activated PDT for breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. The scaffold of the nanocomplex is AS1411&#8208;aptamer&#8208;encoded ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA chain with two functions: i) providing sufficient intercalation sites for the photosensitizer, and ii) recognizing nucleolin that specifically overexpresses on the surface of cancer cells. The PLNPs in the nanocomplex are energy&#8208;charged to act as a self&#8208;illuminant and coated with a shell of MnO2 for blocking energy degradation. In response to the overexpressed glutathione in cancer cells, the MnO2 shell decomposes to provide Mn2+ to catalytically produce O2, which is essential to PDT. Meanwhile, PLNPs are released and act as a self&#8208;illuminant to activate the photosensitizer to convert O2 into cytotoxic 1O2. Significant tumor inhibition effects are demonstrated in breast tumor xenograft models without exogenous laser excitation. It is envisioned that a laser&#8208;excitation&#8208;free PDT strategy enabled by the PLNP&#8211;DNA nanocomplex promotes the development of PDT and provides a new local therapeutic approach.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ternary Perovskite&#8211;Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells based on 2D:3D perovskites incorporated with n&#8208;type low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap conjugated organic molecules exhibit power conversion efficiency over 23%, and dramatically enhanced stability and diminished photocurrent hysteresis are demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells in which 2D perovskites are incorporated within a 3D perovskite network exhibit improved stability with respect to purely 3D systems, but lower record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Here, a breakthrough is reported in achieving enhanced PCEs, increased stability, and suppressed photocurrent hysteresis by incorporating n&#8208;type, low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap conjugated organic molecules into 2D:3D mixed perovskite composites. The resulting ternary perovskite&#8211;organic composites display extended absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region, improved film morphology, enlarged crystallinity, balanced charge transport, efficient photoinduced charge transfer, and suppressed counter&#8208;ion movement. As a result, the ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells exhibit PCEs over 23%, which are among the best PCEs for perovskite solar cells with p&#8211;i&#8211;n device structure. Moreover, the ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells possess dramatically enhanced stability and diminished photocurrent hysteresis. All these results demonstrate that the strategy of exploiting ternary perovskite&#8211;organic composite thin films provides a facile way to realize high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A Tissue Adhesion&#8208;Controllable and Biocompatible Small&#8208;Scale Hydrogel Adhesive Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible small&#8208;scale adhesive robot is developed by using hydrogels of different Young's moduli with octopus&#8208;inspired micropatterns. The robot can continuously and efficiently conduct biomedical functions in underwater environment due to controllable wet tissue adhesion.








Abstract
Recently, the realization of minimally invasive medical interventions on targeted tissues using wireless small&#8208;scale medical robots has received an increasing attention. For effective implementation, such robots should have a strong adhesion capability to biological tissues and at the same time easy controlled detachment should be possible, which has been challenging. To address such issue, a small&#8208;scale soft robot with octopus&#8208;inspired hydrogel adhesive (OHA) is proposed. Hydrogels of different Young's moduli are adapted to achieve a biocompatible adhesive with strong wet adhesion by preventing the collapse of the octopus&#8208;inspired patterns during preloading. Introduction of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel for dome&#8208;like protuberance structure inside the sucker wall of polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogel provides a strong tissue attachment in underwater and at the same time enables easy detachment by temperature changes due to its temperature&#8208;dependent volume change property. It is finally demonstrated that the small&#8208;scale soft OHA robot can efficiently implement biomedical functions owing to strong adhesion and controllable detachment on biological tissues while operating inside the body. Such robots with repeatable tissue attachment and detachment possibility pave the way for future wireless soft miniature robots with minimally invasive medical interventions.

         <title>In Situ Carbon Corrosion and Cu Leaching as a Strategy for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Multimetal Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in multimetal electrocatalysts can effectively boost catalytic activity with a low overpotential. More importantly, by placing a single particle on a nanoelectrode, structural changes during electrocatalysis can be directly evaluated, providing in&#8208;depth understanding for the catalyst's excellent OER performance.








Abstract
The number of active sites and their intrinsic activity are key factors in designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesis, properties, and in&#8208;depth characterization of a homogeneous CoNiFeCu catalyst are reported, demonstrating that multimetal synergistic effects improve the OER kinetics and the intrinsic activity. In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the OER lead to an enhanced electrochemically active surface area, providing favorable conditions for improved electronic interaction between the constituent metals. After activation, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity with a low overpotential of 291.5&#160;&#177; 0.5&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 43.9 mV dec&#8722;1. It shows superior stability compared to RuO2 in 1 m KOH, which is even preserved for 120 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 in 7 m KOH at 50&#160;&#176;C. Single particles of this CoNiFeCu after their placement on nanoelectrodes combined with identical location transmission electron microscopy before and after applying cyclic voltammetry are investigated. The improved catalytic performance is due to surface carbon corrosion and Cu leaching.

     alt="In Situ Carbon Corrosion and Cu Leaching as a Strategy for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Multimetal Electrocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in multimetal electrocatalysts can effectively boost catalytic activity with a low overpotential. More importantly, by placing a single particle on a nanoelectrode, structural changes during electrocatalysis can be directly evaluated, providing in-depth understanding for the catalyst's excellent OER performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of active sites and their intrinsic activity are key factors in designing high-performance catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesis, properties, and in-depth characterization of a homogeneous CoNiFeCu catalyst are reported, demonstrating that multimetal synergistic effects improve the OER kinetics and the intrinsic activity. In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the OER lead to an enhanced electrochemically active surface area, providing favorable conditions for improved electronic interaction between the constituent metals. After activation, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity with a low overpotential of 291.5&#160;&#177; 0.5&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a Tafel slope of 43.9 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It shows superior stability compared to RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH, which is even preserved for 120 h at 500 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 7 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH at 50&#160;&#176;C. Single particles of this CoNiFeCu after their placement on nanoelectrodes combined with identical location transmission electron microscopy before and after applying cyclic voltammetry are investigated. The improved catalytic performance is due to surface carbon corrosion and Cu leaching. The proposed catalyst design strategy combined with the unique single-nanoparticle technique contributes to the development and characterization of high-performance catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bistability, Remanence, Read/Write&#8208;Memory, and Logic Gate Function via a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hysteresis of a thermally responsive polymer is shown to lead to bistability and remanence. This is used to write information on thin&#8208;layer displays using lasers or simple pens. The states can additionally be switched by pH, enabling an AND logic gate function. An unusual memory state allows encoded information to be hidden.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials change their state in response to external triggers. Switching between different states enables information to be written, stored, and read, if the transition between the states exhibits hysteresis. Thermally responsive polymers exhibit an intrinsic hysteresis for the volume phase transition between the swollen and de&#8208;swollen solution state. Here, it is shown that this hysteresis can be used to realize bistability, remanence, and reversible write/read information storage. This is demonstrated for the simplest and most widely used thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), as well as for PNIPAM block copolymers, which widens the hysteresis window. The hysteresis is shown to be related to cluster domain assembly/disassembly during the phase transition. Information can be written thermally using a laser, or using heated or cooled pen tips on a thin&#8208;film backscattering display. The bistable state can additionally be switched by pH, enabling an AND logic gate function. Furthermore, an unusual memory state is discovered, where information is visible in the hysteresis window and invisible at higher temperatures, allowing encoded information to be hidden. Since hysteresis is a very common intrinsic phenomenon for responsive materials, this principle to encode and store information is potentially applicable to a broad range of responsive materials.

         <title>Transforming the Chemical Structure and Bio&#8208;Nano Activity of Doxorubicin by Ultrasound for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasonic transformation of doxorubicin into a tumor selective nanodrug is presented. The nanodrug maintains the antiproliferative activity against several cancer cell lines without being toxic to healthy cells as verified in 2D/3D coculture. The nanodrug associates with lipid rafts on mitochondria membranes to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. In vivo study reveals accumulation of the nanodrug in the lung.








Abstract
Reconfiguring the structure and selectivity of existing chemotherapeutics represents an opportunity for developing novel tumor&#8208;selective drugs. Here, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the use of high&#8208;frequency sound waves is demonstrated to transform the nonselective anthracycline doxorubicin into a tumor selective drug molecule. The transformed drug self&#8208;aggregates in water to form &#8776;200&#160;nm nanodrugs without requiring organic solvents, chemical agents, or surfactants. The nanodrugs preferentially interact with lipid rafts in the mitochondria of cancer cells. The mitochondrial localization of the nanodrugs plays a key role in inducing reactive oxygen species mediated selective death of breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and drug&#8208;resistant cell lines. Only marginal cytotoxicity (80&#8211;100% cell viability) toward fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes is observed, even after administration of high doses of the nanodrug (25&#8211;40&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1). Penetration, cytotoxicity, and selectivity of the nanodrugs in tumor&#8208;mimicking tissues are validated by using a 3D coculture of cancer and healthy cells and 3D cell&#8208;collagen constructs in a perfusion bioreactor. The nanodrugs exhibit tropism for lung and limited accumulation in the liver and spleen, as suggested by in vivo biodistribution studies. The results highlight the potential of this approach to transform the structure and bioactivity of anticancer drugs and antibiotics bearing sono&#8208;active moieties.

         <title>High&#8208;Z&#8208;Sensitized Radiotherapy Synergizes with the Intervention of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway for In Situ Tumor Vaccination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radiosensitizer (physcion&#8208;encapsulated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified layered gadolinium hydroxide (Phy@PLGdH) nanosheets) is developed to amplify radiation&#8208;therapy (RT)&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage for potent immunogenic tumor cell death. The results show that Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT yields great in situ tumor vaccination and obviously primes CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity.








Abstract
In situ tumor vaccination is preliminarily pursued to strengthen antitumor immune response. Immunogenic tumor cell death spontaneously releases abundant antigens and adjuvants for activation of dendritic cells, providing a paragon opportunity for establishing efficient in situ vaccination. Herein, Phy@PLGdH nanosheets are constructed by integrating physcion (Phy, an inhibitor of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) with layered gadolinium hydroxide (PLGdH) nanosheets to boost radiation&#8208;therapy (RT)&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for potent in situ tumor vaccination. It is first observed that sheet&#8208;like PLGdH can present superior X&#8208;ray deposition and tumor penetrability, exhibiting improved radiosensitization in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the destruction of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and nucleotide homeostasis by Phy&#8208;mediated PPP intervention can further amplify PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage, which correspondingly results in effective ICD and enhance the immunogenicity of irradiated tumor cells. Consequently, Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT successfully primes robust CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity to potentiate checkpoint blockade immunotherapies against primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Epitaxial Ferroelectric Oxide Nanospring with Super&#8208;Scalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxial oxide nanosprings are fabricated by etching sacrificial layer. La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 nanosprings can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometry limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain switching associated with highly coupled strain and polarization provides the tolerance for shape deformation and the energy for recovery.








Abstract
Oxide nanosprings have attracted many research interests because of their anticorrosion, high&#8208;temperature tolerance, oxidation resistance, and enhanced&#8208;mechanic&#8208;response from unique helix structures, enabling various applications like nanomanipulators, nanomotors, nanoswitches, sensors, and energy harvesters. However, preparing oxide nanosprings is a challenge for their intrinsic lack of elasticity. Here, an approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled, epitaxial, ferroelectric nanosprings with built&#8208;in strain due to the lattice mismatch in freestanding La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 (LSMO/BTO) bilayer heterostructures is developed. It is found that these LSMO/BTO nanosprings can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometrical limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under co&#8208;existing axial and shear strains. In addition, the oxide heterostructural springs exhibit strong resilience due to the limited plastic deformation nature and the built&#8208;in strain between the bilayers. This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nanosprings that can be applied to various technologies.

This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nanosprings that can be applied to various technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Growth of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films via an Orientation Filter Funnel for High&#8208;Performance Transistors with Excellent Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new orientation filter funnel method is developed for scalable growth of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) with singly orientated crystals. This approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic axis and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of OSCFs. The obtained OSCFs show 4.5&#8208;fold enhanced mobility and excellent uniformity with mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%.








Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. However, crystallization of organic films is normally governed by stochastic nucleation and incoherent growth, posing a formidable challenge to grow large&#8208;sized OSCFs. Here, an &#8220;orientation filter funnel&#8221; concept is presented for the scalable growth of OSCFs with well&#8208;aligned, singly orientated crystals. By rationally designing solvent wetting/dewetting patterns on the substrate, this approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic orientation and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of large&#8208;area OSCFs. As a result, this unique concept for crystal growth not only enhances the average mobility of organic film by 4.5&#8208;fold but also improves its uniformity of electrical properties, with a low mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%, the new lowest record among organic devices. The method offers a general and scalable route to produce OSCFs toward real&#8208;word electronic applications.

         <title>Achieving Remarkable Charge Density via Self&#8208;Polarization of Polar High&#8208;k Material in a Charge&#8208;Excitation Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization effect is found under charge excitation, which significantly improves the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). This work provides a new strategy to enhance the dielectric properties of polar dielectric materials, and the realization of high charge density provides a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;output TENGs toward various applications.








Abstract
Boosting output charge density is top priority for achieving high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The charge&#8208;excitation strategy is demonstrated to be a superior approach to acquire high output charge density. Meanwhile, the molecular charge behaviors in the dielectric under a strong electric field from high charge density bring new physics that are worth exploring. Here, a rapid self&#8208;polarization effect of a polar dielectric material by the superhigh electric field in a charge&#8208;excitation TENG is reported, by which the permittivity of the polar dielectric material realizes self&#8208;increase to a saturation, and thus enhances the output charge density. Consequently, an ultrahigh charge density of 3.53 mC m&#8722;2 is obtained with 7&#160;&#181;m homemade lead zirconate titanate&#8722;poly(vinylidene fluoride) composite film in the atmosphere with 5% relative humidity, which is the highest charge density for TENGs with high durability currently. This work provides new guidance for dielectric material optimization under charge excitation to boost the output performance of TENGs toward practical applications.

         <title>Alternate Storage of Opposite Charges in Multisites for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Al&#8211;MOF Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges in multisite is demonstrated in a 2D Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) cathode to achieve a high energy density for Al&#8211;MOF batteries. The MOF can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which doubles the capacity compared with the storage of the same charge in one active site.








Abstract
The limited active sites of cathode materials in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries restrict the storage of more large&#8208;sized Al&#8208;complex ions, leading to a low celling of theoretical capacity. To make the utmost of active sites, an alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges (AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations) in multisites is proposed herein to achieve an ultrahigh capacity in Al&#8211;metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) battery. The bipolar ligands (oxidized from 18&#960; to 16&#960; electrons and reduced from 18&#960; to 20&#960; electrons in a planar cyclic conjugated system) can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which can double the capacity of unipolar ligands. Moreover, the high&#8208;density active Cu sites (Cu nodes) in the 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF can also store AlCl2+ cations for a higher capacity. The rigid and extended MOF structure can address the problems of high solubility and poor stability of small organic molecules. As a result, three&#8208;step redox reactions with two&#8208;electron transfer in each step are demonstrated in charge/discharge processes, achieving high reversible capacity (184 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (177&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) of the optimized cathode in an Al&#8211;MOF battery. The findings provide a new insight for the rational design of stable high&#8208;energy Al&#8211;MOF batteries.

         <title>Enabling Fast Na+ Transfer Kinetics in the Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Region of Hard&#8208;Carbon Anodes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast sodium storage in the whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;region is realized by rational manipulation of the microstructure of hard carbons (HCs) using a ZnO&#8208;assisted bulk etching strategy. It is revealed that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p&#8208;band center, respectively, which can be balanced by manipulating the physical parameters of HCs.








Abstract
Efficient electrode materials, that combine high power and high energy, are the crucial requisites of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), which have unwrapped new possibilities in the areas of grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Hard carbons (HCs) are considered as the leading candidate anode materials for SIBs, however, the primary challenge of slow charge&#8208;transfer kinetics at the low potential region (&lt;0.1&#160;V) remains unresolved till date, and the underlying structure&#8211;performance correlation is under debate. Herein, ultrafast sodium storage in the whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;region (0.01&#8211;2&#160;V), with the Na+ diffusion coefficient enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude (&#8776;10&#8211;7 cm2 s&#8211;1) through rationally deploying the physical parameters of HCs using a ZnO&#8208;assisted bulk etching strategy is reported. It is unveiled that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p&#8208;band center, respectively, and balance of Ea and Eb is critical in enhancing the charge&#8208;storage kinetics. The charge&#8208;storage mechanism in HCs is evidenced through comprehensive in(ex) situ techniques. The as prepared HCs microspheres deliver a record high rate performance of 107 mAh g&#8211;1 @ 50 A g&#8211;1 and unprecedented electrochemical performance at extremely low temperature (426 mAh g&#8211;1 @ &#8722;40 &#176;C).

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Photosensitizable Bacterial Cellulose as Engineered Living Material for Skin Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>

Photosensitizable bacterial cellulose is obtained via direct microbial metabolism biosynthesis for wound repair in vivo with effective antibacterial functions.








Abstract
Living materials based on bacterial cellulose (BC) represent a natural and promising candidate for wound dressing. Both physical adsorption and chemical methods have been applied to BC for realizing antibacterial function. However, effective and long&#8208;lasting incorporation of bactericidal moieties to BC remains challenging. Herein, a Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans&#8208;based direct synthetic method to fabricate photosensitizer&#8208;grafted BC through&#160;in situ&#160;bacterial metabolism in the presence of TPEPy&#8208;modified glucose is explored. The results verify that the direct biosynthesis method is efficient and convenient to endow BC with outstanding fluorescence and light&#8208;triggered photodynamic bactericidal activity for skin wound repair. This work presents a new approach to fabricate eco&#8208;friendly and active wound dressing with light&#8208;controlled bactericidal activity by microbial metabolism. The successful modification of the glucose carbon source of microorganisms also offers insights for biosyntheses of other living materials through microbial metabolism.

A single&#8208;atom W&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet&#8202;@&#8202;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) is synthesized, as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The introduction of single&#8208;atom W causes the delocalization of the Ni spin states, which increases the Ni d&#8208;electronic states and optimizes the H* adsorption kinetics, significantly reducing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (O* to OOH*). 








Abstract
Developing robust and highly active non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) is crucial for the industrialization of hydrogen energy. In this study, a highly active and durable single&#8208;atom W&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet&#8202;@&#8202;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) electrocatalyst is prepared. W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the HER and OER with ultralow overpotentials (39 and 106&#160;mV for the HER and 171 and 239&#160;mV for the OER at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively) and excellent long&#8208;term durability (500 h), outperforming commercial precious&#8208;metal catalysts and many other previously reported transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based compounds (TMCs). The introduction of single&#8208;atom W delocalizes the spin state of Ni, which results in an increase in the Ni d&#8208;electron density. This causes the optimization of the adsorption/desorption process of H and a significant reduction in the adsorption free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (O* &#8594; OOH*), thus accelerating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HER and OER. This work provides a rational feasible strategy to design single&#8208;atom catalysts for water splitting and to develop advanced TMC electrocatalysts by regulating delocalized spin states.

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Structure in Aqueous Electrolyte via Dynamic Water Intercalation/Deintercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To stabilize the layered structure in aqueous electrolyte, Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t is developed to mitigate H+ attack and the adverse phase transition. Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t provides open channels from (001) planes, enabling dynamic water intercalation/deintercalation in the layered structure. With reversible water intercalation/deintercalation, the layered structure is effectively stabilized in aqueous electrolyte, resulting in outstanding cycle performance in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs) with nonflammable feature attract great attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the layered cathode materials (such as LiCoO2) present serious capacity decay in ALIBs. The degradation mechanism of layered cathode materials in ALIBs is still not clear and an effective strategy to improve cycling stability remains a great challenge. In this work, the authors use LiCoO2 as a typical example to investigate its structural degradation in aqueous electrolytes. It is found that H+ insertion accelerated irreversible layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition is the main reason causing structural degradation and fast capacity fading in LiCoO2. Subsequently, Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t with intermediate spin Co3+ is developed to mitigate H+ influence and the adverse phase transition in aqueous electrolyte. It is interesting to discover that reversible water intercalation/deintercalation occurs in the layered structure during charge/discharge, which effectively suppresses the layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition with cycling. Benefiting from the stabilized layered structure, the Li&#8208;excess Li1.08Co0.92O1.92 shows a significantly improved cycling performance in the neutral aqueous electrolyte with a large specific capacity and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising structural regulation strategy for the layered cathode materials, enabling their potential application in ALIBs.

         <title>Synergetic Anion Vacancies and Dense Heterointerfaces into Bimetal Chalcogenide Nanosheet Arrays for Boosting Electrocatalysis Sulfur Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoZn&#8208;S nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces show an outstanding sulfur conversion activity for lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries. DFT calculations reveal that the sulfur vacancies and built&#8208;in interfacial field can promote the formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity. The catalytic sulfur cathode exhibits good electrochemical performance especially under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation.








Abstract
Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenides. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenides in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during the discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn&#8208;S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur&#8208;vacancy and build&#8208;in interfacial field in CoZn&#8208;S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well&#8208;designed 3D nanosheet array structures shorten the ion&#8208;transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn&#8208;S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the built&#8208;in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity.

A self&#8208;assembled CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/shell nanoplatelets&#8208;whispering gallery mode (WGM) microlaser with ultralow&#8208;threshold, tunable&#8208;wavelength, and excellent photostability is proposed. Both multi&#8208; and single&#8208;mode high quality factor WGM lasing are achieved with ultralow thresholds. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.








Abstract
The realization of efficient on&#8208;chip microlasers with scalable fabrication, ultralow threshold, and stable single&#8208;frequency operation is always desired for a wide range of miniaturized photonic systems. Herein, an effective way to fabricate nanostructures&#8208; whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) lasers by drop&#8208;casting CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/buffer&#8208;shell@graded&#8208;shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) dispersion onto silica microspheres is presented. Benefiting from the excellent gain properties from the interface engineered core/hybrid shell NPLs and high&#8208;quality factor WGM resonator from excellent optical field confinement, the proposed room&#8208;temperature NPLs&#8208;WGM microlasers show a record&#8208;low lasing threshold of 3.26 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 under nanosecond laser pumping among all colloidal NPLs&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. The presence of sharp discrete transverse electric&#8208; and magnetic&#8208;mode spikes, the inversely proportional dependence of the free spectra range on microsphere sizes and the polarization anisotropy of laser output represent the first direct experimental evidence for NPLs&#8208;WGM lasing nature, which is verified theoretically by the computed electric&#8208;field distribution inside the microcavity. Remarkably, a stable single&#8208;mode lasing output with an ultralow lasing threshold of 3.84 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 is achieved by the Vernier effect through evanescent field coupling. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogel Self&#8208;Assembled by Monomeric Nucleoside for Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously achieving high strength and injectability in one hydrogel is challenging. A high strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;FA)). Notably, it exhibits excellent biocompatibility, fast biodegradation, antibacterial property, and osteoclast inhibition, making it a potential candidate biomaterial for tooth&#8208;extraction wound healing and tissue engineering.








Abstract
Hydrogels with high mechanical strength and injectability have attracted extensive attention in biomedical and tissue engineering. However, endowing a hydrogel with both properties is challenging because they are generally inversely related. In this work, by constructing a multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system, a high&#8208;strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is successfully fabricated. It is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;FA)) with distilled water/phosphate buffered saline as solvent. Its storage modulus reaches 1 MPa at a concentration of 5.0 wt%, which is the strongest supramolecular hydrogel comprising an ultralow&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW &lt; 300) gelator. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent shear&#8208;thinning injectability, and completes the sol&#8211;gel transition in seconds after injection at 37 &#176;C. The multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system is essentially based on the synergistic interactions between the double NH2 groups, water molecules, and 2&#8242;&#8208;F atoms. Furthermore, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel exhibits excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity. When applied to rat molar extraction sockets, compared to natural healing and the commercial hemorrhage agent gelatin sponge, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel exhibits faster degradation and induces less osteoclastic activity and inflammatory infiltration, resulting in more complete bone healing. In summary, this study provides ideas for proposing a multifunctional, high&#8208;strength, and injectable supramolecular hydrogel for various biomedical engineering applications.

         <title>Electrically Programmable Interfacial Adhesion for Ultrastrong Hydrogel Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroadhesion strategy capable of realizing ultrastrong and universal hydrogel bonding in an electrically programmable way is reported. With the synergistic effect of electric fields and entropy on hydrated ion diffusion, its peak adhesive strength can reach 1.2&#160;MPa. Further, a mechanoelectric coupling model is established to determine directional diffusion of the ions and resultant smart electroadhesion.








Abstract
Adjustable interfacial adhesion is of great significance in smart&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;related engineering fields. This study presents an electroadhesion strategy for universal and ultrastrong hydrogel bonding with electrically programmable strength. An ionic hydrogel containing lithium ions is designed to achieve hydrated&#8208;ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, where external electric fields are employed to precisely control spatiotemporal dynamics of the ion diffusion across ionic adhesion region (IAR). The hydrogel can realize a universal, ultrastrong, efficient, tough, reversible, and environmentally tolerant electroadhesion to diverse hydrogels, whose peak adhesion strength and interfacial adhesion toughness are as high as 1.2&#160;MPa and 3750 J m&#8722;2, respectively. With a mechanoelectric coupling model, the dominant role of the hydrated ions in IAR played in the interfacial electroadhesion is further quantitatively revealed. The proposed strategy opens a door for developing high&#8208;performance adhesion hydrogels with electrically programmable functions, which are indispensable for various emerging fields like flexible electronics and soft robotics.

         <title>A Fully Flexible Intelligent Thermal Touch Panel Based on Intrinsically Plastic Ag2S Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully flexible intelligent thermal touch panel based on the intrinsically plastic Ag2S semiconductor can well perceive finger touch signals in real&#8208;time and displays intelligent feed back of Chinese characters and letters on an app.








Abstract
Wearable touch panels, a typical flexible electronic device, can recognize and feed back the information of finger touch and movement. Excellent wearable touch panels are required to accurately and quickly monitor the signals of finger movement as well as the capacity of bearing various types of deformation. High&#8208;performance thermistor materials are one of the key functional components, but to date, a long&#8208;standing bottleneck is that inorganic semiconductors are typically brittle while the electrical properties of organic semiconductors are quite low. Herein, a high&#8208;performance flexible temperature sensor is reported by using plastic Ag2S with ultrahigh temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8722;4.7% K&#8722;1 and resolution of 0.05 K, and rapid response/recovery time of 0.11/0.11 s. Moreover, the temperature sensor shows excellent durability without performance damage or loss during force stimuli tests. In addition, a fully flexible intelligent touch panel composed of a 16 &#215; 10 Ag2S&#8208;film&#8208;based temperature sensor array, as well as a flexible printed circuit board and a deep&#8208;learning algorithm is designed for perceiving finger touch signals in real&#8208;time, and intelligent feedback of Chinese characters and letters on an app. These results strongly show that high&#8208;performance flexible inorganic semiconductors can be widely used in flexible electronics.

         <title>Heterometallic Benzenehexathiolato Coordination Nanosheets: Periodic Structure Improves Crystallinity and Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of copper and nickel ions in 2D coordination nanosheets based on benzenehexathiolato&#8208;metal complex motifs induces a periodic in&#8208;plane metal arrangement and a bilayer structure. This heterometallicity affords improved film crystallinity and thus higher electrical conductivities in comparison with the pristine ones, reaching up to 1300 S cm&#8722;1. This strategy expands the variation and function of coordination nanomaterials.








Abstract
Coordination nanosheets are an emerging class of 2D, bottom&#8208;up materials having fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, planar, graphite&#8208;like structures with high electrical conductivities. Since their discovery, great effort has been devoted to expand the variety of coordination nanosheets; however, in most cases, their low crystallinity in thick films hampers practical device applications. In this study, mixtures of nickel and copper ions are employed to fabricate benzenehexathiolato (BHT)&#8208;based coordination nanosheet films, and serendipitously, it is found that this heterometallicity preferentially forms a structural phase with improved film crystallinity. Spectroscopic and scattering measurements provide evidence for a bilayer structure with in&#8208;plane periodic arrangement of copper and nickel ions with the NiCu2BHT formula. Compared with homometallic films, heterometallic films exhibit more crystalline microstructures with larger and more oriented grains, achieving higher electrical conductivities reaching metallic behaviors. Low dependency of Seebeck coefficient on the mixing ratio of nickel and copper ions supports that the large variation in the conductivity data is not caused by change in the intrinsic properties of the films. The findings open new pathways to improve crystallinity and to tune functional properties of 2D coordination nanosheets.

         <title>Artificial Heterogeneous Interphase Layer with Boosted Ion Affinity and Diffusion for Na/K&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;life Na&#8208;metal and K&#8208;metal batteries are realized by development of a heterogeneous protective layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and Na2S (K2S) on the surface of Na (K) foil. Such layer possesses the advantages of excellent sodiophilicity/potassiophilicity, high Young's modulus, and high ionic conductivity, inhibiting the dendrite growth during the repeated Na (K) plating/stripping.








Abstract
Metallic Na (K) are considered a promising anode materials for Na&#8208;metal and K&#8208;metal batteries because of their high theoretical capacity, low electrode potential, and abundant resources. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) is introduced on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K). Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that a heterogeneous Na2S/V (K2S/V) protective layer can effectively improve Na (K)&#8208;ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics, inhibiting the growth of Na (K) dendrites during Na (K) plating/stripping. Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na2S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, and the K2S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na3V2(PO4)3||Na2S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 and a high power density of 23.5&#160;kW kg&#8211;1. The achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation of Hydrogel Actuators by Autocatalytic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators made of polyacrylamide bilayer hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks are controlled by an autocatalytic front of thiols. This regulation enables an autonomous sequential actuation, gradual unrolling, and screwing. In addition, these actuators can activate each other in a relay fashion or switch an electrical circuit.








Abstract
Regulating hydrogel actuators with chemical reaction networks is instrumental for constructing life&#8208;inspired smart materials. Herein, hydrogel actuators are engineered that are regulated by the autocatalytic front of thiols. The actuators consist of two layers. The first layer, which is regular polyacrylamide hydrogel, is in a strained conformation. The second layer, which is polyacrylamide hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks, maintains strain in the first layer. When thiols released by the autocatalytic front reduce disulfide crosslinks, the hydrogel actuates by releasing the mechanical strain in the first layer. The autocatalytic front is sustained by the reaction network, which uses thiouronium salts, disulfides of &#946;&#8208;aminothiols, and maleimide as starting components. The gradual actuation by the autocatalytic front enables movements such as gradual unrolling, screwing, and sequential closing of &#8220;fingers.&#8221; This actuation also allows the transmission of chemical signals in a relay fashion and the conversion of a chemical signal to an electrical signal. Locations and times of spontaneous initiation of autocatalytic fronts can be preprogrammed in the spatial distribution of the reactants in the hydrogel. To approach the functionality of living matter, the actuators triggered by an autocatalytic front can be integrated into smart materials regulated by chemical circuits.

         <title>Star&#8208;Polymer&#8211;DNA Gels Showing Highly Predictable and Tunable Mechanical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA gels with predictable mechanical responses are developed using a star&#8208;polymer strategy and a pair of presimulated DNA sequences. The macroscopic stress&#8208;relaxation time of the DNA gel is connected directly to the microscopic lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over an extended time range from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. In addition, the DNA gels are spatially homogeneous, hysteresis&#8208;less, and self&#8208;healable.








Abstract
Dynamically crosslinked gels are appealing materials for applications that require time&#8208;dependent mechanical responses. DNA duplexes are ideal crosslinkers for building such gels because of their excellent sequence addressability and flexible tunability in bond energy. However, the mechanical responses of most DNA gels are complicated and unpredictable. Here, a DNA gel with a highly homogeneous gel network and well predictable mechanical behaviors is demonstrated by using a pair of star&#8208;polymer&#8211;DNA precursors with presimulated DNA sequences showing the two&#8208;state transition. The melting curve analysis of the DNA gels reveals the good correspondence between the thermodynamic potentials of the DNA crosslinkers and the presimulated values by DNA calculators. Stress&#8208;relaxation tests and dissociation kinetics measurements show that the macroscopic relaxation time of the DNA gels is approximately equal to the lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over 4 orders of magnitude from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. Furthermore, a series of durability tests find the DNA gels are hysteresis&#8208;less and self&#8208;healable after the applications of repeated temperature and mechanical stimuli. These results demonstrate the great potential of star&#8208;polymer&#8211;DNA precursors for building gels with predictable and tunable viscoelastic properties, suitable for applications such as stress&#8208;response extracellular matrices, injectable solids, and soft robotics.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Changing DNA&#8208;Linked Nanoparticle Films Dictated by Lateral and Vertical Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of top&#8208;down plasmonic photopatterning and bottom&#8208;up DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly is used to fabricate free&#8208;standing nanoparticle films encoded with instructions for dynamic shape changes. The distinct plasmonic properties of the incorporated nanoparticles enable on&#8208;demand lateral patterning with 3D selectivity, which, in turn, allows for fine control over the structure and morphing actions of DNA&#8208;linked nanoparticle films.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale building blocks into complex nanostructures with controlled structural anisotropy can open up new opportunities for realizing active nanomaterials exhibiting spatiotemporal structural transformations. Here, a combination of bottom&#8208;up DNA&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly and top&#8208;down photothermal patterning is adopted to fabricate free&#8208;standing nanoparticle films with vertical and lateral heterogeneity. This approach involves the construction of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticle films by DNA&#8208;directed layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly, followed by on&#8208;demand lateral patterning by the direct photothermal writing method. The distinct plasmonic properties of nanospheres and nanorods constituting the multidomain films enable photopatterning in a selective domain with precisely controlled vertical depths. The photopatterned films exhibit complex morphing actions instructed by the lateral and vertical patterns inscribed in the film as well as the information carried in DNA.

         <title>A Biomimetic Human Lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip with Colorful Display of Microphysiological Breath</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural&#8208;color change behavior of soap bubbles, a novel biomimetic 3D human lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip microsystem, which allows for visual sensing and real&#8208;time monitoring of cellular mechanics, is presented. This model enables modeling of human lung disease, assessment of the dynamic relationships between the color atlas and disease phenotypes, and screening of drugs for potential therapeutics.








Abstract
Lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models hold great promise for disease modeling and drug screening. Herein, inspired by the iridescence phenomenon of soap bubbles, a novel biomimetic 3D microphysiological lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system with breathing visualization is presented. The system, with an array of pulmonary alveoli at the physiological scale, is constructed and coated with structural color materials. Cyclic deformation is induced by regular airflow, resembling the expansion and contraction of the alveoli during rhythmic breathing. As the deformation is accompanied with corresponding synchronous shifts in the structural color, the constructed system offers self&#8208;reporting of the cell mechanics and enables real&#8208;time monitoring of the cultivation process. Using this system, the dynamic relationships between the color atlas and disease symptoms, showing the essential role of mechanical stretching in the phenotypes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are investigated. These features make this human lung system ideal in biological study, disease monitoring, and drug discovery.

         <title>Electrical Tuning of Plasmonic Conducting Polymer Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically tunable conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) polymer nano&#8208;optical antennas are reported. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, gradual electrical tuning of their nano&#8208;optical response is demonstrated. This work opens for electrically tunable metasurfaces and takes important steps toward applications ranging from tunable flat metalenses and holograms to adaptable smart windows.








Abstract
Nanostructures of conventional metals offer manipulation of light at the nanoscale but are largely limited to static behavior due to fixed material properties. To develop the next frontier of dynamic nano&#8208;optics and metasurfaces, this study utilizes the redox&#8208;tunable optical properties of conducting polymers, as recently shown to be capable of sustaining plasmons in their most conducting oxidized state. Electrically tunable conducting polymer nano&#8208;optical antennas are presented, using nanodisks of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) (PEDOT:Sulf) as a model system. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, the concept enables gradual electrical tuning of the nano&#8208;optical response, which was&#160;found to be related to the modulation of both density and mobility of the mobile polaronic charge carriers in the polymer. The resonance position of the PEDOT:Sulf nanoantennas can be conveniently controlled by disk size, here reported down to a wavelength of around 1270 nm. The presented concept may be used for electrically tunable metasurfaces, with tunable farfield as well as nearfield. The work thereby opens for applications ranging from tunable flat meta&#8208;optics to adaptable smart windows.

         <title>Realizing 19.05% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells by Progressively Improving Charge Extraction and Suppressing Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progressive improvement of charge extraction and suppression of charge recombination by side&#8208;chain engineering of Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), employing a ternary blend and introducing a volatilizable solid additive, fine&#8208;tunes the electronic properties of the NFAs and optimizes the morphology of the active layer and contributes to a record power conversion efficiency of 19.05% for single&#8208;junction polymer solar cells.








Abstract
Improving charge extraction and suppressing charge recombination are critically important to minimize the loss of absorbed photons and improve the device performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, highly efficient PSCs are demonstrated by progressively improving the charge extraction and suppressing the charge recombination through the combination of side&#8208;chain engineering of new nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), adopting ternary blends, and introducing volatilizable solid additives. The 2D side chains on BTP&#8208;Th induce a certain steric hindrance for molecular packing and phase separation, which is mitigated by fluorination of side chains on BTP&#8208;FTh. Moreover, by introducing two highly crystalline molecules as the second acceptor and volatilizable solid additive, respectively, into the BTP&#8208;FTh&#8208;based host blend, the molecular crystallinity is significantly improved and the blend morphology is finely optimized. As expected, enhanced charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination are progressively realized, contributing to the largely improved fill factor (FF) of the resultant devices. Accompanied by the enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% is realized finally.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Amorphous Interfaces Coupling of CoSe2/CoP with Optimized d&#8208;Band Center and Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline&#8208;amorphous CoSe2/CoP heterojunction is prepared. Thanks to the synergistic&#8208;effect of heterojunction and amorphous structure, the electronic coupling at the interfaces has been significantly strengthened and the d&#8208;band center has been deeply tailored. It optimizes the valence state and the H adsorption of Co and reduces the kinetic barrier of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, achieving excellent HER activity.








Abstract
Amorphous and heterojunction materials have been widely used in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, the current used individual strategy still has limited effects. Hence efficient tailoring tactics with synergistic effect are highly desired. Herein, the authors have realized the deep optimization of catalytic activity by a constructing crystalline&#8211;amorphous CoSe2/CoP heterojunction. Benefiting from the strong electronic coupling at the interfaces, the d&#8208;band center of the material moves further down compared to its crystalline&#8211;crystalline counterpart, optimizing the valence state and the H adsorption of Co and lowering the kinetic barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The heterojunction shows an overpotential of 65&#160;mV to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the acidic medium. Besides, it also shows competitive properties in both neutral and basic media. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the catalytic activity through combining a crystalline and amorphous heterojunction, which can be implemented for other transition metal compound electrocatalysts.

Supramolecular Hydrogels
In article number 2108300, Hang Zhao, Xianglong Han, Qianming Chen, and co&#8208;workers introduce a high&#8208;strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel, which was constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2'&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2'&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8208;FA). Notably, it also exhibits excellent biocompatibility, fast biodegradation, antibacterial properties, and osteoclast inhibition, making it a potential candidate biomaterial for tooth&#8208;extraction wound healing and tissue engineering.

Nanosprings
In article number 2108419, Ziyao Zhou, Houbing Huang, Yong Peng, Ming Liu, and co&#8208;workers report freestanding, epitaxial, ferroelectric nanosprings with superscalability, which provide insights regarding mechanical behaviors and domain evolution of ferroelectric oxide springs. The excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under coexisting axial and shear strains. The superstretchable, elastic, and recoverable oxide spring provides a novel platform to flexible electronics.

Solid Electrolyte Interphase
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a critical role in determining the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal anodes. However, viewing the SEI in batteries remains extremely challenging due to its supersensitivity to the electron beam under a microscope. In article number 2108252, Ju Li, Meng Gu, and co&#8208;workers develop an ultralow&#8208;dosage cryo&#8208;TEM protocol to directly visualize the SEI in 3D at different charging states, revealing surprising and fundamentally significant results for the SEI. The optimized chemo&#8208;mechanical properties of the SEI contribute significantly to the superior performances of Li&#8208;metal batteries.

Hydrogel Actuators
Biochemical circuits regulate the movement of living organisms. In article number 2106816,  Sergey N. Semenov and co&#8208;workers use a synthetic chemical reaction network based on thiols to regulate hydrogel actuators. The signal inducing the actuation is propagated by the autocatalytic front of the thiols. It can jump from one actuator to another or be initiated by the chemical circuit with preprogrammed delay.

Immunotherapy
In article number 2106350, Dan Peer and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy to boost chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by using a dual cell&#8208;targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost. With this approach, chemo&#8208;induced immunogenic cancer cell death is increased, tumor myeloid cell is reprogrammed, and cytotoxic T cell is recruited, which consequently improves responsiveness to immunotherapy.

         <title>Theory of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), namely phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts spin selectivity to various electron processes, has long defied a comprehensive theoretical explanation. Here, the status of CISS in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions is reviewed. For each, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding is discussed and remaining challenges are identified.








Abstract
A critical overview of the theory of the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, that is, phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts significant spin selectivity to various electron processes, is provided. Based on discussions in a recently held workshop, and further work published since, the status of CISS effects&#8212;in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions&#8212;is reviewed. For each, a detailed discussion of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding is provided and remaining challenges and research opportunities are identified.

         <title>Cellular Nanosponges for Biological Neutralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely cellular nanosponges, as host cell decoys for biological neutralization applications is reviewed, including their use to neutralize bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. For each area, the design of different cellular nanosponges and their corresponding neutralization functions are discussed.








Abstract
Biological neutralization represents a general strategy that deploys therapeutic agents to bind with harmful molecules or infectious pathogens, block their bioactivity, and thus prevent them from causing the diseases. Here, a comprehensive review of using cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely &#8220;cellular nanosponges,&#8221; as host decoys for a wide range of biological neutralization applications is provided. Compared to traditional neutralization strategies, the cellular nanosponges stand out by mimicking susceptible host cells rather than accommodating the structures of the causative agents for the design of therapeutics. As all pathological agents must interact with host cells for bioactivity, nanosponges bypass the diversity of these agents and create function&#8208;driven and broad&#8208;spectrum neutralization solutions. The review focuses on the recent progress of using this new nanomedicine platform for neutralization against five primary pathological agents, including bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. Existing studies have established cellular nanosponges as versatile tools for biological neutralization. A thorough review of the cellular nanosponge technology is expected to inspire more refined cellular nanosponge designs and unique neutralization applications to address unsolved medical problems.

         <title>Efficiency of Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. An important contribution to the EQE of a PLED orignates from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in a PPV&#8208;based PLED, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.








Abstract
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. The EQE of an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is governed by a number of parameters, such as the electrical efficiency, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the optical outcoupling efficiency and the spin statistics for singlet exciton generation. In the last decade, the electrical efficiency has been determined from a numerical PLED device model. More recently, an optical model to simulate the fraction of photons outcoupled to air for PLEDs with a broad recombination zone has been developed. Together with the directly measured PLQY, the EQE of a PLED can then be estimated. However, it has been observed that the measured EQEs of fluorescent PLEDs, including the model system super&#8208;yellow poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (SY&#8208;PPV) often exceed the expected values. To solve this discrepancy, it is demonstrate that the electrical PLED model has to be expanded by the inclusion of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA), which is shown to be responsible for a substantial EQE enhancement. Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in SY&#8208;PPV PLEDs, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.

         <title>Recent Advances in Oxidation Stable Chemistry of 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review briefly introduces preparation methods, oxidation mechanisms, a comprehensive summarization of factors affecting oxidation and a detailed account of strategies to mitigate MXenes degeneration. It furthermore offers an overview of in situ synthesis MXene derivatives with enhanced performance, and presents perspectives for the challenges and opportunities for the protection and application of MXenes and their derivatives.








Abstract
As an emerging star of 2D nanomaterials, 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, present a large potential in various research areas owing to their intrinsic multilayer structure and intriguing physico&#8208;chemical properties. However, the fabrication and application of functional MXene&#8208;based devices still remain challenging as they are prone to oxidative degradation under ambient environment. Within this review, the preparation methods of MXenes focusing on the recent investigations on their thermal structure&#8211;stability relationships in inert, oxidizing, and aqueous environments are systematically introduced. Moreover, the key factors that affect the oxidation of MXenes, such as, atmosphere, temperature, composition, microstructure, and aqueous environment, are reviewed. Based on different scenarios, strategies for avoiding or delaying the oxidation of MXenes are proposed to encourage the utilization of MXenes in complicated environments, especially at high temperature. Furthermore, the chemistry of MXene&#8208;derived oxides is analyzed, which can offer perspectives on the further design and fabrication of novel 2D composites with the unique structures of MXenes being preserved.
