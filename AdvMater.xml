         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte is reported, wherein Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarization is known as a promising way to promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since the intermediates and products endow spin&#8208;dependent behaviors, yet it is rarely reported for ferromagnetic catalysts toward acidic OER practically used in industry. Herein, the first spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte. Element&#8208;selective X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Ru ions, fulfilling the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori rule. The ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature can be well interpreted by first principles calculations as the interaction between the Mn2+ impurity and Ru ions. Indeed, Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic field enhanced OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 143&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 and negligible activity decay in 480&#160;h stability (vs 200&#160;mV/195&#160;h without magnetic field) as known for magnetic effects in the literature. The intrinsic turnover frequency is also improved to reach 5.5 s&#8722;1 at 1.45 VRHE. This work highlights an important avenue of spin&#8208;engineering strategy for designing efficient acidic oxygen evolution catalysts.

         <title>Tunable Organic Active Neural Probe Enabling Near&#8208;Sensor Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifier is monolithically integrated with organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a highly flexible substrate. The active neural probe records local field potentials in an experimental rat model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This approach creates a new near&#8208;sensor processing paradigm in neural interface technology.








Abstract
Neural recording systems have significantly progressed to provide an advanced understanding and treatment for neurological diseases. Flexible transistor&#8208;based active neural probes exhibit great potential in electrophysiology applications due to their intrinsic amplification capability and tissue&#8208;compliant nature. However, most current active neural probes exhibit bulky back&#8208;end connectivity since the output is current, and the development of an integrated circuit for voltage output is crucial for near&#8208;sensor signal processing at the abiotic/biotic interface. Here, inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifiers are presented by monolithically integrating organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a single, highly flexible substrate for in vivo brain activity recording. Additive inkjet printing enables the seamless integration of multiple active and passive components on the somatosensory cortex, leading to significant noise reduction over the externally connected typical configuration. It also facilitates fine&#8208;tuning of the voltage amplification and frequency properties. The organic voltage amplifiers are validated as electrocorticography devices in a rat in vivo model, showing their ability to record local field potentials in an experimental model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity. These results bring organic active neural probes to the forefront in applications where efficient sensory data processing is performed at sensor endpoints.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Cation&#8208;&#928; Interactions Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Bright And Spectrally Stable Rec. 2020 Pure&#8208;Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with pure&#8208;red electroluminescence for practical applications remains a critical challenge because of the problematic luminescence property and spectral instability of existing emitters. Herein, we report high&#8208;efficiency Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs simultaneously exhibiting exceptional brightness and spectral stability based on CsPb(Br/I)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) capping with aromatic amino acid ligands featuring cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. We prove that strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between the PbI6&#8208;octahedra of perovskite units and the electron&#8208;rich indole ring of tryptophan (TRP) molecules not only chemically polish the imperfect surface sites and induce crystal reconstruction of the NCs, but also markedly increase the binding affinity of the ligand molecules, leading to high photoluminescence quantum yields and greatly enhanced spectral stability of the CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs. Moreover, the incorporation of small&#8208;size aromatic TRP ligands ensures superior charge transport properties of the assembled emissive layers. The resultant devices emitting at around 635&#160;nm demonstrate a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.8%, a max luminance of 12,910&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and outstanding spectral stability, representing one of the best&#8208;performing Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs achieved so far.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Electrochemically Promoting Lithium Atom Diffusion and Relieving Accumulative Stress for Deep&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile stress can be incorporated into lithium metal anodes to reduce lithium atom diffusion energy barrier by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium through copolymer thinning. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8208;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) can double the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious lithium dendrite growth and large volume change are not well addressed, especially under deep cycling. Here, an in&#8211;situ mechanical&#8211;electrochemical coupling system is built, and it is found that tensile stress can induce smooth lithium deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and finite element method (FEM) simulation confirm that the lithium atom diffusion energy barrier can be reduced when the lithium foils are under tensile strain. Then tensile stress is incorporated into lithium metal anodes by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium in which the copolymer thinning can yield tensile stress to the lithium foil. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8211;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation. The ELMA can withstand hundreds of compression&#8208;release cycles under 10% strain. LMBs paired with ELMA and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can operate beyond 250 cycles with 80% capacity retention under practical condition of 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode capacity, 2.86&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C) and 1.8 negative&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio (N/P), five times of the lifetime using lithium foils.

         <title>Optical Fibers Embedded with As&#8208;Grown Carbon Nanotubes for Ultrahigh Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Direct growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with narrow diameter distribution on the inner walls of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) by a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is developed. By using the as&#8208;fabricated 3&#8208;cm&#8208;long CNT&#8208;fibers with desirable nanotube optical transitions, both third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been largely enhanced and mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser has been fabricated with a stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate.








Abstract
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors. Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibers by ex situ transfer method; however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage. Here, the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method is reported. A two&#8208;step growth method is&#160;developed to control the narrow diameter distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNT&#8208; embedded fiber, third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been enhanced by &#8776;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. A dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fiber mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8776;1561 and &#8776;1064&#160;nm) is further demonstrated by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diameter CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap hollow core PCF&#160;(named HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8776;0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8776;1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fiber laser shows stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. These&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Anionic Structure Activated Co&#63743;S Bonds Promote Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity for High&#8208;Efficiency Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the bifunctional performance of hetero&#8208;anionic structure for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts are constructed and afford excellent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The superior performance of the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#63743;S bond provides fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The electronic structure of transition metal complexes can be modulated by replacing partial ion of complexes to obtain tuned intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. However, the anion&#8208;modulated transition metal complexes ORR activity of is still unsatisfactory, and the construction of hetero&#8208;anionic structure remains challenging. Herein, an atomic doping strategy is presented to prepare the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 (CCSO/NC&#8208;2) as electrocatalysts, the structrual characterization results favorably demonstrate the partial substitution of S atoms for O in CCSO/NC&#8208;2, which shows excellent catalytic performance and durability for OER and ORR in 0.1&#160;m KOH. In addition, the catalyst assembled Zinc&#8211;air battery with an open circuit potential of 1.43&#160;V maintains performance after 300&#160;h of cyclic stability. Theoretical calculations and differential charges illustrate that S doping optimizes the reaction kinetics and promotes electron redistribution. The superior performance of CCSO/NC&#8208;2 catalysis is mainly due to its unique S modulation of the electronic structure of the main body. The introduction of S promotes Co&#63743;O covalency and constructs a fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.

         <title>Rational Design of A Chemical Bath Deposition Based Tin Oxide Electron Transport Layer for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemical bath deposition is widely used to deposit SnOx as an electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The conventional recipe uses thioglycolic acid (TGA) to facilitate attachments of SnOx particles onto the substrate. However, nonvolatile TGA has been reported to harm the operational stability of PSCs. In this work, we&#160;introduced a volatile oxalic acid (OA) as an alternative to TGA. OA, a dicarboxylic acid, functions as a chemical linker for the nucleation and attachment of particles to the substrate in the chemical bath. Moreover, OA can be readily removed through thermal annealing followed by a mild H2O2 treatment, as shown by FTIR measurements. Synergistically, the mild H2O2 treatment selectively oxidizes the surface of the SnOx layer, minimizing nonradiative interface carrier recombination. EELS (electron&#8208;energy&#8208;loss&#8208;spectroscopy) confirms that the SnOx surface is dominated by Sn4+, while the bulk is a mixture of Sn2+ and Sn4+. This rational design of a CBD SnOx layer leads to devices with T85&#8764;1,500&#160;h, a significant improvement over the TGA&#8208;based device with T80&#8764;250&#160;h. Our&#160;champion device reached a power conversion efficiency of 24.6%. This work offers a rationale for optimizing the complex parameter space of CBD SnOx to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.

Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are natural carriers for intercellular transfer of bioactive molecules, which have been harnessed for wide biomedical applications. However, a facile yet general approach to engineering interspecies EV&#8208;cell communications is still lacking. Here, w e report the use of DNA to encode the heterogeneous interfaces of EVs and cells in a manner free of covalent or genetic modifications, which enables orthogonal EV&#8208;cell interkingdom interactions in complex environments. W e employ cholesterol&#8208;modified DNA strands and tetrahedral DNA frameworks with complementary sequences to serve as artificial ligands and receptors docking on EVs and living cells, respectively, which can mediate specific yet efficient cellular internalization of EVs via Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing. W e show that based on this system, human cells can adopt EVs derived from the mouse, watermelon, and E. coli. By implementing several EV&#8208;cell circuits, w e show that this DNA&#8208;programmed system allows orthogonal EV&#8208;cell communications in complex environments. W e further demonstrate efficient delivery of EVs with bioactive contents derived from STO cells toward monkey female germline stem cells (FGSCs), which enables self&#8208;renewal and stemness maintenance of the FGSCs without feeder cells. This system might provide a universal platform to customize intercellular exchanges of materials and signals across species and kingdoms.

         <title>Stabilisation of Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with A 2d Dion&#8208;Jacobson Passivating Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Inorganic metal halide perovskites such as CsPbI3 are promising for high&#8208;performance, reproducible and robust solar cells. However, inorganic perovskites are sensitive to humidity, which causes the transformation from the black phase to the yellow &#948;, non&#8208;perovskite phase. Such phase instability has been a significant challenge to long&#8208;term operational stability. Here, we report a surface dimensionality reduction strategy, using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl) ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the surface of the 3D inorganic perovskite structure. The Dion&#8208;Jacobson layer mainly grew at the grain boundaries of the perovskite, effectively passivating surface defects and providing favourable interfacial charge transfer. The resulting inorganic perovskite films exhibited excellent humidity resistance when submerged in an aqueous solution (Isopropanol: Water = 4: 1v/v) and exposed to a 50% humidity air atmosphere. The DJ 2D/3D inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5% with a Voc of 1.197&#160;eV. It retained 83% of initial PCE after 1260&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under 1.2 sun illumination. Our work demonstrates an effective way for stabilising efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A Bioinspired Injectable, Adhesive And Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel with Dual Hybrid Network for Neural Regeneration After Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based regenerated scaffold shows promise as a platform for neural regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). Nevertheless, the persistent problem of poor mechanical strength and limited integration with the host tissue still exists. In this study, we developed a bioinspired hydrogel with highly sophisticated features for neural regeneration after SCI. The hydrogel is composed of DOPA&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer peptide, offering a unique set of qualities such as being injectable, having self&#8208;healing abilities, and adhering to tissues. Compared to the conventional hydrogel, our hydrogel insured as significant promotion of the immune response modulation and axon regrowth while featuring synapse formation of various neurotransmitters and myelin regeneration. Subsequently, functional recoveries were enhanced, including motor function, sensory function and particularly bladder defect repair. These positive findings demonstrate that the hydrogel has great potential as a strategy for repairing SCI. Moreover, the versatility of this strategy goes beyond neural regeneration and holds promise for tissue regeneration in other contexts. Overall, our proposed hydrogel represented an innovative and multifaceted tool for engineering structures in the biomedical field.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembled Bispecific Nano&#8208;Blocker for Enhancing Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) has achieved substantial success in tumor immunotherapy by T&#8208;cells activation. However, owing to the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components induced unsatisfactory T&#8208;cells infiltration and poor tumor penetration of antibodies makes it challenging to realize efficient tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we reported a peptide&#8208;based bispecific nano&#8208;blocker (BNB) strategy for in situ construction of CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 targeted nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells that capable of boosting up T&#8208;cells infiltration through CXCR4 blockage and enhancing T&#8208;cells activation by PD&#8208;L1 occupancy, ultimately realizing high&#8208;performance tumor immunotherapy. Briefly, the BNB strategy selectively recognize and bond CXCR4/PD&#8208;L1 with deep tumor penetration, which rapidly self&#8208;assembles into nanoclusters on the surface of tumor cells. Compared to the traditional bispecific antibody, BNB exhibits an intriguing metabolic behavior, i.e., the elimination half&#8208;life (t1/2) of BNB in the tumor is 69.3&#160;h that is about 50&#8208;time longer than that in the plasma (1.4&#160;h). The higher tumor accumulation and rapid systemic clearance overcomes potential systemic side effect. Moreover, the solid tumor stress generated by excessive extracellular matrix components is substantially reduced to 44%, which promotes T&#8208;cells infiltration and activation for immunotherapy efficacy. Finally, our findings substantially strengthen and extend clinical applications of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy.

         <title>From Volumetric to Planar Multiplexing: Phase&#8208;Coded Metasurface Without Bragg Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metasurfaces consisting of planar subwavelength structures with minimal thickness are appealing to emerging technologies such as integrated optics and photonic chips for their small footprint and compatibility with sophisticated planar nanofabrication techniques. However, reduced dimensionality due to the two&#8208;dimensional nature of a metasurface poses challenges to the adaptation of a few useful methods that have found great success with conventional optics in three&#8208;dimensional space. For instance, Bragg diffraction is the foundation of the well&#8208;established technique of phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in volume holography. It relies on interference among the scattered waves from multiple layers across the thickness of a sample. In this work, despite losing the dimension in thickness, a metasurface is devised to experimentally demonstrate phase&#8208;coded multiplexing by replacing free&#8208;space light with a surface wave in its output. The in&#8208;plane interference along the propagation of the surface wave resembles the Bragg diffraction, thus enabling phase&#8208;coded multiplexing in the two&#8208;dimensional design. An example of code&#8208;based all optical routing is also achieved by using a multiplexed metasurface, which could find applications in photonic data processing and communications.

         <title>Redox Triggers Guest Release And Uptake Across A Series of Azopyridine&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Capsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Precise control over guest release and recapture using external stimuli is a valuable goal, potentially enabling new modes of chemical purification. Including redox moieties within the ligand cores of molecular capsules to trigger the release and uptake of guests has proved effective, but this technique is limited to certain capsules and guests. Herein, we demonstrated the construction of a series of novel metal&#8208;organic capsules from ditopic, tritopic and tetratopic ligands respectively, which contain redox&#8208;active azo groups coordinated to FeII centers. Compared to their iminopyridine&#8208;based analogs, this new class of azopyridine&#8208;based capsule possess larger cavities, capable of encapsulating more voluminous guests. Upon reduction of the capsules, their guests are released and may then be re&#8208;encapsulated when the capsules are regenerated by oxidation. Since the redox centers are on the ligand arms, they are modular and can be attached to a variety of ligand cores to afford varying and predictable architectures. Our method thus shows promise as a generalized approach for designing redox&#8208;controlled guest release and uptake systems.

         <title>A Smart DNA&#8208;based Nanosystem Containing Ribosome&#8208;Regulating Sirna for Enhanced Mrna Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is the prerequisite for the application of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics. In hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, such as macrophages, the effective transfection of mRNA remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem containing ribosome biogenesis&#8208;promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers were copolymerized to form nanoframework (NF), including N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as skeleton, and Acrydite&#8208;DNA as initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1&#8208;polyT and H2&#8208;siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8764;34&#160;&#176;C), NF swelled to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, NF de&#8208;swelled to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in NF responded to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA were released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down&#8208;regulated the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up&#8208;regulated the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. Our nanosystem showed satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model. We envision that our DNA&#8208;based nanosystem provides a promising carrier to deliver mRNA in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, and promotes the development of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

Herein, we report a smart DNA-based nanosystem containing ribosome biogenesis-promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers were copolymerized to form nanoframework (NF), including N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as skeleton, and Acrydite-DNA as initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1-polyT and H2-siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8764;34&#160;&#176;C), NF swelled to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, NF de-swelled to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in NF responded to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA were released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down-regulated the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up-regulated the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. Our nanosystem showed satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model.

         <title>Mold&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Highly Sensitive And Fast Response Pressure Sensors Through High&#8208;Resolution 3d Printing And Conformal Oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In this work, w e showcase a new manufacturing paradigm to exclude conventional mold&#8208;dependent manufacturing of pressure sensors, which typically requires a series of complex and expensive patterning processes. Our mold&#8208;free manufacturing leverages high&#8208;resolution 3D printed multiscale microstructures as substrate and a gas&#8208;phase conformal polymer coating technique to complete the mold&#8208;free sensing platform. The array of dome and spike structures with a controlled spike density of a 3D&#8208;printed substrate ensures a large contact surface with pressures applied and extended linearity in a wider pressure range. For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&lt; 60 &#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185 kPa&#8722;1) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultra&#8208;fast response time (&#8764;36 &#956;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit sensing performance. Our unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to the technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost&#8208;effective manufacturing manner.

Our mold-free manufacturing leverages high-resolution 3D printed multiscale microstructures as substrate and a gas-phase conformal polymer coating technique to complete the mold-free sensing platform. The array of dome and spike structures with a controlled spike density of a 3D-printed substrate ensures a large contact surface with pressures applied and extended linearity in a wider pressure range. For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&amp;lt; 60 &#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185 kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultra-fast response time (&#8764;36 &#956;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure-of-merit sensing performance. Our unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to the technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost-effective manufacturing manner.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Efficient blue phosphors remain as the formidable challenges for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To circumvent this obstacle, a series of Ir(III) based carbene complexes bearing asymmetric di&#8208;N&#8208;aryl 6&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;2H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;b]pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene chelates, namely, f&#8208;ct6a &#8210; c, were synthesized and their structures and photophysical properties were comprehensively investigated. Moreover, these emitters can undergo interconversion in refluxing 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene, catalyzed by a mixture of sodium acetate (NaOAc) and p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH&#183;H2O) without decomposition. All Ir(III) complexes present good photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL = 83 &#8211; 88%) with peak maximum (max.) at 443 &#8210; 452&#160;nm and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM = 66 &#8211; 73&#160;nm). Among all fabricated OLED devices, f&#8208;ct6b delivered a max. external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage CIE(x,y) coordinates of (0.14, 0.12), whereas the hyper&#8208;OLED device based on f&#8208;ct6a and 5H,9H,11H,15H&#8208;[1,4] benzazaborino [2,3,4&#8208;kl][1,4]benzazaborino[4&#8242;,3&#8242;,2&#8242;:4,5][1,4]benzazaborino[3,2&#8208;b]phenazaborine&#8208;7,13&#8208;diamine, N7,N7,N13,N13,5,9,11,15&#8208;octaphenyl (&#957;&#8208;DABNA) exhibited max. EQE of 26.2% and CIE(x,y) of (0.12, 0.13). Finally, the corresponding tandem OLED with f&#8208;ct6b as dopant gave a max. luminance of over 10000 cd&#8901;m&#8210;2 and max. EQE of 42.1%, confirming their candidacies for making true&#8208;blue OLEDs.

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials with Intrinsically Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced circularly polarized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials synergize the advantages of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), narrowband emission and TADF characteristic, which can be fabricated into highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high color purity, directly facing the urgent market strategic demand of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition and 3D displays. In this contribution, based on edge topology molecular engineering (ETME) strategy, a pair of high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF enantiomers, (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, has been developed, which merges the intrinsically helical chirality into MR framework. The optimized CP&#8208;OLEDs with emitters (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py and the newly developed ambipolar transport host PhCbBCz exhibit pure green emission with sharp peaks of 532&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 37&#160;nm, and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.29, 0.68). Importantly, they achieve remarkable maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.6% and 29.2%, and clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of &#8722;4.37 &#215; 10&#8722;4 and +4.35 &#215; 10&#8722;4 for (P)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py and (M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, respectively.

         <title>Broadband Photodetectors and Imagers in Stretchable Electronics Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusion of optical devices capable of detecting a wide range of wavelengths with stretchable packaging enables internal evaluations for health conditions and abnormalities of targeted living bodies and various objects without experiencing mechanical stress from an arbitrary surface. This review introduces the trends and detailed techniques of materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems.








Abstract
The integration of flexible electronics with optics can help realize a powerful tool that facilitates the creation of a smart society wherein internal evaluations can be easily performed nondestructively from the surface of various objects that is used or encountered in daily lives. Here, organic&#8208;material&#8208;based stretchable optical sensors and imagers that possess both bending capability and rubber&#8208;like elasticity are reviewed. The latest trends in nondestructive evaluation equipment that enable simple on&#8208;site evaluations of health conditions and abnormalities are discussed without subjecting the targeted living bodies and various objects to mechanical stress. Real&#8208;time performance under real&#8208;life conditions is becoming increasingly important for creating smart societies interwoven with optical technologies. In particular, the terahertz (THz)&#8208;wave region offers a substance&#8208; and state&#8208;specific fingerprint spectrum that enables instantaneous analyses. However, to make THz sensors accessible, the following issues must be addressed: broadband and high&#8208;sensitivity at room temperature, stretchability to follow the surface movements of targets, and digital transformation compatibility. The materials, electronics packaging, and remote imaging systems used to overcome these issues are discussed in detail. Ultimately, stretchable optical sensors and imagers with highly sensitive and broadband THz sensors can facilitate the multifaceted on&#8208;site evaluation of solids, liquids, and gases.

         <title>All&#8208;Day Multicyclic Atmospheric Water Harvesting Enabled by Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel with Hybrid Desorption Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with free and coordinated hygroscopic salt is described, which exhibits fast sorption due to the large interior osmotic pressure and prevention of salt aggregation and leakage through the strong salt&#8211;polymer electrostatic interactions. By using a multicyclic operation strategy and a hybrid desorption mode, the sorbent achieves high&#8208;yield water production, outperforming single&#8208;cyclic solar&#8208;driven mode by three times.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising approach for mitigating worldwide water scarcity. However, reliable water supply driven by sustainable energy regardless of diurnal variation and weather remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. To address this issue, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with an optimal hybrid&#8208;desorption multicyclic&#8208;operation strategy is proposed, achieving all&#8208;day AWH and a significant increase in daily water production. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel possesses a large interior osmotic pressure of 659 atm, which refreshes sorption sites by continuously migrating the sorbed water within its interior, and thus enhancing sorption kinetics. The charged polymeric chains coordinate with hygroscopic salt ions, anchoring the salts and preventing agglomeration and leakage, thereby enhancing cyclic stability. The hybrid desorption mode, which couples solar energy and simulated waste heat, introduces a uniform and adjustable sorbent temperature for achieving all&#8208;day ultrafast water release. With rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, an optimization model suggests that eight moisture capture&#8211;release cycles are capable of achieving&#160;high water yield of 2410 mLwater kgsorbent&#8722;1 day&#8722;1, up to 3.5 times that of single&#8208;cyclic non&#8208;hybrid modes. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent and the coupling with sustainable energy driven desorption mode pave the way for the next&#8208;generation AWH systems, significantly bringing freshwater on a multi&#8208;kilogram scale closer.

Abstract
As alternatives to the batteries with organic electrolytes, the aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (AZBs) have been intensively studies. However, the sluggish kinetics, side reactions, structural collapse, and dissolution of cathode severely compromise the commercialization of AZBs. Among various strategies to accelerate their practical applications, multi&#8208;ion engineering shows great feasibility to maintain the original structure of cathode and provide sufficient energy density for high&#8208;performance AZBs. Though multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies could solve most of the problems encountered by AZBs and show great potential in achieving practical AZBs, the comprehensive summaries of the batteries undergo electrochemical reactions involving more than one charge carriers is still in deficiency. The ambiguous nomenclature and classification are becoming the fountainhead of confusion and chaos. In this circumstance, this review overviews all the battery configurations and the corresponding reaction mechanisms investigated in the multi&#8208;ion engineering of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries. By combing through all the reported works, we are the first to nomenclate the different configurations according to the reaction mechanisms of the additional ions, laying the foundation for future unified discussions. The performance enhancement, fundamental challenges, future developing direction of multi&#8208;ion strategies are accordingly proposed, aiming to further accelerate the pace to achieve the commercialization of AZBs with high&#8208;performance.

         <title>Long&#8208;life Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Anode&#8208;Free Battery Enabled by Li Compensation Coupled Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Initially anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges high production feasibility of Li&#8208;ion batteries with superb energy capabilities of Li metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero&#8208;Li&#8208;excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. We report a Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy for realizing long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries. The Li2S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry. Meanwhile, it demonstrates remarkable efficacy in establishing a robust yet slender inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid solid&#8208;state interphase for inhibiting cell degradation by dead and dendritic Li. This strategy enables quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries with a long lifespan of 500 cycles. The Ah&#8208;scale quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, featuring a high&#8208;loading LiFePO4 cathode and lean gel polymer electrolyte, exhibit a high specific energy of 300&#160;Wh kgcell&#8211;1. This achievement translates into an improvement of 46% in gravimetric energy and 94% in volumetric energy compared to LiFePO4||graphite batteries while outperforming LiFePO4||Li metal batteries by 22 &#8211; 47% in volumetric energy. Such quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free cells also demonstrate good safety, showcasing remarkable resistance against nail penetration in ambient air without failure, smoke or fire accidents.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;appended Nanosonosensitizers Targeting Tumor Glycolysis for Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8208;Immunometabolic Therapy of Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumor</title>

Abstract
Despite recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, challenges have yet to be surmounted to achieve two major goals of magnifying antitumor immunity and remodeling immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, a nanosystem (ODM&#8208;R) that integrates oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (ODM) nanosonosensitizers and R7 peptides with tumor metabolism regulation effects is designed and fabricated for synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;immunometabolic therapy of spinal&#8208;metastasized tumor. The ODM generates reactive oxygen species upon ultrasound irradiation to implement sonodynamic therapy (SDT), inducing cancer cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. The R7 attached on ODM markedly inhibits the uptake of glucose and excretion of lactic acid in cancer cells by perturbing the glycolysis process. The combination of SDT and tumor glycolysis obstruction by ODM&#8208;R guarantees satisfactory efficacy in synergizing with PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate the spinal&#8208;metastasized tumors, achieving concurrent sonodynamic&#8208;triggered immune activation and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remodeling. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of nanosonosensitizers for boosting cancer immunotherapy by SDT and tumor metabolic regulation.

         <title>Shape&#8208;programmable Liquid Crystalline Polyurethane&#8208;based Multi&#8208;mode Actuators Triggered by Light&#8208;driven Molecular Motors</title>

Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;driven soft actuators have been rapidly developed as enablers in the fabrication of artificial robots and biomimetic devices. However, it remains challenging to amplify molecular isomerization to multiple modes of macroscopic actuation with large amplitude and complex motions. Here w e report a strategy to build a light&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline polyurethane elastomer by photo&#8208;triggered overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors. Trifunctional molecular motor modified with ethylene glycol spacer on the rotor and stator functions as a crosslinker and unidirectional stirrer that amplifies molecular motion into macroscopic movement. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved. Such research is hoped to pave a new way for the design of advanced light responsive soft actuators and robots.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Perovskite LEDs with An Integrated Distributed Feedback Resonator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Realization of electrically pumped laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processed semiconductors is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Metal halide perovskites have shown great potential toward this goal due to the excellent optoelectronic properties. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) optically pumped lasing in a real electroluminescent device represents a key step to the current injection laser diode, but it has not been realized yet. This is mainly due to the challenge of incorporating a resonant cavity into an efficient light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) which can sustain intensive carrier injection. Here we report CW lasing in an efficient perovskite LED with an integrated distributed feedback resonator, which shows a low lasing threshold of 220&#160;W&#183;cm&#8722;2 at 110&#160;K. Importantly, the LED works well at a current density of 330&#160;A&#183;cm&#8722;2, indicating the carrier injection rate already exceeds the threshold of optically&#8208;pumping. Our results suggest that electrically pumped perovskite laser diodes can be achieved once the Joule heating issue is overcome.

         <title>Core Electron Count As A Versatile And Accurate New Descriptor For Sorting Mechanical Properties Of Diverse Transition Metal Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal light&#8208;element compounds show superb mechanical, chemical and thermal properties, and accurate descriptors are important to sorting targeted properties among this vast class of materials. Valence electron concentration (VEC) can track broad trends of mechanical properties, but this widely used descriptor suffers low accuracy with sorted data strongly scattered along trendlines, necessitating improved sorting strategy. Here, we examine elastic parameters from first&#8208;principles calculations for 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMN) in cubic structure and 81 ternary transition&#8208;metal diborides (TMB2) in hexagonal structure, and identify core electron count (CEC) of the solvent atoms as a new descriptor. Combined with VEC, the composite VEC&#8208;CEC descriptor exhibits greatly improved ability to sort elastic parameters of distinct TMN and TMB2 compounds. The unregulated property variations under the VEC description are well captured by CEC, which tends to enhance ductility and reduce strength at fixed VEC and rising CEC. By invoking a full&#8208;electron consideration, VEC&#8208;CEC descriptor accounts for the impact on bonding behaviors by both core and valence electrons with much improved accuracy and versatility in sorting mechanical properties of diverse TM compounds compared to many other commonly used descriptors, opening a fresh path for rational design and optimization of TM compounds with tailored performance benchmarks.

         <title>Mimicking Antioxidases And Hyaluronan Synthase: A Novel Zwitterionic Nanozyme for Photothermal Therapy of Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Restoring joint homeostasis is crucial for relieving osteoarthritis (OA). Current strategies are limited to unilateral efforts in joint lubrication, inhibition of inflammation, free radicals scavenging, and cartilage regeneration. Herein, by modifying molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with Mg2+&#8211;doped polydopamine and coating with polysulfobetaines, we constructed a dual&#8211;bionic photothermal nanozyme (MPMP) to mimic antioxidases/hyaluronan synthase for OA therapy. Photothermally enhanced lubrication lowered the coefficient of friction (0.028) in the early stage of OA treatment. The antioxidases&#8211;mimicking properties of MPMP nanozyme contributed to eliminating ROS/RNS (over 90% of scavenging ratio for H2O2/&#183;OH/O&#183;&#8211;2/DPPH/ABTS+) and supplying O2. With NIR irradiation, MPMP nanozyme triggered thermogenesis (upregulating HSP70 expression) and Mg2+ release, which promoted the chondrogenesis in inflammatory conditions by deactivating of NF&#8211;&#954;B/IL&#8211;17 signaling pathways and enhancing MAPK signaling pathway. Benefiting from HSP70 and Mg2+, MPMP&#8211;NIR showed HAS&#8211;mimicking activity to increase the intracellular (2.00&#8211;fold) and extracellular (3.12&#8211;fold) HA production. Therefore, MPMP&#8211;NIR demonstrated superior spatiotemporally therapeutic effect on OA in mice model, in terms of osteophytes (83.41% reduction), OARSI scores (88.57% reduction) and ACAN expression (2.70&#8211;fold increment). Hence, insights into dual&#8211;bionic nanozymes can be a promising strategy for OA therapy or other inflammation&#8211;related diseases.

         <title>Target Therapy for Buried Interface Enables Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.05% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The buried interface in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is pivotal for achieving high efficiency and stability. However, it is challenging to study and optimize the buried interface due to its non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, we&#160;develop a facile and effective strategy to modify the SnO2/perovskite buried interface by passivating the buried defects in perovskite and modulating carrier dynamics via incorporating formamidine oxalate (FOA) in SnO2 nanoparticles. Both formamidinium and oxalate ions show a longitudinal gradient distribution in the SnO2 layer, mainly accumulating at the SnO2/perovskite buried interface, which enables high&#8208;quality upper perovskite films, minimized defects, superior interface contacts, and matched energy levels between perovskite and SnO2. Significantly, FOA can simultaneously reduce the oxygen vacancies and tin interstitial defects on the SnO2 surface and the FA+/Pb2+ associated defects at the perovskite buried interface. Consequently, the FOA treatment significantly improves the efficiency of the PSCs from 22.40% to 25.05% and their storage&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. This method provides an effective target therapy of buried interface in PSCs to achieve very high efficiency and stability.

         <title>UV&#8208;curing&#8208;enhanced Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence materials (OLPLMs) can realize simpler solution processing and large&#8208;area uniform luminescence, which luminescent properties are significantly influenced by the rigid environment. However, research on utilizing the rigidity to promote long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) properties of amorphous OLPLMs is still relatively rare due to the lack of an unambiguous and effective strategy to construct the rigid environment. Here, we propose a universal strategy to enhance the LPL performance of organic host&#8208;guest doping systems by UV curing, which utilizes the rigid environment constructed by UV curing to promote the interaction between host and guest, thus inducing the generation of highly efficient LPL performance. This solution&#8208;processable, large&#8208;area and &#8220;easy to realize&#8221; material fabrication strategy can make amorphous OLPLMs show broader application prospects in some fields, such as anti&#8208;counterfeiting, non&#8208;destructive detection, and pattern marking or indication.

         <title>Anions Regulation Engineering Enables Highly Reversible and Dendrite&#8208;Free Nickel Metal Anode with Ultrahigh Capacities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of safe and high energy metal anodes represents a crucial research direction. Here, we report the achievement of highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free transition metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities by regulating aqueous electrolytes. Using nickel (Ni) as a model, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating the beneficial role of chloride ions in inhibiting and disrupting nickel hydroxide passivation layer on the Ni electrode. As a result, we have realized Ni anodes with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 1000 mAh cm&#8722;2 (volumetric capacity of &#8764;6000 mAh cm&#8722;3) and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% on a carbon substrate, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes by approximately two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we have developed a series of full cells based on the Ni anode. The designed Ni&#8208;MnO2 full battery exhibits a long lifespan of 2000 cycles, while the Ni&#8208;PbO2 full battery achieves a high areal capacity of 200 mAh cm&#8722;2. The findings of this study are important for enlightening a new arena towards the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free Ni metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities and long cycle life for various energy storage devices.

         <title>A Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lightweight Al battery is constructed using a dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and a high&#8208;loading integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF induce Al deposition. The zero&#8208;volume expansion of the GCAF results in better stability. A CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery exhibits excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance toward fast storage of fluctuating electricity.








Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode is con&#8208;firmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode is almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density are obtained. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes can promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Featuring Single Molybdenum Atoms in a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multicomponent core&#8211;shell structures presents a versatile route to produce bifunctional molybdenum&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts. Zinc&#8211;air batteries with such multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, significantly outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks.








Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts can facilitate two different electrochemical reactions with conflicting characteristics. Here, a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is reported featuring a &#8220;core&#8211;shell structure&#8221; in which N&#8208;doped graphene sheets wrap around vanadium molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles. Single Mo atoms are released from the particle core during synthesis and anchored to electronegative N&#8208;dopant species in the graphitic shell. The resultant Mo single&#8208;atom catalysts excel as active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites in pyrrolic&#8208;N and as active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites in pyridinic&#8208;N environments. ZABs with such bifunctional and multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Flexible ZABs that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 80&#160;&#176;C) under severe mechanical deformation are also demonstrated

         <title>Photostable Cascade&#8208;Activatable Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly on a Cancer Cell Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Identification of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system can construct a polypeptide&#8208;based nanofiber structure in situ on a cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term stable imaging of bladder cancer. The targeted peptide can specifically react with the reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) to form TRAP, which exhibits enhanced hydrophobicity simultaneously aggregating into nanofibers. The nanofibers can achieve accurate tumor recognition and enable high&#8208;performance stable imaging, retaining the high signal/noise ratio.








Abstract
Missed or residual tumor burden results in high risk for bladder cancer relapse. However, existing fluorescent probes cannot meet the clinical needs because of inevitable photobleaching properties. Performance can be improved by maintaining intensive and sustained fluorescence signals via resistance to intraoperative saline flushing and intrinsic fluorescent decay, providing surgeons with sufficiently clear and high&#8208;contrast surgical fields, avoiding residual tumors or missed diagnosis. This study designs and synthesizes a photostable cascade&#8208;activatable peptide, a target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system, which can construct polypeptide&#8208;based nanofibers in situ on the cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term and stable imaging of bladder cancer. The probe has two parts: a target peptide (TP) targets CD44v6 to recognize bladder cancer cells, and a reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) is introduced, which effectively reacts with the TP via a click reaction to enhance the hydrophobicity of the whole molecule, assembling into nanofibers and further nanonetworks. Accordingly, probe retention on the cell membrane is prolonged, and photostability is significantly improved. Finally, the TRAP system is successfully employed in the high&#8208;performance identification of human bladder cancer in ex vivo bladder tumor tissues. This cascade&#8208;activatable peptide molecular probe based on the TRAP system enables efficient and stable imaging of bladder cancer.

         <title>Delocalized Electronic Engineering of Ni5P4 Nanoroses for Durable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen heteroatoms are introduced to effectively induce electron delocalization and construction of strong electronegative centers of nickel phosphide, significantly decreasing the energy barrier for efficient oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and issues associated with the parasitic reactions of cathodes are major obstacles to the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs), despite their large theoretical energy density. Therefore, efficient electrocatalyst design is critical for optimizing their performance. Ni5P4 is analyzed theoretically as a cathode material, and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center is found to enhance electron occupation in antibonding orbits, providing a valuable descriptor for understanding and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this study, it is demonstrated that incorporating additional nitrogen atoms into Ni5P4 nanoroses regulates the electronic structure, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance in LOBs. Further spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporated nitrogen sites can effectively induce localized structure polarization, lowering the energy barrier for the production of desirable intermediates and thus enhancing battery capacity and preventing cell degradation. This approach provides a sound basis for developing advanced electrode materials with optimized electronic structures for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>Optical Enhancement of Indirect Bandgap Two&#8208;Dimensional Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Multi&#8208;Functional Optoelectronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The outstanding electrical and optical properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) make them attractive nanomaterials for optoelectronic applications, especially optical sensors. However, the optical characteristics of these materials are dependent on the number of layers. Monolayer TMDs have a direct bandgap that provides higher photoresponsivity compared to multilayer TMDs with an indirect bandgap. Nevertheless, multilayer TMDs are more appropriate for various photodetection applications due to their high carrier density, broad spectral response from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, and ease of large&#8208;scale synthesis. Therefore, this review focuses on the modification of the optical properties of devices based on indirect bandgap TMDs and their emerging applications. Several successful developments in optical devices are examined, including band structure engineering, device structure optimization, and heterostructures. Furthermore, it introduces cutting&#8208;edge optical applications based on TMDs devices. Finally, future directions in the engineering of 2D TMDs for optoelectronics are discussed.

         <title>Quantitative Mapping of Chemical Defects at Charged Grain Boundaries in a Ferroelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polar discontinuities, as well as compositional and structural changes at oxide interfaces can give rise to a large variety of electronic and ionic phenomena. In contrast to earlier work focused on domain walls and epitaxial systems, here, w e investigate the potential relation between polar discontinuities and the local chemistry at grain boundaries in polycrystalline ferroelectric ErMnO3. Using orientation mapping and different scanning probe microscopy techniques, w e demonstrate that the polycrystalline material develops charged grain boundaries with enhanced electronic conductance. By performing atom probe tomography measurements, w e find an enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at all grain boundaries. The observed compositional changes translate into a charge that exceeds possible polarization&#8208;driven effects, demonstrating that structural phenomena rather than electrostatics determine the local chemical composition and related changes in the electronic transport behavior. The study shows that the charged grain boundaries behave distinctly different from charged domain walls, giving additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Bioelectronic Portable Array for Early&#8208;Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A cohort of 47 patients is screened for pancreatic cancer&#8208;precursors with a portable 96&#8208;well bioelectronic sensing&#8208;array for single&#8208;molecule assay in cysts fluid and blood plasma deployable at point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC). Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRASmut DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array here proposed, based on the SiMoT (Single&#8208;Molecule&#8208;with&#8208;a&#8208;large&#8208;Transistor) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single&#8208;molecule Limit&#8208;Of&#8208;Identification, LOI (&lt;1% of false&#8208;positives and false&#8208;negatives). It comprises an ELISA&#8208;like 8&#215;12&#8208;array organic&#8208;electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si&#8208;IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB&#8208;connected smart device.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 47 patients is screened for pancreatic cancer-precursors with a portable 96-well bioelectronic sensing-array for single-molecule assay in cysts fluid and blood plasma deployable at point-of-care (POC). Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state-of-the-art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRAS&lt;sup&gt;mut&lt;/sup&gt; DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array here proposed, based on the SiMoT (Single-Molecule-with-a-large-Transistor) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single-molecule Limit-Of-Identification, LOI (&amp;lt;1% of false-positives and false-negatives). It comprises an ELISA-like 8&#215;12-array organic-electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte-gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si-IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB-connected smart device. The cartridge is complemented by a 3D-printed sensing gate cover plate. KRAS&lt;sup&gt;mut&lt;/sup&gt;, MUC1, and CD55 biomarkers either in plasma or cysts-fluid from 5&#8211;6 patients at a time, are multiplexed at single-molecule LOI in 1.5 hours. The pancreatic cancer precursors are classified via a machine-learning analysis resulting in at least 96% diagnostic-sensitivity and 100% diagnostic-specificity. This preliminary study opens the way to POC liquid-biopsy-based early diagnosis of pancreatic-cancer precursors in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>AI&#8208;driven Discovery of Amorphous Fluorinated Polymer Electret with Improved Charge Stability for Energy Harvesting</title>

Abstract
Electret materials are promising dielectric materials with trapped charges for various applications such as vibration energy harvesters and acoustic transducers. In the present work, we discovered ionization potential as the descriptor to quantify the charging performance for amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using this descriptor, high&#8208;throughput computations, and graph neural network models, we screened 1,176,591 functional groups on the cyclic transparent optical polymers (CYTOP) and identified 3 promising electrets. The electrets were synthesized experimentally as 15&#8208;&#956;m&#8208;thick films. The films were able to keep their both bipolar surface potentials above &#177;3.1&#160;kV for over 1500 hours and are estimated to have longevity of 146 years under 80&#176;C, achieving significant improvements on charging stability among CYTOP&#8208;based polymer electrets. The excellent bipolar charging performance can greatly enhance power generation capacity of electret&#8208;based vibration energy harvesters. This work also demonstrates the use of deep learning as a new paradigm for accelerating practical materials discovery.

         <title>Robust and Sustainable Indium Anode Leading to Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The fast degradation of the charge&#8208;extraction interface at indium tin oxide (ITO) poses a significant obstacle to achieving long&#8208;term stability for organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, w e developed a sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules. It is revealed that the recovered indium chloride (InCl3) from indium oxide waste can be applied as an effective hole&#8208;selective interfacial layer for the ITO electrode (noted as InCl3&#8208;ITO anode) through simple aqueous fabrication, facilitating not only energy level alignment to photoactive blends, but also mitigating parasitic absorption and charge recombination losses of the corresponding OSCs. As results, OSCs and modules consisting of InCl3&#8208;ITO anodes have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.92% and 15.20% (active area of 18.73 cm2), respectively. More importantly, the InCl3&#8208;ITO anode can significantly extend the thermal stability of derived OSCs, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime of approximately 10,000 hours.

         <title>Identifying A Universal Activity Descriptor and a Unifying Mechanism Concept on Perovskite Oxides for Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Producing indispensable hydrogen and oxygen for social development via water electrolysis shows more prospects than other technologies. Although electrocatalysts have been explored for centuries, a universal activity descriptor for both hydrogen&#8208;evolving (HER) and oxygen&#8208;evolving reactions (OER) has not been developed. Moreover, a unifying concept has not been established to simultaneously understand HER/OER mechanisms. Here, we rationally bridge the relationships between HER/OER activities in three common electrolytes and over 10 representative material properties on 12 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based model oxides through statistical methodologies. Orbital charge&#8208;transfer energy (&#916;) can serve as an ideal universal descriptor, where a neither too large nor too small &#916; (&#8764;1&#160;eV) with optimal electron&#8208;cloud density around Fermi level affords the best activities, fulfilling Sabatier's principle. Systematic experiments and computations unravel that pristine oxide with &#916; &#8776; 1&#160;eV possesses metal&#8208;like high&#8208;valence configurations and active lattice&#8208;oxygen sites to help adsorb key protons in HER and induce lattice&#8208;oxygen participation in OER, respectively. After reactions, partially generated metals in HER and high&#8208;valence hydroxides in OER dominate proton adsorption and couple with pristine lattice&#8208;oxygen activation, respectively. These can be successfully rationalized by the unifying orbital charge&#8208;transfer theory. This work provides the foundation of rational material design and mechanism understanding for many potential applications.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast And Controlled Capturing, Loading, And Release of Extracellular Vesicles by A Portable Microstructured Electrochemical Fluidic Device.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all living cells and are found in many body fluids. They exert numerous physiological and pathological functions and serve as cargo shuttles. Due to their safety and inherent bioactivity, they have emerged as versatile therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. Despite the growing interest in EVs, current progress in this field is, in part, limited by relatively inefficient isolation techniques. Conventional methods are indeed slow, laborious, require specialized laboratory equipment, and may result in low yield and purity. This work describes an electrochemically controlled &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; device enabling capturing, loading, and release of EVs. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes. It rapidly isolates EVs with a high level of purity from various biofluids such as urine and serum. As a proof of principle, the device w as applied to isolate EVs from skin wounds of healthy and diabetic mice. Strikingly, it w as found that EVs from healing wounds of diabetic mice w ere enriched in mitochondrial proteins compared to those of healthy mice. Additionally, the device improved the loading protocol of EVs with polyplexes, and might therefore find applications in nucleic acid delivery. Overall, the electrochemical device could greatly facilitate the development of EV&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Organic Photodetectors with a Solution&#8208;Processed Integration Circuit toward Ubiquitous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic photodetectors, as an emerging wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology, offer exciting opportunities for next&#8208;generation photonic healthcare electronics. However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, we report an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution&#8208;processed integration circuit for health monitoring application. Through creating an ideal metal&#8208;semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, we achieve solution&#8208;printed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermionic limit. Consequently, monolithic integration of the OFET with an organic photoconductor enables the remarkable amplification of photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by more than four orders of magnitude from 5.5 to 4.6 &#215; 105, which is able to meet the demand for accurately extracting physiological information from the PPG waveforms. Our work offers an effective and versatile approach to greatly enhance the photodetector performance, promising to revolutionize health monitoring technologies.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Oxide Crystals for Device Applications: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxide crystals have garnered considerable attention because of their remarkable physical properties and potential for versatile applications. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the design, preparation, and application of ultrathin 2D oxides, providing many opportunities for new&#8208;generation advanced technologies. This review focuses on the controllable preparation of 2D oxide crystals and their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Based on their bonding nature, we first summarize the various types of 2D oxide crystals, including both layered and nonlayered crystals, as well as their current top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up synthetic approaches. Subsequently, in terms of the unique physical and electrical properties of 2D oxides, we emphasize recent advances in device applications, including photodetectors, field&#8208;effect transistors, dielectric layers, magnetic and ferroelectric devices, memories, and gas sensors. Finally, conclusions and future prospects of 2D oxide crystals are presented. We hope that this review will provide comprehensive and insightful guidance for the development of 2D oxide crystals and their device applications.

         <title>Bifacial And Semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells for Single&#8208;Junction And Tandem Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thin film solar cells, as a complement to silicon solar cells, are expected to play a significant role in the space industry, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), indoor applications and tandem solar cells, where bifaciality and semitransparency are highly desired. Sb2(S,Se)3 has emerged as a promising new photovoltaic (PV) material for its high absorption coefficient, tuneable bandgap, and non&#8208;toxic and earth&#8208;abundant constituents. However, high&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells so far exclusively employ gold back contacts or Mo&#8208;coated glass substrates, which only allows monofacial architectures, leaving a considerable gap towards large&#8208;scale application in aforementioned fields. Here, we report a bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell enabled by a fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide substrate and an indium tin oxide (ITO) back contact, and its extended application in tandem solar cells. The transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and the ultra&#8208;thin inner n&#8208;i&#8208;p structure provide high transmittance at the long wavelength region. Despite of the unfavourable Schottky junction and increased defect density at MnS/ITO interface, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.41% with only front illumination is achieved. On the other hand, though the varied carrier kinetic with rear illumination has a negative impact on the PCE, the internal ultrathin fully depleted absorber layer enables it to remain at a satisfying level at 6.36%, contributing to a great bifaciality of 0.86. As a result, our bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells can gain great enhancement in PV performance by exploiting albedo of surroundings and show exceptional capability in absorbing non&#8208;normal incident light. Moreover, our device can be integrated into a tandem solar cell with a bottom silicon solar cell owing to its adjustable bandgap. A Sb2(S,Se)3/Si tandem solar cell with PCE of 11.66% is achieved in our preliminary trial. These exciting findings imply that bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells possess tremendous potential in practical applications based on their unique characteristics.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals are developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species, release of La ions, and the activation of inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cell death and inhibit metastasis during lung cancer.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics are rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endow LCO with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibits catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroy the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LCO&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

         <title>Realization and Control of Bulk and Surface Modes in 3D Nanomagnonic Networks by Additive Manufacturing of Ferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high&#8208;density integration in information technology fuels the research on functional 3D nanodevices. Particularly ferromagnets promise multifunctional 3D devices for nonvolatile data storage, high&#8208;speed data processing and non&#8208;charge&#8208;based logic operations via spintronics and magnonics concepts. However, 3D nanofabrication of ferromagnets is extremely challenging. In this work, we&#160;report an additive manufacturing methodology and fabricate unprecedented 3D ferromagnetic nanonetworks with a woodpile&#8208;structure unit cell. We&#160;investigate their collective spin dynamics (magnons) at frequencies up to 25 GHz by Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations. A clear discrepancy of about 10 GHz is found between the bulk and surface modes which we&#160;engineer by different unit cell sizes in the Ni&#8208;based nanonetworks. The angle&#8208; and spatially&#8208;dependent modes demonstrate opportunities for multi&#8208;frequency signal processing in 3D circuits via magnons. The developed synthesis route will allow one to create 3D magnonic crystals with chiral unit cells which are a prerequisite towards surface modes with topologically protected&#160;properties.

         <title>D&#8208;orbital Electron Delocalization Realized by Axial Fe4c Atomic Clusters Delivers High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been considered as the most promising non&#8208;precious metal catalyst due to its comparable catalytic performance to Pt in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The active centers of Fe&#8208;pyrrolic N4 have been proven to be extremely active for ORR. However, forming a stable Fe&#8208;pyrrolic N4 structure is a huge challenge. Here, a Cyan&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with Fe&#8208;pyrrolic N4 as the intrinsic active center was constructed with the help of axial Fe4C atomic clusters, which showed a half&#8208;wave potential of up to 0.836&#160;V (Vs RHE) in the acid environment. More remarkably, it delivers a high power density of 870&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and 478&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 1.0&#160;bar in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;Air full cells respectively. According to theoretical calculation and in&#8208;situ spectroscopy, the axial Fe4C can provide strong electronic perturbation to Fe&#8208;N4 active centers, leading to the d&#8208;orbital electron delocalization of Fe and forming the Fe&#8208;pyrrolic N4 bond with high charge distribution, which stabilizes the Fe&#8208;pyrrolic N4 structure and optimizes the OH* adsorption during the catalytic process. This work proposes a new strategy to adjust the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom catalysts based on the strong interaction between single atoms and atomic clusters.

         <title>Reinforcing Hydrogel by Nonsolvent&#8208;Quenching Facilitated In&#8208;Situ Nanofibrosis</title>

Abstract
Nanofibrous hydrogels are pervasive in load&#8208;bearing soft tissues, which are believed to be key to their extraordinary mechanical properties. Enlighted by this phenomenon, a novel reinforcing strategy for polymeric hydrogels is proposed, where polymer segments in the hydrogels are induced to form nanofibers in&#8208;situ by bolstering their controllable aggregation on the nanoscale level. Polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels are chosen to demonstrate the virtue of this strategy. A nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step is introduced into the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogel preparation approach, which readily promotes the formation of nanofibrous hydrogels in the following solvent&#8208;tempering process. The resultant nanofibrous hydrogels demonstrate significantly improved mechanical properties and swelling resistance, compared to the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogels with identical compositions. This work validates the hypothesis that bundling polymer chains to form nanofibers can lead to nanofibrous hydrogels with remarkably enhanced mechanical performances, which may open a new horizon for single&#8208;component hydrogel reinforcement.

         <title>Molecular Additive&#8208;Assisted Tellurium Homogenization in ZnSeTe Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The addition of aqueous hydrohalic acids (HX, X = F, Cl, Br) during the synthesis of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is now widely employed to achieve high&#8208;quality QDs. However, this reliance on the use of aqueous solutions is incompatible with oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;sensitive precursors such as those used in the synthesis of Te&#8208;alloyed ZnSe QDs. Herein, we show this incompatibility, leads to phase segregation into Te&#8208;rich and Te&#8208;poor regions, causing spectral broadening and luminescence peak shifting under high laser irradiation and applied electrical bias. Here we report a synthetic strategy to produce anhydrous&#8208;HF in&#8208;situ by using benzenecarbonyl fluoride (BF) as a chemical additive. Through in&#8208;situ 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we find that BF reacts with surfactants in tandem, ultimately producing intermediary F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;trioctylamine adducts. These act as a pseudo&#8208;HF source that releases anhydrous HF. The controlled release of HF during the nucleation and growth steps homogenizes the Te distribution in the ZnSeTe lattice, leading to spectrally&#8208;stable blue&#8208;emitting QDs under increasing laser flux from &#8764;3 &#956;W to &#8764;12&#160;mW and applied bias from 2.6 to 10&#160;V. Single&#8208;dot photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and analyses of the absorption, PL and transient absorption spectra together with density functional theory point to the role of anhydrous HF as a Te homogenizer.

         <title>Calcitic Prisms of The Giant Seashell Pinna Nobilis Form Light Guide Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The shells of the Pinnidae family are based on a double layer of single&#8208;crystal&#8208;like calcitic prisms and inner aragonitic nacre, a structure known for its outstanding mechanical performance. However, on the posterior side, shells are missing the nacreous layer, which raises the question of whether there could&#160;be any functional role in giving up this mechanical performance. Here, we&#160;demonstrate that the prismatic part of the Pinna nobilis shell exhibits unusual optical properties, whereby each prism acts as an individual optical fiber guiding the ambient light to the inner shell cavity by total internal reflection. This pixelated light channeling enhances both spatial resolution and contrast while reducing angular blurring, an apt combination for acute tracking of a moving object. Our&#160;findings offer insights into the evolutionary aspects of light&#8208;sensing and imaging and demonstrate how an architectured optical system for efficient light&#8208;tracking can be based on birefringent ceramics.

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Hydrogels with Electrotunable Permeability And Uniaxial Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. However, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels still suffer from limited actuation control. Direct electronic control of electronically conductive hydrogels could solve this challenge and allow direct integration with modern electronic systems. W e demonstrate an electrochemically controlled nanowire composite hydrogel with high in&#8208;plane conductivity that stimulates a uniaxial electrochemical osmotic expansion. This materials system allows precisely controlled shape&#8208;morphing at only &#8208;1&#160;V, where capacitive charging of the hydrogel bulk leads to a large uniaxial expansion of up to 300%, caused by the ingress of &#8764;700 water molecules per electron&#8208;ion pair. The material retains its state when turned off, which is ideal for electrotunable membranes as the inherent coupling between the expansion and mesoporosity enables electronic control of permeability for adaptive separation, fractionation, and distribution. Used as electrochemical osmotic hydrogel actuators, they achieve an electroactive pressure of up to 0.7&#160;MPa (1.4&#160;MPa versus dry) and a work density of &#8764;150&#160;kJ m&#8211;3 (2&#160;MJ m&#8211;3&#160;versus dry). This new materials system paves the way to integrate actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation into advanced soft intelligent systems.

         <title>A UV&#8208;Resistant Heterogeneous Wettability Patterned Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Preparing UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability patterns is critical for the practical application of surfaces with heterogeneous wettability. However, combining UV&#8208;resistant superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials on heterogeneous surfaces is challenging. Inspired by the structure of cell membranes, a UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability&#8208;patterned surface (UPS) is designed via laser ablation of the coating of multilayer structures. UV&#8208;resistant superhydrophobic silica patterns can be created in situ on surfaces covered with superhydrophilic TiO2 nanoparticles. The UV resistance time of the UPS with a TiO2&#8208;based surface is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with other surface molecular modification methods that require a mask. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;like structure of the UPS regulates the migration of internal siloxane chain segments in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface. The UPS enables efficient patterning of functional materials under UV irradiation, controlling the wetting behavior of liquids in open&#8208;air systems. Furthermore, its heterogeneous wettability remains stable even after 50&#160;h of intense UV irradiation (365&#160;nm, 500&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). These UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability patterned surfaces will likely be applied in microfluidics, cell culture, energy conversion, and water collection in the future.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: An Enabling Technology for Quantum Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spins are promising qudits but their weak interaction with external fields makes single&#8208;molecule readout challenging. A solution that exploits chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) in photoinduced electron transfer is envisioned in this work. Progress toward the detection of CISS at the molecular level by magnetic resonance is overviewed and it is shown how CISS could enable initialization, manipulation, and readout of molecular spins at high temperature.








Abstract
Molecular spins are promising building blocks of future quantum technologies thanks to the unparalleled flexibility provided by chemistry, which allows the design of complex structures targeted for specific applications. However, their weak interaction with external stimuli makes it difficult to access their state at the single&#8208;molecule level, a fundamental tool for their use, for example, in quantum computing and sensing. Here, an innovative solution exploiting the interplay between chirality and magnetism using the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect on electron transfer processes is foreseen. It is envisioned to use a spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion mechanism that can be realized by connecting a molecular spin qubit to a dyad where an electron donor and an electron acceptor are linked by a chiral bridge. By numerical simulations based on realistic parameters, it is shown that the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect could enable initialization, manipulation, and single&#8208;spin readout of molecular qubits and qudits even at relatively high temperatures.

         <title>Polarization Switching and Correlated Phase Transitions in Fluorite&#8208;Structure ZrO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) enables visualization of oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among multiple metastable phases in ZrO2 nanocrystals. Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among O/M/T phases.








Abstract
Unconventional ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structure oxides enables tremendous opportunities in nanoelectronics owing to their superior scalability and silicon compatibility. However, their polarization order and switching process remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions in nanocrystalline films. In this work, the oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions are directly captured among multiple metastable phases in freestanding ZrO2 thin films by low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM). Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with Zr&#8211;O displacement in reversible martensitic transformation between monoclinic and orthorhombic phases and two&#8208;step tetrahedral&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition. These findings provide atomic insights into the transition pathways between metastable polymorphs and unravel the evolution of polarization orders in (anti)ferroelectric fluorite oxides.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Dermal Fibroblasts Attenuate Inflammation in a Murine Model of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs) derived from adult dermal fibroblasts show enhanced intrapulmonary targeting and retention and can effectively deliver therapeutic cargo to the inflamed lung to reduce inflammation, mediate tissue repair, and drive metabolic changes that favor further activation of anti&#8208;inflammatory pathways. These eEVs could potentially represent a powerful tool for the treatment of acute lung injury.








Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant burden to the healthcare system, with &#8776;200&#160;000 cases diagnosed annually in the USA. ARDS patients suffer from severe refractory hypoxemia, alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired surfactant function, and abnormal upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospitalization, and increased disability&#8208;adjusted life years. Currently, there is no cure or FDA&#8208;approved therapy for ARDS. This work describes the implementation of engineered extracellular vesicle (eEV)&#8208;based nanocarriers for targeted nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory payloads to the inflamed/injured lung. The results show the ability of surfactant protein A (SPA)&#8208;functionalized IL&#8208;4&#8208; and IL&#8208;10&#8208;loaded eEVs to promote intrapulmonary retention and reduce inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. Significant attenuation is observed in tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, macrophage activation, influx of protein&#8208;rich fluid, and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space as early as 6 h post&#8208;eEVs treatment. Additionally, metabolomics analyses show that eEV treatment causes significant changes in the metabolic profile of inflamed lungs, driving the secretion of key anti&#8208;inflammatory metabolites. Altogether, these results establish the potential of eEVs derived from dermal fibroblasts to reduce inflammation, tissue damage, and the prevalence/progression of injury during ARDS via nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes/transcripts.

         <title>Bioinspired Processing: Complex Coacervates as Versatile Inks for 3D Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printable complex coacervate biomaterial inks composed of hyaluronic acid and chitosan are developed. Fine&#8208;tuning of the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the polymers results in inks that are printable both in air and in water without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Produced cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability.








Abstract
3D bioprinting is a powerful fabrication technique in biomedical engineering, which is currently limited by the number of available materials that meet all physicochemical and cytocompatibility requirements for biomaterial inks. Inspired by the key role of coacervation in the extrusion and spinning of many natural materials, hyaluronic acid&#8211;chitosan complex coacervates are proposed here as tunable biomaterial inks. Complex coacervates are obtained through an associative liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation driven by electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged macromolecules. They offer bioactive properties and facile modulation of their mechanical properties through mild physicochemical changes in the environment, making them attractive for 3D bioprinting. Fine&#8208;tuning the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the constituent polymers results in biomaterial inks that are printable in air and water. The biomaterial ink, initially a viscoelastic fluid, transitions into a viscoelastic solid upon printing due to dehydration (for printing in air) or due to a change in pH and ionic composition (for printing in solution). Consequently, scaffolds printed using the complex coacervate inks are stable without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Fabricated cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability. These results pave the way to a new class of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle tunable biomaterials for biofabrication.

         <title>Flame Aerosol Synthesis of Metal Sulfides at High Temperature in Oxygen&#8208;Lean Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, the preparation of various metal sulfides in a flame process using single&#8208;droplet combustion and enclosed flame spray pyrolysis in O2&#8208;lean condition is demonstrated. Using a large&#8208;tube reactor MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are formed at a rate of 5 g h&#8722;1. The flame aerosol process is a key toward scalable synthesis of binary/ternary metal sulfides for next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
The development of a novel reactive spray technology based on the well&#8208;known gas&#8208;phase metal oxide synthesis route provides innumerable opportunities for the production of non&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. Among these materials, metal sulfides are expected to have a high impact, especially in the development of electrochemical and photochemical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area materials. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are synthesized in an O2&#8208;lean and sulfur&#8208;rich environment. In addition, the formation of Cu2S in a single&#8208;droplet combustion experiment is reported. The multiscale approach combining flame sprays with single&#8208;droplet combustion is expected to pave the way toward a fundamental understanding of the gas&#8208;phase formation of metal sulfides in the future. The knowledge acquired can open the possibility for the development of a next&#8208;generation gas&#8208;phase technology facilitating the scalable synthesis of functional binary/ternary metal sulfides.

         <title>Stabilization of FAPbI3 with Multifunctional Alkali&#8208;Functionalized Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution is reported. Rubidium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) (Rb&#8208;PAA) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% with enhanced operational stability.









Abstract
The defects located at the interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Manipulating the perovskite crystallization process and tailoring the interfaces with molecular passivators are the main effective strategies to mitigate performance loss and instability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution. The synergic effects of the alkali cations and poly(acrylic acid) anion effectively passivate the defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite films. As a result, the rubidium (Rb)&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% and reduces the risk of lead ion (Pb2+) leakage continuously&#160;via the strong interaction between C&#63742;O bonds and Pb2+. In addition, the unencapsulated device shows enhanced operational stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h operation at maximum power point under one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Interstitial Segregation has the Potential to Mitigate Liquid Metal Embrittlement in Iron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;resolution probing techniques reveal the formation of a nanoscale segregation pattern of zinc in a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic iron grain boundary (GB) decorated by boron and carbon. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon hinder zinc segregation and compensate for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion.








Abstract
The embrittlement of metallic alloys by liquid metals leads to catastrophic material failure and severely impacts their structural integrity. The weakening of grain boundaries (GBs) by the ingress of liquid metal and preceding segregation in the solid are thought to promote early fracture. However, the potential of balancing between the segregation of cohesion&#8208;enhancing interstitial solutes and embrittling elements inducing GB de&#8208;cohesion is not understood. Here, the mechanisms of how boron segregation mitigates the detrimental effects of the prime embrittler, zinc, in a &#931;5&#8201;[001] tilt GB in &#945;&#8208;Fe (4 at.% Al) is unveiled. Zinc forms nanoscale segregation patterns inducing structurally and compositionally complex GB states. Ab initio simulations reveal that boron hinders zinc segregation and compensates for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion. The work sheds new light on how interstitial solutes intimately modify GBs, thereby opening pathways to use them as dopants for preventing disastrous material failure.

         <title>Understanding the Interfacial Reactions and Band Alignment for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Built on Metal Substrates with Reduced Upscaling Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new understanding and architecture enabling efficient and stable perovskite solar cells built on metal substrates is presented. The efficiency and fill&#8208;factor losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for upscaling and module design.








Abstract
Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) built on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass face a fundamental challenge to retain fill factor (FF) for large&#8208;area upscaling due to series resistance loss. Building a perovskite solar cell on metal has the potential to reduce this FF loss and is promising for flexible applications. However, their efficiency and stability lag far behind their TCO counterparts. Herein, findings on the complex chemical reactions and degradation&#8208;promoting processes at different perovskite/metal (Cu, Au, Ag, and Mo) interfaces, which are closely linked with the inherent stability; and the interlayer engineering for perovskite/metal interface's band alignment, which plays an essential role in achieving high efficiency, are reported. Leveraging these findings, 21% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved for 1 cm2 perovskite solar cells using a p&#8211;i&#8211;n top&#8208;illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC upscaling and module design.

         <title>Ultralong Carrier Lifetime Exceeding 20 &#181;s in Lead Halide Perovskite Film Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the electronic structure with ThFABr, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m is achieved in 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite films. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices yielding a champion efficiency of 24.69% and a high VOC of 1.21&#160;V, coupled with significantly improved operational stability.








Abstract
The carrier lifetime is one of the key parameters for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to achieve long carrier lifetimes in perovskite films that are comparable with perovskite crystals owning to the large trap density resulting from the unavoidable defects in grain boundaries and surfaces. Here, by regulating the electronic structure with the developed 2&#8208;thiopheneformamidinium bromide (ThFABr) combined with the unique film structure of 2D perovskite layer caped 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite film, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m are achieved. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices to yield a champion efficiency of 24.69% with a minimum VOC loss of 0.33&#160;V. The unencapsulated device retains &#8776;95% of its initial efficiency after 1180&#160;h by max power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light illumination. This work provides important implications for structured 2D/(2D/3D) perovskite films combined with unique FA&#8208;based spacers to achieve ultralong carrier lifetime for high&#8208;performance PSCs and other optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Inhibition of Tumor Metastasis by Liquid&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Shocked Tumor Cells with Oncolytic Viruses Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling oncolytic virus delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The virus can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells; then, the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery.








Abstract
Despite the superior tumor lytic efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs), their systemic delivery still faces the challenges of limited circulating periods, poor tumor tropism, and spontaneous antiviral immune responses. Herein, a virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling OVs&#8216; delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The OVs can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells. Then the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery for more than 110&#8208;fold virus enrichment in the tumor metastasis. In addition, this strategy can serve as a tumor vaccine and initiate endogenous adaptive antitumor effects through increasing the memory T cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, including reducing the M2 macrophage, downregulating Treg cells, and priming T cells.

In addition, this strategy can serve as a tumor vaccine and initiate endogenous adaptive antitumor effects through increasing the memory T cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, including reducing the M2 macrophage, downregulating Treg cells, and priming T cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Accelerated Prodrug Reduction of Pt(IV)&#8208;Incorporating Pseudo Semiconducting Polymers for Robust Degradation and Maximized Photothermal/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

NIR&#8208;II light accelerated prodrug reduction of Pt(IV) nanoparticles is studied&#160;by co&#8208;assembling a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer with Oxa(IV) in the polymer main chain for NIR&#8208;II light phototriggered effective photothermal therapy and synergistic photoactivated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Selective activation of Pt(IV) prodrugs within tumors is particularly attractive because of their low damage to normal tissues. However, current common activation via chemical/photoreduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs into Pt(II) counterparts is limited by undesirable spatial&#8211;temporal control over this reduction process and the ineffective tissue penetration depth of undesirable light. Here, a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer is designed via Stille polymerization, resulting in PSP&#8208;Pt with a Pt(IV) prodrug of oxaliplatin (Oxa(IV)) in the polymer main chain that can be activated by NIR&#8208;II light. PSP&#8208;Pt can co&#8208;assemble with a commercially available lipid polymer, namely mPEG2k&#8208;DSPE, into NPPSP&#8208;Pt. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NPPSP&#8208;Pt can be photoactivated to accelerate the Pt(IV) reduction to release oxaliplatin, thereby killing the cancer cells by photothermal effect and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy inside a mouse model with CT26 colon cancer. This work reports the application of NIR&#8208;II light for accelerating Pt(IV) reduction for cancer tumor therapy.

         <title>Giant Spin&#8208;Valve Effect in Planar Spin Devices Using an Artificially Implemented Nanolength Mott&#8208;Insulator Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely large magnetoresistance ratio is demonstrated in oxide&#8208;based lateral spin&#8208;valve devices, where a nonmagnetic nanochannel is made by implementing the metal&#8211;insulator transition in a nanoscale region of a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin layer with Ar ion irradiation. The current is successfully modulated by applying the gate voltage. These are promising results for realizing oxide&#8208;based spin transistors.








Abstract
Developing technology to realize oxide&#8208;based nanoscale planar integrated circuits is in high demand for next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronics. Oxide circuits can have a variety of unique functions, including ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, multiferroicity, superconductivity, and mechanical flexibility. In particular, for spin&#8208;transistor applications, the wide tunability of the physical properties due to the presence of multiple oxide phases is valuable for precise conductivity matching between the channel and ferromagnetic electrodes. This feature is essential for realistic spin&#8208;transistor operations. Here, a substantially large magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of up to &#8776;140% is demonstrated for planar&#8208;type (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO)&#8208;based spin&#8208;valve devices. This MR ratio is 10&#8211;100 times larger than the best values obtained for semiconductor&#8208;based planar devices, which have been studied over the past three decades. This structure is prepared by implementing an artificial nanolength Mott&#8208;insulator barrier region using the phase transition of metallic LSMO. The barrier height of the Mott&#8208;insulator region is only 55 meV, which enables the large MR ratio. Furthermore, a successful current modulation, which is a fundamental functionality for spin transistors, is shown. These results open up a new avenue for realizing oxide planar circuits with unique functionalities that conventional semiconductors cannot achieve.

         <title>Halides&#8208;Enhanced Buried Interfaces for Stable and Extremely Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Deficit Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, facile, and versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides is developed for strengthening the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface, in which precise manipulation of perovskite defects and carrier dynamics has been realized by altering halide electronegativity (&#967;).








Abstract
The perovskite buried interfaces have demonstrated pivotal roles in determining both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs);&#160;however, challenges remain in understanding and managing the interfaces due to their non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, we proposed a versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides to strengthen the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface by precisely manipulating perovskite defects and carrier dynamics through alteration of halide electronegativity (&#967;), thereby resulting in both favorable perovskite crystallization and minimized interfacial carrier losses. Specifically, the implementation of fluoride with the highest &#967; induces the strongest binding affinity to uncoordinated SnO2&#160;defects and perovskite cations, leading to retarded perovskite crystallization and high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced residual stress. These improved properties enable champion efficiencies of 24.2% (the control: 20.5%) and 22.1% (the control: 18.7%) in rigid and flexible devices with extremely low voltage deficit down to 386&#160;mV, all of which are among the highest reported values for PSCs with a similar device architecture. In addition, the resulting devices exhibit marked improvements in the device longevity under various stressors of humidity (&gt;5000&#160;h), light (1000&#160;h), heat (180&#160;h), and bending test (10&#160;000&#160;times). This method provides an effective way to improve the quality of buried interfaces toward high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>A 0D Additive&#160;for Flexible All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Go Beyond 60&#160;000 Flexible Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;durability flexible all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSCs) constructed by way of a 0D/3D mixed&#8208;dimensional structure is designed. The 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive effectively prevents the expansion of cracks during the bending process and enhances the efficiency of the all&#8208;inorganic flexible PSCs. This study provides a new route for further exploration of improving the mechanical durability of flexible all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) exhibit superior thermal stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their flexibility and efficiency are still below&#8208;par for practical viability. Herein, a design using a 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive to transform tensile stress into compressive stress in the perovskite film, effectively preventing expansion of cracks for significantly improved mechanical durability, is reported. It is found that not only is improved flexibility obtained, but also the cell efficiency is increased for the all&#8208;inorganic flexible 3D CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx solar cells. The CsPbI2.81Br0.19 f&#8208;PSC retains over 97% of its initial efficiency even after 60&#160;000 flexing cycles at a curvature radius of 5&#160;mm (R = 5&#160;mm). Simultaneously, 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 enhances the crystallinity of the CsPbI2.81Br0.19 film and passivates the defects along the grain boundaries, effectively improving the photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs. The highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency obtained is 14.25% with a short&#8208;circuit current density of 18.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.09&#160;V, and fill factor of 70.67%. This strategy paves the way for further improvement of the mechanical durability of all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs.

The highest power-conversion efficiency obtained is 14.25% with a short-circuit current density of 18.47&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, open-circuit voltage of 1.09&#160;V, and fill factor of 70.67%. This strategy paves the way for further improvement of the mechanical durability of all-inorganic f-PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Overstretch Strategy to Double the Designed Elastic Stretchability of Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overstretch strategy is proposed, which is applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to the soft substrate. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching.








Abstract
Achieving or enhancing the elastic stretchability of inorganic stretchable electronics is critically significant. However, only two types of fundamental strategies&#8212;using the prestrained elastic substrate and designing the geometric layouts&#8212;are exploited thus far. This study proposes a third strategy, an overstretch strategy, applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to a soft substrate. The theoretical, numerical, and experimental results collectively prove that the overstretch strategy can double the designed elastic stretchability of fabricated stretchable electronics and is valid for various geometrical interconnects with both thick and thin cross&#8208;sections. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching. The overstretch strategy can be easily executed and combined with the other two strategies to enhance elastic stretchability, which has profound implications for the design, fabrication, and applications of inorganic stretchable electronics.

         <title>Precise Control of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Nanolasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptional points (EPs) are employed&#160;&#160;in precisely tuning &#160; perovskite lasing actions. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a nanocavity, EPs periodically emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position: both the internal lasing actions and far&#8208;field radiation are completely reversed with a &lt;100 nm displacement. This research may find use in ultrasensitive position sensing.








Abstract
Efficient control of integrated light sources is crucial to advancing practical applications of nanophotonics. Despite the success of microlasers, their sophisticated nanostructures are not applicable in nanolasers. The situation for bottom&#8208;up&#8208;synthesized nanolasers becomes more challenging due to the constraints of fixed cavity shapes and fragile material stability. Here, the physics of exceptional points (EPs) is employed, and a strategy is demonstrated to precisely tune the lasing actions in lead halide perovskite nanorods. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a square nanocavity, it is shown that EPs regularly and controllably emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position. Consequently, both the internal lasing actions and their far&#8208;field radiation can be completely reversed with a tiny displacement of &lt;100&#160;nm. The new strategy for controlling lasing actions in nanocavities is confirmed with numerical simulations and lasing experiments. This research can also bring new avenues for ultrasensitive position sensing.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Scale Understanding of Misorientation Toughening in Corals and Seashells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coral skeletons and nacre (left and right, respectively) have distinct structures, but they share slight misorientation of adjacent crystals, as displayed in these maps where color represents crystal orientation, and as measured in the histogram (center bottom). Synthetic spherulites, center top, spontaneously self&#8208;assemble with slight misorientation of adjacent crystals.








Abstract
Biominerals are organic&#8211;mineral composites formed by living organisms. They are the hardest and toughest tissues in those organisms, are often polycrystalline, and their mesostructure (which includes nano&#8208; and microscale crystallite size, shape, arrangement, and orientation) can vary dramatically. Marine biominerals may be aragonite, vaterite, or calcite, all calcium carbonate (CaCO3) polymorphs, differing in crystal structure. Unexpectedly, diverse CaCO3 biominerals such as coral skeletons and nacre share a similar characteristic: Adjacent crystals are slightly misoriented. This observation is documented quantitatively at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales, using polarization&#8208;dependent imaging contrast mapping (PIC mapping), and the slight misorientations are consistently between 1&#176; and 40&#176;. Nanoindentation shows that both polycrystalline biominerals and abiotic synthetic spherulites are tougher than single&#8208;crystalline geologic aragonite. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bicrystals at the molecular scale reveal that aragonite, vaterite, and calcite exhibit toughness maxima when the bicrystals are misoriented by 10&#176;, 20&#176;, and 30&#176;, respectively, demonstrating that slight misorientation alone can increase fracture toughness. Slight&#8208;misorientation&#8208;toughening can be harnessed for synthesis of bioinspired materials that only require one material, are not limited to specific top&#8208;down architecture, and are easily achieved by self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules (e.g., aspirin, chocolate), polymers, metals, and ceramics well beyond biominerals.

         <title>Flexible Solution&#8208;Processable Black&#8208;Phosphorus&#8208;Based Optoelectronic Memristive Synapses for Neuromorphic Computing and Artificial Visual Perception Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cu/HfOx/solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/Pt structure is designed and fabricated on a flexible Si substrate for neuromorphic computing and artificial visual perception. The device shows advanced synaptic features like long&#8208;term memory, short term memory, short&#8208;term potentiation, and learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when illuminated by visible light. A 6 &#215; 6 optoelectronic synapse array is constructed and used to mimic the human visual perception and visual memory functions.








Abstract
Being renowned for operating with visible&#8208;light pulses and electrical signals, optoelectronic memristive synaptic devices have excellent potential for neuromorphic computing systems and artificial visual information processing. Here, a flexible back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line&#8208;compatible optoelectronic memristor based on a solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/HfOx bilayer with excellent synaptic features, toward biomimetic retinas is presented. The device shows highly stable synaptic features such as long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) and long&#8208;term depression (LTD) for repetitive 1000 epochs, having 400 conductance pulses, each. The device presents advanced synaptic features in terms of long&#8208;term memory (LTM)/short term memory (STM), as well as learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when visible light is induced on it. These advanced synaptic features can improve the information processing abilities for neuromorphic applications. Interestingly, the STM can be converted into LTM by adjusting the intensity of light and illumination time. Using the light&#8208;induced characteristics of the device, a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6 synaptic array is developed to exhibit possible use in artificial visual perception. Moreover, the devices are flexed using a silicon back&#8208;etching process. The resulting flexible devices demonstrate stable synaptic features when bent down to 1&#160;cm radius. These multifunctional features in a single memristive cell make it highly suitable for optoelectronic memory storage, neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual perception applications.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotides Selectively Enter Human&#8208;Derived Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria through Bacterial&#8208;Specific ATP&#8208;Binding Cassette Sugar Transporter</title>

         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenge that the current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize antisense oligonucleotides by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers, allowing specific and efficient destruction of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria.









Abstract
Current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, greatly hindering the preclinical or clinical treatment of bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize ASOs by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers. Compared with their cell&#8208;penetrating peptide counterparts, which are non&#8208;specifically engulfed by mammalian and bacterial cells, the presented therapeutics consisting of glucose polymer and antisense peptide nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified nanoparticles are selectively internalized into the human&#8208;derived multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and they display a much higher uptake rate (i.e., 51.6%). The developed strategy allows specific and efficient killing of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Its significant curative efficacy against bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis is also shown. This strategy will expand the focus of antisense technology to include bacterial cells other than mammalian cells.

         <title>Versatile Host Materials for Both D&#8211;A&#8208;Type and Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters toward Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs with Nearly 30% EQE</title>

A feasible molecular&#8208;design strategy of versatile hosts, featuring a twisted 3D&#160;structure, for both donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type and multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is proposed, which enables highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with external quantum efficiencies nearly 30%.








Abstract
Fabricating solution&#8208;processible host material for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter remains a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, two new host materials, namely 3CzAcPy and 9CzAcPy, are found to exhibit high triplet energy levels, high thermal stability, and excellent film morphology from a solution process. An in&#8208;depth analysis on the photophysical data and device performance reveals the isomeric effect of the host materials has a significant impact not only on the host properties, but also on the host&#8211;dopant interactions and thus the performance of the resulting solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. Impressively, the new hosts are proven to be suitable for both donor&#8211;acceptor type and multi&#8208;resonance TADF emitters, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance. By using the new host 9CzAcPy, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on a donor&#8211;acceptor TADF emitter of DPAC&#8208;PCN, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29.5% is achieved, and solution&#8208;processed narrowband OLED based on a multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter of BN&#8208;CP1 acquires a maximum EQE of 26.6%. These efficiencies represent the highest values among the solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. This study highlights the significance of host&#8211;dopant interactions in modulating the electroluminescence performance of TADF emitters, and provides an effective design principle for solution&#8208;processible host materials.

         <title>Photofunctional Scope of Fluorescent Dithienylethene Conjugates with Aza&#8208;Heteroaromatic Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithienylethenes are structurally integrated with heteroaromatic cations. The photoswitches in their ring&#8208;open forms show fluorescence in the visible spectral range, while the ring&#8208;closed isomers are non&#8208;fluorescent. This leads to ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching with the emission output being fine&#8208;tuned by the conjugation degree of the heteroaromatic units.








Abstract
A series of dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic cationic moieties is synthesized. The switches are characterized regarding their photochemical and photophysical properties in acetonitrile and in water. The efficiency of the switching and the photostationary state composition depend on the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic systems. Thus, DTEs with acridinium&#8208;derived moieties have very low quantum yields for the ring&#8208;closing process, which is in contrast to switches with pyridinium and quinolinium moieties. All switches emit fluorescence in their open forms. The involved electronic transitions are traced back to an integrative picture including the DTE core and the cationic arms. The emission can be fine&#8208;tuned by the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic cations, reaching the red spectral region for DTEs with acridinium moieties. On ring&#8208;closing of the DTEs the fluorescence is not observable anymore. Theoretical calculations point to rather low&#8208;lying energy levels of the highly conjugated ring&#8208;closed DTEs, which would originate near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt; 1200&#160;nm). The latter is predicted to be very weak due to the concurrent non&#8208;radiative deactivation, according to the energy&#8208;gap law. In essence, an ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching as the result of the electrocyclic ring&#8208;closing reaction is observed.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tuned Fano Resonances in All&#8208;Dielectric Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si/Ge0.90Sn0.10 core/shell metasurface is developed to harness Fano resonance in the short&#8208;wave infrared spectral range. This resonance exploits the efficient coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles, which is modulated with the incident light polarization. A refractive&#8208;index nanosensor is fabricated to detect a change of 10&#8722;2 unit with a sensitivity of 386 nm/RIU, despite the low quality factor.








Abstract
The short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) is an underexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in metasurface&#8208;based nanophotonics despite its strategic importance in sensing and imaging applications. This is mainly attributed to the lack of material systems to tailor light&#8211;matter interactions in this range. Herein, this limitation is addressed and an all&#8208;dielectric silicon&#8208;integrated metasurface enabling polarization&#8208;induced Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies is demonstrated. The platform consists of a 2D Si/Ge0.9Sn0.1 core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, it is shown that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high&#8208;index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization&#8208;modulated resonances. This tunablity is harnessed in nanosensors yielding an efficient detection of 10&#8722;2 changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium.

         <title>A Universal Microscopic Patterned Doping Method for Perovskite Enables Ultrafast, Self&#8208;Powered, Ultrasmall Perovskite Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale patterned doping is difficult for perovskite&#160;due to its solubility to the photoresist. This problem is solved by utilizing the self&#8208;doping phenomenon of perovskite. This method is successfully realized by an ultrasmall (2 &#181;m) perovskite pn junction with satisfactory photodetector performance, which sheds light on fabricating integrated perovskite device arrays.








Abstract
Novel metal halide perovskite&#160;is proven to be a promising optoelectronic material. However, fabricating microscopic perovskite devices is still challenging because the perovskite is soluble with the photoresist, which conflicts with conventional microfabrication technology. The size of presently reported perovskite devices is about 50&#160;&#181;m.

&lt;p&gt;Microscale patterned doping is difficult for perovskite&#160;due to its solubility to the photoresist. This problem is solved by utilizing the self-doping phenomenon of perovskite. This method is successfully realized by an ultrasmall (2 &#181;m) perovskite pn junction with satisfactory photodetector performance, which sheds light on fabricating integrated perovskite device arrays.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel metal halide perovskite&#160;is proven to be a promising optoelectronic material. However, fabricating microscopic perovskite devices is still challenging because the perovskite is soluble with the photoresist, which conflicts with conventional microfabrication technology. The size of presently reported perovskite devices is about 50&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the large size of perovskite optoelectronic devices, they cannot be readily adopted in the fields of imaging, display, etc. Herein a universal microscopic patterned doping method is proposed, which can realize microscale perovskite devices. Rather than by the conventional doping method, in this study the local Fermi level of perovskite is modulated by the redistributing intrinsic ion defects via a polling voltage. A satisfactorily stable polarized ion distribution can be achieved by optimization of the perovskite material and polling voltage, resulting in ultrafast (40 &#181;s), self-powered microscale (2&#160;&#181;m) photodiodes.

         <title>Li&#8208;Ion Transfer Mechanism of Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Sole Fluoroethylene Carbonate Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte is in situ solidified with fluoroethylene carbonate and ester monomers to investigate the Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism. Therein, an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer between the solvent and the polymer matrix is formed. With lower ion&#8208;diffusion barrier, the electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; is expected as a novel ion&#8208;transfer path, facilitating Li&#8208;ion migration.








Abstract
Although gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represent a promising candidate to address the individual limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes, their extensive development is still hindered due to the veiled Li&#8208;ion conduction mechanism. Herein, the related mechanism in GPEs is extensively studied by developing an in situ polymerized GPE comprising fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) solvent and carbonate ester segments (F&#8208;GPE). Practically, although with high dielectric constant, FEC fails to effectively transport Li ions when acting as the sole solvent. By sharp contrast, F&#8208;GPE demonstrates superior electrochemical performances, and the related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and 7Li/6Li solid&#8208;state nNMR spectroscopy. The polymer segments are extended with the swelling of FEC, then an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer is generated between abundant electron&#8208;rich groups of FEC and the polymer ingredients, which works as an electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and facilitates the rapid transfer of Li ions by lowering the diffusion barrier dramatically, resulting in a high conductivity of 2.47&#160;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a small polarization of about 20&#160;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 8000&#160;h. Remarkably, FEC provides high flame&#8208;retardancy and makes F&#8208;GPE remains stable under ignition and puncture tests.

         <title>A Highly Robust Amphibious Soft Robot with Imperceptibility Based on a Water&#8208;Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely engineering the molecular structure and introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interaction, a soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed. With this electrode material, a 50&#8208;time DEA lifetime and excellent underwater stability are achieved. Based on the synthesized electrode, the first highly robust, amphibious DEA&#8208;driven soft robot with imperceptibility is demonstrated.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are widely exploited for actuating soft machines and granting soft robots with capability to operate in both underwater and on&#8208;land environments is important to make them adapt to more complex situations. Here, a DEA&#8208;driven, highly robust, amphibious imperceptible soft robot (AISR) based on an all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductive material is presented. A soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed by introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interactions to provide underwater stability as well as efficient suppression of ion penetration. By tuning molecular structures of the material, a 50&#8208;time device lifetime increase compared with unmodified [EMI][TFSI]&#8208;based devices and excellent underwater actuating performance is achieved. With the synthesized ionic electrode, the DEA&#8208;driven soft robot exhibits amphibious functionality to traverse hydro&#8208;terrestrial regions. When encountering damage, the robot shows good resilience and can self&#8208;heal underwater and it also exhibits imperceptibility to light, sound, and heat.

         <title>(111)&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Films by Antisolvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent engineering is proposed to realize high&#8208;quality dominantly oriented perovskite film by the antisolvent of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to the direct crystallization of (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature, sidestepping the intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Solar cells based on (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 demonstrate improved performance compared to the randomly oriented perovskite films treated by other antisolvents.








Abstract
Fabricating perovskite films with a dominant crystal orientation is an effective path to realizing quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal perovskite film, which can eliminate the fluctuation of the electrical properties in films arising from grain&#8208;to&#8208;grain variations, and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite (FAPbI3) films based on one&#8208;step antisolvent methods usually suffer from chaotic orientations due to the inevitable intermediate phase conversion from intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Here, a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with (111) preferred orientation ((111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) using a short&#8208;chain isomeric alcohol antisolvent, isopropanol (IPA) or isobutanol (IBA), is reported. The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to a corner&#8208;sharing structure instead of an edge&#8208;sharing PbI2 octahedron, sidestepping the formation of these intermediates. With the volatilization of IPA, FA+ can replace IPA in situ to form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 along the (111) direction. Compared to randomly orientated perovskites, the dominantly (111) orientated perovskite ((111)&#8208;perovskite) exhibits improved carrier mobility, uniform surface potential, suppressed film defects and enhanced photostability. PSCs based on the (111)&#8208;perovskite films show 22% power conversion efficiency and excellent stability, which remains unchanged after 600&#160;h continuous working at maximum power point, and 95% after 2000&#160;h of storage in atmosphere environment.

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Multilobe Microparticles from Microfluidics for Intestinal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peony&#8208;pollen&#8208;inspired multilobe microparticles are designed for target surface adhesion and durable drug release via microfluidic electrospray technology and hydrogel selective degradation. By loading dexamethasone inside, these microparticles show excellent adhesion ability and anti&#8208;inflammatory property in treating rats with inflammatory bowel disease.








Abstract
Microparticles (MPs)&#8208;based delivery systems have a demonstrated value in gastrointestinal administration. Research in this area is focusing on the development of multifunctional MPs to improve delivery effects. Herein, learning from the natural morphology of peony pollens, novel multilobe MPs delivery systems for target surface adhesion and durable drug release are pesented. Ascribing to the flexibility of microfluidic technology and the combination of selective hydrogel degradation methods, MPs with a series of multilobe structures can be obtained using alginate and methacrylated gelatin. Compared with spherical MPs, these multilobe MPs are elucidated to show excellent adhesion capacity due to their enhanced contact area. By encapsulating anti&#8208;inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DXM) into their matrix hydrogel, the resultant multilobe MPs delivery systems are verified to feature durable drug&#8208;release property and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy, which is further demonstrated in rats with inflammatory bowel disease.

&lt;p&gt;Peony-pollen-inspired multilobe microparticles are designed for target surface adhesion and durable drug release via microfluidic electrospray technology and hydrogel selective degradation. By loading dexamethasone inside, these microparticles show excellent adhesion ability and anti-inflammatory property in treating rats with inflammatory bowel disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microparticles (MPs)-based delivery systems have a demonstrated value in gastrointestinal administration. Research in this area is focusing on the development of multifunctional MPs to improve delivery effects. Herein, learning from the natural morphology of peony pollens, novel multilobe MPs delivery systems for target surface adhesion and durable drug release are pesented. Ascribing to the flexibility of microfluidic technology and the combination of selective hydrogel degradation methods, MPs with a series of multilobe structures can be obtained using alginate and methacrylated gelatin. Compared with spherical MPs, these multilobe MPs are elucidated to show excellent adhesion capacity due to their enhanced contact area. By encapsulating anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DXM) into their matrix hydrogel, the resultant multilobe MPs delivery systems are verified to feature durable drug-release property and anti-inflammatory efficacy, which is further demonstrated in rats with inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicated that the biomimetic multilobe MPs are potentially ideal adhesive and durable drug-delivery vehicles for gastrointestinal drug administrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectrochemical Imaging of Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral tissue imaging method is developed to advance quantitative functional biomolecule mapping in brain tissue sections. Probing nanoscale tissue volumes via metasurface&#8208;localized strong electromagnetic fields, this imaging modality isolates the molecular composition information from the bulk physical properties of the tissue sections. The approach increases the sensitivity and selectivity of molecular fingerprint retrieval enhancing the chemical image contrast and enabling detection of ultrathin tissue regions.









Abstract
Label&#8208;free and nondestructive mid&#8208;infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging is an essential tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid&#8208;infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface&#8208;localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large&#8208;area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization&#8208;multiplexed multi&#8208;resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non&#8208;specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging. While this work uses murine brain tissue sections, the&#160;chemical imaging method is well&#8208;suited for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research and clinical histopathology.

         <title>Reversing Acute Kidney Injury through Coordinated Interplay of Anti&#8208;Inflammation and Iron Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasmall nicotinamide&#8208;mononucleotide&#8208;modified Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@NMN) nanoprobe with renal targeting ability has been constructed for reversing AKI through instant release of NMN and slow degradation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The upregulation of the erythropoietin level as well as the iron level in bone marrow is demonstrated to promote the generation of red blood cells, which plays a key role in accelerating renal recovery.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia reperfusion is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can enhance the mitochondrial function and restrain the following inflammation, but it is hardly delivered and lacks renal targeting ability. To address these problems, herein, an ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticle is used as a carrier to deliver nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. An outstanding sophistication of the current design is that once NMN is attached on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles through its phosphate group, the remaining part is structurally highly similar to nicotinamide riboside, which provides an opportunity to deliver the NAD+ precursor into renal cells through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 on the cell membrane. It is demonstrated that NMN&#8208;loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively reverse AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion. In&#8208;depth studies indicate that a well&#8208;timed iron replenishment following anti&#8208;inflammation treatment plays a determined role in recovering AKI, which distinguishes the current study from previous strategies centering on anti&#8208;ROS (reactive oxygen species), anti&#8208;inflammation, or even iron elimination.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Enriched Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocages Enable Highly Efficient Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocages with a controlled oxygen electronic state around the designed carbon defects are fabricated through a hard template strategy for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The electron density around the unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. The optimum HPC nanocages with lowest defective degree show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the CER.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts are crucial for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to reduce the usage of noble metals and industrial cost. However, the corresponding catalytic activity of high overpotential and low durability hinders their wide application. Here, a hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocage with a controlled oxygen electronic state around designed carbon defects for CER activity is reported. Alkali etching can bring defects in zeolite with a hollow structure. In a hard template strategy, the type of carbon defects is directly related to etching degree of the zeolite template. More importantly, the oxygen atoms can be &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from the zeolite framework by the defective carbon. The electron density around unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon compared with that on large defects which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized HPC nanocages with minor defects show excellent electrocatalytic performance for CER with a low overpotential of 94&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with good stability, which is superior to the commercial precious metal catalyst of dimensionally stable anode (DSA), and the best in the reported carbon materials. The designed carbon materials provide an option for metal&#8208;free industrial catalysts with significant CER activities.

         <title>Universal Renaissance Strategy of Metal Fluoride in Secondary Ion Batteries Enabled by Liquid Metal Gallium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic limitations of metal fluorides can be solved by simply introducing GaF3. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated liquid Ga provides highly conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure activates Li&#63743;F splitting. The lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 can be significantly increased by 87%, while the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity of FeF3 can be increased by 33%.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state alkali ion batteries represent a future trend in battery technology, as well as provide an opportunity for low&#8208;cost metal fluoride electrode materials, if certain intrinsic problems can be resolved. In this work, a liquid metal activation strategy is proposed in which liquid Ga elements are generated in situ and doped into the LiF crystal structure by introducing a small amount of GaF3. Benefiting from these two Ga states of existence, in which the liquid metal Ga can continuously maintain conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure catalyzes Li&#63743;F splitting, the lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 significantly increases&#160;by 87%. A similar effect can be obtained in FeF3, where the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity is enhanced by 33%. This universal strategy with few restrictions can be used to realize a complete renaissance of metal fluorides, as well as offer an opportunity for the new application of liquid metals in the field of energy storage.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Entangled Network Design Toward Ultratough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic hydrogels with ultrahigh toughness and durability are prepared by mixing a hydrophobic polymer into a hydrophilic matrix. Fine crystallites stiffen the network, which can endure long&#8208;term shear. Dense chain entanglements enable large tensile deformation with low hysteresis. The resulting gels can retain both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules.








Abstract
Hydrogels find important roles in biomedicine, wearable electronics, and soft robotics, but their mechanical properties are often unsatisfactory. Conventional tough hydrogel designs are based on hydrophilic networks with sacrificial bonds, while the incorporation of hydrophobic polymers into hydrogels is less well understood. In this work, a hydrogel toughening strategy is demonstrated by introducing a hydrophobic polymer as reinforcement. Semicrystalline hydrophobic polymer chains are &#8220;woven&#8221; into a hydrophilic network via entropy&#8208;driven miscibility. In&#8208;situ&#8208;formed sub&#8208;micrometer crystallites stiffen the network, while entanglements between hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic network enable large deformation before failure. The hydrogels are stiff, tough, and durable at high swelling ratios of 6&#8211;10, and the mechanical properties are tunable. Moreover, they can effectively encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.

         <title>Sequential Co&#8208;Passivation in InAs Colloidal Quantum Dot Solids Enables Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the passivation of III&#8208;V InAs quantum dots, this work designs a sequential co&#8208;passivation ligand exchange strategy involving Z&#8208;type, InBr3, and X&#8208;type methylammonium acetate. The application of sequential co&#8208;passivation dots to near&#8208;infrared photodetectors produces photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency of 37%, which is 20% better than the current best.








Abstract
III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications, for they avoid heavy metals while achieving absorption spanning the visible to the infrared (IR). However, the covalent nature of III&#8208;V CQDs requires the development of new passivation strategies to fabricate conductive CQD solids for optoelectronics: this work shows herein that ligand exchanges, previously developed in II&#8208;VI and IV&#8208;VI quantum dots and employing a single ligand, do not fully passivate CQDs, and that this curtails device efficiency. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, this work develops a co&#8208;passivation strategy to fabricate indium arsenide CQD photodetectors, an approach that employs the combination of X&#8208;type methyl ammonium acetate (MaAc) and Z&#8208;type ligands InBr3. This approach maintains charge carrier mobility and improves passivation, seen in a 25% decrease in Stokes shift, a fourfold reduction in the rate of first&#8208;exciton absorption linewidth broadening over time&#8208;under&#8208;stress, and leads to a doubling in photoluminescence (PL) lifetime. The resulting devices show 37% external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 950&#160;nm, the highest value reported for InAs CQD photodetectors.

         <title>Achieving Tunable Organic Afterglow and UV&#8208;Irradiation&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Triphenylamine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime, tunable afterglow, and UV&#8208;irradiation response is developed by simply doping pyridine&#8208;substituted TPA derivatives into the poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer matrixes, respectively. Diversified encryption patterns are fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems in multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption technologies.








Abstract
Amorphous polymers with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly promising for various applications. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with multiple functions such as color&#8208;tunability or stimulus&#8208;response are highly desirable for multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting but are rarely reported. Herein, a facile strategy is presented to achieve a series of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and reversible response to UV irradiation by simply embedding pyridine&#8208;substituted triphenylamine derivatives into the polymer matrix poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), respectively. Notably, the pyridine group with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing and forming hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is essential for triggering ultralong RTP from the doping PVA system, among which the doping film TPA&#8208;2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4&#160;ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. By further co&#8208;doping with the commercially available fluorescent dye, multicolor afterglow is obtained via phosphorescence energy transfer. Meanwhile, the doped PMMA system exhibits reversible photoactivated ultralong RTP properties under continuous UV irradiation. Finally, potential applications of these doped PVA and PMMA systems with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and photoactivated ultralong RTP in multidimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated.

         <title>Exploring Electronic Characteristics of Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Molecules by Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through single&#8208;molecule detection, it is found that an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone acceptor units exhibits enhanced conductance compared with the control donor molecule. Furthermore, the charge transport of the D central part is directly detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule.








Abstract
The electronic characteristics of organic optoelectronic materials determine the performance of corresponding devices. Clarifying the relationship between molecular structure and electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level can help to achieve high performance for organic optoelectronic materials and devices, especially for organic photovoltaics. In this work, a typical acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule is explored by combining theoretical and experimental studies to reveal the intrinsic electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level. Specifically, the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone (INCN) acceptor units exhibits an enhanced conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions when compared with the control donor molecule, because the acceptor units of the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule contribute additional transport channels. In addition, through opening the S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O noncovalent conformational lock by protonation to expose the &#8722;S anchoring sites, the charge transport of the D central part is detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the INCN acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule. These results provide important insights into the development of high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials and devices toward practical applications.

         <title>Constructing an Interfacial Gradient Heterostructure Enables Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Printed Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial gradient heterostructure (denoted as BTA+&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx) is constructed to simultaneously tune CsPbI3 perovskite defects and interfacial energy levels. This strategy can significantly suppress nonradiative recombination in perovskites and facilitate charge transfer in a device. An efficiency of 21.31% is achieved for CsPbI3 solar cells, and a record efficiency of 16.60% is demonstrated for printed inorganic CsPbI3 minimodules.








Abstract
Severe nonradiative recombination originating from interfacial defects together with the pervasive energy level mismatch at the interface remarkably limits the performance of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These issues need to be addressed urgently for high&#8208;performance cells and their applications.

Consequently, the printed small&#8208;size cell with an efficiency of 20.28% and 12 cm2 printed CsPbI3 minimodules with a record efficiency of 16.60% are also demonstrated. Moreover, the unencapsulated CsPbI3 films and devices exhibit superior stability.

         <title>Non&#8208;Toxic CuInS2/ZnS Colloidal Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at 920 nm is reported. Notably, the synthesis employs a supplementary S precursor, hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS), which gives rise to better size homogeneity and an improvement in PLQE. Implementation of the QDs in a light&#8208;emitting device gives an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%.








Abstract
Ternary CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) with photoluminescence that is tunable from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are promising light&#8208;emitters for consumer electronics due to the absence of toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, or As. Despite the compelling performance of visible&#8208;light&#8208;emitting CuInS2 QDs, reports on NIR emission remain limited, with modest efficiencies at wavelengths beyond 900&#160;nm. In this work, the facile synthesis of NIR&#8208;emitting CuInS2/ZnS QDs is reported. A combination of two&#160;sulfur precursors w as used in the synthesis, comprising 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) and hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS). The reactive HMDS facilitates faster nucleation and leads to a higher density of emissive Cu&#8208;deficiency sites. The resulting QDs exhibit high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at a long emission wavelength of 920&#160;nm. Using these QDs, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) are fabricated, which attain an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%. This efficiency is comparable to the best reported PbS and InAs QD LEDs, and the emission wavelength exceeds that of lead iodide perovskites. This work thus marks one of the first reports of efficient NIR LEDs based on environmentally benign CuInS2 QDs and may open up promising new applications in consumer electronic products.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency of All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Long&#8208;Term Stability Enabled by Y6 as a Solid Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) as a solid additive is introduced intoPM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 can remain inside the active layer and interact with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation, and decreased trap density in the Y6&#8208;processed blend result in a high efficiency over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h.








Abstract
Morphology control greatly influences the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs); however, it remains challenging owing to their complex crystallization behavior. Herein, a small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) is introduced as a solid additive into a PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 remained inside the active layer and interacted with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation size, and decreased trap density are observed for the Y6&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. The corresponding devices showed simultaneously improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, achieving a high PCE of over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability, with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h and an extrapolated T70 lifetime of 9185&#160;h at maximum power point tracking (MPP) conditions under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This Y6&#8208;assisted strategy is successfully applied to other all&#8208;polymer blends, demonstrating its universality for all&#8208;PSCs. This work paves a new way for the fabrication of all&#8208;PSCs with high efficiency and superior long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Catalyzed Siloxane Exchange as a Robust Dynamic Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through reactive extrusion of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent processability. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers.








Abstract
Sustainable development of new technologies requires materials having advanced physical and chemical properties while maintaining reprocessability and recyclability. Vitrimers are designed for this purpose; however, their dynamic covalent chemistries often have drawbacks or are limited to specialized polymers. Here, fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is reported as an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through industrial processing of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent melt flow for processing and recycling. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers. This offers a general, scalable method for producing sustainable high&#8208;performance vitrimers and a new strategy for recycling mixed plastic wastes.

         <title>Improving the Performance of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Organic Solar Cells via Introducing a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Dopant into the Upper Acceptor Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap polymer poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the acceptor layer of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells (OSCs). Besides enhancing molecular stacking, PVK n&#8208;dopes the electron acceptor, increases the electron concentration, and improves charge transport, leading to elevated power conversion efficiency in OSCs, especially for the D18/L8&#8208;BO active layer which demonstrates device efficiency over 19% with PVK addition.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor&#8211;acceptor (D/A) interfaces, and favorable charge&#8208;transport pathways. In this work, a wide&#8208;bandgap component poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration, and improve charge transport. Such n&#8208;type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK&#8208;doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases when 2.50 wt.% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer of commonly&#8208;used high&#8208;efficiency system and a maximum value of 19.05% can be achieved. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so the results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs.

Besides enhancing molecular stacking, PVK n-dopes the electron acceptor, increases the electron concentration, and improves charge transport, leading to elevated power conversion efficiency in OSCs, especially for the D18/L8-BO active layer which demonstrates device efficiency over 19% with PVK addition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layer-by-layer (LbL) solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor&#8211;acceptor (D/A) interfaces, and favorable charge-transport pathways. In this work, a wide-bandgap component poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL-processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration, and improve charge transport. Such n-type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK-doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases when 2.50 wt.% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer of commonly-used high-efficiency system and a maximum value of 19.05% can be achieved. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so the results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL-processed OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inorganic Perovskite Surface Reconfiguration for Stable Inverted Solar Cells with 20.38% Efficiency and Its Application in Tandem Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method involves utilizing 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 20.38% for p&#8211;i&#8211;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs is obtained. Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 25.31%.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have garnered attention in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their suitable bandgap and impressive thermal stability. However, the efficiency of inverted IPSCs has been limited by the high trap density on the top surface of inorganic perovskite film. Herein, a method for fabricating efficient IPSCs by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) is developed. This modification not only exhibits the synergistic coordination of carbonyl (C=O) and amino (NH2) groups with uncoordinated Pb2+, but also the Br fills halide vacancies and suppresses the formation of Pb0, effectively passivating the defective top surface. As a result, a champion efficiency of 20.38%, the highest efficiency reported for inverted IPSCs to date is achieved. Furthermore, the successful fabrication of a p&#8211;i&#8211;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon TSCs with an efficiency of 25.31% for the first time is demonstrated. Crucially, the unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated IPSCs shows enhanced photostability, retaining 80.33% of its initial efficiency after 270&#160;h, and thermal stability (maintain 85.98% of its initial efficiency after 300&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C). The unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated TSCs also retains 92.59% of its initial efficiency after 200&#160;h under continuous illumination in ambient air.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Bipolar Photoresponse with Amplified Photocurrents in an Electrolyte&#8208;Assisted Bipolar p&#8211;n Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode based on p&#8211;n junction gallium nitride nanowires with ruthenium oxides surface decoration is built. The device exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;band optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;channel signals with encrypted property.








Abstract
The p&#8211;n junction with bipolar characteristics sets the fundamental unit to build electronics while its unique rectification behavior constrains the degree of carrier tunability for expanded functionalities. Herein, a bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode employed with a gallium nitride (GaN) p&#8211;n homojunction nanowire array that operates in electrolyte is reported, demonstrating bipolar photoresponse controlled by different wavelengths of light. Significantly, with rational decoration of a ruthenium oxides (RuOx) layer on nanowires guided by theoretical modeling, the resulting RuOx/p&#8211;n GaN photoelectrode exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively, compared to the pristine nanowires. The loading of the RuOx layer on nanowire surface optimizes surface band bending, which facilitates charge transfer across the GaN/electrolyte interface, meanwhile promoting the efficiency of redox reaction for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction which corresponds to the negative and positive photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;channel optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed with using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;band signals with encrypted property. The proposed bipolar device architecture presents a viable route to manipulate the carrier dynamics for the development of a plethora of multifunctional optoelectronic devices for future sensing, communication, and imaging systems.

A novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle patch fabricated with an advanced microfluidic template approach is presented. The microneedle platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Wound dressing patches based on stem cells have demonstrated promising potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds, while their capabilities in the maintenance of cell stemness, effective exchange of cellular substance, and precise targeting of the stem cells remain to be promoted. Here, a novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle (MN@SPs) patch is presented using microfluidic templating technology. By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibit advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, this microfluidic&#8208;engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.

         <title>Rationalized Electroepitaxy toward Scalable Single&#8208;Crystal Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable Zn electroepitaxy is realized on the mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil by reasonably circumventing interface distorted alloying and electroosmosis of the second kind, harvesting ultrahigh reversibility of Zn anodes.








Abstract
Electroepitaxy is recognized as an effective approach to prepare metal electrodes with nearly complete reversibility. Nevertheless, large&#8208;scale manipulation is still not attainable owing to complicated interfacial chemistry. Here, the feasibility of extending Zn electroepitaxy toward the bulk phase over a mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil is demonstrated. Interfacial Cu&#8211;Zn alloy and turbulent electroosmosis are circumvented by adopting a potentiostatic electrodeposition protocol. The as&#8208;prepared Zn single&#8208;crystalline anode enables stable cycling of symmetric cells at a stringent current density of 50.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled full cell further sustaines a capacity retention of 95.7% at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles, accompanied by a controllably low N/P ratio of 7.5. In addition to Zn, Ni electroepitaxy can be realized by using the same approach. This study may inspire rational exploration of the design of high&#8208;end metal electrodes.

         <title>In Situ Device&#8208;Level TEM Characterization Based on Ultra&#8208;Flexible Multilayer MoS2 Micro&#8208;Cantilever</title>

An in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical transmission electron microscopy characterization platform is first developed by integrating with an ultra&#8208;flexible piezoresistive molybdenum disulfide&#160;micro&#8208;cantilever for device&#8208;level electromechanical and opto&#8208;electromechanical mechanism exploration.








Abstract
Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#160;situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization technology has been capable of statically or dynamically nanorobotic manipulating specimens, affording abundant atom&#8208;level material attributes. However, an insurmountable barrier between material attributes investigations and device&#8208;level application explorations exists due to immature in&#160;situ TEM manufacturing technology and sufficient external coupled stimulus. These limitations seriously prevent the development of in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization. Herein, a representative in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical TEM characterization platform is put forward by integrating an ultra&#8208;flexible micro&#8208;cantilever chip with optical, mechanical, and electrical coupling fields for the first time. On this platform, static and dynamic in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterizations are implemented by utilizing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#160;nanoflake as channel material. E&#8208;beam modulation behavior in MoS2&#160;transistors is demonstrated at ultra&#8208;high e&#8208;beam acceleration voltage (300&#160;kV), stemming from inelastic scattering electron doping into MoS2&#160;nanoflakes. Moreover, in&#160;situ dynamic bending MoS2&#160;nanodevices without/with laser irradiation reveals asymmetric piezoresistive properties based on electromechanical effects and secondary enhanced photocurrent based on opto&#8208;electromechanical coupling effects, accompanied by real&#8208;time monitoring atom&#8208;level characterization. This approach provides a step toward advanced in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization technology with excellent perception ability and inspires in&#160;situ TEM characterization with ultra&#8208;sensitive force feedback and light sensing.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Solvation toward Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Feature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salt precipitation is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS)&#8211;weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture. As a result, the solvation structure can transform at low temperature by spontaneous increase in entropy of the electrolyte, with a feature of temperature&#8208;adaption. This ensures a fast de&#8208;ionization process and stable co&#8208;intercalation process at low temperature.









Abstract
Salt precipitation at temperatures far above the freezing point of solvents is primarily responsible for performance decay of rechargeable batteries at low temperature, yet is still challenged by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of the design principle and ultimate solutions. Here, this is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS) and weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture, in which a solvation structure can spontaneously transform at low temperature to avoid salt precipitation, endowing the electrolyte with a temperature&#8208;adaptive feature. The results affirm that such temperature&#8208;adaptive electrolyte ensures encouraging low&#8208;temperature performance in a hard carbon||Na2/3Ni1/4Cu1/12Mn2/3O2 full cell with 90.6% capacity retention over 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The generality of the concept is further expanded to construct a series of SS&#8211;WS electrolytes as potential candidates for rechargeable low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The work shed lights on the importance of entropy tuning and affords a rational viewpoint on designing low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <title>Ordering&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis of High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordering transformation of high&#8208;entropy Pt4FeCoNiCu nanoparticles from disordered solid&#8208;solution alloy to ordered intermetallic structure is demonstrated across multiple scales. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities are revealed to be ordering&#8208;dependent, and the highly ordered Pt4FeCoNiCu outperforms most other Pt&#8208;based catalysts for HER and ORR with robust durability.








Abstract
Disordered solid&#8208;solution high&#8208;entropy alloys have attracted wide research attention as robust electrocatalysts. In comparison, ordered high&#8208;entropy intermetallics have been hardly explored and the effects of the degree of chemical ordering on catalytic activity remain unknown. In this study, a series of multicomponent intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles with tunable ordering degrees is fabricated. The transformation mechanism of the multicomponent nanoparticles from disordered structure into ordered structure is revealed at the single&#8208;particle level, and it agrees with macroscopic analysis by selected&#8208;area electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electrocatalytic performance of Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles correlates well with their crystal structure and electronic structure. It is found that increasing the degree of ordering promotes electrocatalytic performance. The highly ordered Pt4FeCoCuNi achieves the highest mass activities toward both acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which are 18.9&#8208;fold and 5.6&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The experiment also shows that this catalyst demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability than both partially ordered and disordered Pt4FeCoCuNi as well as Pt/C when subject to both HER and ORR. This ordering&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;property relationship provides insight into the rational design of catalysts and stimulates the exploration of many other multicomponent intermetallic alloys.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Driven Coordination Fields Altering Single Cerium Atom Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through ubtle modulation of the coordination environments by introducing P and S heteroatoms, the Ce electroactive sites are modulated to achieve effective enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction's intrinsic catalytic activity. This work supplies significant references for optimizing the electroactivity of atomic catalysts by a coordination regulation strategy.








Abstract
For current single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), modulating the coordination environments of rare&#8208;earth (RE) single atoms with complex electronic orbital and flexible chemical states is still limited. Herein, cerium (Ce) SAs supported on a P, S, and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon substrate (Ce SAs/PSNC) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are reported. The as&#8208;prepared Ce SAs/PSNC possesses a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#160;V, a turnover frequency value of 52.2&#160;s&#8722;1 at 0.85&#160;V, and excellent stability for the ORR, which exceeds the commercial Pt/C and most recent SACs. Ce SAs/PSNC&#8208;based liquid zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) exhibit a high and stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.49&#160;V and a maximum power density of 212&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2. As the catalyst of the air cathode, it also displays remarkable performance in flexible electronic devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of S and P sites induces significant electronic modulations to the Ce SA active sites. The P and S dopings promote the electroactivity of Ce SAs and improve the overall site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer within the Ce SAs/PSNC. This work offers a unique perspective for modulating RE&#8208;based SACs in a complex coordination environment toward superior electrocatalysis and broad applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

Crystal Misorientation
In article number 2300373, Andrew J. Lew, Davide Ruffoni, Markus J. Buehler, Pupa U. P. A. Gilbert, and co&#8208;workers reveal that the toughness of polycrystalline seashells and coral skeletons is increased by small misorientation of adjacent crystals. The findings pave the way toward bioinspired materials with tunable toughness.

Polarization Order
Polarization&#8208;switching processes of fluorite&#8208;oxide thin films remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions. In article number 2207736, Chen Ge, Qinghua Zhang, Lin Gu, and co&#8208;workers directly capture the transition between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orders using integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2212210, Funan Liu, Hongjun Li, Zhen Gu, and co&#8208;workers present an oncolytic virus therapy that can target metastasis after systemic administration. Tumor cells that have been pre&#8208;infected with an oncolytic virus serve as the delivery vehicle after pathogenicity has been eliminated by liquid nitrogen shock, but their metastasis&#8208;targeting ability is maintained by the integrity of cellular structure and surface protein preservation. This Trojan&#8208;horse&#8208;like method prevents virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and improves tumor&#8208;specific delivery.

Flame Aerosol Synthesis
In article number 2211104, Lutz M&#228;dler and co&#8208;workers report a novel thermochemical process control with coordinated precursor design, which enables the establishment of a reactive spray process that produces binary metal sulfides with high surface area and crystallinity in the gas phase. Thus a breakthrough technology capable of producing multimetal sulfides (ternary, quaternary) is provided, which will play a key role in the field of non&#8208;oxide materials.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202211104"&gt;2211104&lt;/a&gt;, Lutz M&#228;dler and co-workers report a novel thermochemical process control with coordinated precursor design, which enables the establishment of a reactive spray process that produces binary metal sulfides with high surface area and crystallinity in the gas phase. Thus a breakthrough technology capable of producing multimetal sulfides (ternary, quaternary) is provided, which will play a key role in the field of non-oxide materials.

         <title>Defective Metal Oxides: Lessons from CO2RR and Applications in NOxRR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 28, July 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on oxide surfaces is a critical factor in promoting electrochemical conversion reactions. A special focus is placed on the structure&#8211;performance relationship of oxygen vacancies in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR)/nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) electrocatalysts. This work examines the formation/characterization of defects for CO2RR, taking learnings, challenges, and future directions in designing defective oxides for the emerging field of NO3RR.








Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and the undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self&#8208;reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as the carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO2RR and NO3RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge&#8208;transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, are yet to be fully understood. Engingeering of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position engineering of OVs as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art findings of the roles of OVs in both the CO2RR and the NO3RR are presented. The review starts with a description of approaches to constructing and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of the CO2RR and a detailed discussion on the roles of OVs in the CO2RR. Then, insights into the NO3RR mechanism and the potential of OVs on NO3RR based on early findings are&#160;highlighted. Finally, the challenges in designing CO2RR/NO3RR electrocatalysts and perspectives in studying OV engineering are provided.

         <title>Sequential Molecule&#8208;Doped Hole Conductor to Achieve &gt;23% Perovskite Solar Cells with 3000&#8208;Hour Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport layers (HTLs) is being held back by poor stability and unsatisfied scalability. Herein, a versatile molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping approach is developed to improve the spatial doping uniformity and fabricate all&#8208;evaporated HTL. The resultant devices achieve a record efficiency of 23.4%, and exhibit impressive stability both in ambient and working conditions.








Abstract
Although hole transport layers (HTLs) based on solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD are extremely popular and effective for their remarkable performance in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their scalable application is still being held back by poor chemical stability and unsatisfied scalability. Essentially, the volatile components and hygroscopic nature of ionic salts often cause morphological deformation that deteriorate both device efficiency and stability. Herein, a simple and effective molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping (MISD) approach is strategically introduced to modulate spatial doping uniformity of organic films and fabricate all evaporated Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD layer in which phase&#8208;segregation free HTL is achieved accompanied with high molecular density, uniform doping composition, and superior optoelectronic characteristics. The resultant MISD&#8208;based devices attain a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4%, which represents the highest reported value among all the PSCs with evaporated HTLs. Simultaneously, the unencapsulated devices realize considerably enhanced stability by maintaining over 90% of their initial PCEs in the air for 5200&#160;h and after working at maximum power point under illumination for 3000&#160;h. This method provides a facile way to fabricate robust and reliable HTLs toward developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature, Reversible, and Robust Thermochromic Fluorescence Based on Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are demonstrated in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals. Such unique features showcase a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption application.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) characterized by noticeable emission color variation with temperature have attracted pervasive attention for their frontier application in stimulus&#8208;response and optical encryption technologies. However, existing TFMs typically suffer from weak PL reversibility as well as limited mild operating temperature and severe temperature PL quenching. PL switching under extreme conditions such as high temperature will undoubtedly improve encryption security, while it is still challenging for present TFMs. In this work, high&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are observed in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals, which is seldom reported for PL changes at such a high temperature. Temperature&#8208;driven nonluminous, red and green light emission states can be achieved at specific temperatures and the modulation mechanism is verified by in situ optical and structural measurements and single particle transition. By virtue of this unique feature, a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption applications are demonstrated. This work opens a window for the design of inorganic materials with multi&#8208;PL change and the development of advanced encryption strategies with extreme stimuli source.

&lt;p&gt;High-temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are demonstrated in Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and related crystals. Such unique features showcase a multicolor anti-counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption application.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) characterized by noticeable emission color variation with temperature have attracted pervasive attention for their frontier application in stimulus-response and optical encryption technologies. However, existing TFMs typically suffer from weak PL reversibility as well as limited mild operating temperature and severe temperature PL quenching. PL switching under extreme conditions such as high temperature will undoubtedly improve encryption security, while it is still challenging for present TFMs. In this work, high-temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are observed in Rb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and related crystals, which is seldom reported for PL changes at such a high temperature. Temperature-driven nonluminous, red and green light emission states can be achieved at specific temperatures and the modulation mechanism is verified by in situ optical and structural measurements and single particle transition. By virtue of this unique feature, a multicolor anti-counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption applications are demonstrated. This work opens a window for the design of inorganic materials with multi-PL change and the development of advanced encryption strategies with extreme stimuli source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eye&#8208;Mimicked Neural Network Composed of Photosensitive Neural Spheroids with Human Opsin Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain mimicking model is designed with photosensitive neural spheroid and neural network. In the photosensitive neural spheroid, human opins such as rhodopsin and short&#8208;wavelength opsin are reacted by the specific wavelength of light with selective sensitivity. Photonic reaction result in the neural response, of which signal spread to other neurons through axons.








Abstract
An&#160;in vitro model, composed of the short&#8208;wavelength human opsins and rhodopsins, is created. Two types of photosensitive neural spheroids are transfected for selective reaction under bluish&#8208;purple and green lights. These are employed to two devices with intact neuron and neural&#8208;spheroid to study the interaction. By photostimulation, the photosensitive spheroid initiated photoactivation, and the signal generated from its body is transmitted to adjacent neural networks. Specifically, the signal traveled through the axon bundle in narrow gap from photosensitive spheroid to intact spheroid as an eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain model including optic nerve. The whole process with photosensitive spheroid is monitored by calcium ion detecting fluorescence images. The results of this study can be applied to examine vision restoration and novel photosensitive biological systems with spectral sensitivity.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles&#8208;Derived Hybrid Nanoplatforms for Amplified CD47 Blockade&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanoplatforms are designed by fusing M1 macrophage extracellular vesicles with drug&#8208;loaded liposomes and decorating them with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, which enables amplified CD47 blockade&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy through combinational treatment strategy.








Abstract
Immunomodulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) into tumor&#8208;inhibiting M1&#8208;like phenotype is a promising but challenging strategy. Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re&#8208;education of TAMs into the &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy. Herein, it is reported that hybrid nanovesicles (hEL&#8208;RS17) derived from extracellular vesicles of M1 macrophages and decorated with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, can actively target tumor cells and remodel TAM phenotypes. Consequently, more M1&#8208;like TAMs infiltrate into tumor tissue to phagocytize more tumor cells due to CD47 blockade. By further co&#8208;encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent shikonin, photosensitizer IR820, and immunomodulator polymetformin in hEL&#8208;RS17, an enhanced antitumor effect is obtained due to the combinational treatment modality and close synergy among each component. Upon laser irradiation, the designed SPI@hEL&#8208;RS17 nanoparticles exert potent antitumor efficacy against both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, which not only suppresses primary tumor growth but also inhibits lung metastasis and prevents tumor recurrence, exhibiting great potential in boosting CD47 blockade&#8208;based antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Thin&#8208;Film Organic Heteroepitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems have not been fully clarified. In this work, one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate heteroepitaxy is demonstrated and it is shown that the lattice matched plane of the adcrystal must also be its lowest energy surface.








Abstract
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, while rules for commensurate epitaxy of covalent or ionic inorganic material systems are known to be dictated by lattice matching constraints, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems are still being written. Here, it is found that lattice matching alone is insufficient to achieve heteroepitaxy in molecular systems, owing to weak intermolecular forces that describe molecular crystals. It is found that, in addition, the lattice matched plane also must be the lowest energy surface of the adcrystal to achieve one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate molecular heteroepitaxy over a large area. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the lattice matched interface to be of higher electronic quality than a disordered interface of the same materials.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Anchored Curved Carbon Surface for Efficient CO2 Electro&#8208;Reduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity and Industrially&#8208;Relevant Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni&#8208;N4 sites on curved carbon surfaces possess a lower energy barrier for *COOH formation, which benefits the CO2 reduction reaction. Accordingly, porous carbon with atomic Ni&#8208;N4 sites and a rich curved surface is developed and exhibits nearly 100 % selectivity for CO formation under a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although single metal atoms on porous carbons (PCs) are widely used in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, these systems have long relied on flat graphene&#8208;based models, which are far beyond reality because of abundant curved structures in PCs; the effect of curved surfaces has long been ignored. In addition, the selectivity generally decreases under high current density, which severely limits practical application. Herein, theoretical calculations reveal that a single&#8208;Ni&#8208;atom on a curved surface can simultaneously enhance the total density of states around Fermi level and decrease the energy barrier for *COOH formation, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. This work reports a rational molten salt approach for preparing PCs with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area of up to 2635 m2 g&#8722;1. As determined by cutting&#8208;edge techniques, a single Ni atom on a curved carbon surface is obtained and used as a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The CO selectivity reaches up to 99.8% under industrial&#8208;level current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PC&#8208;based catalysts. This work not only offers a new method for the rational synthesis of single atom catalysts with strained geometry to host rich active sites, but also provides in&#8208;depth insights for the origin of catalytic activity of curved structure&#8208;enriched PC&#8208;based catalysts.

Ultrarobust helical Mn(II)&#8208;organic polymers are developed to realize magnetically&#8208;responsive circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with exceptionally high performance (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;89%, glum&#160;=&#160;0.021) as well as triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity.&#160;We&#160;have disclosed that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPP for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPP signal noticeably.








Abstract
Over recent years, Mn(II)&#8208;organic materials showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great interest because of their eco&#8208;friendliness, cheapness, and room temperature phosphorescence. Using the helicity design strategy, herein, chiral Mn(II)&#8208;organic helical polymers are constructed featuring long&#8208;lived circularly polarized phosphorescence with exceptionally high glum and &#934;PL magnitudes of 0.021% and 89%, respectively, while remaining ultrarobust toward humidity, temperature, and X&#8208;rays. Equally important, it is disclosed for the first time that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPL for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPL signal by 4.2&#8208;times at B&#8407;$\vec{B}$&#160;=&#160;1.6&#160;T. Using the designed materials, UV&#8208;pumped CPL light&#8208;emitting diodes are fabricated, demonstrating enhanced optical selectivity under right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed polarization conditions. On top of all this, the reported materials display bright triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity with a perfectly linear X&#8208;ray dose rate response up to 174&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1. Overall, these observations significantly contribute to the CPL phenomenon for multi&#8208;spin compounds and promote the design of highly efficient and stable Mn(II)&#8208;based CPL emitters.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Adaptable Polyimide Hybrid Dielectric Films with Superior Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic crosslinked polyimide film (DCPI) is designed by introducing a chain extender. This DCPI film has excellent superior recyclability at the monomer level and self&#8208;healable ability. Moreover, the DCPI is a good corona&#8208;resistant film and a matrix of sustainable carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced composites.








Abstract
Polyimides (PIs) used in advanced electrical and electronic devices can be electrically/mechanically damaged, resulting in a significant waste of resources. Closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling may prolong the service life of synthetic polymers. However, the design of dynamic covalent bonds for preparing chemically recyclable crosslinked PIs remains a challenging task. Herein, new crosslinked PI films containing a PI oligomer, chain extender, and crosslinker are reported. They exhibit superior recyclability and excellent self&#8208;healable ability owing to the synergistic effect of the chain extender and crosslinker. The produced films can be completely depolymerized in an acidic solution at ambient temperature, leading to efficient monomer recovery. The recovered monomers may be used to remanufacture crosslinked PIs without deteriorating their original performance. In particular, the designed films can serve as corona&#8208;resistant films with a recovery rate of approximately 100%. Furthermore, carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs) with PI matrices are suitable for harsh environments and can be recycled multiple times at a non&#8208;destructive recycling rate up to 100%. The preparation of high&#8208;strength dynamic covalent adaptable PI hybrid films from simple PI oligomers, chain extenders, and crosslinkers may provide a solid basis for sustainable development in the electrical and electronic fields.

         <title>Interelectrode Talk in Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new insight into the cross&#8208;talk behavior between cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode is presented by analyzing the non&#8208;uniform Li+ flux induced electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure. A forward&#8208;looking and overturning opinion on the thorny problem of lithium dendrites is that the initiation factor of lithium&#8208;dendrite growth is the reaction inhomogeneity of the cathode, which can be effectively solved by cathode modification.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries have been identified as a strategic research direction for the electric vehicle industry because of their promising high energy density and potential characteristic safety. However, the intrinsic mechanical properties of solid materials cause inevitable electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure of electrodes and electrolytes during charging and discharging; these failure mechanisms include lithium penetration and formation of cracks and voids, which pose a serious challenge for the long cycle life of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a short overview of the recent advances with a view to understand this challenge is provided. Furthermore, new insights into the cross&#8208;talk behavior between the cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode are provided based on the non&#8208;uniform Li+ flux inducing interactional electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure. Furthermore, guidelines for designing stable solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries and research directions to figure out the interelectrode&#8208;talk&#8208;related electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure mechanism are presented, which can be significant for accelerating the development of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Li Plating Diagnosis for Fast&#8208;Charging Li&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Relaxation Time Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Li plating behavior of Li&#8208;ion batteries under fast charging conditions is elusive due to a lack of reliable indicators of the Li plating onset. In this work, the relaxation time constant of the charge transfer process (&#964;CT) is proposed to be promising for the determination of Li plating onset. A novel pulse/relaxation test method enables a rapid access to the &#964;CT of the graphite anode during battery operation, applicable to both half and full batteries. The diagnosis of Li plating at varying temperatures and charging rates enriches the cognition of Li plating behaviors. Li plating at low temperatures and high charging rates can be avoided because of the battery voltage limitations. Nevertheless, after the onset, severe Li plating evolves rapidly under harsh charging conditions, while the Li plating process under benign charging conditions is accompanied by a simultaneous Li intercalation process. The quantitative estimates indicate that Li plating at high temperatures/high charging rates leads to more irreversible capacity losses. This facile method with rational scientific principles can provide inspiration for exploring the safe boundaries of Li&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
Polaritons in layered materials (LMs) are a promising platform to manipulate and control light at the nanometer scale. Thus, the observation of polaritons in wafer&#8208;scale LMs is critically important for the development of industrially relevant nanophotonics and optoelectronics applications. Here w e report phonon polaritons (PhPs) in wafer&#8208;scale multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) grown by chemical vapor deposition. By infrared nanoimaging w e visualize the PhPs and measure their lifetime of about 0.6&#160;ps, comparable to that of micromechanically exfoliated multilayer hBN. W e also demonstrate PhP nano&#8208;resonators with quality factors of about 50, which is 0.7 times that of state of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices based on exfoliated hBN. O ur results could enable PhP&#8208;based surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (e.g., for gas sensing) and infrared photodetector applications.

         <title>Breath Biopsy Reveals Systemic Immunothrombosis and Its Resolution Through Bioorthogonal Dendritic Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunothrombosis, an inflammation&#8208;dependent activation of the coagulation cascade, leads to microthrombi formations in small vessels. It is a dreaded complication of COVID&#8208;19 and a major cause of respiratory failure. Due to their size and disseminated nature, microthrombi are currently undetectable. Here, we introduce non&#8208;invasive detection of a volatile reporter in the exhaled air for assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. A dendritic nanoprobe, containing high loading of a thrombin&#8208;sensitive substrate, was selectively cleaved by thrombin, resulting in release of a synthetic bioorthogonal volatile organic compound (VOC). The VOC was quantitated in the exhaled air biopsies via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS), allowing near realtime assessment of systemic immunothrombosis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunothrombosis, an inflammation-dependent activation of the coagulation cascade, leads to microthrombi formations in small vessels. It is a dreaded complication of COVID-19 and a major cause of respiratory failure. Due to their size and disseminated nature, microthrombi are currently undetectable. Here, we introduce non-invasive detection of a volatile reporter in the exhaled air for assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. A dendritic nanoprobe, containing high loading of a thrombin-sensitive substrate, was selectively cleaved by thrombin, resulting in release of a synthetic bioorthogonal volatile organic compound (VOC). The VOC was quantitated in the exhaled air biopsies via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), allowing near realtime assessment of systemic immunothrombosis. The VOC detection can be further improved with more rapid and sensitive MS-based technologies. The amount of the VOC in the exhaled air decreased with resolution of the microvascular inflammation and intravascular fibrin depositions. Through conjugation of the thrombin-sensitive peptide with a rhodol derivative, a novel thrombin-sensitive fluorescent nanoprobe was developed for intravital visualization of thrombin activity in actively growing thrombi. These results establish unprecedented detection of thrombin activity in vivo, addressing an unmet medical need. Our novel approach facilitates diagnosis of immunothrombosis in diseases such as diabetic complications, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nanoscale Metal Particle Modified Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, And Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in heterogeneous catalysis because of their well&#8208;defined active sites, maximum atomic utilization efficiency, and unique unsaturated coordinated structures. However, their effectiveness is limited to reactions requiring active sites containing multiple metal atoms. Furthermore, the loading amounts of single&#8208;atom sites must be restricted to prevent aggregation, which can adversely affect the catalytic performance despite the high activity of the individual atoms. The introduction of nanoscale metal particles (NMPs) into SACs (NMP&#8208;SACs) has proven to be an efficient approach for improving their catalytic performance. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to systematically introduce the synthesis, characterization, and application of NMP&#8208;SACs and the mechanisms behind their superior catalytic performance. This review first presents and classifies the different mechanisms through which NMPs enhance the performance of SACs. It then summarizes the currently reported synthetic strategies and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques of NMP&#8208;SACs. Moreover, their application in electro/thermo/photocatalysis, and the reasons for their superior performance are discussed. Finally, we address the challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs for the future design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Imaging Field&#8208;Driven Melting of a Molecular Solid at the Atomic Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;liquid phase transitions are imaged for molecules assembled at the surface of a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor. Electrostatic gating is seen to cause reversible transitions between a charge&#8208;neutral quasi&#8208;1D molecular solid and a negatively charged 2D liquid phase. Transiently heating the device enables nonequilibrium dynamics to be visualized. The observed behavior is explained using thermodynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;liquid phase transitions are basic physical processes, but atomically resolved microscopy has yet to capture their full dynamics. A new technique is developed for controlling the melting and freezing of self&#8208;assembled molecular structures on a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) that allows phase&#8208;transition behavior to be imaged using atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy. This is achieved by applying electric fields to 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane&#8208;decorated FETs to induce reversible transitions between molecular solid and liquid phases at the FET surface. Nonequilibrium melting dynamics are visualized by rapidly heating the graphene substrate with an electrical current and imaging the resulting evolution toward new 2D&#160;equilibrium states. An analytical model is developed that explains observed mixed&#8208;state phases based on spectroscopic measurement of solid and liquid molecular energy levels. The observed nonequilibrium melting dynamics are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations.

         <title>Flexible Modulation of Cellular Activities with Cationic Photosensitizers: Insights of Alkyl Chain Length on Reactive Oxygen Species Antimicrobial Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) with berberine (BBR) cores with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed for different binding, localization, and photodynamic killing effects among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility.








Abstract
Cationic photosensitizers have good binding ability with negatively charged bacteria and fungi, exhibiting broad applications potential in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). However, cationic photosensitizers often display unsatisfactory transkingdom selectivity between mammalian cells and pathogens, especially for eukaryotic fungi. It is unclear which biomolecular sites are more efficient for photodynamic damage, owing to the lack of systematic research with the same photosensitizer system. Herein, a series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) (using berberine (BBR) as the photosensitizers core) with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed and synthesized for flexible modulation of cellular activities. The BBR core can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve high&#8208;performance aPDT . Through the precise regulation of alkyl chain length, different bindings, localizations, and photodynamic killing effects of CABs are achieved and investigated systematically among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. It is found that intracellular active substances, not membranes, are more efficient damage sites of aPDT. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility. This study is expected to provide systematic theoretical and strategic research guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance cationic photosensitizers with good transkingdom selectivity.

         <title>A Multifunctional Additive Strategy Enables Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate performs three functions on perovskites: dimensionality control, defect passivation, and surface modification. Consequently, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 11.87% at 468&#160;nm, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have shown exceptional performance in light&#8208;emitting devices (PeLEDs), particularly in producing significant electroluminescence in sky&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. However, PeLEDs emitting pure&#8208;blue light at 465&#8211;475 nm are still not satisfactory. Herein, efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are reported by controlling phase distribution, passivation of defects, as well as surface modifications using multifunctional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate (PEATFA) in reduced&#8208;dimensional p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA2Csn&#8722;1Pbn(Br0.55Cl0.45)3n+1 polycrystalline perovskite films. Compared with 4&#8208;fluorophenylethylammonium (p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA+) in the pristine films, phenylethylammonium (PEA+) has lower adsorption energy while interacting with perovskites, resulting in large&#8208;n low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, which can greatly facilitate charge transport within the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films. The interaction between the C&#63742;O group in trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) and perovskites significantly reduces defects in the perovskite films. Additionally, the electron&#8208;giving &#63743;CF3 group in TFA&#8208; uplifts surface potential in the films, resulting in smooth electronic injection in devices. The multifunctional additive strategy leads to elevated radiative recombination and efficient carrier transport in the films and devices. As a result, the devices exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.87% at 468 nm with stable spectral output, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Thus, this study extends the way for high&#8208;efficiency pure&#8208;blue LED with perovskite polycrystal films.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of energy offset and defects with different halide types in 2D perovskite are studied, providing a new approach for designing stable and efficient PSCs. Using 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions can improve the passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction, boosting the efficiency to 25.32% for the small devices and 21.48% for the large module.








Abstract
Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by chargecarrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified.

&lt;p&gt;The effects of energy offset and defects with different halide types in 2D perovskite are studied, providing a new approach for designing stable and efficient PSCs. Using 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions can improve the passivation and charge-carrier extraction, boosting the efficiency to 25.32% for the small devices and 21.48% for the large module.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by chargecarrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high-efficiency PSCs, 2D perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge-carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small-size devices and to 21.48% for a large-area module (with a designated area of 29.0&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small-size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The basic concepts and components of liquid crystals and the functional materials derived from them are introduced. After that, their ongoing and foreseeable biomedical applications are discussed. 








Abstract
Liquid crystal is a state of matter being intermediate between solid and liquid. Liquid crystal materials exhibit both orientational order and fluidity. While liquid crystals have long been highly recognized in the display industry, in recent decades, liquid crystals provide new opportunities into the cross&#8208;field of material science and biomedicine due to their biocompatibility, multifunctionality, and responsiveness. In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The start is made by introducing the basic concepts of liquid crystals, and then shifting to the components of liquid crystals as well as functional materials derived therefrom. After that, the ongoing and foreseeable applications of liquid crystal materials in the biomedical field with emphasis put on several cutting&#8208;edge aspects, including drug delivery, bioimaging, tissue engineering, implantable devices, biosensing, and wearable devices are discussed. It is hoped that this review will stimulate ingenious ideas for the future generation of liquid crystal&#8208;based drug development, artificial implants, disease diagnosis, health status monitoring, and beyond.

         <title>Directed Neural Stem Cells Differentiation via Signal Communication with Ni&#8211;Zn Micromotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotors precisely approach target neural stem cells (NSCs) under magnetic guidance and further activate the cellular voltage&#8208;gated ion channel, thus directing the differentiation fate of the target cell. Such micromotors provide a possibility for non&#8208;invasive, minimally invasive therapy for neuron regeneration.








Abstract
Neural stem cells (NSCs), with the capability of self&#8208;renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy, and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous NSCs, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogenous cell transplantation. Yet, how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, a pure water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor via a self&#8208;established electric&#8211;chemical field is proposed. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target NSCs. Through the electric&#8211;chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous NSCs are allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, the Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via a self&#8208;established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous NSCs.

         <title>Open and Close&#8208;Packed, Shape&#8208;Engineered Polygonal Nanoparticle Metamolecules with Tailorable Fano Resonances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles (NPs) are produced with lithographic fabrication and assembled into open or close&#8208;packed structures using a template&#8208;assisted assembly technique. The NP assemblies&#8217; coordination number, interparticle gap size, disorder, and voids are controlled by the shapes and sizes of the NPs and templates. Tuneable Fano resonances are obtained in the dark&#8208;field scattering spectra of the assembly.








Abstract
A top&#8208;down lithographic patterning and deposition process is reported for producing nanoparticles (NPs) with well&#8208;defined sizes, shapes, and compositions that are often not accessible by wet&#8208;chemical synthetic methods. These NPs are ligated and harvested from the substrate surface to prepare colloidal NP dispersions. Using a template&#8208;assisted assembly technique, fabricated NPs are driven by capillary forces to assemble into size&#8208; and shape&#8208;engineered templates and organize into open or close&#8208;packed multi&#8208;NP structures or NP metamolecules. The sizes and shapes of the NPs and of the templates control the NP number, coordination, interparticle gap size, disorder, and location of defects such as voids in the NP metamolecules. The plasmonic resonances of polygonal&#8208;shaped Au NPs are exploited to correlate the structure and optical properties of assembled NP metamolecules. Comparing open and close&#8208;packed architectures highlights that introduction of a center NP to form close&#8208;packed assemblies supports collective interactions, altering magnetic optical modes and multipolar interactions in Fano resonances. Decreasing the distance between NPs strengthens the plasmonic coupling, and the structural symmetries of the NP metamolecules determine the orientation&#8208;dependent scattering response.

         <title>An Ultrafast, Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrochromic and Thermochromic Device for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through innovative molecular design and advanced device optimization, a high&#8208;performance electrochromic device is achieved, demonstrating high transparency, rapid color&#8208;switching, and excellent stability. In conjunction with the creation of a thermoresponsive gel electrolyte, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is realized, exhibiting flame&#8208;retardant properties and energy&#8208;saving characteristics. Such an advanced device equips smart windows with energy efficiency, privacy protection, and decorative enhancements.








Abstract
Smart windows nowadays undertake the esteemed obligation of reducing energy consumption as well as upgrading living experience. This project aims to devise a smart window that responds to both electricity and heat, with the intention of achieving energy efficiency, privacy preservation, and enhanced decorative attributes. Through the implementation of a novel electrochromic material design, coupled with the optimization of electrochromic devices (ECDs), a high&#8208;performance ECD is obtained, demonstrating coloring/bleaching time of 0.53/0.16&#160;s, a transmittance modulation of 78% (from 99% to 21%), and superior performance in six dimensions. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;responsive units and an ionic liquid are incorporated into the electrolyte system to create a novel thermochromic gel electrolyte with transmittance modulation from 80% to 0%, and excellent thermal insulation (6.4&#160;&#176;C reduction). Ultimately, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is developed, featuring an ultrafast color&#8208;switching speed of 0.82/0.60&#160;s and multiple working modes. Overall, this work showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of next&#8208;generation ultrafast&#8208;switching, and energy&#8208;efficient intelligent windows.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Bandgap Engineering in Nanoribbons of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective bandgap modulation of water&#8208;adsorbed zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) is reported. A water layer adsorbed at the edges creates a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces its bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs with adsorbates of water can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature.








Abstract
Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It is predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator&#8211;metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, it is&#160;theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that water adsorption greatly reduces the bandgap of zigzag&#8208;oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water molecules can be favorably assembled within the trench between two adjacent BNNRs to form a polar ice layer, which induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V&#160;nm&#8722;1 accounting for the bandgap reduction. Field&#8208;effect transistors are&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of water&#8208;adsorbed zBNNRs can&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via modulation of the equivalent electrical field at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements are&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgaps of zBNNRs with water adsorption. The zBNNR with increased width can exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV.

     alt="Water-Induced Bandgap Engineering in Nanoribbons of Hexagonal Boron Nitride"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective bandgap modulation of water-adsorbed zigzag-oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) is reported. A water layer adsorbed at the edges creates a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces its bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm-wide zBNNRs with adsorbates of water can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different from hexagonal boron nitride (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN) sheets, the bandgap of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;BN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It is predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator&#8211;metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, it is&#160;theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that water adsorption greatly reduces the bandgap of zigzag-oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water molecules can be favorably assembled within the trench between two adjacent BNNRs to form a polar ice layer, which induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V&#160;nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; accounting for the bandgap reduction. Field-effect transistors are&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of water-adsorbed zBNNRs can&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via modulation of the equivalent electrical field at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements are&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgaps of zBNNRs with water adsorption. The zBNNR with increased width can exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV. This study offers fundamental insights into new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Oxygen Evolution Reaction Drives Passivity Breakdown for Ni&#8208;Cr&#8208;Mo Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Corrosion is the main factor limiting the lifetime of metallic materials, and a fundamental understanding of the governing mechanism and surface processes is difficult to achieve since the thin oxide films at the metal&#8208;liquid interface governing passivity are notoriously challenging to study. Here, a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based techniques and electrochemical methods are used to investigate the passive film breakdown of a Ni&#8208;Cr&#8208;Mo alloy used in many industrial applications. This alloy is found to be active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the OER onset coincides with the loss of passivity and severe metal dissolution. The OER mechanism involves the oxidation of Mo4+ sites in the oxide film to Mo6+ that can be dissolved, which results in passivity breakdown. This is fundamentally different from typical transpassive breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys where Cr6+ is postulated to be dissolved at high anodic potentials, which was not observed here. At high current densities, OER also leads to acidification of the solution near the surface, further triggering metal dissolution. OER plays an important role in the mechanism of passivity breakdown of Ni&#8208;Cr&#8208;Mo alloys due to their catalytic activity, and this effect needs to be considered when studying the corrosion of catalytically active alloys.

         <title>Doping Engineering to Modulate Lattice and Electronic Structure for Enhanced Piezocatalytic Therapy and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy, which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mechanical force, has garnered extensive attention for its use in cancer therapy owing to its deep tissue penetration depth and less O2&#8208;dependence. However, the piezocatalytic therapeutic efficiency is limited owing to the poor piezoresponse, low separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs, and complicated tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a biodegradable, porous Mn&#8208;doped ZnO nanocluster with enhanced piezoelectric effect is constructed via doping engineering. Mn&#8208;doping not only induces lattice distortion to increase polarization but also creates rich oxygen vacancy (OV) for suppressing the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs, leading to high&#8208;efficiency generation of ROS under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Moreover, Mn&#8208;doped ZnO shows TME&#8208;responsive multienzyme&#8208;mimic activity to generate &#183;OH and &#183;O2&#8210;, as well as glutathione (GSH) depletion ability owing to the mixed valence of Mn (II/III), further aggravating oxidative stress in tumor cells. Density functional theory calculations show that Mn&#8208;doping can improve the piezocatalytic performance because of the enhancement of polarization and enzyme activity of Mn&#8208;ZnO due to the presence of OV. Beneficiating from the US&#8208;triggered boosting of ROS generation and GSH depletion ability, Mn&#8208;ZnO can significantly accelerate the accumulation of lipid peroxide and inactivate glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to induce ferroptosis. Our work may provide new guidance for exploring novel piezoelectric sonosensitizers for tumor therapy.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed ferromagnetic Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Programmed Dual&#8208;Anisotropy And Multi&#8208;Responsiveness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and magnetic soft materials are promising active materials in many emerging fields, such as soft robotics. Despite the high demand for developing active materials that combine the advantages of LCE and magnetic actuation, the lack of independent programming of the LCE nematic order and magnetization in a single material still hinders the desired multi&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, we developed a ferromagnetic LCE (magLCE) ink with nematic order and magnetization that can be independently programmed to be anisotropic, referred to as dual anisotropy, via a customized 3D printing platform. The magLCE ink was fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic micro&#8208;particles in the LCE matrix, and a 3D printing platform was created by integrating a magnet with 3&#8208;DoF motion into an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printer. In addition to magnetic fields, magLCEs can also be actuated by heating sources (either environmental heating or photo&#8208;heating of the embedded ferromagnetic microparticles) with a high energy density and tunable actuation temperature. We demonstrated a programmed magLCE strip robot with enhanced adaptability to complex environments (different terrains, magnetic fields, and temperatures) using a multi&#8208;actuation strategy. The magLCE also has potential applications in mechanical memory, as demonstrated by the multi&#8208;stable mechanical metastructure array with remote writability and stable memory.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Two&#8208;Dimensional Spinel&#8208;Type Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnetic materials have been of interest due to their unique long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in the low&#8208;dimensional regime and potential applications in spintronics. Currently, most of the studies are focused on strippable van der Waals magnetic materials with layered structures, which typically suffer from a poor stability and scarce species. Spinel oxides have a good environmental stability and rich magnetic properties. However, the isotropic bonding and close&#8208;packed nonlayered crystal structure make their 2D growth challenging, let alone the phase engineering. Herein, we report a phase&#8208;controllable synthesis of 2D single&#8208;crystalline spinel&#8208;type oxides for the first time. Using the van der Waals epitaxy strategy, the thicknesses of the obtained tetragonal and hexagonal manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanosheets can be tuned down to 7.1&#160;nm and one unit cell (0.7&#160;nm), respectively. The magnetic properties of these two phases are evaluated using vibrating&#8208;sample magnetometry and first&#8208;principle calculations. Both structures exhibit a Curie temperature of 48 K. Owing to its ultrathin geometry, the Mn3O4 nanosheet exhibits a superior ultraviolet detection performance with an ultralow noise power density of 0.126 pA/Hz1/2. This study broadens the range of 2D magnetic semiconductors and highlights their potential applications in future information devices.

         <title>A General Strategy for Developing Ultrasensitive &#8220;Transistor&#8208;like&#8221; Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) exhibit great potential in information encryption applications, but are limited by low thermosensitivity, poor color tunability, and a wide temperature&#8208;responsive range. Herein, a novel strategy for constructing highly sensitive TFMs with tunable emission (450&#8208;650&#160;nm) toward multilevel information encryption was proposed, which employed polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with D&#8208;A&#8208;D type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrixes. The structure&#8208;function relationships between the performance of TFMs and the structures of both fluorescent emitters and phase change molecules w ere systematically studied for the first time. Benefiting from the above design, the obtained TFMs exhibited over 9500&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement toward the temperature change, as well as ultrahigh relative temperature sensitivity up to 80% K &#8208;1, which w ere first confirmed. Thanks to the superior transducing performance, the above&#8208;prepared TFMs could be further developed as information storage platforms within a relatively narrow interval of temperature variation, including temperature&#8208;dominated multicolored information display and multilevel information encryption. This work will not only provide a novel perspective for designing superior TFMs for information encryption, but also bring inspiration to the design and preparation of other response&#8208;switch&#8208;type fluorescent probes with ultrahigh conversion efficiency.

         <title>Engineered Nanomaterials to Potentiate CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing for Cancer Therapy</title>

Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) gene&#8208;editing technology holds significant promise for manipulating single or multiple tumor&#8208;associated genes and engineering immune cells to treat cancers. Currently, most gene&#8208;editing strategies rely on viral delivery; yet, while being efficient, many limitations, mainly from safety and packaging capacity considerations, hinder the use of viral CRISPR vectors in cancer therapy. In contrast, the recent development of non&#8208;viral CRISPR/Cas9 nanoformulations has paved the way for better cancer gene editing, as these nanoformulations can be engineered to improve safety, efficiency, and specificity through optimizing the packaging capacity, pharmacokinetics, and targetability. In this review, we highlight the advance in non&#8208;viral CRISPR delivery and discuss how these approaches could be potentially used to treat cancers in addressing the aforementioned issues, followed by our perspectives in designing a proper CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;based cancer nanomedicine system with translational potential.

         <title>Sodiophilic Amyloid Fibril Modified Separator for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium (Na) batteries are being considered as prospective candidates for the next generation of secondary batteries in contrast to lithium&#8208;based batteries, due to their high raw material abundance, low cost, and sustainability. However, the unfavorable growth of Na metal deposition and severe interfacial reactions have prevented their large&#8208;scale applications. Here we propose a vacuum filtration strategy through amyloid fibril modified glass fiber separators to address these issues. The modified symmetric cell can be cycled for 1800&#160;h, surpassing the performance of previously reported Na&#8208;based electrodes under an ester&#8208;based electrolyte. Moreover, the Na/ Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a sodiophilic amyloid fibril modified separator exhibits a capacity retention of 87.13% even after 1000 cycles. Both experimental and theoretical results show sodiophilic amyloid fibril homogenizes electric field and Na ion concentration, fundamentally inhibiting dendrite formation. Simultaneously, the glutamine amino acids in the amyloid fibril have the highest adsorption energy for Na, resulting in the formation of a stable Na3N and NaNxOy&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface film on the anode during cycling. This work provides not only a possible pathway to solve dendrite problem in metal batteries using environmental&#8208;friendly biomacromolecular materials, but also a new direction for expanding biomaterial applications.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Integrated Auxetic Elastomers Constructed by Dual Dynamic Interfacial Healing Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Auxetic materials are appealing due to their unique characteristics of transverse expansion while being axially stretched. Nevertheless, current auxetic materials are often produced by the introduction of diverse geometric structures through cutting or other pore&#8208;making processes, which heavily weaken their mechanical performance. Inspired by the skeleton&#8208;matrix structures in natural organisms, here we report an integrated auxetic elastomer (IAE) composed of high&#8208;modulus crosslinked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) as a skeleton and low&#8208;modulus non&#8208;crosslinked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) as a complementary&#8208;shape matrix. Benefiting from disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds&#8208;promoted dual dynamic interfacial healing, the resulting IAE is flat, void&#8208;free, and has no sharp soft&#8208;to&#8208;hard interface. Its fracture strength and elongation at the break are increased to 400% and 150%, respectively, of the values of corrugated re&#8208;entrant skeleton alone, while the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) reserves within a strain range of 0&#8211;104%. In addition, the advantageous mechanical and auxetic properties of this elastomer are further confirmed by finite element analysis. The concept of combining two dissimilar polymers into an integrated hybrid material solves the problem of the deterioration in mechanical performance of auxetic materials after subtractive manufacturing, while preserves the NPR effect in a large deformation, which provides a promising approach to robust auxetic materials for engineering applications.

         <title>High&#8208;yield Synthesis of Sodium Chlorides of Unconventional Stoichiometries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Abnormal salt crystals with unconventional stoichiometries, such as Na2Cl, Na3Cl, K2Cl, and CaCl crystals that have been explored in reduced graphene oxide membranes (rGOMs) or diamond anvil cell, hold great promise in applications due to their unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties predicted in theory. However, the low content of these crystals, only less than 1% in rGOM, limits their research interest and utility in applications. Here, w e report a high&#8208;yield synthesis of 2D abnormal crystals with unconventional stoichiometries achieved by applying negative potential on rGOM. W e obtained a more than ten&#8208;fold increase in the abnormal Na2Cl crystals using potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V, resulting in an atomic content of 13.4 &#177; 4.7% for Na on rGOM. Direct observations by transmission electron microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy demonstrated a unique piezoelectric behavior arise from 2D Na2Cl crystals with square structure. The output voltage increased from 0 to &#8764;180&#160;mV in broad 0&#176;&#8211;150&#176; bending angle regime, which meets the voltage requirement of most nanodevices in realistic applications. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the applied negative potential of the graphene surface can strengthen the effect of the Na+&#8208;&#960; interaction and reduce the electrostatic repulsion between cations, making more Na2Cl crystals formed.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;scale Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;dimensional Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals Toward High&#8208;performance Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The success of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronics and optoelectronics relies heavily on the capability to fabricate semiconductor single&#8208;crystal wafers. However, the conventional epitaxial growth strategy for inorganic wafers is invalid for growing organic semiconductor single crystals due to the lack of lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial substrates and intricate nucleation behaviors, severely impeding the advancement of organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. Here, we develop for the first time an anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method for wafer&#8208;scale growth of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic semiconductor single crystals. The crystal seed is firmly anchored on the viscous liquid surface, ensuring the steady epitaxial growth of organic single crystals from the crystal seed. The atomically flat liquid surface effectively eliminates the disturbance from substrate defects and greatly enhances the 2D growth of organic crystals. Using this approach, a wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer bis(triethylsilythynyl)&#8208;anthradithphene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) single crystal is formed, yielding a breakthrough for organic field&#8208;effect transistors with a high reliable mobility up to 8.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an ultra&#8208;low mobility variable coefficient of 8.9%. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate organic single&#8208;crystal wafers for high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

         <title>Current Advances on the Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme and Its Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis approaches including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down strategies; catalysis modulation including central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8208;support interaction for activity and selectivity modulation of single&#8208;atom nanozymes; and bioapplications in the biosensing, antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor fields are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes, a class of nanomaterials mimicking the function of enzymes, have aroused much attention as the candidate in diverse fields with the arbitrarily tunable features owing to the diversity of crystalline nanostructures, composition, and surface configurations. However, the uncertainty of their active sites and the lower intrinsic deficiencies of nanomaterial&#8208;initiated catalysis compared with the natural enzymes promote the pursuing of alternatives by imitating the biological active centers. Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) maximize the atom utilization with the well&#8208;defined structure, providing an important bridge to investigate mechanism and the relationship between structure and catalytic activity. They have risen as the new burgeoning alternative to the natural enzyme from in vitro bioanalytical tool to in vivo therapy owing to the flexible atomic engineering structure. Here, focus is mainly on the three parts. First, a detailed overview of single&#8208;atom catalyst synthesis strategies including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches is given. Then, according to the structural feature of single&#8208;atom nanocatalysts, the influence factors such as central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8211;support interaction are discussed and the representative biological applications (including antibacterial/antiviral performance, cancer therapy, and biosensing) are highlighted. In the end, the future perspective and challenge facing are demonstrated.

         <title>Nanobiohybrid&#8208;based Bio&#8208;Solar Cell to Regulate The Electrical Signal Transmission to Living Cells for Biomedical Application</title>

Abstract
Bio&#8208;solar cells have been studied as sustainable and biocompatible energy sources with significant potential for biomedical applications. However, they are composed of light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules with narrow absorption wavelengths and weak transient photocurrent generation. In this study, a nanobiohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell composed of bacteriorhodopsin, chlorophyllin, and Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles is developed for the first time to overcome the current limitations and verify the possibility of biomedical applications. Bacteriorhodopsin and chlorophyllin are introduced as light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules to broaden the absorption wavelength. As a photocatalyst, Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles are introduced to generate a photocurrent and amplify the photocurrent generated by the biomolecules. The developed bio&#8208;solar cell absorbed a broad range of visible wavelengths and generated an amplified stationary photocurrent density (152.6 nA/cm2) with a long lifetime (up to 1 month). Besides, the electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions are precisely regulated by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell, indicating that the bio&#8208;solar cell can control living cells by signal transmission through other types of living cells. The proposed nanobiohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell can be used as a sustainable and biocompatible energy source for the development of wearable and implantable biodevices and bioelectronic medicines for humans.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Stretchable and Recyclable Starch&#8208;Based Gel with Multiple&#160;Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the development of various gel&#8208;based flexible sensors, novel gels with multiple integrated and efficient properties, particularly recyclability, have been developed. Herein, a starch&#8208;based ADM (Amylopectin (AP)&#8208;poly 3&#8208;[Dimethyl&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208; enoyloxy)ethyl]azaniumyl]propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (PDMAPS)&#8208;MXene) gel is prepared by a facile &#8220;cooking&#8221; strategy accompanying the gelatinization of AP and polymerization reaction of zwitterionic monomers. Reversible crosslinking in the gel occurs through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The ADM gel exhibits high stretchability (&#8764;2700%, after one month), swift self&#8208;healing performance, self&#8208;adhesive properties, favorable freezing resistance, and satisfactory moisturizing properties (&#8805;30 d). Interestingly, ADM gel can be recycled and reused by a &#8220;kneading&#8221; method and &#8220;dissolution&#8208;dialysis&#8221; process, respectively. Furthermore, the ADM gel can be assembled as a strain sensor with a broad working strain range (&#8764;800%) and quick response time (response time 211&#160;ms and recovery time 253&#160;ms, under 10% strain) to detect various macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;human motions, even under harsh conditions such as pronunciation and handwriting. The ADM gel can also be used as a humidity sensor to investigate humidity and human respiratory status, suggesting its practical application in personal health management. This study provides a novel strategy for the preparation of high&#8208;performance recycled gels and flexible sensors.

         <title>Hierarchies in Visual Pathway: Functions and Inspired Artificial Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of artificial intelligence has posed a challenge to machine vision based on conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits owing to its high latency and inefficient power consumption originating from the data shuffling between memory and computation units. Gaining more insight into the function of every part of the visual pathway for visual perception could bring the capabilities of machine vision in terms of robustness and generality. Hardware acceleration of more energy efficient and biorealistic artificial vision highly necessitates neuromorphic devices and circuits which are able to mimic the function of each part of visual pathway. In this paper, we review the structure and function of the entire class of visual neurons from retina to the primate visual cortex within reach (chapter 2). Based on the extraction of biological principles, the recent hardware implemented visual neurons located in different parts of the visual pathway are detailed discussed (chapter 3 and chapter 4). Furthermore, we attempt to provide valuable applications of inspired artificial vision in different scenarios (chapter 5). The functional description of the visual pathway and its inspired neuromorphic devices/circuits are expected to provide valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation artificial visual perception systems.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable And Efficient Fully &#928;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer via Internal Plasticization for Flexible Deep&#8208;blue Polymer Light&#8208;emitting Diodes with CIEy = 0.08</title>

Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long&#8208;time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge&#8208;transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep&#8208;blue PLEDs. Herein, we&#160;propose an internal plasticization strategy to introduce a phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF&#8208;MC4, PF&#8208;MC6, and PF&#8208;MC8) for narrowband deep&#8208;blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF&#8208;MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &gt; 25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission (PLQY &gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers. The PF&#8208;MC8&#8208;based PLEDs show deep&#8208;blue emission, which corresponds to CIE and EQE values of (0.16, 0.10) and 1.06%, respectively. Finally, the narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8764;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF&#8208;MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&#8722;2 at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long-time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge-transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;-conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep-blue PLEDs. Herein, we&#160;propose an internal plasticization strategy to introduce a phenyl-ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF-MC4, PF-MC6, and PF-MC8) for narrowband deep-blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4-(octyloxy)-9,9-diphenylfluoren-2,7-diyl]-co-[5-(octyloxy)-9,9-diphenylfluoren-2,7-diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF-MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &amp;gt; 25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep-blue emission (PLQY &amp;gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;-conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl-ester plasticizers.

         <title>Recent Progress in Functional Nanomaterials Towards The Storage, Separation, And Removal of Tritium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tritium is a sustainable next&#8208;generation prime fuel for generating nuclear energy through fusion reactions to fulfill the increasing global energy demand. Owing to the scarcity&#8211;high demand tradeoff, tritium must be bred inside a fusion reactor to ensure sustainability and must therefore be separated from its isotopes (protium and deuterium) in pure form, stored safely, and supplied on demand. Existing multistage isotope separation technologies exhibit low separation efficiency and require intensive energy inputs and large capital investments. Furthermore, tritium&#8208;contaminated heavy water constitutes a major fraction of nuclear waste, and accidents like the one at Fukushima Daiichi leave behind thousands of tons of diluted tritiated water, whose removal is beneficial from an environmental point of view. In this review, we discuss the recent progress and main research trends in hydrogen isotope storage and separation by focusing on the use of metal hydride (e.g., intermetallic, and high&#8208;entropy alloys), porous (e.g., zeolites and metal organic frameworks (MOFs)), and 2&#8208;D layered (e.g., graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), and MXenes) materials to separate and store tritium based on their diverse functionalities. Finally, the challenges and future directions for implementing tritium storage and separation are summarized in the reviewed materials.

         <title>A H2O&#8208;initiated Crosslinking Strategy for Ultrafine Nanoclusters Reinforced High Toughness Polymer&#8208;In&#8208;Plasticizer Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Incorporating plasticizers is an effective way to facilitate ions conduction in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, this conductivity enhancement often comes at the cost of reduced mechanical properties, which can make the electrolyte membrane more difficult to process and increase safety hazards. Here, we proposed a novel crosslinking strategy where metal alkoxy terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we use trimethylaluminum (TMA) functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to demonstrate that ultrafine Al&#8208;O nanoclusters can serve as nodes to crosslink PEO chains with a wide range of molecular weights from 10,000 to 8,000,000&#160;g mol&#8722;1. The crosslinked polymer network can incorporate a high concentration of plasticizers, with a total weight percentage over 75%, while still maintaining excellent stretchability (4640%) and toughness (3.87 &#215; 104&#160;kJ m&#8722;3). The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.41 mS cm&#8722;1), low interfacial resistance towards Li metal (48.1 &#937; cm2) and a wide electrochemical window (&gt; 4.8&#160;V versus Li+/Li) at 30&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/Li battery shows stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 98.6% (146.3 mAh g&#8722;1) over 1000 cycles at 1C (1C = 170 mAh g&#8722;1) at 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Large Magnetoresistance of Isolated Domain Walls in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation, manipulation, and sensing of magnetic domain walls are cornerstones in the design of more efficient spintronic devices. In this work, it is shown that the domain wall magnetoresistance in manganite perovskite nanowires can reach values in excess of 10% caused by the mistracking effect of the spin texture of the domain wall by the conduction electrons.








Abstract
Generation, manipulation, and sensing of magnetic domain walls are cornerstones in the design of efficient spintronic devices. Half&#8208;metals are amenable for this purpose as large low field magnetoresistance signals can be expected from spin accumulation at spin textures. Among half metals, La1&#8722;xSrxMnO3 (LSMO) manganites are considered as promising candidates for their robust half&#8208;metallic ground state, Curie temperature above room temperature (Tc = 360 K, for x = 1/3), and chemical stability. Yet domain wall magnetoresistance is poorly understood, with large discrepancies in the reported values and conflicting interpretation of experimental data due to the entanglement of various source of magnetoresistance, namely, spin accumulation, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and colossal magnetoresistance. In this work, the domain wall magnetoresistance is measured in LSMO cross&#8208;shape nanowires with single&#8208;domain walls nucleated across the current path. Magnetoresistance values above 10% are found to be originating at the spin accumulation caused by the mistracking effect of the spin texture of the domain wall by the conduction electrons. Fundamentally, this result shows the importance on non&#8208;adiabatic processes at spin textures despite the strong Hund coupling to the localized t2g electrons of the manganite. These large magnetoresistance values are high enough for encoding and reading magnetic bits in future oxide spintronic sensors.

         <title>How to Adequately Describe Full Range Intercalation&#8212;A Two&#8208;Sided Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate description of the cell voltage of an intercalation electrode succeeds by applying defect thermodynamics near the ordered compositions. At large deviations thermodynamic interpolation (as indicated in the figure) or non&#8208;ideal statistics is required. Literature data on nanocrystalline LixFePO4 are reproduced where the entire range is realized, but other materials can be described analogously (i, n, v, and p stand for interstitial Li+, excess electrons, Li+ vacancies, electron holes; C&#948; denotes the chemical capacitance; electronic defects are not shown in the figure).








Abstract
One of the key challenges in battery research is to quantitatively describe the intercalation storage capacity as a function of the reversible cell voltage. The reason that such endeavors are not yet very successful, lies in the lack of an adequate charge carrier treatment. Using the most challenging example of nanocrystalline lithium iron phosphate, where the full range from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is accessible without miscibility gap, this study shows how a quantitative description of literature results can be achieved even for such a huge window. For this purpose, point&#8208;defect thermodynamics is applied and the problem is tackled from the two end&#8208;member sides including saturation effects. A first, rather heuristic treatment interpolates in&#8208;between using the safe thermodynamic criterion of local phase stability. Already this straightforward approach works very satisfactorily. In order to also gain mechanistic insight, interactions among and between ions and electrons have to be taken account of. This study shows how to implement them into the analysis.

         <title>Implementing Logic Gates by DNA Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple logic gates are constructed via engineered DNA crystals. Their outputs are crystal formation; thus, can be easily observed. In addition to providing a useful biosensing platform, this work, more importantly, points to the potential of using algorithmic self&#8208;assembly as a way to assemble otherwise non&#8208;accessible, complicated crystal architectures.








Abstract
DNA self&#8208;assembly computation is attractive for its potential to perform massively parallel information processing at the molecular level while at the same time maintaining its natural biocompatibility. It has been extensively studied at the individual molecule level, but not as much as ensembles in 3D. Here, the feasibility of implementing logic gates, the basic computation operations, in large ensembles: macroscopic, engineered 3D DNA crystals is demonstrated. The building blocks are the recently developed DNA double crossover&#8208;like (DXL) motifs. They can associate with each other via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. Common logic gates are realized by encoding the inputs within the sticky ends of the motifs. The outputs are demonstrated through the formation of macroscopic crystals that can be easily observed. This study points to a new direction of construction of complex 3D crystal architectures and DNA&#8208;based biosensors with easy readouts.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Removable Solid Additives: Selective Interaction Contributes to Vertical Component Distributions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid additives with varied electrostatic potential and steric hinderance are introduced to investigate the impact of both evaporation dynamics and selective interaction on vertical component distribution. The removal of solid additives can drive the more strongly interacting component upward to the surface, delivering a high performance of 19.2%, among the highest efficiencies achieved in organic solar cells.








Abstract
Sequentially deposited organic solar cells (SD&#8208;OSCs) have attracted great attention owing to their ability in achieving a more favorable, vertically phase&#8208;separated morphology to avoid the accumulation of counter charges at absorber/transporting layer interfaces. However, the processing of SD&#8208;OSCs is still quite challenging in preventing the penetration of small&#8208;molecule acceptors into the polymer donor layer via erosion or swelling. Herein, solid additives (SAs) with varied electrostatic potential distributions and steric hinderance are introduced into SD&#8208;OSCs to investigate the effect of evaporation dynamics and selective interaction on vertical component distribution. Multiple modelings indicate that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction dominates the interactions between aromatic SAs and active layer components. Among them, p&#8208;dibromobenzene shows a stronger interaction with the donor while 2&#8208;chloronaphthalene (2&#8208;CN) interacts more preferably with acceptor. Combining the depth&#8208;dependent morphological study aided by multiple X&#8208;ray scattering methods, it is concluded that the evaporation of SAs can drive the stronger&#8208;interaction component upward to the surface, while having minor impact on the overall molecular packing. Ultimately, the 2&#8208;CN&#8208;treated devices with reduced acceptor concentration at the bottom surface deliver a high power conversion efficiency of 19.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of applying selective interactions to improve the vertical morphology of OSCs by using SAs with proper structure.

         <title>A Synthetic Signaling Network Imitating the Action of&#160;Immune Cells in Response to Bacterial Metabolism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology aims to replicate useful biological functions, but mimicking complex behaviors such as immunity remains elusive. In this work, a consortium of DNA particles and liposomes is shown to detect bacteria, trap them, and expose them to antibiotics, imitating a response of the immune system. These results demonstrate the bottom&#8208;up design of advanced life&#8208;like responses and outline new antimicrobial strategies. 








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology allows to replicate many basic biological functions in artificial&#8208;cell&#8208;like devices. To mimic more complex behaviors, however, artificial cells would need to perform many of these functions in a synergistic and coordinated fashion, which remains elusive. Here, a sophisticated biological response is considered, namely the capture and deactivation of pathogens by neutrophil immune cells, through the process of netosis. A consortium consisting of two synthetic agents is designed&#8212;responsive DNA&#8208;based particles and antibiotic&#8208;loaded lipid vesicles&#8212;whose coordinated action mimics the sought immune&#8208;like response when triggered by bacterial metabolism. The artificial netosis&#8208;like response emerges from a series of interlinked sensing and communication pathways between the live and synthetic agents, and translates into both physical and chemical antimicrobial actions, namely bacteria immobilization and exposure to antibiotics. The results demonstrate how advanced life&#8208;like responses can be prescribed with a relatively small number of synthetic molecular components, and outlines a new strategy for artificial&#8208;cell&#8208;based antimicrobial solutions.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Chemically Bonded 2D/2D Covalent Organic Frameworks/O&#8208;Vacancy WO3 Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed 2D/2D covalent organic framework (COF)/WO3&#8208;Ov Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is synthesized for highly effective and long&#8208;term photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and overall water splitting, exceeding most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the outstanding activity is mainly attributed to the suitable band level, surface oxygen vacancies, robust build&#8208;in electric field, and strong 2D/2D interfacial coupling with precisely connected chemical bonds.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great promise for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via water splitting. However, the four&#8208;electron oxidation of water remains elusive toward oxygen evolution. Enabling this water oxidation pathway is critical to improve the yield and maximize atom utilization efficiency. A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed for overcoming fundamental issues in COF&#8208;based photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS), such as inefficient light absorption, charge recombination, and poor water oxidation ability. It is shown that the construction of a novel 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction through in situ growth of COFs on the O&#8208;vacancy WO3 nanosheets (Ov&#8208;WO3) via the W&#63743;O&#63743;C chemical bond can remarkably promote photocatalytic OWS. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the enhanced built&#8208;in electric field by the interfacial W&#63743;O&#63743;C bond, the strong water oxidation ability of Ov&#8208;WO3, and the ultrathin structure of TSCOF, both separation and utilization efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs can be significantly enhanced. An impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution half&#8208;rection rate of 593&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and overall water splitting rate of 146 (hydrogen) and 68 (oxygen) &#181;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 are achieved on the COF&#8208;WO3 (TSCOFW) composite. This 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with two&#8208;step excitation and precisely cascaded charge&#8208;transfer pathway makes it responsible for the efficient solar&#8208;driven OWS without a sacrificial agent.

         <title>Paintable Physical Unclonable Functions using DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA liquid crystals (LCs), which are extracted from nature, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, are used as a paint for anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. The entropy&#8208;driven instability in the evaporation process of DNA LCs induces a stochastic birefringent pattern that provides high&#8208;level security codes based on physical unclonable functions. The platform can allow the fabrication&#160;of protective barriers with a simple method, brushstrokes.








Abstract
Controversy over artwork's authenticity is ongoing despite numerous technologies for copyright protection. Artists should build their own ways to protect the authority, but these are still open to piracy. Here, a platform is proposed for developing anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), in an artist&#8208;friendly manner, brushstrokes. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is natural, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, can be applied as a paint that shows entropy&#8208;driven buckling instability of the liquid crystal phase. Brushed and wholly dried DNA exhibits line&#8208;shaped zig&#8208;zag textures with inherent randomness as a source of the PUF, and its primary performance and reliability are systematically examined. This breakthrough enables the utilization of these drawings in a wider range of applications.

         <title>A Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayer high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co&#8208;ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high&#8208;entropy material structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in 1&#160;m KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high&#8208;entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.

Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high-entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neonatal&#8208;Tissue&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicle Therapy (NEXT): A Potent Strategy for Precision Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large amounts of extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be produced from desired tissues with high yield/purity and low time/cost. Tissue&#8208;derived EVs exert tissue repair effects in an age&#8208; and donor tissue type specific manner, and neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs have favorable repair potential in diverse forms of tissue injury. Neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EV therapy (NEXT) may provide a new avenue for precision tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;based therapies have emerged as a promising means in regenerative medicine. However, the conventional EV therapy strategy displays some limitations, such as inefficient EV production and lack of tissue&#8208;specific repair effects. Here, it is reported that neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EV therapy (NEXT) is a potent strategy for precision tissue repair. In brief, large amounts of EVs with higher yield/purity can be readily isolated from desired tissues with less production time/cost compared to the conventional cell&#8208;culture&#8208;based method. Moreover, source factors, such as age and tissue type, can affect the repair efficacy of such tissue&#8208;derived EVs in different tissue injury models (skin wounds and acute kidney injury), and neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs show superior tissue repair potency compared with adult&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs. Different age&#8208; or tissue&#8208;type&#8208;derived EVs have distinct composition (e.g., protein) signatures that are likely due to the diverse metabolic patterns of the donor tissues, which may contribute to the specific repair action modes of NEXT in different types of tissue injury. Furthermore, neonatal&#8208;tissue&#8208;derived EVs can be incorporated with bioactive materials for advanced tissue repair. This study highlights that the NEXT strategy may provide a new avenue for precision tissue repair in many types of tissue injury.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Robotics Approach for Targeting Fungal Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microrobotic platform is developed using iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based nanozymes to achieve precise spatial targeting and localized catalysis for rapid fungal killing. These nanozyme&#8208;microrobots demonstrate programmable motions, controllable catalysis, and selective binding to fungi. Using tissue infection models, localized delivery of nanozymes and targeted fungal eradication is shown, providing a unique antifungal modality for pathogen killing at the infection site.








Abstract
Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off&#8208;target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, a nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotic platform is developed that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine&#8208;scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (Candida albicans) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS&#8208;mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding to fungi, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo&#8208;like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to Candida&#8208;infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on&#8208;site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 min. This nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotics approach provides a uniquely effective and targeted therapeutic modality for pathogen elimination at the infection site.

         <title>Cancer Models on Chip: Paving the Way to Large&#8208;Scale Trial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ToC devices may become state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art models for pharmaceutical oncology trials. To achieve this, the ToC should present reliability in mimicking the TME and monitoring biophysical and chemical signals using sensors and actuators. The translation of this technology to the industrial scale must take into consideration scalability and the standardization of the materials/biomaterials, architectures, actuators, and integration with analytical tools.








Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. 3D tumor&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (ToC) models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment (TME), the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic ToC models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.

         <title>Oxidized Activated Charcoal Nanozymes: Synthesis, and Optimization for In Vitro and In Vivo Bioactivity for Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes synthesized via the oxidation of coconut&#8208;derived activated charcoal afford markable protection against oxidative injury in an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury. By tuning the oxidation process, smaller, more homogeneous nanomaterials containing free&#8208;radical&#8208;quenching quinone active sites are targeted for enhanced bioactivity. Such findings highlight the features that drive the oxidative power of these nanozymes.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic nanozymes have recently been employed as promising antioxidant nanotherapeutics due to their distinct properties. The structural features responsible for the efficacy of these nanomaterials as antioxidants are, however, poorly understood. Here, the process&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance properties of coconut&#8208;derived oxidized activated charcoal (cOAC) nano&#8208;SOD mimetics are studied by analyzing how modifications to the nanomaterial's synthesis impact the size, as well as the elemental and electrochemical properties of the particles. These properties are then correlated to the in vitro antioxidant bioactivity of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized cOACs (PEG&#8208;cOAC). Chemical oxidative treatment methods that afford smaller, more homogeneous cOAC nanoparticles with higher levels of quinone functionalization show enhanced protection against oxidative damage in bEnd.3 murine endothelioma cells. In an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and oxidative vascular injury, PEG&#8208;cOACs restore cerebral perfusion rapidly to the same extent as the former nanotube&#8208;derived PEG&#8208;hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) with a single intravenous injection. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how carbon nanozyme syntheses can be tailored for improved antioxidant bioactivity, and set the stage for translation of medical applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metastable Hidden Skyrmion Phase in the Mott Insulator Cu2OSeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored laser pulses are found to drive the multiferroic insulating material Cu2OSeO3 into a metastable hidden phase hosting magnetic skyrmions. Such a phase cannot be accessed otherwise, via adiabatic protocols sweeping temperature or magnetic fields. These results highlight the potential of non&#8208;adiabatic stimuli to control magnetism by directly modifying the free energy landscape at ultrafast timescales.








Abstract
The discovery of a novel long&#8208;lived metastable skyrmion phase in the multiferroic insulator Cu2OSeO3 visualized with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy for magnetic fields below the equilibrium skyrmion pocket is reported. This phase can be accessed by exciting the sample non&#8208;adiabatically with near&#8208;infrared femtosecond laser pulses and cannot be reached by any conventional field&#8208;cooling protocol, referred as a hidden phase. From the strong wavelength dependence of the photocreation process and via spin&#8208;dynamics simulations, the magnetoelastic effect is identified as the most likely photocreation mechanism. This effect results in a transient modification of the magnetic free energy landscape extending the equilibrium skyrmion pocket to lower magnetic fields. The evolution of the photoinduced phase is monitored for over 15 min and no decay is found. Because such a time is much longer than the duration of any transient effect induced by a laser pulse in a material, it is assumed that the newly discovered skyrmion state is stable for practical purposes, thus breaking ground for a novel approach to control magnetic state on demand at ultrafast timescales and drastically reducing heat dissipation relevant for next&#8208;generation spintronic&#160;devices.

&lt;p&gt;Tailored laser pulses are found to drive the multiferroic insulating material Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into a metastable hidden phase hosting magnetic skyrmions. Such a phase cannot be accessed otherwise, via adiabatic protocols sweeping temperature or magnetic fields. These results highlight the potential of non-adiabatic stimuli to control magnetism by directly modifying the free energy landscape at ultrafast timescales.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a novel long-lived metastable skyrmion phase in the multiferroic insulator Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OSeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; visualized with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy for magnetic fields below the equilibrium skyrmion pocket is reported. This phase can be accessed by exciting the sample non-adiabatically with near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses and cannot be reached by any conventional field-cooling protocol, referred as a hidden phase. From the strong wavelength dependence of the photocreation process and via spin-dynamics simulations, the magnetoelastic effect is identified as the most likely photocreation mechanism. This effect results in a transient modification of the magnetic free energy landscape extending the equilibrium skyrmion pocket to lower magnetic fields. The evolution of the photoinduced phase is monitored for over 15 min and no decay is found. Because such a time is much longer than the duration of any transient effect induced by a laser pulse in a material, it is assumed that the newly discovered skyrmion state is stable for practical purposes, thus breaking ground for a novel approach to control magnetic state on demand at ultrafast timescales and drastically reducing heat dissipation relevant for next-generation spintronic&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fundamentals of Skin Bioimpedances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multilayer structure of skin and the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, complicate the electrical characterization of skin. In this work,&#160;the theoretical framework and the design strategies for overcoming these long&#8208;standing issues are established. The results may advance bioimpedance for skin cancer diagnosis or for assessing type&#8208;2 diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular risk.








Abstract
The bioimpedances of tissues beyond the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, contain crucial clinical information. Nevertheless, bioimpedance measurements of both the viable skin and the adipose tissue are not widely used, mainly because of the complex multilayered skin structure and the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum. Here, a theoretical framework is established for analyzing the impedances of multilayered tissues and, in particular, of skin. Then, strategies are determined for the system&#8208;level design of electrodes and electronics, which minimize 4&#8208;wire (or tetrapolar) measurement errors even in the presence of a top insulating tissue, thus enabling non&#8208;invasive characterizations of tissues beyond the stratum corneum. As an example, non&#8208;invasive measurements of bioimpedances of living tissues are demonstrated in the presence of parasitic impedances which are much (e.g., up to 350 times) higher than the bioimpedances of the living tissues beyond the stratum corneum, independently on extreme variations of the barrier (tape stripping) or of the skin&#8211;electrode contact impedances (sweat). The results can advance the development of bioimpedance systems for the characterization of viable skin and adipose tissues in several applications, including transdermal drug delivery and the assessment of skin cancer, obesity, dehydration, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk, and multipotent adult stem cells.

         <title>Plasmonic Coupling on an Optical Microfiber Surface: Enabling Single&#8208;Molecule and Noninvasive Dopamine Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical microfiber biosensor for dopamine (DA) detection based on the DA&#8208;binding&#8208;induced aptamer conformational transitions that occur at plasmonic coupling sites on a double&#8208;amplified nanointerface is demonstrated. The sensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity when detecting DA molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level. It provides an approach for overcoming optical device sensitivity limits, extending optical fiber single&#8208;molecule detection to a small molecule range.








Abstract
Optical fibers can be effective biosensors when employed in early&#8208;stage diagnostic point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices as they can avoid interference from molecules with similar redox potentials. Nevertheless, their sensitivity needs to be improved for real&#8208;world applications, especially for small&#8208;molecule detection. This work demonstrates an optical microfiber biosensor for dopamine (DA) detection based on the DA&#8208;binding&#8208;induced aptamer conformational transitions that occur at plasmonic coupling sites on a double&#8208;amplified nanointerface. The sensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity when detecting DA molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level; additionally, this work provides an approach for overcoming optical device sensitivity limits, further extending optical fiber single&#8208;molecule detection to a small molecule range (e.g., DA and metal ions). The selective energy enhancement and signal amplification at the binding sites effectively avoid nonspecific amplification of the whole fiber surface which may lead to false&#8208;positive results. The sensor can detect single&#8208;molecule DA signals in body&#8208;fluids. It can detect the released extracellular DA levels and monitor the DA oxidation process. An appropriate aptamer replacement allows the sensor to be used for the detection of other target small molecules and ions at the single&#8208;molecule level. This technology offers alternative opportunities for developing noninvasive early&#8208;stage diagnostic point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices and flexible single&#8208;molecule detection techniques in theoretical research.

         <title>Mechanochemical Degradation of Poly(vinyl chloride) into Nontoxic Water&#8208;Soluble Products via Sequential Dechlorination, Heterolytic Oxirane Ring&#8208;Opening, and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical degradation of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) into water&#8208;soluble biocompatible products is demonstrated. The solid&#8208;state mechanochemical dechlorination followed by epoxidation offers a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional solution&#8208;based reaction. This work exploits the force&#8208;induced heterolytic oxirane ring&#8208;opening which aids PVC degradation into smaller fragments upon hydrolysis.








Abstract
As one of the most widely used commodity plastics, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is extensively used worldwide, yet is difficult to recycle and is often discarded immediately after use. Its end&#8208;of&#8208;life treatment often generates toxic hydrogen chloride and dioxins that pose a critical threat to ecosystems. To address this challenge, the mechanochemical degradation of PVC into water&#8208;soluble biocompatible products is presented herein. Oxirane mechanophores are strategically introduced into the polymeric backbone via sequential dechlorination followed by epoxidation. The oxirane mechanophore in the polymer backbone undergoes a force&#8208;induced heterolytic ring&#8208;opening to carbonyl ylide intermediates, which eventually generates acetals during the course of the reaction. The subsequent hydrolysis of the backbone acetals affords the scission of the polymeric chain into water&#8208;soluble low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fragments. Combined with its low cytotoxicity and phytotoxicity, this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical degradation process offers a green alternative for the degradation of PVC.

         <title>Does Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Subdue Issues of Zn Batteries?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to wide electrochemical stability window, water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISEs) are attracting considerable interest. WISEs display distinctive physical and electrochemical properties compared to conventional electrolyte that makes them a promising electrolyte to be used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZnBs). This review provides overview about issues in ZnBs, a historical, basic, thermodynamic, and kinetic overview about WISEs and finally discusses their use in ZnBs.









Abstract
Zn&#8208;metal batteries (ZnBs) are safe and sustainable because of their operability in aqueous electrolytes, abundance of Zn, and recyclability. However, the thermodynamic instability of Zn metal in aqueous electrolytes is a major bottleneck for its commercialization. As such, Zn deposition (Zn2+ &#8594; Zn(s)) is continuously accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ &#8594; H2) and dendritic growth that further accentuate the HER. Consequently, the local pH around the Zn electrode increases and promotes the formation of inactive and/or poorly conductive Zn passivation species (Zn + 2H2O &#8594; Zn(OH)2 + H2) on the Zn. This aggravates the consumption of Zn and electrolyte and degrades the performance of ZnB. To propel HER beyond its thermodynamic potential (0&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 0), the concept of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8208;electrolyte (WISE) has been employed in ZnBs. Since the publication of the first article on WISE for ZnB in 2016, this research area has progressed continuously. Here, an overview and discussion on this promising research direction for accelerating the maturity of ZnBs is provided. The review briefly describes the current issues with conventional aqueous electrolyte in ZnBs, including a historic overview and basic understanding of WISE. Furthermore, the application scenarios of WISE in ZnBs are detailed, with the description of various key mechanisms (e.g., side reactions, Zn electrodeposition, anions or cations intercalation in metal oxide or graphite, and ion transport at low temperature).

The electrochemical performance of MnO2 differs with its polymorph states. By tuning the temperature, the deposited phase can be manipulated from &#603;&#8208;MnO2 to &#947;&#8208;MnO2 with &#8776;200&#8208;fold enhancement in conductivity for both MnO2&#8211;H2 and MnO2&#8211;Zn aqueous batteries. Such polymorph tuning technologies have validated the application potential for ultrahigh normalized areal loading electrodes and good cyclability at high areal capacities.








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based aqueous batteries utilizing Mn2+/MnO2 redox reactions are promising choices for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high theoretical specific capacity, high power capability, low&#8208;cost, and intrinsic safety with water&#8208;based electrolytes. However, the application of such systems is hindered by the insulating nature of deposited MnO2, resulting in low normalized areal loading (0.005&#8211;0.05&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) during the charge/discharge cycle. In this work, the electrochemical performance of various MnO2 polymorphs in Mn2+/MnO2 redox reactions is investigated, and &#603;&#8208;MnO2 with low conductivity is determined to be the primary electrochemically deposited phase in normal acidic aqueous electrolyte. It is found that increasing the temperature can change the deposited phase from &#603;&#8208;MnO2 with low conductivity to &#947;&#8208;MnO2 with two order of magnitude increase in conductivity. It is demonstrated that the highly conductive &#947;&#8208;MnO2 can be effectively exploited for ultrahigh areal loading electrode, and a normalized areal loading of 33&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. At a mild temperature of 50&#160;&#176;C, cells are cycled with an ultrahigh areal loading of 20&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than previous studies) for over 200 cycles with only 13% capacity loss.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Stalactite Nanopores for Biosensing and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a nature&#8208;inspired method for stalactite nanopores growth using atomic layer deposition of hafnium dioxide at the orifice of templated silicon nitride apertures. These nanostructures feature reduced sensing regions of 2&#8208;dimensional material nanopores with the asymmetry of capillaries, offering ionic selectivity, stability, and scalability. This nanopore platform has the potential in nanofluidic research: biosensing, energy science, and filtration. 








Abstract
Nature provides a wide range of self&#8208;assembled structures from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Under the right thermodynamic conditions and with the appropriate material supply, structures like stalactites, icicles, and corals can grow. However, the natural growth process is time&#8208;consuming. This work demonstrates a fast, nature&#8208;inspired method for growing stalactite nanopores using heterogeneous atomic deposition of hafnium dioxide at the orifice of templated silicon nitride apertures. The stalactite nanostructures combine the benefits of reduced sensing region typically for 2&#8208;dimensional material nanopores with the asymmetric geometry of capillaries, resulting in ionic selectivity, stability, and scalability. The proposed growing method provides an adaptable nanopore platform for basic and applied nanofluidic research, including biosensing, energy science, and filtration technologies.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Resonant Exciton&#8208;Trion Conversion in Electrically Modulated Atomically Thin WS2 at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excitonic resonance in atomically thin semiconductors has the potential to enable highly tunable and ultra&#8208;compact optical devices. However, insufficient light&#8208;matter interactions have hindered the observation of trionic phenomenon and the development of excitonic devices for dynamic applications. To overcome this limitation, an optical cavity is engaged, resulting in greatly enhanced exciton&#8208;trion conversion at room temperature and enabling both amplitude and phase tuning in monolayer tungsten disulfide.








Abstract
Excitonic resonance in atomically thin semiconductors offers a favorite platform to study 2D nanophotonics in both classical and quantum regimes and promises potentials for highly tunable and ultra&#8208;compact optical devices. The understanding of charge density dependent exciton&#8208;trion conversion is the key for revealing the underlaying physics of optical tunability. Nevertheless, the insufficient and inefficient light&#8208;matter interactions hinder the observation of trionic phenomenon and the development of excitonic devices for dynamic power&#8208;efficient electro&#8208;optical applications. Here, by engaging an optical cavity with atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), greatly enhanced exciton&#8208;trion conversion is demonstrated at room temperature (RT) and achieve electrical modulation of reflectivity of &#8776;40% at exciton and 7% at trion state, which correspondingly enables a broadband large phase tuning in monolayer tungsten disulfide. Besides the absorptive conversion, &#8776;100% photoluminescence conversion from excitons to trions is observed at RT, illustrating a clear physical mechanism of an efficient exciton&#8208;trion conversion for extraordinary optical performance. The results indicate that both excitons and trions can play significant roles in electrical modulation of the optical parameters of TMDCs at RT. The work shows the real possibility for realizing electrical tunable and multi&#8208;functional ultra&#8208;thin optical devices using 2D materials.

Abstract
Two multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are presented and it is shown how further borylation of a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, DIDOBNA&#8208;N, both blueshifts and narrows the emission producing a new near&#8208;UV MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N, are shown. DIDOBNA&#8208;N emits bright blue light (&#934;PL = 444&#160;nm, FWHM = 64&#160;nm, &#934;PL = 81%, &#964;d = 23 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on this twisted MR&#8208;TADF compound shows a very high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 15.3% for a device with CIEy of 0.073. The fused planar MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N shows efficient and narrowband near&#8208;UV emission (&#955;PL = 402&#160;nm, FWHM = 19&#160;nm, &#934;PL = 74.7%, &#964;d = 133 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The best OLED with MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N, doped in a co&#8208;host, shows the highest efficiency reported for a near&#8208;UV OLED at 16.2%. With a CIEy coordinate of 0.049, this device also shows the bluest EL reported for a MR&#8208;TADF OLED to date.

         <title>Materials for Cell Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;surface&#8208;associated materials (e.g., nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings) can prevent cell damage or loss, control cell transport and biodistribution, mask cell&#8208;surface antigens, regulate cell phenotypes, and deliver therapeutic agents to target&#160;tissues.








Abstract
Cell therapies are emerging as a promising new therapeutic modality in medicine, generating effective treatments for previously incurable diseases. Clinical success of cell therapies has energized the field of cellular engineering, spurring further exploration of novel approaches to improve their therapeutic performance. Engineering of cell surfaces using natural and synthetic materials has emerged as a valuable tool in this endeavor. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of technologies for decorating cell surfaces with various materials including nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings, focusing on the ways in which surface decorations enhance carrier cells and therapeutic effects. Key benefits of surface&#8208;modified cells include protecting the carrier cell, reducing particle clearance, enhancing cell trafficking, masking cell&#8208;surface antigens, modulating inflammatory phenotype of carrier cells, and delivering therapeutic agents to target tissues. While most of these technologies are still in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, the promising therapeutic efficacy of these constructs from in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies has laid a strong foundation for eventual clinical translation.

&lt;p&gt;Cell-surface-associated materials (e.g., nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings) can prevent cell damage or loss, control cell transport and biodistribution, mask cell-surface antigens, regulate cell phenotypes, and deliver therapeutic agents to target&#160;tissues.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell therapies are emerging as a promising new therapeutic modality in medicine, generating effective treatments for previously incurable diseases. Clinical success of cell therapies has energized the field of cellular engineering, spurring further exploration of novel approaches to improve their therapeutic performance. Engineering of cell surfaces using natural and synthetic materials has emerged as a valuable tool in this endeavor. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of technologies for decorating cell surfaces with various materials including nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings, focusing on the ways in which surface decorations enhance carrier cells and therapeutic effects. Key benefits of surface-modified cells include protecting the carrier cell, reducing particle clearance, enhancing cell trafficking, masking cell-surface antigens, modulating inflammatory phenotype of carrier cells, and delivering therapeutic agents to target tissues. While most of these technologies are still in the proof-of-concept stage, the promising therapeutic efficacy of these constructs from in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies has laid a strong foundation for eventual clinical translation. Cell surface engineering with materials can imbue a diverse range of advantages for cell therapy, creating opportunities for innovative functionalities, for improved therapeutic efficacy, and transforming the fundamental and translational landscape of cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Filler&#8208;Free PEDOT:PSS Hydrogels with Ultrahigh Electrical Conductivity Induced by Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Promoted Ion Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;halides&#8208;doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxy thiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels with an ultrahigh electrical conductivity up to 547 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 have been prepared that exhibited high performance in thermoelectrics, electromagnetic shielding, Joule heating, and sensing.








Abstract
Highly conductive hydrogels with biotissue&#8208;like mechanical properties are of great interest in the emerging field of hydrogel bioelectronics due to their good biocompatibility, deformability, and stability. Fully polymeric hydrogels may exhibit comparable Young's modulus to biotissues. However, most of these filler&#8208;free hydrogels have a low electrical conductivity of &lt;10 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, which limits their wide applications of them in digital circuits or bioelectronic devices. In this work, a series of metal&#8208;halides&#8208;doped poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels with an ultrahigh electrical conductivity up to 547 S&#160;cm&#8722;1 is reported, which is 1.5 times to 104 times higher than previously reported filler&#8208;free polymeric hydrogels. Theoretical calculation demonstrated that the ion exchange between PEDOT:PSS and the metal halides played an important role to promote phase separation in the hydrogels, which thus leads to ultrahigh electrical conductivity. The high electrical conductivity resulted in multifunctional hydrogels with high performance in thermoelectrics, electromagnetic shielding, Joule heating, and sensing. Such flexible and stretchable hydrogels with ultrahigh electrical conductivity and stability upon various deformations are promising for soft bioelectronics devices and wearable electronics.

         <title>Multifunctional Magnetic Oxide&#8208;MoS2 Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exotic functionalities of transition metal oxides are appealing to multifunctional devices if integrated with low&#8208;dimensional materials on Si&#8208;based platforms. In this study, heterostructures of MoS2 and magnetic Sr&#8208;doped LaMnO3 are achieved on Si using a freestanding form of Sr&#8208;doped LaMnO3. The multifunctionality of the heterostructures is demonstrated based on three applications, including field&#8208;effect transistors, photodiodes, and magnetoresponsive heterostructure devices.








Abstract
Correlated oxides and related heterostructures are intriguing for developing future multifunctional devices by exploiting their exotic properties, but their integration with other materials, especially on Si&#8208;based platforms, is challenging. Here, van der Waals heterostructures of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) , a correlated manganite perovskite, and MoS2 are demonstrated on Si substrates with multiple functions. To overcome the problems due to the incompatible growth process, technologies involving freestanding LSMO membranes and van der Waals force&#8208;mediated transfer are used to fabricate the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures exhibit a gate&#8208;tunable rectifying behavior, based on which metal&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MESFETs) with on&#8208;off ratios of over 104 can be achieved. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures can function as photodiodes displaying considerable open&#8208;circuit voltages and photocurrents. In addition, the colossal magnetoresistance of LSMO endows the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures with an electrically tunable magnetoresponse at room temperature. This work not only proves the applicability of the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure devices on Si&#8208;based platform but also demonstrates a paradigm to create multifunctional heterostructures from materials with disparate properties.

         <title>Microporogen&#8208;Structured Collagen Matrices for Embedded Bioprinting of Tumor Models for Immuno&#8208;Oncology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microporous collagen matrix is developed for embedded printing of a 3D melanoma tumor model. This microporogen&#8208;structured matrix exhibits a fibrillar collagen type&#8208;I network akin to that observed in vivo. Printed tumor cells remain viable and proliferate, while antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells incorporated in the matrix migrate to the tumor site, where they induce cell death.








Abstract
Embedded bioprinting enables the rapid design and fabrication of complex tissues that recapitulate in vivo microenvironments. However, few biological matrices enable good print fidelity, while simultaneously facilitate cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Here, a new microporogen&#8208;structured (&#181;POROS) matrix for embedded bioprinting is introduced, in which matrix rheology, printing behavior, and porosity are tailored by adding sacrificial microparticles composed of a gelatin&#8211;chitosan complex to a prepolymer collagen solution. To demonstrate its utility, a 3D tumor model is created via embedded printing of a murine melanoma cell ink within the &#181;POROS collagen matrix at 4 &#176;C. The collagen matrix is subsequently crosslinked around the microparticles upon warming to 21&#160;&#176;C, followed by their melting and removal at 37&#160;&#176;C. This process results in a &#181;POROS matrix with a fibrillar collagen type&#8208;I network akin to that observed in vivo. Printed tumor cells remain viable and proliferate, while antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells incorporated in the matrix migrate to the tumor site, where they induce cell death. The integration of the &#181;POROS matrix with embedded bioprinting opens new avenues for creating complex tissue microenvironments in vitro that may find widespread use in drug discovery, disease modeling, and tissue engineering for therapeutic use.

         <title>PAF&#8208;6 Doped with Phosphoric Acid through Alkaline Nitrogen Atoms Boosting High&#8208;Temperature Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes for High Performance of Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAF&#8208;6&#160;with ordered porous structure and abundant alkaline sites&#160;are doped with phosphoric acid to obtain PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA. It is applied to the OPBI&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membrane toward superb mechanical properties and excellent proton conduction performance. The peak power density of the H2/O2 fuel cell at 200&#160;&#176;C reaches 437.7&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 with the catalyst Pt dosage only 0.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) can offer improved energy efficiency and tolerance to fuel/air impurities. The high expense of the high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membranes (HT&#8208;PEMs) and their low durability at high temperature still impede their further practical applications. In this work, a phosphoric acid (PA)&#8208;doped porous aromatic framework&#160;(PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA) is incorporated into poly[2,2&#8242;&#8208;(p&#8208;oxydiphenylene)&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;benzimidazole] (OPBI) to fabricate novel PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI composite HT&#8208;PEMs through solution&#8208;casting. The alkaline nitrogen structure in PAF&#8208;6 can be protonated with PA to provide proton hopping sites, and its porous structure can enhance the PA retention in the membranes, thus creating fast pathways for proton transfer. The hydrogen bond interaction between the rigid PAF&#8208;6 and OPBI can also enhance the mechanical properties and chemical stability of the composite membranes. Consequently, PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI exhibits&#160;an optimal proton conductivity of 0.089 S cm&#8722;1 at 200&#160;&#176;C, and peak power density of 437.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 (Pt: 0.3 mg cm&#8722;2), which is significantly higher than that of the OPBI. &#160; The PAF&#8208;6&#8208;PA/OPBI provides&#160;a novel strategy for the practical application of PBI&#8208;based HT&#8208;PEMs.

Consequently, PAF-6-PA/OPBI exhibits&#160;an optimal proton conductivity of 0.089 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 200&#160;&#176;C, and peak power density of 437.7&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (Pt: 0.3 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is significantly higher than that of the OPBI. &#160; The PAF-6-PA/OPBI provides&#160;a novel strategy for the practical application of PBI-based HT-PEMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Physiological Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks exhibiting significant advantages for developing flexible/stretchable physiological sensors. This review discusses structure, operation, critical features, a wide spectrum of physiological sensing mechanisms and uses, as well as major challenges and opportunities for flexible/stretchable OECTs, particularly for biochemical and bioelectrical sensor applications.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit significant advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the basis of the switching behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V), and high transconductance (in millisiemens range). During the past few years, significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensors has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principles, materials, and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of quantum applications relating to types of qubits that rely on development and control of quantum material systems and their respective device architectures is presented. The success of quantum technology rapid growth lies in the bottom&#8208;up pull of qubit characteristics in the manifestation of quantum behavior discovery.








Abstract
A broad perspective of quantum technology state of the art is provided and critical stumbling blocks for quantum technology development are identified. Innovations in demonstrating and understanding electron entanglement phenomena using bulk and low&#8208;dimensional materials and structures are summarized. Correlated photon&#8208;pair generation via processes such as nonlinear optics is discussed. Application of qubits to current and future high&#8208;impact quantum technology development is presented. Approaches for realizing unique qubit features for large&#8208;scale encrypted communication, sensing, computing, and other technologies are still evolving; thus, materials innovation is crucially important. A perspective on materials modeling approaches for quantum technology acceleration that incorporate physics&#8208;based AI/ML, integrated with quantum metrology is discussed.

Inspired by a world entering a quantum age, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop framework is presented, which addresses key challenges and opportunities to overcome in the manufacturing of quantum materials.








Abstract
The quantum age is just around the corner. As quantum systems become more stable, robust, and mainstream, tackling the challenge of high&#8208;throughput manufacturing will require further developments in materials synthesis, characterization, assembly, and diagnostics. As the building blocks of future technologies scale down to atomic and molecular scales, a paradigm shift in manufacturing will begin to take shape. Inspired by a quantum manufacturing world that elevates the Materials Genome Initiative to the next level, a &#8220;human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop&#8221; framework for high&#8208;throughput manufacturing, which addresses key opportunities and challenges to be overcome, is outlined.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer conceptual novelties and provide unique platforms for exploring fundamental science questions and transformational next&#8208;generation technologies. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work focused on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory paradigm. The image highlights how constant energy surfaces in topological materials differ fundamentally from those in normal materials.








Abstract
Interest in topological materials continues to grow unabated in view of their conceptual novelties as well as their potential as platforms for transformational new technologies. Electronic states in a topological material are robust against perturbations and support unconventional electromagnetic responses. The first&#8208;principles band&#8208;theory paradigm has been a key player in the field by providing successful prediction of many new classes of topological materials. This perspective presents a cross section&#160;through the recent work on understanding the role of geometry and topology in generating topological states and their responses to external stimuli, and as a basis for connecting theory and experiment within the band theory framework. In this work, effective strategies for topological materials discovery and impactful directions for future topological materials research are also commented.

Quantum Applications
In article number 2201064, Ajit K. Roy and co&#8208;workers present a perspective of quantum technology state of the art wherein critical stumbling blocks for quantum technology development are identified. As represented in the cover, atomic defects are created in a transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) thin film with a specialized tip in an atomic force microscope. AFM tip tracing indicates atomic&#8208;scale localization of materials states at the defect location. These controlled and localized defect sites are the source of quantum signal generation under a biased field.

         <title>Through the Lens of a Momentum Microscope: Viewing Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Phenomena in 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, time&#8208;resolved momentum&#8208;microscopy is highlighted as a powerful new technique for characterizing photoexcited two&#8208;dimensional materials in momentum&#8208;space. The recent scientific progress that is&#160;made thanks to this technique is surveyed. The future directions in which it will be impactful are outlined: the dynamics of photoexcitations, and the control of the band&#8208;structure by Floquet band engineering.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their 2D limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin&#8208;physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many 2D semiconductors and semi&#8208;metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, the recent advances made in studying out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, light&#8208;induced, phenomena in these materials are reviewed using powerful, surface&#8208;sensitive, time&#8208;resolved photoemission&#8208;based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi&#8208;dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy. The advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials are discussed. Then, the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements are projected for studying the physics of 2D materials and the opportunities to engineer their band&#8208;structure and band&#8208;topology by laser fields.

         <title>Magnetic Topological Insulator Heterostructures: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of topology and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states and exotic physical effects. An overview of proximity&#8208;coupled magnetic topological insulator heterostructures, involving modulation doping, magnetic insulators, antiferromagnets, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, is given. They form a platform for exploring emergent phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect, real&#8208;space topological spin textures, and interfacial exchange coupling.








Abstract
Topological insulators (TIs) provide intriguing prospects for the future of spintronics due to their large spin&#8211;orbit coupling and dissipationless, counter&#8208;propagating conduction channels in the surface state. The combination of topological properties and magnetic order can lead to new quantum states including the quantum anomalous Hall effect that was&#160;first experimentally realized in Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 films. Since magnetic doping can introduce detrimental effects, requiring very low operational temperatures, alternative approaches are explored. Proximity coupling to magnetically ordered systems is an obvious option, with the prospect to raise the temperature for observing the various quantum effects. Here, an overview of proximity coupling and interfacial effects in TI heterostructures is presented, which provides a versatile materials platform for tuning the magnetic and topological properties of these exciting materials. An introduction is first given to the heterostructure growth by molecular beam epitaxy and suitable structural, electronic, and magnetic characterization techniques. Going beyond transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped and undoped TI heterostructures, examples of heterostructures are discussed, including rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped TIs, magnetic insulators, and antiferromagnets, which lead to exotic phenomena such as skyrmions and exchange bias. Finally, an outlook on novel heterostructures such as intrinsic magnetic TIs and systems including 2D materials is&#160;given.

         <title>Quantum Sensing of Thermoelectric Power in Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric conversion has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In this review, the thermoelectric microscopy&#8208;based quantum sensing of thermopower from classical, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, collective spin dynamics, and relativistic effect is summarized. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials provide insights for the future thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Thermoelectric power, has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In addition to classical and macroscopic values, thermopower also varies locally over a wide range of length scales, and is fundamentally linked to electron wave functions and phonon propagation. Various experimental methods for the quantum sensing of localized thermopower have been suggested, particularly based on scanning probe microscopy. Here, critical advances in the quantum sensing of thermopower are introduced, from the atomic to the several&#8208;hundred&#8208;nanometer scales, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects for optimized power generation. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications. Quantum sensing techniques for thermopower can pave the way to practical and novel energy devices for a sustainable society.

         <title>Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneities such as defects, impurities, edges, interfaces, and disorder often define and affect the coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topology of quantum states. Their roles in quantum materials are examined at the atomistic level by revealing the different degrees of freedom of heterogeneities, understanding their effects on the host material, and controlling heterogeneities to create new materials with tailored quantum functions.








Abstract
Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic&#8208;level structure&#8208;property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Low&#8208;Dimensional Materials for Emerging Quantum Phenomena and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron&#8211;electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many&#8208;body interactions and holds substantial promise for next&#8208;generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

         <title>Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating electron spin resonance capability in spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, quantum states of individual spins on surfaces can be initialized, controlled, and read out. Individual spins and artificial spin structures built atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom provide new platforms for sensing magnetic interactions, performing quantum operations, and simulating spin Hamiltonians at the atomic scale.








Abstract
The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all&#8208;electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically&#8208;precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic&#160;scale.

The basic concepts of quantum computing, communications, and sensing technologies are introduced. The current materials&#8208;related challenges in current quantum devices are identified and how nanoscale and low&#8208;dimensional materials may be used to overcome these challenges is considered. Theoretical and experimental studies on nanomaterials for quantum devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Quantum information science and engineering (QISE)&#8212;which entails the use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing&#8212;and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid&#8208;state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. This review considers how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. The materials challenges for specific types of qubits, along with how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges, are identified. Challenges for and progress toward nanomaterials&#8208;based quantum devices are condidered. The overall aim of the review is to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next&#8208;generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

         <title>Benchmarking Noise and Dephasing in Emerging Electrical Materials for Quantum Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The available data on low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical properties are reviewed to benchmark dephasing and noise in materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design, characterize and implement both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.








Abstract
As quantum technologies develop, a specific class of electrically conducting materials is rapidly gaining interest because they not only form the core quantum&#8208;enabled elements in superconducting qubits, semiconductor nanostructures, or sensing devices, but also the peripheral circuitry. The phase coherence of the electronic wave function in these emerging materials will be crucial when incorporated in the quantum architecture. The loss of phase memory, or dephasing, occurs when a quantum system interacts with the fluctuations in the local electromagnetic environment, which manifests in &#8220;noise&#8221; in the electrical conductivity. Hence, characterizing these materials and devices therefrom, for quantum applications, requires evaluation of both dephasing and noise, although there are very few materials where these properties are investigated simultaneously. Here, the available data on magnetotransport and low&#8208;frequency fluctuations in electrical conductivity are reviewed to benchmark the dephasing and noise. The focus is on new materials that are of direct interest to quantum technologies. The physical processes causing dephasing and noise in these systems are elaborated, the impact of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from materials synthesis and devices realization are evaluated, and it is hoped that a clearer pathway to design and characterize both material and devices for quantum&#160;applications is thus provided.

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Engineered Devices Based on 2D Materials for Next&#8208;Generation Information Processing and Storage</title>

2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices&#8212;from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin&#8208;FETs, valley&#8208;FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8211;orbit coupling, spin&#8211;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum&#8208;engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum&#8208;engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists are provided.

         <title>Recent Development of Ultrafast Optical Characterizations for Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 27, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of ultrashort optical pulses has provided unprecedented opportunities to probe and manipulate physical properties of quantum materials. There have been rapid growing discoveries of photoinduced new phenomena and nonlinear properties. A review on recent progress of ultrafast optical characterization and manipulation of quantum states, specifically in systems with broken&#8208;symmetry states or phase transitions, and prospects are provided.








Abstract
The advent of intense ultrashort optical pulses spanning a frequency range from terahertz to the visible has opened a new era in the experimental investigation and manipulation of quantum materials. The generation of strong optical field in an ultrashort time scale enables the steering of quantum materials nonadiabatically, inducing novel phenomenon or creating new phases which may not have an equilibrium counterpart. Ultrafast time&#8208;resolved optical techniques have provided rich information and played an important role in characterization of the nonequilibrium and nonlinear properties of solid systems. Here, some of the recent progress of ultrafast optical techniques and their applications to the detection and manipulation of physical properties in selected quantum materials are reviewed. Specifically, the new development in the detection of the Higgs mode and photoinduced nonequilibrium response in the study of superconductors by time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy are discussed.

         <title>Specific Clearance of Lipopolysaccharide from Blood Based on Peptide Bottlebrush Polymer for Sepsis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEP&#8208;1 exhibiting high affinity and specificity toward Escherichia coli&#160;lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#160;is discovered. Not only could it distinguish LPS from plasma proteins, but it can even distinguish the targeted LPS from other types of LPSs with &#8776;1000 times higher affinity. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing PEP&#8208;1 achieves specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood for sepsis therapy.








Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary bacterial toxin that is vital to the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis associated with extremely high morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood is highly challenging because of the structural complexity and its variation between/within bacterial species. Herein, a robust strategy based on phage display screening and hemocompatible peptide bottlebrush polymer design for specific clearance of targeted LPS from circulating blood is proposed. Using LPS extracted from Escherichia coli as an example, a novel peptide (HWKAVNWLKPWT) with high affinity (KD &lt; 1.0 n&#1084;), specificity, and neutralization activity (95.9 &#177; 0.1%) against the targeted LPS is discovered via iterative affinity selection coupled with endotoxin detoxification&#160;screening. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing the short peptide [poly(PEGMEA&#8208;co&#8208;PEP&#8208;1)] exhibits high LPS selectivity to reduce circulating LPS level from 2.63 &#177; 0.01 to 0.78 &#177; 0.05 EU mL&#8722;1 in sepsis rabbits via extracorporeal hemoperfusion (LPS clearance ratio &gt; 70%), reversing the LPS&#8208;induced leukocytopenia and multiple organ damages significantly. This work provides a universal paradigm for developing a highly selective hemoadsorbent library fully covering the LPS family, which is promising to create a new era of precision medicine in sepsis therapy.

         <title>Two&#8208;Tailed Dynamic Covalent Amphiphile Combats Bacterial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of non&#8208;antibiotic two&#8208;tailed antimicrobial amphiphile (T2A2) via dynamic covalent bonding is reported. T2A2 prevents biofilm formation and eradicates the mature biofilms via multiple mechanisms, suggestions applications in addressing the ever&#8208;growing threat of drug resistance in bacteria.








Abstract
Drug combination provides an efficient pathway to combat drug resistance in bacteria and bacterial biofilms. However, the facile methodology to construct the drug combinations and their applications in nanocomposites is still lacking. Here the two&#8208;tailed antimicrobial amphiphiles (T2A2) composed of nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;donor (diethylenetriamine NONOate, DN) and various natural aldehydes are reported. T2A2 self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles due to their amphiphilic nature, with remarkably low critical aggregation concentration. The representative cinnamaldehyde (Cin)&#8208;derived T2A2 (Cin&#8208;T2A2) assemblies demonstrate excellent bactericidal efficacy, notably higher than free Cin and free DN. Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies kill multidrug&#8208;resistant staphylococci and eradicate their biofilms via multiple mechanisms, as proved by mechanism studies, molecular dynamics simulations, proteomics, and metabolomics. Furthermore, Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies rapidly eradicate bacteria and alleviate inflammation in the subsequent murine infection models. Together, the Cin&#8208;T2A2 assemblies may provide an efficient, non&#8208;antibiotic alternative in combating the ever&#8208;increasing threat of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and their biofilms.
