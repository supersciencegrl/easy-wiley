      <title>Lead Chalcogenides: Discovering Electron&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Driven Changes in Chemical Bonding in Lead Chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S, O) (Adv. Mater. 49/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2005533, Matthias Wuttig and co&#8208;workers study systematic changes of chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S, O) to comprehend their properties. They discover an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from highly anharmonic, metavalent bonding in thermoelectric PbX (X = Te, Se, S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO, highlighting the relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding for materials design.

They discover an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from highly anharmonic, metavalent bonding in thermoelectric PbX (X = Te, Se, S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO, highlighting the relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding for materials design.

      <title>Afterglow Nanoparticles: Coloring Afterglow Nanoparticles for High&#8208;Contrast Time&#8208;Gating&#8208;Free Multiplex Luminescence Imaging (Adv. Mater. 49/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Akin to &#8220;luminous pearls&#8221; in ancient Chinese tales of legend, afterglow nanoparticles display unusual extremely long&#8208;life&#8208;time luminescence properties after the cessation of excitation. In article number 2003881, Zhanjun Li, Gang Han, and co&#8208;workers report multicolor afterglow &#8220;luminous pearls&#8221; with tailorable emission colors and uniform size. High&#8208;contrast multichannel afterglow imaging can be readily accomplished without the current need of a time&#8208;gating system.

      <title>Polymer Films: Improvement of Electrical Conductivity in Conjugated Polymers through Cascade Doping with Small&#8208;Molecular Dopants (Adv. Mater. 49/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular sequential doping using conjugated polymers is a promising approach to modulate or improve electrical conductivity without sacrificing the morphology of a pristine polymer film. In article number 2005129, Hyungtak Seo, Jong H. Kim, Bong&#8208;Gi Kim, and co&#8208;workers develop a cascade doping strategy that realizes excellent electrical conductivity through a separated doping process using two different dopants. The first dopant provides a kinetically favorable working environment for the second dopant, through regeneration, reengagement, and replacement during the secondary doping step.

      <title>Potassium Metal Batteries: Stable Potassium Metal Anodes with an All&#8208;Aluminum Current Collector through Improved Electrolyte Wetting (Adv. Mater. 49/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
An explorer is kayaking in uncharted territory, representing the exciting scientific pursuit of emerging metal batteries (MBs). Water is flowing smoothly over the jagged rocks, representing dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes as well as enhanced electrolyte wetting, both due to geometrical roughness. The electric eels underneath represent potassium&#8208;based energy storage, as they utilize potassium and sodium ions for electricity. In article number 2002908, Pengcheng Liu,  David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers present a route via improved electrolyte wetting toward stable potassium metal batteries with an all&#8208;aluminum current collector.

      <title>Electronic Charge Transport: Breakdown of the Small&#8208;Polaron Hopping Model in Higher&#8208;Order Spinels (Adv. Mater. 49/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
For six decades, electronic charge transport in oxides has been described by the small&#8208;polaron hopping model. However, this model was developed for binary oxides only. By characterizing structure, site occupation, and transport, in article number 2004490, Maytal Caspary Toroker, Richard D. Robinson, and co&#8208;workers show  that the conventional model is inaccurate for oxides with more than two types of cation. They present an accurate model, opening new design avenues for high&#8208;performance devices.

      <title>Surface Termination of Solution&#8208;Processed CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Film Examined using Electron Spectroscopies</title>
      <dc:description>
The interface property of perovskite is governed by the surface termination. The combination of ultraviolet photoelectron and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopies is demonstrated as a versatile technique to prove the surface termination. This method is applied to a solution&#8208;processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film to show that the surface is terminated with a layer consisting of CH3NH3 and I.








Abstract
The interfaces of a perovskite solar cell significantly influence the charge processes in the cell, which contributes to the device performance with direct implication for surface potential, electronic structure, and chemical reactivity. The properties of the interface are strongly affected by the surface termination. In this work, the combination of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopy is demonstrated, to examine the surface termination of a solution&#8208;processed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film. The results show that the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film is terminated with a layer consisting of CH3NH3 and I. The interface energy level alignment for both occupied and unoccupied levels between CH3NH3PbI3 and C60 is also examined using UPS and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy. It turns out that an ideal energy level alignment is established for the electron collection and hole block at the perovskite and C60 interface.

&lt;p&gt;The interface property of perovskite is governed by the surface termination. The combination of ultraviolet photoelectron and metastable&#8208;atom electron spectroscopies is demonstrated as a versatile technique to prove the surface termination.

      <title>Design of Local Atomic Environments in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Renewable Energy Conversions</title>
      <dc:description>
A rich variety of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates vast opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance renewable energy conversions.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) have recently attracted tremendous research interest due to their often remarkable catalytic responses, unmatched by conventional catalysts. The electrocatalytic performance of SAECs is closely related to the specific metal species and their local atomic environments, including their coordination number, the determined structure of the coordination sites, and the chemical identity of nearest and second nearest neighboring atoms. The wide range of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates virtually limitless opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of SAECs with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis. In this review, the authors first identify fundamental hurdles in electrochemical conversions and highlight the relevance of SAECs. They then critically examine the role of the local atomic structures, encompassing the first and second coordination spheres of the isolated metal atoms, on the design of high&#8208;performance SAECs. The relevance of single&#8208;atom dopants for host activation is also discussed. Insights into the correlation between local structures of SAECs and their catalytic response are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the authors summarize major challenges to be addressed in the field of SAECs and provide some perspectives in the rational construction of superior SAECs for a wide range of electrochemical conversions.

      <title>3D Interfacing between Soft Electronic Tools and Complex Biological Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
Soft electronics enable biocompatible interfaces for physiological sensing and stimulation. However, their typical forms as 2D sheets create difficulties for integration with organs and tissues with complex 3D geometry. Recent strategies involve a transformation of soft electronic tools for building adaptive 3D interfaces with natural organs and tissues, providing advanced capabilities for biological research and therapeutic innovation.








Abstract
Recent developments in soft functional materials have created opportunities for building bioelectronic devices with tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. Their integration with the human body could enable advanced sensing and stimulation for medical diagnosis and therapies. However, most of the available soft electronics are constructed as planar sheets, which are difficult to interface with the target organs and tissues that have complex 3D structures. Here, the recent approaches are highlighted to building 3D interfaces between soft electronic tools and complex biological organs and tissues. Examples involve mesh devices for conformal contact, imaging&#8208;guided fabrication of organ&#8208;specific electronics, miniaturized probes for neurointerfaces, instrumented scaffold for tissue engineering, and many other soft 3D systems. They represent diverse routes for reconciling the interfacial mismatches between electronic tools and biological tissues. The remaining challenges include device scaling to approach the complexity of target organs, biological data acquisition and processing, 3D manufacturing techniques, etc., providing a range of opportunities for scientific research and technological innovation.

      <title>Activatable NIR&#8208;II Plasmonic Nanotheranostics for Efficient Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An activatable NIR&#8208;II plasmonic theranostics system for accurate tumor diagnosis and effective treatment is reported. This gold nanochain structure breaks through the traditional molecular imaging window, shifting from the visible to the NIR&#8208;II region, owing to fusion between adjacent gold nanoparticles in the restricted local space triggered by the high H2O2 level in the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Precise manipulation of optical properties through the structure&#8208;evolution of plasmonic nanoparticles is of great interest in biomedical fields including bioimaging and phototherapy. However, previous success has been limited to fixed assembled structures or visible&#8211;NIR&#8208;I absorption. Here, an activatable NIR&#8208;II plasmonic theranostics system based on silica&#8208;encapsulated self&#8208;assembled gold nanochains (AuNCs@SiO2) for accurate tumor diagnosis and effective treatment is reported. This transformable chain structure breaks through the traditional molecular imaging window, whose absorption can be redshifted from the visible to the NIR&#8208;II region owing to the fusion between adjacent gold nanoparticles in the restricted local space of AuNCs@SiO2 triggered by the high H2O2 level in the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to the generation of a new string&#8208;like structure with strong NIR&#8208;II absorption, which is further confirmed by finite&#8208;difference&#8208;time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulation. With the TME&#8208;activated characteristics, AuNCs@SiO2 exhibits excellent properties for photoacoustic imaging and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 82.2% at 1064&#160;nm leading to severe cell death and remarkable tumor growth inhibition in vivo. These prominent intelligent TME&#8208;responsive features of AuNCs@SiO2 may open up a new avenue to explore optical regulated nano&#8208;platform for intelligent, accurate, and noninvasive theranostics in NIR&#8208;II window.

      <title>Hammett Relationship in Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Revealed through a Protein&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Inspired Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
Studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanozymes requires overcoming the composition&#8208; and site&#8208;heterogeneity limitations in nanomaterials. Inspired by natural metalloenzymes, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks is employed, and a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship is revealed, where increasing Hammett &#963;m value leads to the enhancement of the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity.








Abstract
While the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials that enable regulation of nanozyme activities are demonstrated in many systems, quantitative relationships between the nanomaterials structure and their enzymatic activities remain poorly understood, due to the heterogeneity of compositions and active sites in these nanomaterials. Here, inspired by metalloenzymes with well&#8208;defined metal&#8211;ligand coordination, a set of substituted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with similar coordination is employed to investigate the relationship between structure and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. Both experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal a Hammett&#8208;type structure&#8211;activity linear free energy relationship (H&#8208;SALR) of MIL&#8208;53(Fe) (MIL = Materials of Institute Lavoisier) nanozymes, in which increasing the Hammett &#963;m value with electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands increases the oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. As a result, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) &#63743;NO2 with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing NO2 substituent shows a tenfold higher activity than the unsubstituted MIL&#8208;53(Fe). Furthermore, the generality of H&#8208;SALR is demonstrated for a range of substrates, one other metal (Cr), and even one other MOF type (MIL&#8208;101). Such biologically inspired quantitative studies demonstrate that it is possible to identify quantitative structure&#8211;activity relationships of nanozymes, and to provide detailed insight into the catalytic mechanisms as those in native enzymes, making it possible to use these relationships to develop high&#8208;performance nanomaterials.

      <title>Cathodoluminescence of Ultrathin Twisted Ge1&#8211;xSnxS van der Waals Nanoribbon Waveguides</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultrathin twisted Ge1&#8211;xSnxS nanoribbons, realized via scalable vapor&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid growth over gold catalysts, provide a unique platform for probing guided excitonic waveguide modes in van der Waals semiconductors. Nanophotonic experiments using local electron&#8208;beam excitation detect the confined modes in the plane of the layered crystal and enable the measurement of key properties such as the field distribution into the adjacent cladding layers.








Abstract
Ultrathin van der Waals semiconductors have shown extraordinary optoelectronic and photonic properties. Propagating photonic modes make layered crystal waveguides attractive for photonic circuitry and for studying hybrid light&#8211;matter states. Accessing guided modes by conventional optics is challenging due to the limited spatial resolution and poor out&#8208;of&#8208;plane far&#8208;field coupling. Scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy can overcome these issues and can characterize waveguide modes down to a resolution of tens of nanometers, albeit for planar samples or nanostructures with moderate height variations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin van der Waals semiconductors have shown extraordinary optoelectronic and photonic properties. Propagating photonic modes make layered crystal waveguides attractive for photonic circuitry and for studying hybrid light&#8211;matter states. Accessing guided modes by conventional optics is challenging due to the limited spatial resolution and poor out&#8208;of&#8208;plane far&#8208;field coupling. Scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy can overcome these issues and can characterize waveguide modes down to a resolution of tens of nanometers, albeit for planar samples or nanostructures with moderate height variations. Electron microscopy provides atomic&#8208;scale localization also for more complex geometries, and recent advances have extended the accessible excitations from interband transitions to phonons. Here, bottom&#8208;up synthesized layered semiconductor (Ge&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;S) nanoribbons with an axial twist and deep subwavelength thickness are demonstrated as a platform for realizing waveguide modes, and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy is introduced as a tool to characterize them. Combined experiments and simulations show the excitation of guided modes by the electron beam and their efficient detection via photons emitted in the ribbon plane, which enables the measurement of key properties such as the evanescent field into the vacuum cladding with nanometer resolution. The results identify van der Waals waveguides operating in the infrared and highlight an electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based approach for probing complex&#8208;shaped nanophotonic structures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Multifunctional Reversible Self&#8208;Assembled Structures of Cellulose&#8208;Derived Phase&#8208;Change Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are prepared via surface esterification and further thiol&#8211;ene reaction on cellulose nanocrystals. These nanocrystals can assemble into flaky structures in the solid&#8208;state, which exhibit excellent thermoinduced imaging property, thermoinduced reversibility, and self&#8208;healing property. The multifunctional flaky structures can manipulate energy conversion, surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties, largely expanding their potential uses in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to advantageous properties attributed to well&#8208;organized structures, multifunctional materials with reversible hierarchical and highly ordered arrangement in solid&#8208;state assembled structures have drawn tremendous interest. However, such materials rarely exist. Based on the reversible phase transition of phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), phase&#8208;change nanocrystals (C18&#8208;UCNCs) are presented herein, which are capable of self&#8208;assembling into well&#8208;ordered hierarchical structures. C18&#8208;UCNCs have a core&#8211;shell structure consisting of a cellulose crystalline core that retains the basic structure and a soft shell containing octadecyl chains that allow phase transition. The distinct core&#8211;shell structure and phase transition of octadecyl chains allow C18&#8208;UCNCs to self&#8208;assemble into flaky nano/microstructures. These self&#8208;assembled C18&#8208;UCNCs exhibit efficient thermal transport and light&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion, and thus are promising for thermosensitive imaging. Specifically, flaky self&#8208;assembled nano/microstructures with manipulable surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties are thermoreversible and show thermally induced self&#8208;healing properties. By using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals as a novel group of PCMs, reversible self&#8208;assembled multifunctional materials can be engineered. This study proposes a promising approach for constructing self&#8208;assembled hierarchical structures by using phase&#8208;change nanocrystals and thereby significantly expands the application of PCMs.

      <title>Reversible Crystal&#8211;Glass Transition in a Metal Halide Perovskite</title>
      <dc:description>
2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide perovskites are introduced into the field of semiconducting glasses through deliberate synthetic design of the hybrid structure, resulting in facile and reversible glass&#8211;crystalline switching under moderate thermal cycling. Such glasses can find prospective application in, for example, memory, computing, nonlinear optics, communication, catalysis, sensing, and batteries.








Abstract
Crystalline metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have provided unprecedented advances in interdisciplinary fields of materials, electronics, and photonics. While crystallinity offers numerous advantages, the ability to access a glassy state with distinct properties provides unique opportunities to extend the associated structure&#8211;property relationship, as well as broaden the application space for MHPs. Amorphous analogs for MHPs have so far been restricted to high pressures, limiting detailed studies and applications. Here, a 2D MHP is structurally tailored using bulky chiral organic cations to exhibit an unusual confluence of exceptionally low melting temperature (175&#160;&#176;C) and inhibited crystallization. The chiral MHP can thus be melt&#8208;quenched into a stable glassy state, otherwise inhibited in the analogous racemic MHP. Facile and reversible switching between glassy and crystalline states is demonstrated for the chiral MHP, each with distinct optoelectronic character, opening new opportunities for applications including, for example nonvolatile memory, optical communication, and neuromorphic computing.

      <title>Gigantic Current Control of Coercive Field and Magnetic Memory Based on Nanometer&#8208;Thin Ferromagnetic van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
      <dc:description>
Substantial coercivity reduction by the current, larger at least by two orders of magnitude than those in previous reports, is found in the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. It is theoretically shown to arise from an unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque, which itself is directly related to its special symmetries, large Berry curvature, and band topology. A working model of a new robust nonvolatile magnetic memory based on Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a much smaller current, is also produced.








Abstract
Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next&#8208;generation of energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase&#8208;transition temperature. Here, it is reported that, surprisingly, an in&#8208;plane current can tune the magnetic state of the nanometer&#8208;thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is a direct demonstration of the current&#8208;induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in&#8208;plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin&#8211;orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. In addition, a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of the discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current, is further demonstrated. The findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impact on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.

      <dc:description>
Cascade enzyme&#8208;based drug delivery bioreactors, GOx/hemin@ZIF&#8208;8@DHA (GHZD NCs), are fabricated with augmented biocatalytic efficiency. Free radicals and self&#8208;sufficient H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment trigger irretrievable apoptosis and necrosis, which burst severe damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) for activation of sequential immune responses.

Abstract
Biocatalytic nanomaterials have been verified to modulate the immunosuppressive state of an extensive range of solid tumors and directly induce antitumor immune response, which effectively combats the holdbacks in cancer immunotherapy. Herein, biomimetic cascade enzyme&#8208;initiated toxic&#8208;radical&#8208;generating devices (GHZD NCs) are fabricated by enveloping glucose oxidase (GOx), artificial nanozyme hemin, and sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide derived dihydroartemisinin (DHA) into zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for enhanced biocatalytic immunotherapy. The GHZD NCs exhibit amplified multienzyme&#8208;mimic (glucose oxidase, peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase) cascade reactions in artificial nanoscale proximity. Concurrently, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;stimulated labile iron&#8208;current amplifier boosts C&#8208;centered free radicals, which endows the GHZD NCs with tumor&#8208;specific and self&#8208;circulating generation ability of vicious C&#8208;centered free radicals. Irreversible free radicals (&#183;C and &#183;OH) and sustainable H2O2 from sequential catalytic processes logically and selectively elevate the oxidative stress in the tumor, which further triggers an efficient immunogenic cell death (ICD) progress. In addition, the in situ nanozyme&#8208;based immunotherapy employed for tumor suppression successfully elicits the long&#8208;lasting immunological memory effect, which hinders the growth of distant tumors and lung metastasis.

      <title>Trends in Micro&#8208;/Nanorobotics: Materials Development, Actuation, Localization, and System Integration for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The design and fabrication, functionalization, actuation, and tracking of individual and a swarm of micro/nanorobots are the indispensable part for achieving the biomedical applications. This review focuses on how to combine and integrate all the four aspects together and realize a biomedical therapeutic function using the micro&#8208;/nanorobotic strategy.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;/nanorobots (m&#8208;bots) have attracted significant interest due to their suitability for applications in biomedical engineering and environmental remediation. Particularly, their applications in in vivo diagnosis and intervention have been the focus of extensive research in recent years with various clinical imaging techniques being applied for localization and tracking. The successful integration of well&#8208;designed m&#8208;bots with surface functionalization, remote actuation systems, and imaging techniques becomes the crucial step toward biomedical applications, especially for the in vivo uses. This review thus addresses four different aspects of biomedical m&#8208;bots: design/fabrication, functionalization, actuation, and localization. The biomedical applications of the m&#8208;bots in diagnosis, sensing, microsurgery, targeted drug/cell delivery, thrombus ablation, and wound healing are reviewed from these viewpoints. The developed biomedical m&#8208;bot systems are comprehensively compared and evaluated based on their characteristics. The current challenges and the directions of future research in this field are summarized.

      <title>Extremely Stable Luminescent Crosslinked Perovskite Nanoparticles under Harsh Environments over 1.5 Years</title>
      <dc:description>
An extraordinarily long stability, exceeding 1.5 years, for crosslinked perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) under harsh environments, by a novel materials design strategy, is reported. Surprisingly, the photoluminescence of the perovskite NPs is significantly increased under air, moisture, and chemicals, overcoming their instability in oxygen, water, and polar chemicals.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) are a very strong candidate emitter that can meet the high luminescence efficiency and high color standard of Rec.2020. However, the instability of perovskite NPs is the most critical unsolved problem that limits their practical application. Here, an extremely stable crosslinked perovskite NP (CPN) is reported that maintains high photoluminescence quantum yield for 1.5 years (&gt;600 d) in air and in harsher liquid environments (e.g., in water, acid, or base solutions, and in various polar solvents), and for more than 100 d under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity without additional encapsulation. Unsaturated hydrocarbons in both the acid and base ligands of NPs are chemically crosslinked with a methacrylate&#8208;functionalized matrix, which prevents decomposition of the perovskite crystals. Counterintuitively, water vapor permeating through the crosslinked matrix chemically passivates surface defects in the NPs and reduces nonradiative recombination. Green&#8208;emitting and white&#8208;emitting flexible large&#8208;area displays are demonstrated, which are stable for &gt;400 d in air and in water. The high stability of the CPN in water enables biocompatible cell proliferation which is usually impossible when toxic Pb elements are present. The stable materials design strategies provide a breakthrough toward commercialization of perovskite NPs in displays and bio&#8208;related applications.

      <title>Ultrathin Ga2O3 Glass: A Large&#8208;Scale Passivation and Protection Material for Monolayer WS2</title>
      <dc:description>
2D transition metal dichalcogenides have promising properties for future semiconductor technologies. Their integration into functional devices requires cost&#8208;efficient and large&#8208;scale passivation and protection against material deposition. This work introduces ultrathin Ga2O3 glass as a new, scalable capping material for monolayer WS2. It exhibits a novel passivation mechanism and offers extraordinary protection against deposition of dielectric materials, for example, for top&#8208;gating.








Abstract
Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs) have extraordinary optical properties that make them attractive for future optoelectronic applications. Integration of TMDCs into practical all&#8208;dielectric heterostructures hinges on the ability to passivate and protect them against necessary fabrication steps on large scales. Despite its limited scalability, encapsulation of TMDCs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) currently has no viable alternative for achieving high performance of the final device. Here, it is shown that the novel, ultrathin Ga2O3 glass is an ideal centimeter&#8208;scale coating material that enhances optical performance of the monolayers and protects them against further material deposition. In particular, Ga2O3 capping of monolayer WS2 outperforms commercial&#8208;grade hBN in both scalability and optical performance at room temperature. These properties make Ga2O3 highly suitable for large&#8208;scale passivation and protection of monolayer TMDCs in functional&#160;heterostructures.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Poly(vinylidene difluoride)/Dopamine Core/Shell Piezoelectric Nanofiber and Its Application for Biomedical Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance poly(vinylidene difluoride)/dopamine core/shell piezoelectric nanofibers with excellent stability are successfully fabricated by one&#8208;step electrospinning in large scale and quantity, offering an extraordinary building block for developing self&#8208;powered sensor devices to detect weak absolute pressure change from soft tissues in vivo. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.








Abstract
Fabrication of soft piezoelectric nanomaterials is essential for the development of wearable and implantable biomedical devices. However, a big challenge in this soft functional material development is to achieve a high piezoelectric property with long&#8208;term stability in a biological environment. Here, a one&#8208;step strategy for fabricating core/shell poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF)/dopamine (DA) nanofibers (NFs) with a very high &#946;&#8208;phase content and self&#8208;aligned polarization is reported. The self&#8208;assembled core/shell structure is believed essential for the formation and alignment of &#946;&#8208;phase PVDF, where strong intermolecular interaction between the &#63743;NH2 groups on DA and the &#63743;CF2 groups on PVDF is responsible for aligning the PVDF chains and promoting &#946;&#8208;phase nucleation. The as&#8208;received PVDF/DA NFs exhibit significantly enhanced piezoelectric performance and excellent stability and biocompatibility. An all&#8208;fiber&#8208;based soft sensor is fabricated and tested on human skin and in vivo in mice. The devices show a high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting weak physiological mechanical stimulation from diaphragm motions and blood pulsation. This sensing capability offers great diagnostic potential for the early assessment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.

      <title>Finding the Next Superhard Material through Ensemble Learning</title>
      <dc:description>
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method capable of finding new superhard materials is constructed by directly predicting the experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on chemical composition. The model is then used to conduct high&#8208;throughput screening of crystal databases and machine&#8208;learning generated phase diagrams to suggest undiscovered superhard materials.








Abstract
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method is demonstrated to be capable of finding superhard materials by directly predicting the load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on the chemical composition. A total of 1062 experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness data are extracted from the literature and used to train a supervised machine&#8208;learning algorithm utilizing boosting, achieving excellent accuracy (R2&#160;= 0.97). This new model is then tested by synthesizing and measuring the load&#8208;dependent hardness of several unreported disilicides and analyzing the predicted hardness of several classic superhard materials. The trained ensemble method is then employed to screen for superhard materials by examining more than 66&#8201;000 compounds in crystal structure databases, which show that 68 known materials have a Vickers hardness &#8805;40 GPa at 0.5 N (applied force) and only 10 exceed this mark at 5 N. The hardness model is then combined with the data&#8208;driven phase diagram generation tool to expand the limited number of reported high hardness compounds. Eleven ternary borocarbide phase spaces are studied, and more than ten thermodynamically favorable compositions with a hardness above 40 GPa (at 0.5 N) are identified, proving this ensemble model's ability to find previously unknown materials with outstanding mechanical&#160;properties.

      <title>Covalent Graphene&#8208;MOF Hybrids for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile method for the preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF hybrids with an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework and carboxylate functionalized graphene via amide bonds for capacitance applications is demonstrated.








Abstract
In this work, the covalent attachment of an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#160;= Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc&#8208;NH2)6; bdc&#8208;NH2&#160;= 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) (UiO&#8208;Universitetet i Oslo) to the basal&#8208;plane of carboxylate functionalized graphene (graphene acid = GA) via amide bonds is reported. The resultant GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 hybrid displayed a large specific surface area, hierarchical pores and an interconnected conductive network. The electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the hybrid GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 acts as an effective charge storing material with a capacitance of up to 651 F g&#8722;1, significantly higher than traditional graphene&#8208;based materials. The results suggest that the amide linkage plays a key role in the formation of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, which facilitates charge transfer and consequently offers good capacitance and cycling stability. Furthermore, to realize the practical feasibility, an asymmetric supercapacitor using a GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 positive electrode with Ti3C2TX MXene as the opposing electrode has been constructed. The cell is able to deliver a power density of up to 16&#160;kW kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of up to 73&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which are comparable to several commercial devices such as Pb&#8208;acid and Ni/MH batteries. Under an intermediate level of loading, the device retained 88% of its initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles.

     alt="Covalent Graphene&#8208;MOF Hybrids for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile method for the preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF hybrids with an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework and carboxylate functionalized graphene via amide bonds for capacitance applications is demonstrated.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the covalent attachment of an amine functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(bdc&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;; bdc&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) (UiO&#8208;Universitetet i Oslo) to the basal&#8208;plane of carboxylate functionalized graphene (graphene acid = GA) via amide bonds is reported. The resultant GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid displayed a large specific surface area, hierarchical pores and an interconnected conductive network. The electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the hybrid GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as an effective charge storing material with a capacitance of up to 651 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly higher than traditional graphene&#8208;based materials. The results suggest that the amide linkage plays a key role in the formation of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, which facilitates charge transfer and consequently offers good capacitance and cycling stability. Furthermore, to realize the practical feasibility, an asymmetric supercapacitor using a GA@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; positive electrode with Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; MXene as the opposing electrode has been constructed. The cell is able to deliver a power density of up to 16&#160;kW kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an energy density of up to 73&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which are comparable to several commercial devices such as Pb&#8208;acid and Ni/MH batteries. Under an intermediate level of loading, the device retained 88% of its initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alloyed Palladium&#8211;Silver Nanowires Enabling Ultrastable Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>
Alloyed Pd&#8211;Ag nanowires exhibit significantly improved stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate at potentials where people previously believed that the product could not be stably formed on Pd. This is due to the markedly enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires.








Abstract
Palladium can enable the electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with nearly zero overpotential and good selectivity. However, it usually has very limited stability owing to CO poisoning from the side reaction intermediate. Herein, it is demonstrated that alloying palladium with silver is a viable strategy to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic stability. Palladium&#8211;silver alloy nanowires are prepared in aqueous solution with tunable chemical compositions, large aspect ratio, and roughened surfaces. Thanks to the unique synergy between palladium and silver, these nanowires exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performances for selective formate production. Most remarkably, impressive long&#8208;term stability is measured even at &lt;&#8201;&#8208;0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode where people previously believed that formate cannot be stably formed on palladium. Such stability results from the enhanced CO tolerance and selective stabilization of key reaction intermediates on alloy nanowires as supported by detailed electrochemical characterizations and theoretical computations.

      <title>Continuous High&#8208;Throughput Fabrication of Architected Micromaterials via In&#8208;Air Photopolymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
In&#8208;air polymerization of a liquid jet is presented as a novel platform to produce tunable micromaterials at flow rates &gt;1 mL min&#8208;1 per nozzle. A library of microparticles with tunable size, shape, morphology, and chemistry is presented. Stimuli&#8208;responsive Janus fiber with tunable composition and printed microlens arrays with controllable three&#8208;dimensional curvatures are demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent advances in optical coding, drug delivery, diagnostics, tissue engineering, shear&#8208;induced gelation, and functionally engineered rheology crucially depend on microparticles and microfibers with tunable shape, size, and composition. However, scalable manufacturing of the required complex micromaterials remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here in&#8208;air polymerization of liquid jets is demonstrated as a novel platform to produce microparticles and microfibers with tunable size, shape, and composition at high throughput (&gt;100&#160;mL h&#8722;1 per nozzle). The polymerization kinetics is quantitatively investigated and modeled as a function of the ink composition, the UV light intensity, and the velocity of the liquid jet, enabling engineering of complex micromaterials in jetting regimes. The size, morphology, and local chemistry of micromaterials are independently controlled, as highlighted by producing micromaterials using 5 different photopolymers as well as multi&#8208;material composites. Simultaneous optimization of these control parameters yields rapid fabrication of stimuli&#8208;responsive Janus fibers that function as soft actuators. Finally, in&#8208;air photopolymerization enables control over the curvature of printed droplets, as highlighted by high&#8208;throughput printing of microlenses with tunable focal distance. The combination of rapid processing and tunability in composition and architecture opens a new route toward applications of tailored micromaterials in soft matter, medicine, pharmacy, and optics.

      <title>Stable, High&#8208;Efficiency Voltage&#8208;Dependent Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a Single Tetradentate Platinum(II) Emitter Having Long Operational Lifetime</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance voltage&#8208;dependent color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a single Pt[O^N^C^N] emitter are fabricated. The emission color can be tuned from warm white to nature white or from orange to yellowish green, depending upon the emitter used. High external quantum efficiency (23.23%), low efficiency roll&#8208;off, long&#8208;term stability (LT90&#160;= 19&#160;105 h) and continuously variable color enable these color&#8208;tunable OLEDs to find applications in smart wearable devices.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;dependent, color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are appealing tools that can be used for the visualization of electronic output signal of sensors. Nonetheless, the literature&#8208;reported color&#8208;tunable OLEDs that have a simple single&#8208;cell device structure suffer from relatively low efficiency, pronounced efficiency roll&#8208;off, color&#8208;aging, and short operation lifetime, all of which limit their practical applications. Here, a novel co&#8208;host&#8208;in&#8208;double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer (CHIDEL) device, designed to enhance the performance of color&#8208;tunable OLEDs with the use of a single tetradentate Pt[O^N^C^N] emitter, is described. When Pt&#8208;X&#8208;2 is used as a single emitter in an optimized CHIDEL device, a white OLED with tunable Commission International de I'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates from (0.47, 0.44) at 3&#160;V to (0.36, 0.48) at 11&#160;V, a high color rendering index of 82, and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20.75% can be achieved. By using Pt&#8208;X&#8208;4 as a single emitter, the voltage&#8208;dependent color&#8208;tunable CHIDEL device, with CIE coordinates shifted from (0.56, 0.43) at 3&#160;V to (0.42, 0.55) at 11&#160;V, demonstrates a high luminance of beyond 90 000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a high EQE of 23.23% at a luminance of 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2. A long&#8208;lifetime time to 90% of the initial luminance (LT90) of almost 20&#160;000 h is demonstrated for the color&#8208;tunable OLED with Pt&#8208;X&#8208;4 emitting dopant.

      <title>Nanoscale&#8208;Confined Terahertz Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
Extreme confinement of long&#8208;wavelength terahertz radiation to nanoscale dimensions is achieved in the natural hyperbolic van der Waals crystal &#945;&#8208;MoO3. A range of highly anisotropic, in&#8208;plane THz polaritonic excitations are directly visualized in the 8&#8211;12 THz spectral range, exhibiting ultralow&#8208;loss propagation, tunable THz response, and orthogonal propagation directions.








Abstract
Electromagnetic field confinement is crucial for nanophotonic technologies, since it allows for enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions, thus enabling light manipulation in deep sub&#8208;wavelength scales. In the terahertz (THz) spectral range, radiation confinement is conventionally achieved with specially designed metallic structures&#8212;such as antennas or nanoslits&#8212;with large footprints due to the rather long wavelengths of THz radiation. In this context, phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in van der Waals (vdW) crystals have emerged as a promising solution for controlling light beyond the diffraction limit, as they feature extreme field confinements and low optical losses. However, experimental demonstration of nanoscale&#8208;confined phonon polaritons at THz frequencies has so far remained elusive. Here, it is provided by employing scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy combined with a free&#8208;electron laser to reveal a range of low&#8208;loss polaritonic excitations at frequencies from 8 to 12 THz in the vdW semiconductor &#945;&#8208;MoO3. In this study, THz polaritons are visualized with: i) in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersion, ii) extreme nanoscale field confinement (below &#955;o&#160;&#8260;75), and iii) long polariton lifetimes, with a lower limit of &gt;2&#160;ps.

Here, it is provided by employing scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy combined with a free&#8208;electron laser to reveal a range of low&#8208;loss polaritonic excitations at frequencies from 8 to 12 THz in the vdW semiconductor &#945;&#8208;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study, THz polaritons are visualized with: i) in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersion, ii) extreme nanoscale field confinement (below &#955;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8260;75), and iii) long polariton lifetimes, with a lower limit of &amp;gt;2&#160;ps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turning On Solid&#8208;State Luminescence by Phototriggered Subtle Molecular Conformation Variations</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state intelligent materials, in particular those showing photoresponsive luminescence (PRL), is desirable for their cutting&#8208;edge applications but challenging. A PRL material that features sensitive and reversible fluorescence switching through phototriggering and thermal annealing is reported. The behavior is attributed to subtle molecular conformation variations. Excellent quality of thin&#8208;films and high PRL performance allows interesting applications in invisible anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic optical data storage with micro&#8208;resolution.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state intelligent materials, in particular those showing photoresponsive luminescence (PRL), is highly desirable for their cutting&#8208;edge applications in sensors, displays, data&#8208;storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, but is challenging. Few PRL materials are constructed by tethering the classic photochromic systems with newly&#8208;emerged solid&#8208;state emitters. Selective solid&#8208;state photoreactions are demanded to precisely manipulate the luminescent behavior of these emitters, which require dramatic structural change and enough free space, thus limiting the scope of the PRL family. Here, a new PRL material, TPE&#8208;4N, that features sensitive and reversible fluorescence switching is reported. The interesting on&#8211;off luminescent property of TPE&#8208;4N can be facilely tuned through fast phototriggering and thermal annealing. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that subtle molecular conformation variation induces the corresponding PRL behavior. The crystalline and amorphous state endows an efficient and weak ISC process, respectively, to turn on and off the emission. The readily fabricated thin&#8208;film of TPE&#8208;4N exhibits non&#8208;destructive PRL behavior with high contrast (&gt;102), good light transmittance (&gt;72.3%), and great durability and reversibility under room light for months. Remarkably, a uniform thin&#8208;film with such fascinating PRL properties allows high&#8208;tech applications in invisible anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic optical data storage with micro&#8208;resolution.

      <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Modulated Supramolecular Assembly Increases Antitumor Potency against Malignant Breast Tumors via Tunable Cooperativity</title>
      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles (IBMs), via the interplay of both &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions, are reported. These IBMs cause efficient cascade delivery into cytoplasm and tunable photoconversion for yielding potent antitumor synergy against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer together with distinctly reduced recurrence and metastasis through the reversal of tumor immunosuppression.








Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains with highest incidence and mortality rates among females, and a critical bottleneck lies in rationally establishing potent therapeutics against TNBC. Here, the self&#8208;assembled micellar nanoarchitecture of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;modulated supramolecules with efficient cytoplasmic translocation and tunable photoconversion is shown, for potent suppression against primary, metastatic, and recurrent TNBC. Multi&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles yield tunable photoconversion into singlet oxygen and a thermal effect, together with deep penetration and subsequent cytoplasmic translocation at the tumor. Tetra&#8208;iodinated boron dipyrromethene micelles (4&#8208;IBMs) particularly show a distinctly enhanced cooperativity of antitumor efficiency through considerable expressions of apoptotic proteins, potently suppressing subcutaneous, and orthotopic TNBC models, together with reduced oxygen dependence. Furthermore, 4&#8208;IBMs yield preferable anti&#8208;metastatic and anti&#8208;recurrent efficacies through the inhibition of metastasis&#8208;relevant proteins, distinct immunogenic cell death, and re&#8208;education of M2 macrophages into tumoricidal M1 phenotype as compared to chemotherapy and surgical resection. These results offer insights into the cooperativity of supramolecular nanoarchitectures for potent phototherapy against TNBC.

      <title>Stabilizing Anionic Redox Chemistry in a Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathode Constructed by Li&#8208;Deficient Pristine State</title>
      <dc:description>
O3&#8208;type Li0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2 is successfully developed, with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathode materials are of significant interest for coupling anionic redox with cationic redox chemistry to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, lattice oxygen loss and derived structure distortion would induce serious capacity loss and voltage decay, further hindering its practical application. Herein, a novel Li&#8208;rich cathode material, O3&#8208;type Li0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2, is developed with the pristine state displaying both a Li excess in the transition metal layer and a deficiency in the alkali metal layer. Benefiting from stable structure evolution and Li migration processes, not only can high reversible capacity (&#8776;329 mAh g&#8722;1) be harvested but also irreversible/reversible anionic/cationic redox reactions are comprehensively assigned via the combination of in/ex situ spectroscopies. Furthermore, irreversible lattice oxygen loss and structure distortion are effectively restrained, resulting in long&#8208;term cycle stability (capacity drop of 0.045% per cycle, 500 cycles). Altogether, tuning the Li state in the alkali metal layer presents a promising way for modification of high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich cathode candidates.

      <title>Performance Limits of an Alternating Current Electroluminescent Device</title>
      <dc:description>
Electroluminescence can be achieved from nearly any emissive material with a single, generic device structure that uses alternating current voltage and a carbon nanotube contact. Performance limits of the device are studied through device modeling and experiments, demonstrating how low voltage and efficient electroluminescence can be achieved with emissive materials possessing a wide range of electrical and physical properties.








Abstract
The use of an alternating current (AC) voltage is a simple, versatile method of producing electroluminescence from generic emissive materials without the need for contact engineering. Recently, it was shown that AC&#8208;driven, capacitive electroluminescent devices with carbon nanotube network contacts can be used to generate and study electroluminescence from a variety of molecular materials emitting in the infrared&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet range. Here, performance trade&#8208;offs in these devices are studied through comprehensive device simulations and illustrative experiments, enhancing understanding of the mechanism and capability of electroluminescent devices based on alternating as opposed to direct current (DC) schemes. AC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices can overcome several limitations of conventional DC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices, including the requirement for proper alignment of material energy levels and the need to process emitting materials into uniform thin films. By simultaneously optimizing device geometry, driving parameters, and material characteristics, the performance of these devices can be tuned. Importantly, the turn&#8208;on voltage of AC&#8208;driven electroluminescent devices approaches the bandgap of the emitting material as the gate oxide thickness is scaled, and internally efficient electroluminescence can be achieved using low&#8208;mobility single&#8208;layer emitter films with varying thicknesses and energy barrier heights relative to the contact.

      <title>Operando Tailoring of Defects and Strains in Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>
Corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, with outstanding activity and stability for hybrid supercapacitors, is developed through an electrochemical abuse strategy. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure technique and finite element analysis demonstrate that the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology play critical roles in enhancing chemical activity and structural robustness.








Abstract
Nickel hydroxide represents a technologically important material for energy storage, such as hybrid supercapacitors. It has two different crystallographic polymorphs, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, showing advantages in either theoretical capacity or cycling/rate performance, manifesting a trade&#8208;off trend that needs to be optimized for practical applications. Here, the synergistic superiorities in both activity and stability of corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are demonstrated through an electrochemical abuse approach. With &#8776;91% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, the corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 457 C g&#8722;1 at a high current density of 30 A g&#8722;1, which is nearly two and four times that of the regular &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2, respectively. Operando spectroscopy and finite element analysis reveal that greatly enhanced chemical activity and structural robustness can be attributed to the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology. This work demonstrates a multi&#8208;scale defect&#8208;and&#8208;strain co&#8208;design strategy, which is helpful for rational design and tuned fabrication of next&#8208;generation electrode materials for stable and high&#8208;rate energy storage.

With &#8776;91% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, the corrugated &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 457 C g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a high current density of 30 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is nearly two and four times that of the regular &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Operando spectroscopy and finite element analysis reveal that greatly enhanced chemical activity and structural robustness can be attributed to the in situ tailored lattice defects and the strain&#8208;induced highly curved micromorphology. This work demonstrates a multi&#8208;scale defect&#8208;and&#8208;strain co&#8208;design strategy, which is helpful for rational design and tuned fabrication of next&#8208;generation electrode materials for stable and high&#8208;rate energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage and Tumor&#8208;Cell Dually Transfecting Polyplexes for Efficient Interleukin&#8208;12 Cancer Gene Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Intravenously administered polymeric interleukin&#8208;12 (IL12) gene&#8208;delivery vector transfects both tumor cells and macrophages to efficiently produce IL12 inside the tumor, which activates anticancer immune responses and the tumor microenvironment, leading to retarded tumor growth and prolonged animals&#8217; survival with negligible systemic toxicities. This work demonstrates the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery making use of both macrophages and tumor cells.








Abstract
Interleukin 12 (IL12) is a potent pro&#8208;inflammatory chemokine with multifunction, including promoting cytotoxic T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated killing of cancer cells. IL12&#8208;based cancer gene therapy can overcome IL12's life&#8208;threatening adverse effects, but its clinical translation has been limited by the lack of systemic gene&#8208;delivery vectors capable of efficiently transfecting tumors to produce sufficient local IL12. Macrophages inherently excrete IL12, and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are the major tumor component taking up a large fraction of the vectors arriving in the tumor. It is thus hypothesized that a gene vector efficiently transfecting both cancer cells and TAMs would make the tumor to produce sufficient IL12; however, gene transfection of TAMs is challenging due to their inherent strong degradation ability. Herein, an IL12 gene&#8208;delivery vector is designed that efficiently transfects both cancer cells and TAMs to make them as a factory for IL12 production, which efficiently activates anticancer immune responses and remodels the tumor microenvironment, for instance, increasing the M1/M2 ratio by more than fourfold. Therefore, the intravenously administered vector retards tumor growth and doubles survival in three animal models&#8217; with negligible systemic toxicities. This work reports the first nonviral IL12 gene delivery system that effectively makes use of both macrophages and tumor cells.

      <title>Consequences of Chirality in Directing the Pathway of Cholesteric Helix Inversion of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers by Light</title>
      <dc:description>
Alternating copolymers of fluorene and azobenzene exhibit exceptional chiroptical properties in annealed thin films. The chiroptical properties, polymer chain alignment, and their supramolecular helicity can be fully controlled by irradiating with polarized light. Intriguingly, the diastereomeric relationship between the supramolecular helicity of polymer and the circular polarization of light leads to an asymmetric helix inversion pathway, reminiscent of molecular motors.








Abstract
Control over main&#8208;chain motion of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers can lead to unexpected new functionalities.&#160;Here, it is shown that by combining photoswitchable azobenzene units in conjugation with chiral fluorene comonomers and appropriate plasticizers, the polymer organization and chiroptical properties of these alternating copolymers steered by light and its state of polarization can be dynamically controlled. The configuration of the stereogenic centers in the side chains of the fluorene units determines the handedness of the cholesteric organization in thermally annealed films, indicating cooperative behavior. The polymer alignment and helicity of the supramolecular arrangement can be switched by irradiating with linearly and circularly polarized light, respectively.&#160;Intriguingly, when switching the handedness of thermally induced cholesteric organizations by illuminating with circularly polarized light that is opposite to the handedness of the cholesteric phases, a nematic&#8208;like intermediate state is observed during helix interconversion. By the sequence of irradiation with left and right circularly polarized light followed by thermal annealing, an asymmetric motion, reminiscent of that seen in molecular motors is observed. These findings suggest that functional conjugated polymers can exhibit emergent properties at mesoscopic scale.

      <title>Designing Mechanical Metamaterials with Kirigami&#8208;Inspired, Hierarchical Constructions for Giant Positive and Negative Thermal Expansion</title>
      <dc:description>
A type of 2D hierarchical metamaterial that incorporates kirigami&#8208;inspired bilayer actuating elements into periodic lattice patterns to allow for giant positive/negative CTEs is developed. Quantitative comparison to existing mechanical metamaterials suggests that the presented hierarchical metamaterials can substantially enlarge the accessible range of CTE in the Ashby plot, by nearly an order of magnitude for the biaxial CTE.








Abstract
Advanced mechanical metamaterials with unusual thermal expansion properties represent an area of growing interest, due to their promising potential for use in a broad range of areas. In spite of previous work on metamaterials with large or ultralow coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), achieving a broad range of CTE values with access to large thermally induced dimensional changes in structures with high filling ratios remains a key challenge. Here, design concepts and fabrication strategies for a kirigami&#8208;inspired class of 2D hierarchical metamaterials that can effectively convert the thermal mismatch between two closely packed constituent materials into giant levels of biaxial/uniaxial thermal expansion/shrinkage are presented. At large filling ratios (&gt;50%), these systems offer not only unprecedented negative and positive biaxial CTE (i.e., &#8722;5950 and 10 710&#160;ppm K&#8722;1), but also large biaxial thermal expansion properties (e.g., &gt;&#160;21% for 20 K temperature increase). Theoretical modeling of thermal deformations provides a clear understanding of the microstructure&#8211;property relationships and serves as a basis for design choices for desired CTE values. An Ashby plot of the CTE versus density serves as a quantitative comparison of the hierarchical metamaterials presented here to previously reported systems, indicating the capability for substantially enlarging the accessible range of CTE.

      <title>Recent Advances in Hyperthermia Therapy&#8208;Based Synergistic Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanomaterial&#8208;based hyperthermia therapy (HTT) including photothermal therapy and magnetic hyperthermia can not only ablate different types of primary tumors, but also sensitize tumors to create a highly immunogenic tumor microenvironment for immunotherapy to further fight against cancer metastasis and recurrence. Hence, such HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy approach offers a powerful method for curing cancer completely.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed hyperthermia therapy (HTT) as an emerging strategy against malignant tumors. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) and magnetic hyperthermia (MHT), as highly effective and noninvasive treatment models, offer advantages over other strategies in the treatment of different types of tumors. However, both PTT and MHT cannot completely cure cancer due to recurrence and distal metastasis. In recent years, cancer immunotherapy has attracted widespread attention owing to its capability to activate the body's own natural defense to identify, attack, and eradicate cancer cells. Significant efforts have been devoted to studying the activated immune responses caused by hyperthermia&#8208;ablated tumors. In this article, the synergistic mechanism of HTT in immunotherapy, including immunogenic cell death and reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is discussed. The reports of the combination of HTT or HTT&#8208;based multimodal therapy with immunotherapy, including immunoadjuvant exploitation, immune checkpoint blockade therapy, and adoptive cellular immunotherapy are summarized. As highlighted, these strategies could achieve synergistically enhanced therapeutic outcomes against both primary tumors and metastatic lesions, prevent cancer recurrence, and prolong the survival period. Finally, current challenges and prospective developments in HTT&#8208;synergized immunotherapy are also reviewed.

      <title>Nanocellulose: Recent Fundamental Advances and Emerging Biological and Biomimicking Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have recently become the focal point of sustainable nanoconstruction. Beyond the classic approaches dealing with, for example, reinforced nanocomposites, barriers, films, and structural color, the fundamental interactions within nanocelluloses, multifunctional hybrid gels, multicomponent fibers, and nanocelluloses in artificial photosynthesis are reviewed.








Abstract
In the effort toward sustainable advanced functional materials, nanocelluloses have attracted extensive recent attention. Nanocelluloses range from rod&#8208;like highly crystalline cellulose nanocrystals to longer and more entangled cellulose nanofibers, earlier denoted also as microfibrillated celluloses and bacterial cellulose. In recent years, they have spurred research toward a wide range of applications, ranging from nanocomposites, viscosity modifiers, films, barrier layers, fibers, structural color, gels, aerogels and foams, and energy applications, until filtering membranes, to name a few. Still, nanocelluloses continue to show surprisingly high challenges to master their interactions and tailorability to allow well&#8208;controlled assemblies for functional materials. Rather than trying to review the already extensive nanocellulose literature at large, here selected aspects of the recent progress are the focus. Water interactions, which are central for processing for the functional properties, are discussed first. Then advanced hybrid gels toward (multi)stimuli responses, shape&#8208;memory materials, self&#8208;healing, adhesion and gluing, biological scaffolding, and forensic applications are discussed. Finally, composite fibers are discussed, as well as nanocellulose as a strategy for improvement of photosynthesis&#8208;based chemicals production. In summary, selected perspectives toward new directions for sustainable high&#8208;tech functional materials science based on nanocelluloses are described.

      <title>Identifying Ionic and Electronic Charge Transfer at Oxide Heterointerfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
The combined role of ionic and electronic charge transfer in oxide heterointerfaces (LaAlO3/SrTiO3) is investigated. New near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data proves a reversible Sr cation reconstruction under thermodynamic treatment to be responsible for lowered interface conductivity and enhanced magnetism under low temperatures. Ionic movement is found to be considerably higher and more influential than in the bulk.








Abstract
The ability to tailor oxide heterointerfaces has led to novel properties in low&#8208;dimensional oxide systems. A fundamental understanding of these properties is based on the concept of electronic charge transfer. However, the electronic properties of oxide heterointerfaces crucially depend on their ionic constitution and defect structure: ionic charges contribute to charge transfer and screening at oxide interfaces, triggering a thermodynamic balance of ionic and electronic structures. Quantitative understanding of the electronic and ionic roles regarding charge&#8208;transfer phenomena poses a central challenge. Here, the electronic and ionic structure is simultaneously investigated at the prototypical charge&#8208;transfer heterointerface, LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Applying in situ photoemission spectroscopy under oxygen ambient, ionic and electronic charge transfer is deconvoluted in response to the oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In this way, both the rich and variable chemistry of complex oxides and the associated electronic properties are equally embraced. The interfacial electron gas is depleted through an ionic rearrangement in the strontium cation sublattice when oxygen is applied, resulting in an inverse and reversible balance between cation vacancies and electrons, while the mobility of ionic species is found to be considerably enhanced as compared to the bulk. Triggered by these ionic phenomena, the electronic transport and magnetic signature of the heterointerface are significantly altered.

      <dc:description>
Here, a straightforward polyTPD passivation is introduced to reduce the defect&#8208;mediated recombination by elucidating the imperfections on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in perovskite solar cells with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21%. Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic and thermally robust polyTPD passivated devices retain 94% of the initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions.








Abstract
The failure of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to maintain their maximum efficiency over a prolonged time is due to the deterioration of the light harvesting material under environmental factors such as humidity, heat, and light. Systematically elucidating and eliminating such degradation pathways are critical to imminent commercial use of this technology. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced to reduce the level of defect&#8208;states present at the perovskite and hole transporting layer interface by treating the various perovskite surfaces with poly(N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;4&#8208;butylphenyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bisphenyl)benzidine (polyTPD) molecules. This strategy significantly suppresses the defect&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative recombination in the ensuing devices and prevents the penetration of degrading agents into the inner layers by passivating the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination and improved interfacial hole extraction result in PSCs with stabilized efficiency exceeding 21% with negligible hysteresis (&#8776;19.1% for control device). Moreover, ultra&#8208;hydrophobic polyTPD passivant considerably alleviates moisture penetration, showing &#8776;91% retention of initial efficiencies after 300 h storage at high relative humidity of 80%. Similarly, passivated device retains 94% of its initial efficiency after 800 h under operational conditions (maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination at 60&#160;&#176;C). In addition to interfacial passivation function, hole&#8208;selective role of dopant&#8208;free polyTPD is also evaluated and discussed in this study.

      <title>Strain&#8208;Mediated High Conductivity in Ultrathin Antiferromagnetic Metallic Nitrides</title>
      <dc:description>
Electronic state transitions in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films are mediated with strain and reduced dimensionality. Surprisingly, the CrN layer is still highly conductive when its thickness shrinks to 1&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.








Abstract
Strain engineering provides the ability to control the ground states and associated phase transition in epitaxial films. However, the systematic study of the intrinsic character and strain dependency in transition&#8208;metal nitrides remains challenging due to the difficulty in fabricating stoichiometric and high&#8208;quality films. Here the observation of an electronic state transition in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films with strain and reduced dimensionality is reported. By shrinking the film thickness to a critical value of &#8776;30 unit cells, a profound conductivity reduction accompanied by unexpected volume expansion is observed in CrN films. The electrical conductivity is observed surprisingly when the CrN layer is as thin as a single unit cell thick, which is far below the critical thickness of most metallic films. It is found that the metallicity of an ultrathin CrN film recovers from insulating behavior upon the removal of the as&#8208;grown strain by the fabrication of freestanding nitride films. Both first&#8208;principles calculations and linear dichroism measurements reveal that the strain&#8208;mediated orbital splitting effectively customizes the relatively small bandgap at the Fermi level, leading to an exotic phase transition in CrN. The ability to achieve highly conductive nitride ultrathin films by harnessing strain&#8208;control over competing phases can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.

      <dc:description>
In recent years, microfluidic technologies have increasingly been applied toward the accelerated synthesis science studies of solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, allowing greater control over synthesis conditions, lower reagent consumption, and unique data access through online monitoring techniques. Adoption of microfluidic synthesis technologies offers potential access to higher performing nanomaterials through autonomous robotic experimentation.








Abstract
In recent years, microfluidic technologies have emerged as a powerful approach for the advanced synthesis and rapid optimization of various solution&#8208;processed nanomaterials, including semiconductor quantum dots and nanoplatelets, and metal plasmonic and reticular framework nanoparticles. These fluidic systems offer access to previously unattainable measurements and synthesis conditions at unparalleled efficiencies and sampling rates. Despite these advantages, microfluidic systems have yet to be extensively adopted by the colloidal nanomaterial community. To help bridge the gap, this progress report details the basic principles of microfluidic reactor design and performance, as well as the current state of online diagnostics and autonomous robotic experimentation strategies, toward the size, shape, and composition&#8208;controlled synthesis of various colloidal nanomaterials. By discussing the application of fluidic platforms in recent high&#8208;priority colloidal nanomaterial studies and their potential for integration with rapidly emerging artificial intelligence&#8208;based decision&#8208;making strategies, this report seeks to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between microfluidic reactor engineers and colloidal nanomaterial chemists. Full convergence of these two research efforts offers significantly expedited and enhanced nanomaterial discovery, optimization, and manufacturing.

      <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Field&#8208;Tailored T1&#8211;T2 Dual&#8208;Mode MRI Contrast Agent for High&#8208;Performance Vascular Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrahigh magnetic field (UHF)&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with a near&#8208;paramagnetic core and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification is developed, which exhibits a dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under UHF. By virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode imaging enables the assessment of the vascular anatomy and functions with high sensitivity and accuracy.








Abstract
The assessment of vascular anatomy and functions using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for medical diagnosis, whereas the commonly used low&#8208;field MRI system (&#8804;3 T) suffers from low spatial resolution. Ultrahigh field (UHF) MRI (&#8805;7 T), with significantly improved resolution and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, shows great potential to provide high&#8208;resolution vasculature images. However, practical applications of UHF MRI technology for vascular imaging are currently limited by the low sensitivity and accuracy of single&#8208;mode (T1 or T2) contrast agents. Herein, a UHF&#8208;tailored T1&#8211;T2 dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with extremely small core size and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification, exhibiting dually enhanced T1&#8211;T2 contrast effect under the 7 T magnetic field, is reported. The UDIOC enables clear visualization of microvasculature as small as &#8776;140&#160;&#181;m in diameter under UHF MRI, extending the detection limit of the 7 T MR angiography. Moreover, by virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF MRI and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode dynamic contrast&#8208;enhanced MRI is successfully applied to detect tumor vascular permeability with extremely high sensitivity and accuracy, providing a novel paradigm for the precise medical diagnosis of vascular&#8208;related diseases.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual&#8208;mode iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based contrast agent (UDIOC) with extremely small core size and ultracompact hydrophilic surface modification, exhibiting dually enhanced &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contrast effect under the 7 T magnetic field, is reported. The UDIOC enables clear visualization of microvasculature as small as &#8776;140&#160;&#181;m in diameter under UHF MRI, extending the detection limit of the 7 T MR angiography. Moreover, by virtue of high&#8208;resolution UHF MRI and a simple double&#8208;checking process, UDIOC&#8208;based dual&#8208;mode dynamic contrast&#8208;enhanced MRI is successfully applied to detect tumor vascular permeability with extremely high sensitivity and accuracy, providing a novel paradigm for the precise medical diagnosis of vascular&#8208;related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
In article number 2004897, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi and co&#8208;workers propose a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, to drastically increase the recording density of magnetic tapes. Demonstrations are performed using magnetic films based on a series of epsilon iron oxide, &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3. Irradiation of the focused millimeter wave generated from terahertz (THz) light flips the magnetic pole direction, leading to a breakthrough technology for high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.

In article number 2003313, Liting Yan, Jianxing Shen, Xuebo Zhao, Lianzhou Wang, and co&#8208;workers report a facile and versatile MOF&#8208;assisted strategy to construct a freestanding 3D CNT/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) heterostructure film (CGHF). The film shows remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic performance in an alkaline electrolyte and can be used in highly efficient electrodes for overall water splitting and Zn&#8211;air batteries.

      <title>In a Nutshell: Topological Interlocking and Geometric Stiffening as Complementary Strategies for Strong Plant Shells (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2004519, Jessica C. Huss, Notburga Gierlinger, and co&#8208;workers reveal previously unknown functional interrelations between the structure, geometry, and mechanics in (nut)shells. Their multi&#8208;scale analysis suggests that simple geometric modifications, such as the development of puzzle&#8208;shaped instead of round cells, and small spherical shells instead of large ellipsoidal shells, increase the fracture resistance of hard plant shells resource&#8208;efficiently.

      <title>Magnetic Patterning: Magneto&#8208;Driven Gradients of Diamagnetic Objects for Engineering Complex Tissues (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2005030, Robert L. Mauck and co&#8208;workers magnetically pattern diamagnetic objects in 3D hydrogels to engineer complex tissues. Because the diamagnetic objects are suspended in a transiently paramagnetic solution, the objects are repelled from a permanent magnet. Most notably, unlabeled living cells are magneto&#8208;patterned to generate cartilaginous tissues with a native&#8208;like cell gradient.

      <title>Flow Patterns: Numerical Simulations and In Situ Optical Microscopy Connecting Flow Pattern, Crystallization, and Thin&#8208;Film Properties for Organic Transistors with Superior Device&#8208;to&#8208;Device Uniformity (Adv. Mater. 48/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive analytical system that connects flow pattern, crystallization, and thin&#8208;film properties is introduced by Steve Park, Jaewook Nam, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2004864. Using 3D&#8208;patterned microfluidic channels, flow pattern is precisely manipulated. 3D numerical simulation and in situ microscopy enable tracking of the flow pattern along its entire path, elucidating its relation to the crystallization process. The resulting organic thin&#8208;film transistors have superior device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity.

      <title>A Low&#8208;Swelling Polymeric Mixed Conductor Operating in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>
Although beneficial to ion transport, swelling can affect the performance and durability of organic mixed conductor devices. This communication presents a hydrophilic conjugated polymer, poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene], comparing its swelling properties to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art glycolated organic semiconductors for bioelectronics. Hydroxyl functionalization of poly(thiophene) backbone minimizes swelling while still allowing good ion uptake, resulting in robust organic electrochemical transistor operation in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Organic mixed conductors find use in batteries, bioelectronics technologies, neuromorphic computing, and sensing. While great progress has been achieved, polymer&#8208;based mixed conductors frequently experience significant volumetric changes during ion uptake/rejection, i.e., during doping/de&#8208;doping and charging/discharging. Although ion dynamics may be enhanced in expanded networks, these volumetric changes can have undesirable consequences, e.g., negatively affecting hole/electron conduction and severely shortening device lifetime. Here, the authors present a new material poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HHT) that is able to transport ions and electrons/holes, as tested in electrochemical absorption spectroscopy and organic electrochemical transistors, and that exhibits low swelling, attributed to the hydroxylated alkyl side&#8208;chain functionalization. P3HHT displays a thickness change upon passive swelling of only +2.5%, compared to +90% observed for the ubiquitous poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, and +10 to +15% for polymers such as poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (p[g2T&#8208;TT]). Applying a bias pulse during swelling, this discrepancy becomes even more pronounced, with the thickness of P3HHT films changing by &lt;10%&#160;while that of p(g2T&#8208;TT) structures increases by +75 to +80%. Importantly, the initial P3HHT film thickness is essentially restored after de&#8208;doping while p(g2T&#8208;TT) remains substantially swollen. The authors, thus, expand the materials&#8208;design toolbox for the creation of low&#8208;swelling soft mixed conductors with tailored properties and applications in bioelectronics and beyond.

      <title>Transparent Hybrid Opals with Unexpected Strong Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Energy Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Optical absorption, being absent in the pure polymer matrix and that with ordered particles, is remarkably amplified in a self&#8208;assembled polymer&#8208;tethered (brush) particles comprised of low contrast constituents. The amplification is shown to be caused by &#8220;photon slowdown&#8221; and to induce rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of materials even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption.








Abstract
Photothermal energy conversion is of fundamental importance to applications ranging from drug delivery to microfluidics and from ablation to fabrication. It typically originates from absorptive processes in materials that&#8212;when coupled with non&#8208;radiative dissipative processes&#8212;allow the conversion of radiative energy into heat. Microstructure design provides versatile strategies for controlling light&#8211;matter interactions. In particular, the deliberate engineering of the band structure in photonic materials is known to be an effective approach to amplify absorption in materials. However, photonic amplification is generally tied to high optical contrast materials which limit the applicability of the concept to metamaterials such as microfabricated metal&#8211;air hybrids. This contribution describes the first observation of pronounced amplification of absorption in low contrast opals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of polymer&#8208;tethered particles. The dependence of the amplification factor on the length scale and degree of order of materials as well as the angle of incidence reveal that it is related to the slow photon effect. A remarkable amplification factor of 16 is shown to facilitate the rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of opal films even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption. The results point to novel opportunities for tailoring light&#8211;matter interactions in hybrid materials that can benefit the manipulation and fabrication of functional materials.

      <title>Ternary Ta2PdS6 Atomic Layers for an Ultrahigh Broadband Photoresponsive Phototransistor</title>
      <dc:description>
A new 2D material, atomic layer Ta2PdS6, is introduced to the 2D family, and exhibits excellent optoelectronic and electronic performances including an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106, electron mobility of 25 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106 and one&#8208;year air stability, making it a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
2D noble&#8208;transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (NTMCs) are emerging as a promising class of optoelectronic materials due to ultrahigh air stability, large bandgap tunability, and high photoresponse. Here, a new set of 2D NTMC: Ta2PdS6 atomic layers is developed, displaying the excellent comprehensive optoelectronic performance with an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 7.1&#160;&#215; 1010 Jones and a high photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106 under laser illumination at a wavelength of 633&#160;nm with a power of 0.025 W m&#8722;2, which is ascribed to a photogating effect via study of the device band profiles. Especially, few&#8208;layer Ta2PdS6 exhibits a good broadband photoresponse, ranging from 450&#160;nm in the ultraviolet region to 1450&#160;nm in the shortwave infrared (SIR) region. Moreover, this material also delivers an impressive electronic performance with electron mobility of &#8776;25 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106, and a one&#8208;year air stability, which is better than those of most reported 2D materials. Our&#160;studies underscore Ta2PdS6 as a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Persistent Conjugated Backbone and Disordered Lamellar Packing Impart Polymers with Efficient n&#8208;Doping and High Conductivities</title>
      <dc:description>
Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity of over 90 S cm&#8722;1 and thermoelectric performance up to 106 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable highly conductive polymers are of great interest in emerging electronic applications. For p&#8208;doped polymers, conductivities as high a nearly 105 S cm&#8722;1 have been reported. In the case of n&#8208;doped polymers, they often fall well short of the high values noted above, which might be achievable, if much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities determined could be realized in combination with high charge&#8208;carrier densities. This is in part due to inefficient doping and dopant ions disturbing the ordering of polymers, limiting efficient charge transport and ultimately the achievable conductivities. Here, n&#8208;doped polymers that achieve a high conductivity of more than 90 S cm&#8722;1 by a simple solution&#8208;based co&#8208;deposition method are reported. Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to, and excellent miscibility with, commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity and thermoelectric performance.

      <title>Elucidation of the Synergistic Effect of Dopants and Vacancies on Promoted Selectivity for CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel SnO2 nanosheet catalyst presents a possible synergistic effect of N dopants and oxygen vacancies on the activity and selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to formate. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties with optimal N dopants and O vacancies are identified as active sites with intrinsically enhanced activity.








Abstract
Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as promising catalysts for the CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to formate (HCOO&#8722;). However, their insufficient selectivity and activity remain grand challenges. A new type of SnO2 nanosheet with simultaneous N dopants and oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS) for promoting CO2 conversion to HCOO&#8722; is reported. Due to the likely synergistic effect of N dopant and VO, the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS exhibits high catalytic selectivity featured by an HCOO&#8722; Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83% at &#8722;0.9 V and an FE of &gt; 90% for all C1 products (HCOO&#8722; and CO) at a wide potential range from &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.2 V. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties are the active sites with optimal electronic and geometric structures regulated by VO and N dopants. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the reaction free energy of HCOO* protonation is decreased on the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS, thus enhancing HCOO&#8722; selectivity. The weakened H* adsorption energy also inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, a dominant side reaction during the CO2RR. Furthermore, using the catalyst as the cathode, a spontaneous Galvanic Zn&#8208;CO2 cell and a solar&#8208;powered electrolysis process successfully demonstrated the efficient HCOO&#8722; generation through CO2 conversion and storage.

      <title>Full Concentration Gradient&#8208;Tailored Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A precise elemental gradient design for practical lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) agglomerated spheres is developed, providing a unique tool for the optimization of voltage retention and electrochemical/thermal stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The effects of elemental gradient on the LLOs, especially from a mechanical/electrochemical stress point of view, have been quantitively elucidated for stability evaluation.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) are prospective cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but severe voltage decay and energy attenuation with cycling still hinder their practical applications. Herein, a series of full concentration gradient&#8208;tailored agglomerated&#8208;sphere LLOs are designed with linearly decreasing Mn and linearly increasing Ni and Co from the particle center to the surface. The gradient&#8208;tailored LLOs exhibit noticeably reduced voltage decay, enhanced rate performance, improved cycle stability, and thermal stability. Without any material modifications or electrolyte optimizations, the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO with medium&#8208;slope shows the best electrochemical performance, with a very low average voltage decay of 0.8&#160;mV per cycle as well as a capacity retention of 88.4% within 200 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. These excellent findings are due to spinel structure suppression, electrochemical stress optimization, and Jahn&#8208;Teller effect inhibition. Further investigation shows that the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO reduces the thermal release percentage by as much as about 41% when the battery is charged to 4.4&#160;V. This study provides an effective method to suppress the voltage decay of LLOs for further practical utilization in LIBs and also puts forward a bulk&#8208;structure design strategy to prepare better electrode materials for different rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Tailored Mesoporous Inorganic Biomaterials: Assembly, Functionalization, and Drug Delivery Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Tailored mesoporous inorganic nanocarriers with abundant compositions and structures exhibit unprecedented drug&#8208;loading capacity and sustained responsive release behavior under various stimuli (e.g., pH, redox, temperature, magnetic field, and light), and exceptionally mesoporous structure plays an important role in the diffusion and transport of drug molecules, which will open a new door for drug therapy and new biological nanocarriers.








Abstract
Infectious or immune diseases have caused serious threat to human health due to their complexity and specificity, and emerging drug delivery systems (DDSs) have evolved into the most promising therapeutic strategy for drug&#8208;targeted therapy. Various mesoporous biomaterials are exploited and applied as efficient nanocarriers to loading drugs by virtue of their large surface area, high porosity, and prominent biocompatibility. Nanosized mesoporous nanocarriers show great potential in biomedical research, and it has become the research hotspot in the interdisciplinary field. Herein, recent progress and assembly mechanisms on mesoporous inorganic biomaterials (e.g., silica, carbon, metal oxide) are summarized systematically, and typical functionalization methods (i.e., hybridization, polymerization, and doping) for nanocarriers are also discussed in depth. Particularly, structure&#8211;activity relationship and the effect of physicochemical parameters of mesoporous biomaterials, including morphologies (e.g., hollow, core&#8211;shell), pore textures (e.g., pore size, pore volume), and surface features (e.g., roughness and hydrophilic/hydrophobic) in DDS application are overviewed and elucidated in detail. As one of the important development directions, advanced stimuli&#8208;responsive DDSs (e.g., pH, temperature, redox, ultrasound, light, magnetic field) are highlighted. Finally, the prospect of mesoporous biomaterials in disease therapeutics is stated, and it will open a new spring for the development of mesoporous nanocarriers.

      <title>Recent Advances and Perspectives on Calcium&#8208;Ion Storage: Key Materials and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;ion based technologies are attractive for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance energy storage, while their development is currently far from practical applications. An overview of the key electrode materials for Ca2+ storage and a comprehensive insight of promising optimization strategies such as multi&#8208;ion strategy are critical to promote further development of Ca2+ technologies.








Abstract
The urgent demand for cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices for large&#8208;scale applications has led to the development of several beyond&#8208;lithium energy storage systems (EESs). Among them, calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) are attractive due to abundant calcium resources, excellent volumetric and gravimetric capacities of Ca metal anode, and potential high energy density coming from the multivalent feature of Ca&#8208;ion. Therefore, the exploration of CIBs electrode materials and the construction of CIBs devices are gaining increasing research interest. Relevant publications cover a wide range of materials by both theoretical and experimental investigations, whereas the performances of rocking&#8208;chair CIBs have been unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, multi&#8208;ion strategies using more than one ion as the charge carrier have been demonstrated to be feasible and promising options in realizing room temperature CIBs. The summary and reflection of previous studies would provide useful information for future exploration and optimization. In this circumstance, this paper overviews the reported CIBs electrode materials, including both anode and cathode, and presents the latest progress of multi&#8208;ion strategies in CIBs. Fundamental challenges, potential solutions, and opportunities are accordingly proposed, mimicking other more mature EESs. This review may promote the development of electrode materials and accelerate the construction of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance CIBs.

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ti3C2Tx MXene Antennas for Radio&#8208;Frequency Communication</title>
      <dc:description>
MXene microstrip patch antennas with ultrahigh&#8208;power radiation in a wide frequency range are fabricated by spray&#8208;coating. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date.








Abstract
Highly integrated, flexible, and ultrathin wireless communication components are in significant demand due to the explosive growth of portable and wearable electronic devices in the fifth&#8208;generation (5G) network era, but only conventional metals meet the requirements for emerging radio&#8208;frequency (RF) devices so far. Here, it is reported on Ti3C2Tx MXene microstrip transmission lines with low&#8208;energy attenuation and patch antennas with high&#8208;power radiation at frequencies from 5.6 to 16.4&#160;GHz. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna manufactured by spray&#8208;coating from aqueous solution reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a standard 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna at about 15% of its thickness and 7% of the copper weight. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date. Moreover, it is demonstrated that an MXene patch antenna array with integrated feeding circuits on a conformal surface has comparable performance with that of a copper antenna array at 28&#160;GHz, which is a target frequency in practical 5G applications. The versatility of MXene antennas in wide frequency ranges coupled with the flexibility, scalability, and ease of solution processing makes MXene promising for integrated RF components in various flexible electronic devices.

      <title>Imaging Cellular Aerobic Glycolysis using Carbon Dots for Early Warning of Tumorigenesis</title>
      <dc:description>
The occurrence of aerobic glycolysis based on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;induced enhancement of fluorescence emitted by nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots is revealed by a new strategy. This can be used to monitor the occurrence of tumorigenesis and provide an early warning of tumor formation with high accuracy and specificity.








Abstract
Early warning of tumor formation is crucial for the classification, treatment, and prognosis of tumor patients. Here, a new strategy is reported, aimed at realizing this goal based on imaging aerobic glycolysis processes using nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots (N&#8208;CDs) as fluorescent probes. The intensity of the photoluminescence emitted by the N&#8208;CDs is specifically enhanced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, oxidized) in the physiological environment. The N&#8208;CDs allow a few (five to ten) abnormal cells in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma models to be identified before the in situ development of tumor tissue. The N&#8208;CD probes can also distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and be used to evaluate their proliferation activity (with a specificity of up to 96.15% in 13 types of tumor cells and 90.90% in orthotopic xenograft models). The N&#8208;CDs are successfully used to monitor the invasion of tumor cells into neighboring tissues and body fluids in 49 clinical samples (with a sensitivity up to 79.31%). These included three vitreous body samples (from patients with retinoblastoma), 42 urine samples (22 patients clinically diagnosed with urothelium carcinoma and 20 healthy persons), and four hydrothorax samples (from patients with metastatic lesions).

      <title>Observation of Standing Spin Waves in a van der Waals Magnetic Material</title>
      <dc:description>
Standing spin&#8208;wave modes are reported in a van der Waals magnetic material. These modes travel along the CrCl3 sample thickness of 20 mm and are reflected at the boundaries. These spin waves can be useful for creating tunable van der Waals magnonic devices operating at GHz frequencies.








Abstract
Spin waves are studied for data storage, communication, and logic circuits in the field of spintronics based on their potential to substitute electrons. The recent discovery of magnetism in 2D systems such as monolayer CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 has led to a renewed interest in such applications of magnetism in the 2D limit. Here, direct evidence of standing spin waves is presented along with the uniform precessional resonance modes in the van der Waals magnetic material, CrCl3. This is the first direct observation of standing spin&#8208;wave modes, set up along a thickness of 20&#160;mm, in a van der Waals material. Standing spin waves are detected in the vicinity of both branches, optical and acoustic, of the antiferromagnetic resonance. Magnon&#8211;magnon coupling and softening of resonance modes with temperature enable extraction of interlayer exchange field as a function of temperature.

      <title>Electrochemical Delamination of Ultralarge Few&#8208;Layer Black Phosphorus with a Hydrogen&#8208;Free Intercalation Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultralarge few&#8208;layer black&#8208;phosphorus single crystals are obtained with a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical exfoliation mechanism using CH3COOTBA intercalation. The largest size is up to 119 &#181;m with an average around at 77.6 &#177; 15.0 &#181;m. A high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, and a broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850 nm with ultrahigh responsivity are achieved at 298 K.








Abstract
Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FL&#8208;BP) crystals is often below 10&#160;&#181;m, which extremely limits its further applications in large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL&#8208;BP single&#8208;crystalline domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium acetate (CH3COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the average domain size of FL&#8208;BP crystal up to 77.6&#160;&#177; 15.0&#160;&#181;m and the largest domain size is found to be as large as 119&#160;&#181;m. The presence of H+ and H2O is found to sharply decrease the size of as&#8208;exfoliated FL&#8208;BP flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated FL&#8208;BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and an on/off ratio of 103 at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850&#160;nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a scalable, simple, and low&#8208;cost approach for large&#8208;area BP films that meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.

      <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide Driven by the Intrinsic Defects in the Carbon Plane of a Single Fe&#8211;N4 Site</title>
      <dc:description>
The outstanding electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction activity of the intrinsic defect in a carbon&#8208;based catalyst containing a single Fe&#8211;N4 site is highlighted. Benefiting from its immunity for the adsorbed intermediates, such as *CO, as well as the enhanced intrinsic activity after incorporating with the Fe&#8211;N4 site, the intrinsic defect acts as the real active center for carbon dioxide reduction and outperforms single Fe&#8211;N4 centers.








Abstract
Manipulating the in&#8208;plane defects of metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon catalysts to regulate the electroreduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) remains a challenging task. Here, it is demonstrated that the activity of the intrinsic carbon defects can be dramatically improved through coupling with single&#8208;atom Fe&#8211;N4 sites. The resulting catalyst delivers a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 90% and a CO partial current density of 33&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1 m KHCO3. The remarkable enhancements are maintained in concentrated electrolyte, endowing a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with a high CO selectivity of 86.5% at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further analysis suggests that the intrinsic defect is the active sites for CO2RR, instead of the Fe&#8211;N4 center. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe&#8211;N4 coupled intrinsic defect exhibits a reduced energy barrier for CO2RR and suppresses the hydrogen evolution activity. The high intrinsic activity, coupled with fast electron&#8208;transfer capability and abundant exposed active sites, induces excellent electrocatalytic performance.

      <title>Plant Nanobionic Sensors for Arsenic Detection</title>
      <dc:description>
Exploiting the natural ability of plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenite from the belowground environment, a living plant nanobionic sensor is engineered for non&#8208;destructive arsenite monitoring. By embedding near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors within the mesophyll, living plants are converted into environmental sensors for real&#8208;time arsenite detection. This demonstration opens new frontiers for plant&#8208;based sensors in environmental monitoring and food safety research.








Abstract
Arsenic is a highly toxic heavy&#8208;metal pollutant which poses a significant health risk to humans and other ecosystems. In this work, the natural ability of wild&#8208;type plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenic from the belowground environment is exploited to engineer plant nanobionic sensors for real&#8208;time arsenic detection. Near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors are specifically designed for sensitive and selective detection of arsenite. These optical nanosensors are embedded in plant tissues to non&#8208;destructively access and monitor the internal dynamics of arsenic taken up by the plants via the roots. The integration of optical nanosensors with living plants enables the conversion of plants into self&#8208;powered autosamplers of arsenic from their environment. Arsenite detection is demonstrated with three different plant species as nanobionic sensors. Based on an experimentally validated kinetic model, the nanobionic sensor could detect 0.6 and 0.2 ppb levels of arsenic after 7 and 14 days respectively by exploiting the natural ability of Pteris cretica ferns to hyperaccumulate and tolerate exceptionally high level of arsenic. The sensor readout could also be interfaced with portable electronics at a standoff distance, potentially enabling applications in environmental monitoring and agronomic research.

Abstract
Fabrication of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;power&#8208;density packaged long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life rechargeable microbatteries remains a considerable challenge.

To assist the critical challenge of hermetic packaging, the microbattery is infilled with a gel electrolyte. The packaged cell exhibits high areal energy and power densities of 1.24 J cm&#8722;2 and 75.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, respectively, and can be cycled 550 times in argon or 200 times in air with 75% capacity retention of the initial discharge capacity. An unpackaged cell, using a liquid electrolyte, provides a power density of 218&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. As far as it is known, the microbatteries have the highest peak power density among all reported microbatteries.

      <title>Quasi&#8208;Epitaxial Growth of Magnetic Nanostructures on 4H&#8208;Au Nanoribbons</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal&#8208;phase engineering of Co and Ni nanostructures is reported, which is realized by quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth on 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons. Notably, a new phase of Co, namely 14H, is formed due to the generation of ordered misfit dislocations in the grown Co nanostructures. The as&#8208;prepared 14H&#8208;Co nanostructures are ferromagnetic at room temperature.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to tune the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials for various promising applications. Herein, by using the 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons as templates, four novel magnetic nanostructures, namely 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, and 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Ni nanoribbons, are synthesized based on the quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth. Different from the conventional epitaxial growth of metal nanomaterials, the obtained Co and Ni nanostructures possess different crystal phases from the Au template. Due to the large lattice mismatch between Au and the grown metals (i.e., Co and Ni), ordered misfit dislocations are generated at the Co/Au and Ni/Au interfaces. Notably, a new super&#8208;structure of Co is formed, denoted as 14H. Both 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches and nanoribbons are ferromagnetic at room temperature, showing similar Curie temperature. However, their magnetic behaviors exhibit distinct temperature dependence, resulting from the competition between spin and volume fluctuations as well as the unique geometry. This work paves the way to the templated synthesis of nanomaterials with unconventional crystal phases for the exploration of phase&#8208;dependent properties.

      <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries with a Limited Lithium Metal Anode at Room Temperature using a Garnet&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>
Owing to the stability between lithium metal and a garnet&#8208;type solid electrolyte, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are proved to possess longer cycling life than that of liquid&#8208;state LMBs under limited lithium anode condition. Moreover, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs with long cycling life using a limited lithium metal anode are achieved at room temperature through a hybrid solid&#8208;state electrolyte design.








Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li), considered as the ultimate anode, is expected to promise high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries. However, owing to the continuous Li consumption during the repeated Li plating/stripping cycling, excess amount of the Li metal anode is commonly utilized in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), leading to reduced energy density and increased cost. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery (ASSLMB) based on a garnet&#8208;oxide solid electrolyte with an ultralow negative/positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) is reported. Compared with the counterpart using a liquid electrolyte at the same low N/P ratios, ASSLMBs show longer cycling life, which is attributed to the higher Coulombic efficiency maintained during cycling. The effect of the species of the interface layer on the cycling performance of ASSLMBs with low N/P ratio is also studied. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the ASSLMB using a limited Li metal anode paired with a LiFePO4 cathode (5.9 N/P ratio) delivers a stable long&#8208;term cycling performance at room temperature. Furthermore, it is revealed that enhanced specific energies for ASSLMBs with low N/P ratios can be further achieved by the use of a high&#8208;voltage or high mass&#8208;loading cathode. This study sheds light on the practical high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries under the constrained condition of a limited Li metal anode.

Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery (ASSLMB) based on a garnet&#8208;oxide solid electrolyte with an ultralow negative/positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) is reported. Compared with the counterpart using a liquid electrolyte at the same low N/P ratios, ASSLMBs show longer cycling life, which is attributed to the higher Coulombic efficiency maintained during cycling. The effect of the species of the interface layer on the cycling performance of ASSLMBs with low N/P ratio is also studied. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the ASSLMB using a limited Li metal anode paired with a LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (5.9 N/P ratio) delivers a stable long&#8208;term cycling performance at room temperature. Furthermore, it is revealed that enhanced specific energies for ASSLMBs with low N/P ratios can be further achieved by the use of a high&#8208;voltage or high mass&#8208;loading cathode. This study sheds light on the practical high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries under the constrained condition of a limited Li metal anode.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processed All&#8208;Ceramic Plasmonic Metamaterials for Efficient Solar&#8211;Thermal Conversion over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C</title>
      <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed large&#8208;area plasmonic metamaterial with all&#8208;ceramic components is demonstrated to achieve high solar absorption but low IR emission over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, leading to higher solar&#8211;thermal conversion efficiency than vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. Accompanied by its great thermal stability (727&#160;&#176;C) and low cost (&lt;1.6&#160;USD&#160;m&#8722;2), the versatile metamaterial will benefit both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal systems.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;area solar&#8211;thermal absorbers with superior spectral selectivity and excellent thermal stability are vital for efficient and large&#8208;scale solar&#8211;thermal conversion applications, such as space heating, desalination, ice mitigation, photothermal catalysis, and concentrating solar power. Few state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art selective absorbers are qualified for both low&#8208; (&lt;200&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;temperature (&gt;600&#160;&#176;C) applications due to insufficient spectral selectivity or thermal stability over a wide temperature range. Here, a high&#8208;performance plasmonic metamaterial selective absorber is developed by facile solution&#8208;based processes via assembling an ultrathin (&#8776;120&#160;nm) titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticle film on a TiN mirror. Enabled by the synergetic in&#8208;plane plasmon and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances, the all&#8208;ceramic plasmonic metamaterial simultaneously achieves high, full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption (95%), low mid&#8208;IR emission (3% at 100&#160;&#176;C), and excellent stability over a temperature range of 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, even outperforming most vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers at their specific operating temperatures. The competitive performance of the solution&#8208;processed absorber is accompanied by a significant cost reduction compared with vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. All these merits render it a cost&#8208;effective, universal solution to offering high efficiency (89&#8211;93%) for both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal applications.

      <title>Lifshitz Transition and Non&#8208;Fermi Liquid Behavior in Highly Doped Semimetals</title>
      <dc:description>
A physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and non&#8208;Fermi liquid behavior in highly doped monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Based on Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory.








Abstract
The classical Fermi liquid theory and Drude model have provided fundamental ways to understand the resistivity of most metals. The violation of the classical theory, known as non&#8208;Fermi liquid (NFL) transport, appears in certain metals, including topological semimetals, but quantitative understanding of the NFL behavior has not yet been established. In particular, the determination of the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity, a sign of NFL behavior, remains a puzzling issue. Here, a physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in highly doped (a carrier density of &#8776;1022 cm&#8722;3) monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate an apparent chemical potential shift by temperature in monoclinic Nb2Se3, which induces a Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in the material. Accordingly, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory. This model provides a new experimental insight for nontrivial transport with NFL behavior or sign inversion of Seebeck coefficients in emerging materials.

      <title>Mutually Reinforced Polymer&#8211;Graphene Bilayer Membranes for Energy&#8208;Efficient Acoustic Transduction</title>
      <dc:description>
To fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio, lightweight, and transparent conductive membranes, single&#8208;layer graphene is reinforced by high&#8208;performance polyetherimide to form a laminate bilayer. The bilayer is exceptionally strong, lightweight, transparent, and conductive and has a record&#8208;high aspect ratio of 1 &#215; 105. As an acoustic transducer in a prototype electrostatic speaker, the bilayer consumes 100 times less energy than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers.








Abstract
Graphene holds promise for thin, ultralightweight, and high&#8208;performance nanoelectromechanical transducers. However, graphene&#8208;only devices are limited in size due to fatigue and fracture of suspended graphene membranes. Here, a lightweight, flexible, transparent, and conductive bilayer composite of polyetherimide and single&#8208;layer graphene is prepared and suspended on the centimeter scale with an unprecedentedly high aspect ratio of 105. The coupling of the two components leads to mutual reinforcement and creates an ultrastrong membrane that supports 30&#160;000 times its own weight. Upon electromechanical actuation, the membrane pushes a massive amount of air and generates high&#8208;quality acoustic sound. The energy efficiency is &#8776;10&#8211;100&#160;times better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers. The bilayer membrane's combined properties of electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, optical transparency, thermal stability, and chemical resistance will promote applications in electronics, mechanics, and optics.

      <title>Guest Encapsulation within Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Self&#8208;Assembled Cages</title>
      <dc:description>
The adsorption of two metal&#8211;organic coordination capsules on alumina is quantified and the cages are shown to retain their ability to bind and release a molecular cargo following immobilization. The adsorbed cages are then used to stabilize the reagents of a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction prior to their subsequent release and reaction.








Abstract
Coordination cages encapsulate a wide variety of guests in the solution state. This ability renders them useful for applications such as catalysis and the sequestration of precious materials. A simple and general method for the immobilization of coordination cages on alumina is reported. Cage loadings are quantified via adsorption isotherms and guest displacement assays demonstrate that the adsorbed cages retain the ability to encapsulate and separate guest and non&#8208;guest molecules. Finally, a system of two cages, adsorbed on to different regions of alumina, stabilizes and separates a pair of Diels&#8211;Alder reagents. The addition of a single competitive guest results in the controlled release of the reagents, thus triggering their reaction. This method of coordination cage immobilization on solid phases is envisaged to be applicable to the extensive library of reported cages, enabling new applications based upon selective solid&#8208;phase molecular encapsulation.

      <title>Photosynthetic Nanomaterial Hybrids for Bioelectricity and Renewable Energy Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Natural photosynthesis absorbs solar energy and generates photosynthetic electrons by water splitting with an internal quantum efficiency close to 100%. Various nanomaterials applied to photosynthetic complexes are discussed in detail, including the working principles and improvements in photosynthetic electron generation, transfer, conversion, and storage efficiency.








Abstract
Harvesting solar energy in the form of electricity from the photosynthesis of plants, algal cells, and bacteria has been researched as the most environment&#8208;friendly renewable energy technology in the last decade. The primary challenge has been the engineering of electrochemical interfacing with photosynthetic apparatuses, organelles, or whole cells. However, with the aid of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, there have been many advances, including enhanced photon absorption, increased generation of photosynthetic electrons (PEs), and more efficient transfer of PEs to electrodes. These advances have demonstrated the possibility for the technology to advance to a new level. In this article, the fundamentals of photosynthesis are introduced. How PE harvesting systems have improved concerning solar energy absorption, PE production, and PE collection by electrodes is discussed. The review focuses on how different kinds of nanomaterials are applied and function in interfacing with photosynthetic materials for enhanced PE harvesting. Finally, the review analyzes how the performance of PE harvesting and stand&#8208;alone systems have evolved so far and its future prospects.

However, with the aid of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, there have been many advances, including enhanced photon absorption, increased generation of photosynthetic electrons (PEs), and more efficient transfer of PEs to electrodes. These advances have demonstrated the possibility for the technology to advance to a new level. In this article, the fundamentals of photosynthesis are introduced. How PE harvesting systems have improved concerning solar energy absorption, PE production, and PE collection by electrodes is discussed. The review focuses on how different kinds of nanomaterials are applied and function in interfacing with photosynthetic materials for enhanced PE harvesting. Finally, the review analyzes how the performance of PE harvesting and stand&#8208;alone systems have evolved so far and its future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
