         <title>Recent Advances of Green Electricity Generation: Potential in Solar Interfacial Evaporation System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has played a pivotal role in optimizing water&#8208;energy utilization, reducing conventional power costs, and mitigating environmental impacts. The increasing emphasis on the synergistic co&#8208;generation of water and green electricity through SDIE is particularly noteworthy. However, there is a gap of existing reviews that have specifically focused on the mechanistic understanding of green power from WEC systems, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between efficiency of green energy utilization in WEC and materials design in SDIE. Particularly it lacks a comprehensive discussion to address the challenges faced in these areas along with potential solutions. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively assess the progress and future perspective of green electricity from water&#8208;electricity co&#8208;generation (WEC) systems by investigating the potential expansion of SDIE. Firstly, it provides a comprehensive overview about materials rational design, thermal management and water transportation tunnels in SDIE. Then it summarizes diverse energy sources utilized in the SDIE process, including steaming generation, photovoltaics, salinity gradients effect, temperature gradients effect, and piezoelectric effect. Subsequently, it explores factors that affect generated green electricity efficiency in WEC. Lastly, this review proposes challenges and possible solution in the development of WEC. The timely emergence of this review will promote the sustainable use of energy.

&lt;p&gt;Solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has played a pivotal role in optimizing water-energy utilization, reducing conventional power costs, and mitigating environmental impacts. The increasing emphasis on the synergistic co-generation of water and green electricity through SDIE is particularly noteworthy. However, there is a gap of existing reviews that have specifically focused on the mechanistic understanding of green power from WEC systems, the structure-activity relationship between efficiency of green energy utilization in WEC and materials design in SDIE.

         <title>Freeze&#8208;thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>

Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, we created a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC). The TNC consisted of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC released heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produced virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulated the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

         <title>Digital Multiphase Composites via Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanical properties of traditional engineering materials are typically coupled to each other, presenting a challenge to practitioners with multi&#8208;dimensional material property requirements. In this work we&#160;demonstrate continuous, independent control over multiple mechanical properties in composite materials realized using additive manufacturing. For the first time, we&#160;experimentally characterize composites additively manufactured from rigid plastic, soft elastomer, and liquid constituents, demonstrating materials which span four orders of magnitude in modulus and two orders of magnitude in toughness. By forming analytical mappings between relative concentrations of constituents at the microscale and resulting macroscale material properties, we&#160;enable inverse material design; we&#160;showcase the method by printing artifacts with prescribed toughness and elasticity distributions. We&#160;place the properties of these composites in the context of biological tissues, showing they have promise as mechanically plausible tissue&#160;mimics.

         <title>Building Stable Anodes for High&#8208;Rate Na&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the low&#8208;cost and high energy density, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have attracted growing interests, with great potential to power future electric vehicles (EVs) and mobile electronics, which require the rapid charge/discharge capability. However, the development of high&#8208;rate SMBs has been impeded by the sluggish Na+ ion kinetics, particularly at the sodium metal anode (SMA). The high&#8208;rate operation severely threatens the SMA stability, due to the unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), the Na dendrite growth, and large volume changes during Na plating&#8208;stripping cycles, leading to rapid electrochemical performance degradations. In this paper, we survey key challenges faced by high&#8208;rate SMAs, and we highlight representative stabilization strategies, including the general modification of SMB components (including the host, Na metal surface, electrolyte, separator, and cathode), and emerging solutions with the development of solid&#8208;state SMBs and liquid metal anodes; we elaborate the working principle, performance, and application of these strategies, to reduce the Na nucleation energy barriers and promote Na+ ion transfer kinetics for stable high&#8208;rate Na metal anodes. This review will inspire further efforts to stabilize SMAs and other metal (e.g., Li, K, Mg, Zn) anodes, promoting high&#8208;rate applications of high&#8208;energy metal batteries towards a more sustainable society.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Materials for CO2 And CH4 Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The catalytic conversion of greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2 constitutes an effective approach for alleviating the greenhouse effect and generating valuable chemical products. However, the intricate molecular characteristics characterized by high symmetry and bond energies, coupled with the complexity of associated reactions, pose challenges for conventional catalysts to attain high activity, product selectivity, and enduring stability. Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) materials, distinguished by their tunable composition and unique electronic structures, confer versatile physicochemical properties and modulable functionalities. In recent years, SAAs materials have demonstrated pronounced advantages and expansive prospects in catalytic conversion of CH4 and CO2. In this review, we begin by introducing the challenges entailed in catalytic conversion of CH4 and CO2 and the advantages offered by SAAs. Subsequently, we present the intricacies of synthesis strategies employed for SAAs and introduce characterization techniques and methodologies. The subsequent section furnishes a meticulous and inclusive overview of research endeavors concerning SAAs in CO2 catalytic conversion, CH4 conversion, and synergy CH4 and CO2 conversion. The particular emphasis is directed toward scrutinizing the intricate mechanisms underlying the influence of SAAs on reaction activity and product selectivity. Finally, insights are presented on the development and future challenges of SAAs in CH4 and CO2 conversion reactions.

         <title>Spectral Engineering of Optical Microresonators in Anisotropic Lithium Niobate Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
On&#8208;chip optical microresonators are essential building blocks in integrated optics. The ability to arbitrarily engineer their resonant frequencies is crucial for exploring novel physics in synthetic frequency dimensions and practical applications like nonlinear optical parametric processes and dispersion&#8208;engineered frequency comb generation. Photonic crystal ring (PhCR) resonators are a versatile tool for such arbitrary frequency engineering, by controllably creating mode splitting at selected resonances. To date, these PhCRs have mostly been demonstrated in isotropic photonic materials, while such engineering could be significantly more complicated in anisotropic platforms that often offer more fruitful optical properties. Here, we realize the spectral engineering of chip&#8208;scale optical microresonators in the anisotropic lithium niobate (LN) crystal by a gradient design that precisely compensates for variations in both refractive index and perturbation strength. We experimentally demonstrate controllable frequency splitting at single and multiple selected resonances in LN PhCR resonators with different sizes, while maintaining high Q&#8208;factors up to 1 &#215; 106. Moreover, we experimentally construct a sharp boundary in the synthetic frequency dimension based on an actively modulated x&#8208;cut LN gradient&#8208;PhCR, opening up new paths toward the arbitrary control of electro&#8208;optic comb spectral shapes and exploration of novel physics in the frequency degree of freedom.

We experimentally demonstrate controllable frequency splitting at single and multiple selected resonances in LN PhCR resonators with different sizes, while maintaining high &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;-factors up to 1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, we experimentally construct a sharp boundary in the synthetic frequency dimension based on an actively modulated x-cut LN gradient-PhCR, opening up new paths toward the arbitrary control of electro-optic comb spectral shapes and exploration of novel physics in the frequency degree of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Sulfur Conversion in High&#8208;Content Carbon Layer Confined Sulfur Cathode Maximizes Voltage And Rate Capability of K&#8208;S Batteries</title>

Abstract
Potassium&#8208;sulfur (K&#8208;S) battery has attracted attention in large&#8208;scale energy storage system. Small&#8208;molecule/covalent sulfur (SMCS) can help to avoid shuttle effect of polysulfide ions via solid&#8208;solid sulfur conversion. However, content of SMCS is relatively low (&#8804;40%), and solid&#8208;solid reaction cause sluggish kinetics and low discharge potentials. Herein, SMCS was confined in turbo carbon layers with content of &#8764;74.1 wt% via a C/S co&#8208;deposition process. In the K&#8208;S battery assembled by using as&#8208;fabricated SMCS@C as cathode and KFSI&#8208;EC/DEC as electrolyte, anion&#8208;regulated two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state S conversion chemistry and a novel high discharge potential plateau at 2.5&#8208;2.0&#160;V with remarkable reversible capacity of 384 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles were found. The SMCS@C||K full cell showed energy and power density of 72.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 873.2&#160;W kg&#8722;1, respectively, at 3 A g&#8722;1. Mechanism&#160;studies&#160;reveal&#160;that the&#160;enlarged carbon layer space enables the diffusion of K+&#8208;FSI&#8208;&#160;ion pairs, and the coulombic attraction between them accelerates their diffusion in SMCS@C. In addition, FSI&#8722;&#160;regulates sulfur conversion in situ inside the&#160;carbon layers along a two&#8208;plateau solid&#8208;state reaction pathway, which lowers the free energy and weakens the S&#8208;S bond of intermediates, leading to faster and more efficient S conversion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potassium-sulfur (K-S) battery has attracted attention in large-scale energy storage system. Small-molecule/covalent sulfur (SMCS) can help to avoid shuttle effect of polysulfide ions via solid-solid sulfur conversion. However, content of SMCS is relatively low (&#8804;40%), and solid-solid reaction cause sluggish kinetics and low discharge potentials. Herein, SMCS was confined in turbo carbon layers with content of &#8764;74.1 wt% via a C/S co-deposition process. In the K-S battery assembled by using as-fabricated SMCS@C as cathode and KFSI-EC/DEC as electrolyte, anion-regulated two-plateau solid-state S conversion chemistry and a novel high discharge potential plateau at 2.5-2.0&#160;V with remarkable reversible capacity of 384 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles were found. The SMCS@C||K full cell showed energy and power density of 72.8&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 873.2&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, at 3 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Mechanism&#160;studies&#160;reveal&#160;that the&#160;enlarged carbon layer space enables the diffusion of K+-FSI-&#160;ion pairs, and the coulombic attraction between them accelerates their diffusion in SMCS@C. In addition, FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;regulates sulfur conversion in situ inside the&#160;carbon layers along a two-plateau solid-state reaction pathway, which lowers the free energy and weakens the S-S bond of intermediates, leading to faster and more efficient S conversion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Versatile Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered organic redox&#8208;active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, we propose prospects and directions for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials in AMIBs.

         <title>Revealing the Substrate Constraint Effect on the Thermodynamic Behaviour of the Pd&#8208;H through Capacitive&#8208;based Hydrogen&#8208;Sorption Measurement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanical constraints imposed on the Pd&#8208;H system can induce significant strain upon hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion, potentially leading to changes in the thermodynamic behaviour, such as the phase&#8208;transition pressure. However, the investigation of the constraint effect is often tricky due to the lack of simple experimental techniques for measuring hydrogenation&#8208;induced expansion. In this study, we developed a capacitive&#8208;based measurement system to monitor hydrogenation&#8208;induced areal expansion, which allows us to control and evaluate the magnitude of the substrate constraint. By using the measurement technique, we investigate the influence of substrate constraint intensity on the thermodynamic behaviour of the Pd&#8208;H system. Through experiments with different constraint intensities, we found that the difference in the constraint intensity minimally affects the phase&#8208;transition pressure when the Pd&#8208;H system allows the release of constraint stress through plastic deformation. Our experiments can improve the understanding of the substrate constraint behaviours of Pd&#8208;H systems allowing plastic deformation while demonstrating the potential of capacitive&#8208;based measurement systems to study the mechanical&#8211;thermodynamic coupling of M&#8208;H systems.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Tandem Organic Photovoltaics for Indoor Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ability of achieving high efficiency makes tandem organic photovoltaics a competitive technique in potential indoor applications. Except high efficiency, reliable indoor energy supplying also calls for outstanding stability. However, unavoidable instable voltage&#8208;supply from circuit control system for indoor light sources like light emitting diodes and incandescent lamps would cause carrier density fluctuating and device fatigue drove by periodic light/dark switching. In this work, the strobing induced fatigue within bulk heterojunction/interconnecting layer interface is firstly revealed and overcome. Based on reliable and effective interfacial doping between conjugated acceptor and metal oxide, the interfacial capacitance that determines the strobing induced fatigue, has been significantly restrained. The imbalance carrier migration and fierce inter&#8208;layer accommodating during burn&#8208;in stage caused by light strobing are substantially diminished. Benefitted from this method, the stability of tandem device are highly enhanced under strobing indoor illumination and a champion efficiency (35.02%) is obtained. Our method provides a guidance for further material design for interconnecting layer in organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Engineering Semi&#8208;Reversed Quantum Well Photocatalysts for Highly&#8208;Efficient Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Fuels Conversion</title>

Abstract
Semiconductor quantum wells (QWs) exhibit high charge&#8208;utilization efficiency for light&#8208;emitting applications due to their strong charge confinement effect. Inspired by this effect, herein, we propose a new idea to significantly improve the photo&#8208;generated charge separation for attaining a highly&#8208;efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuels conversion process through &#8220;semi&#8208;reversing&#8221; the conventional QWs to confine only the photo&#8208;generated electrons. This electron confinement&#8208;improved charge separation is implemented in the well&#8208;designed model of the CdS/TiO2/CdS semi&#8208;reversed QW (SRQW) structure. The latter is fabricated by selectively assembling CdS quantum dots (QDs) onto the {101} facets (ultra&#8208;thin edge regions) of the TiO2 nanosheets (NSs). Upon light excitation, the photo&#8208;generated electrons of SRQW can be confined on the TiO2&#8208;{101} facets in the vicinity of the CdS/TiO2 hetero&#8208;interface. Thereby, the continuous multi&#8208;electron injection to the adsorbed reactants on the interfacial active&#8208;sites is significantly accelerated. Thus, the CdS/TiO2/CdS SRQW exhibits &#8764;35.7 and &#8764;56.0&#8208;fold enhancements on the photocatalytic activities for water and CO2 reduction, respectively, compared to those of pure TiO2. Correspondingly, its CH4&#8208;product selectivity is increased by &#8764;180%. Our work provides a novel charge separation mechanism, which is of great importance for the design of the next&#8208;generation quantum&#8208;sized photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuels conversion.

         <title>Advanced Terahertz Refractive Sensing And Fingerprint Recognition Through Metasurface&#8208;Excited Surface Waves</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;sensitive metasurface&#8208;based sensors are essential for effective substance detection and insightful bio&#8208;interaction studies, which compress light in subwavelength volumes to enhance light&#8208;matter interactions. However, current methods to improve sensing performance always focus on optimizing near&#8208;field response of individual meta&#8208;atom, and fingerprint recognition for bio&#8208;substances necessitates several pixelated metasurfaces to establish a quasi&#8208;continuous spectrum. Here, a novel sensing strategy is proposed to achieve Terahertz (THz) refractive sensing, and fingerprint recognition based on surface waves (SWs). Leveraging the long&#8208;range transmission, strong confinement, and interface sensitivity of SWs, a metasurface&#8208;supporting SWs excitation and propagation is experimentally verified to achieve sensing integrations. Through wide&#8208;band information collection of SWs, the proposed sensor not only facilitates refractive sensing up to 215.5&#176;/RIU, but also enables the simultaneous resolution of multiple fingerprint information within a continuous spectrum. By covering 5&#160;&#956;m thickness of polyimide, quartz and silicon nitride layers, the maximum phase change of 91.1&#176;, 101.8&#176; and 126.4&#176; is experimentally obtained within THz band, respectively. Thus, our strategy broadens the research scope of metasurface&#8208;excited SWs and introduces a novel paradigm for ultrasensitive sensing functions.

         <title>Design of a Biohybrid Materials Circuit with Binary Decoder Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biohybrid materials that communicate with each other via diffusible inhibitory or activating signals are assembled in a circuit topology inspired by an electronical binary 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output decoder. The decoder is programmed to convert different combinations of two input signals into the release of distinct protease outputs. Such information&#8208;processing biohybrid material circuits can be used for biomolecular computing and signal processing.








Abstract
Synthetic biology applies concepts from electrical engineering and information processing to endow cells with computational functionality. Transferring the underlying molecular components into materials and wiring them according to topologies inspired by electronic circuit boards has yielded materials systems that perform selected computational operations. However, the limited functionality of available building blocks is restricting the implementation of advanced information&#8208;processing circuits into materials. Here, a set of protease&#8208;based biohybrid modules the bioactivity of which can either be induced or inhibited is engineered. Guided by a quantitative mathematical model and following a design&#8208;build&#8208;test&#8208;learn (DBTL) cycle, the modules are wired according to circuit topologies inspired by electronic signal decoders, a fundamental motif in information processing. A 2&#8208;input/4&#8208;output binary decoder for the detection of two small molecules in a material framework that can perform regulated outputs in form of distinct protease activities is designed. The here demonstrated smart material system is strongly modular and can be used for biomolecular information processing for example in advanced biosensing or drug delivery applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Proton Conductor for Fuel Cells with Flexible Operational Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A developed dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid and phosphoric acid exhibits efficient and stable proton conductivity over 80&#8211;160 &#176;C owing to the strong interaction between the two proton conductors and enhanced proton dissociation, enabling fuel cell operation with a flexible temperature range and excellent stability.








Abstract
The properties of proton conductors determine the operating temperature range of fuel cells. Typically, phosphoric acid (PA) proton conductors exhibit excellent proton conductivity owing to their high proton dissociation and self&#8208;diffusion abilities. However, at low temperatures or high current densities, water&#8208;induced PA loss causes rapid degradation of cell performance. Maintaining efficient and stable proton conductivity within a flexible temperature range can significantly reduce the start&#8208;up temperature of PA&#8208;doped proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In this study, a dual&#8208;proton conductor composed of an organic phosphonic acid (ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, EDTMPA) and an inorganic PA is developed for proton exchange membranes. The proposed dual&#8208;proton conductor can operate within a flexible temperature range of 80&#8211;160 &#176;C, benefiting from the strong interaction between EDTMPA and PA, and the enhanced proton dissociation. Fuel cells with the EDTMPA&#8208;PA dual&#8208;proton conductor showed excellent cell stability at 80 &#176;C. In particular, under the high current density of 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 160 &#176;C, the voltage decay rate of the fuel cell with the dual&#8208;proton conductor is one&#8208;thousandth of that of the fuel cell with PA&#8208;only proton conductor, indicating excellent stability.

         <title>Bypassing the Single Junction Limit with Advanced Photovoltaic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bayesian optimization&#8208;based simulation framework is presented, able to perform virtual optimization of multi&#8208;junction solar cell architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Vertical and lateral architectures are proposed to surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion.








Abstract
Multijunction devices and photon up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion are prominent concepts aimed at increasing photovoltaic efficiencies beyond the single junction limit. Integrating these concepts into advanced architectures may address long&#8208;standing issues such as processing complexity, microstructure control, and resilience against spectral changes of the incoming radiation. However, so far, no models have been established to predict the performance of such integrated architectures. Here, a simulation environment based on Bayesian optimization is presented, that can predict and virtually optimize the electrical performance of multi&#8208;junction architectures, both vertical and lateral, in combination with up&#8208; and down&#8208;conversion materials. Microstructure effects on performance are explicitly considered using machine&#8208;learned predictive models from high throughput experimentation on simpler architectures. Two architectures that would surpass the single junction limit of photovoltaic energy conversion at reasonable complexity are identified: a vertical &#8220;staggered half octave system,&#8221; where selective absorption allows the use of 6 different bandgaps, and the lateral &#8220;overlapping rainbow system&#8221; where selective irradiation allows the use of a narrowband energy acceptor with reduced voltage losses, according to the energy gap law. Both architectures would be highly resilient against spectral changes, in contrast with two terminal multi&#8208;junction architectures which are limited by Kirchhoff's law.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Encapsulation Regulates Nephrogenesis in Kidney Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived kidney organoids contain nephron segments that recapitulate morphological and functional aspects of the human kidney. However, directed differentiation protocols for kidney organoids are largely conducted using biochemical signals to control differentiation. Here, the hypothesis that mechanical signals regulate nephrogenesis is investigated in three&#8208;dimensional culture by encapsulating kidney organoids within viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with varying rates of stress relaxation. Tubular nephron segments are significantly more convoluted in kidney organoids differentiated in encapsulating hydrogels when compared with those in suspension culture. Hydrogel viscoelasticity regulates the spatial distribution of nephron segments within the differentiating kidney organoids. Consistent with these observations, a particle&#8208;based computational model predicts that the extent of deformation of the hydrogel&#8208;organoid interface regulates the morphology of nephron segments. Elevated extracellular calcium levels in the culture medium, which can be impacted by the hydrogels, decrease the glomerulus&#8208;to&#8208;tubule ratio of nephron segments. These findings reveal that hydrogel encapsulation regulates nephron patterning and morphology and suggest that the mechanical microenvironment is an important design variable for kidney regenerative medicine.

         <title>Polymer Molecules Adsorption&#8208;Induced Zincophilic&#8208;Hydrophobic Protective Layer Enables Highly Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zn metal, as one of the most promising anode materials for aqueous batteries, suffers from uncontrollable dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions, which drastically compromise its cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, we propose a nonionic amphipathic additive Tween&#8208;20 (denoted as TW20) that bears both zincophilic and hydrophobic units. The zincophilic segment of TW20 preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode, while the hydrophobic segment is exposed on the electrolyte side, forming an electrolyte&#8208;facing hydrophobic layer that shields the anode from active water molecules. Moreover, theoretical calculation and experimental results reveal that the TW20 additive is able to induce the preferential growth of the (002) plane by adsorbing on other facets, enabling a highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Benefitting from the multi&#8208;functional TW20 additive, the long&#8208;term stability and reversibility of Zn anodes are substantially improved, reflected by stable cycling for over 2500&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 500&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2 as well as high reversibility with a high average CE of 99.4% at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The full cells paired with MnO2 demonstrate a long lifespan for more than 700 cycles at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work is expected to provide a new approach to modulate Zn electrode interface chemistry for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Zn metal, as one of the most promising anode materials for aqueous batteries, suffers from uncontrollable dendrite growth and water-induced parasitic reactions, which drastically compromise its cycle life and Coulombic efficiency (CE). Herein, we propose a nonionic amphipathic additive Tween-20 (denoted as TW20) that bears both zincophilic and hydrophobic units. The zincophilic segment of TW20 preferentially adsorbs on the Zn anode, while the hydrophobic segment is exposed on the electrolyte side, forming an electrolyte-facing hydrophobic layer that shields the anode from active water molecules. Moreover, theoretical calculation and experimental results reveal that the TW20 additive is able to induce the preferential growth of the (002) plane by adsorbing on other facets, enabling a highly reversible and dendrite-free Zn anode. Benefitting from the multi-functional TW20 additive, the long-term stability and reversibility of Zn anodes are substantially improved, reflected by stable cycling for over 2500&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 500&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2 as well as high reversibility with a high average CE of 99.4% at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The full cells paired with MnO2 demonstrate a long lifespan for more than 700 cycles at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work is expected to provide a new approach to modulate Zn electrode interface chemistry for highly stable Zn anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conducting Polymer Coatings Prepared by Mixed Emulsions Are Highly Conductive and Stable in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting polymer coating is prepared by a mixture of two emulsions: an aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer, and an aqueous emulsion of hydrophobic and rubbery chains copolymerized with silane coupling agents. The coating features percolated nanocrystals which make the coating highly conductive, and the hydrophobic covalent network which stabilizes the coating in water.








Abstract
An aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer is commonly applied on a substrate to form a coating after drying. The coating, however, disintegrates in water. This paper reports a coating prepared using a mixture of two emulsions: an aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer, and an aqueous emulsion of hydrophobic and rubbery chains copolymerized with silane coupling agents. When applied on a substrate and dried, particles of the mixed emulsion merge into a continuous film. While the conducting polymer forms percolated nanocrystals, the silane groups crosslink the rubbery chains and interlink the rubbery chains to the substrate. The percolated nanocrystals make the coating highly conductive. The covalent network of hydrophobic polymer chains stabilizes the coating in water. The high conductivity and stability in water may enable broad applications.

         <title>Light and Magnetism Orchestrating Aquatic Pollutant&#8208;Degradation Robots in Programmable Trajectories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart aquatic superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled composite heterojunction minerals is developed based on the liquid film&#8208;confined strategy. Taking advantage of the remarkable photothermal and magnetic properties, the aquatic robot exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient navigation in broad range of surface tensions, and the purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ by the synergistic orchestration of light and magnetism.








Abstract
Interfacial floating robots have promising applications in carriers, environmental monitoring, water treatment, and so on. Even though, engineering smart robots with both precisely efficient navigation and elimination of water pollutants in long term remains a challenge, as the superhydrophobicity greatly lowers resistance for aquatic motion while sacrificing chemical reactivity of the surface. Here, a pollutant&#8208;removing superhydrophobic robot integrated with well&#8208;assembled iron oxide&#8208;bismuth sulfide heterojunction composite minerals, which provide both light and magnetic propulsion, and the ability of catalytic degradation, is reported. The motion velocity of the robot reaches up to 51.9&#160;mm s&#8722;1 within only 300&#160;ms of acceleration under the orchestration of light, and brakes rapidly (&#8776;200&#8211;300&#160;ms) once turn off the light. And magnetism extends the robot to work in broad range of surface tensions in any programmable trajectory. Besides, purification of polluted water is efficiently achieved in situ and the degradation efficiency exhibits eightfold enhancements under the effect of light&#8208;triggered photothermal behavior coupled with magnetic induction, overcoming the dilemma of efficient motion with catalytic superhydrophobicity. This strategy developed here provides guidelines for the explorations of high&#8208;performance smart devices.

         <title>Tandem Catalysis inside Double&#8208;Shelled Nanocages with Separated and Tunable Atomic Catalyst Sites for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages with separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites are developed as nano reactors to trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of lithium polysulfides. These nanocages can serve as multifunctional sulfur hosts for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, guaranteeing admirable rate performance and high stability in battery cycling.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atomic catalysts are effective in mitigating the shuttling effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, but their ideal performance has yet to be achieved due to the multi&#8208;step conversion of LiPSs requiring multifunctional active sites for tandem catalysis. Here double&#8208;shelled nano&#8208;cages (DSNCs) have been developed to address this challenge, featuring separated and tunable single&#8208;atom sites as nano reactors that trigger tandem catalysis and promote the efficient electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. This enables high capacity and durable Li&#8208;S batteries. The DSNCs, with inner Co&#8208;N4 and outer Zn&#8208;N4 sites (S/CoNC@ZnNC DSNCs), exhibit a high specific capacity of 1186 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, along with a low capacity fading rate of 0.063% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm&#8722;2) and a low E/S ratio (6 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), the cell displays excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the Li&#8208;S pouch cells are capable of stable cycling for more than 160 cycles. These results demonstrate the feasibility of driving successive sulfur conversion reactions with separated active sites, and are expected to inspire further catalyst design for high performance Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Ionic Polyimine&#8208;Based Composite Membrane with Inductive and Complexation Synergistic Effects for Sensitive and On&#8208;Site Fluorescent Detection of Volatile Iodine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concerns about radioactive iodine emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage are raised. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;based method using an ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone composite membrane is developed for on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by utilizing ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions and complexation effects for iodine enrichment and immobilization. The resulting membrane shows rapid response time and low detection limit.








Abstract
Along with the development of nuclear power, concerns about radioactive emissions and the potential for nuclear leakage have been widely raised, particularly of harmful iodine isotopes. However, as a significant component of nuclear air waste, the enrichment and detection of air&#8208;dispersed gaseous iodine remain a challenge. In this work, it is focused on developing an attraction&#8208;immobilization&#8208;detection strategy&#8208;based fluorescence method for the on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine, by employing a photoluminescent ionic polyimine network&#8208;polyvinylpyrrolidone (IPIN&#8208;PVP) composite membrane. This strategy synergizes ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions from IPIN and complexation effects from PVP, allowing effective iodine enrichment and immobilization. As a result, the optimized IPIN&#8208;PVP membrane exhibits rapid response times of 5 s and a low detection limit of 4.087 &#215; 10&#8722;8&#160;m for gaseous iodine. It also introduces a portable handheld detection device that utilizes the composite membrane, offering a practical solution for real&#8208;time on&#8208;site detection of volatile iodine. This innovation enhances nuclear safety measures and disaster management by providing rapid and reliable iodine detection capabilities.

         <title>Bridging the Catalytic Turnover Gap Between Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozymes and Natural Enzymes by Engineering the First and Second Shell Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a first&#8211; and second&#8211;shell coordination tuning strategy of iron&#8211;based SAzymes is reported using Na2S2O5&#8211;mediated thermal activation. Axial ligands of the active sites and functionalities of the carbon host are modulated to elevate the reaction kinetics. The optimized SAzyme exhibits the highest k
cat value (52.7 s&#8722;1) in peroxidase reaction, and consequently, presents remarkable anti&#8211;tumor properties.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) constitute a promising category of enzyme&#8208;mimicking materials with outstanding catalytic performance. The performance of SAzymes improves through modification of the coordination environments around the metal center. However, the catalytic turnover rates of SAzymes, which are key measures of the effectiveness of active site modifications, remain lower than those of natural enzymes, especially in peroxidase&#8208;reactions. Here, the first and second shell coordination tuning strategy that yields SAzymes with structures and activities analogous to those of natural enzymes is reported. The optimized SAzyme exhibits a turnover rate of 52.7 s&#8722;1 and a catalytic efficiency of 6.97 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. A computational study reveals that axial S&#8208;ligands induce an alternative reaction mechanism, and SO2&#8722; functional groups provide hydrogen bonds to reduce the activation energy. In addition, SAzyme shows superior anti&#8208;tumor ability in vitro and in vivo.

     alt="Bridging the Catalytic Turnover Gap Between Single-Atom Iron Nanozymes and Natural Enzymes by Engineering the First and Second Shell Coordination"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, a first&#8211; and second&#8211;shell coordination tuning strategy of iron&#8211;based SAzymes is reported using Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;mediated thermal activation. Axial ligands of the active sites and functionalities of the carbon host are modulated to elevate the reaction kinetics. The optimized SAzyme exhibits the highest &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; value (52.7 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in peroxidase reaction, and consequently, presents remarkable anti&#8211;tumor properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) constitute a promising category of enzyme-mimicking materials with outstanding catalytic performance. The performance of SAzymes improves through modification of the coordination environments around the metal center. However, the catalytic turnover rates of SAzymes, which are key measures of the effectiveness of active site modifications, remain lower than those of natural enzymes, especially in peroxidase-reactions. Here, the first and second shell coordination tuning strategy that yields SAzymes with structures and activities analogous to those of natural enzymes is reported. The optimized SAzyme exhibits a turnover rate of 52.7 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a catalytic efficiency of 6.97 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A computational study reveals that axial S-ligands induce an alternative reaction mechanism, and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; functional groups provide hydrogen bonds to reduce the activation energy. In addition, SAzyme shows superior anti-tumor ability in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate the validity of coordination engineering strategies and the carcinostatic potential of SAzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Injectable MSC Spheroid and Microgel Granular Composites for Engineering Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel microparticles and mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids are combined into granular composites to engineer cartilage tissue. The spheroids allow for important cell&#8211;cell interactions during chondrogenesis and fusion into a cartilage tissue, whereas the granular structure allows for injectability and then stabilization through interparticle crosslinking. This approach advances the use of engineered biomaterials for tissue engineering applications.








Abstract
Many cell types require direct cell&#8211;cell interactions for differentiation and function; yet, this can be challenging to incorporate into 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures for the engineering of tissues. Here, a new approach is introduced that combines aggregates of cells (spheroids) with similarly&#8208;sized hydrogel particles (microgels) to form granular composites that are injectable, undergo interparticle crosslinking via light for initial stabilization, permit cell&#8211;cell contacts for cell signaling, and allow spheroid fusion and growth. One area where this is important is in cartilage tissue engineering, as cell&#8211;cell contacts are crucial to chondrogenesis and are missing in many tissue engineering approaches. To address this, granular composites are developed from adult porcine mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) spheroids and hyaluronic acid microgels and simulations and experimental analyses are used to establish the importance of initial MSC spheroid to microgel volume ratios to balance mechanical support with tissue growth. Long&#8208;term chondrogenic cultures of granular composites produce engineered cartilage tissue with extensive matrix deposition and mechanical properties within the range of cartilage, as well as integration with native tissue. Altogether, a new strategy of injectable granular composites is developed that leverages the benefits of cell&#8211;cell interactions through spheroids with the mechanical stabilization afforded with engineered hydrogels.

         <title>Dynamic Transition Between Monomer and Excimer Phosphorescence in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Achieving efficient near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence of purely organic phosphors remains scarce and challenging due to strong non&#8208;radiative decay. Additionally, the investigation of triplet excimer phosphorescence is rarely reported, despite the fact that excimer, a special emitter commonly formed in crystals with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, can efficiently change the fluorescent properties of compounds. Herein, we develop a series of dithienopyrrole derivatives with low triplet energy levels and stable triplet states, exhibiting persistent near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence. Via the modification of halogen atoms, the crystals display tunable emissions of monomers from 645&#8211;702&#160;nm, with a maximum lifetime of 3.68&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Notably, excimer phosphorescence can be switched on at low temperatures, enabled by non&#8208;covalent interactions rigidifying the matrix and stabilizing triplet excimer. Unprecedentedly, we capture the dynamic transition process between the monomer and excimer phosphorescence with temperature variations, revealing that the unstable triplet excimers in crystals with a tendency to dissociate can result in the effective quench of room temperature phosphorescence. This work elucidates excited state transitions across varying environments, interpreting the structural dynamics of the triplet excimer and demonstrating strategies for devising novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors.

         <title>Exchange Bias Between van der Waals Materials: Tilted Magnetic States and Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exchange&#8208;bias interactions between van der Waals ferromagnets and van der Waals antiferromagnets are unusual in that the antiferromagnetic surface can be completely uncompensated. In Pt/Fe3GeTe2/CrSBr heterostructures, this produces interfacial exchange interactions along the in&#8208;plane easy&#8208;axis of CrSBr comparable to the interlayer interactions. Such an effect produces non&#8208;uniform tilted magnetic configurations and enables field&#8208;free deterministic spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching of the Fe3GeTe2 layer.








Abstract
Magnetic van der Waals heterostructures provide a unique platform to study magnetism and spintronics device concepts in the 2D limit. Here, studies of exchange bias from the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr acting on the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) are reported. The orientation of the exchange bias is along the in&#8208;plane easy axis of CrSBr, perpendicular to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy of the FGT, inducing a strongly tilted magnetic configuration in the FGT. Furthermore, the in&#8208;plane exchange bias provides sufficient symmetry breaking to allow deterministic spin&#8211;orbit torque switching of the FGT in CrSBr/FGT/Pt samples at zero applied magnetic field. A minimum thickness of the CrSBr of &gt;10 nm is needed to provide a non&#8208;zero exchange bias at 30&#160;K.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Strategies in The Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Searching for new high&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials that are economical and environmentally friendly is an urgent task for TE society, but the advancements are greatly limited by the time&#8208;consuming and high cost of traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error method. The significant progresses achieved in the computing hardware, efficient computing methods, advance artificial intelligence algorithms, and rapidly growing material data have brought a paradigm shift in the investigation of TE materials. Many electrical and thermal performance descriptors have been proposed and efficient high&#8208;throughput calculation methods have been developed with the purpose to quickly screen new potential TE materials from the material databases. Some high&#8208;throughput experiment methods have also been developed which can increase the density of information obtained in a single experiment with less time and lower cost. In addition, the machine learning methods have been also introduced in thermoelectrics. In this review, we systematically summarize the high&#8208;throughput strategies in the discovery of TE materials. The applications of performance descriptor, high&#8208;throughput calculation, high&#8208;throughput experiment, and machine learning in the discovery of new TE materials are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and possible directions in the future research are also discussed.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact Solar Cell Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tunnel oxide passivated contacts (TOPCon) have recently gained interest as a way to increase the energy conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells, and the International Technology Roadmap of Photovoltaics forecasts TOPCon to become an important technology despite a few remaining challenges. To review the recent development of TOPCon cells, we have compiled a dataset of all device data found in the current literature, which sums up to 405 devices from 131 papers. This may seem like a surprisingly small number of cells given the recent interest in the TOPCon architecture, but it illustrates a problem of data dissemination in the field. Notwithstanding the limited number of cells, there is a great diversity in cell manufacturing procedures, and we observe a gradual increase in performance indicating that the field has not yet converged on a set of best practices. By analyzing the data using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms, we were able to reinforces some commonly held hypotheses related to the performance differences between different device architectures. We also identify a few more unintuitive feature combinations that would be of interest for further experimentally studies. This work also aims to inspire improvements in data management and dissemination within the TOPCon community, which would further increase the value of statistical analysis like this as well as enable a larger part of the ML toolbox to be used.

         <title>Conjugated Phosphonic Acids Enable Robust Hole Transport Layers for Efficient and Intrinsically Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated phosphonic acid is developed to modify Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable device stability.








Abstract
High efficiency and long&#8208;term stability are the prerequisites for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, inadequate and non&#8208;uniform doping of hole transport layers (HTLs) still limits the efficiency improvements, while the intrinsic instability of HTLs caused by ion migration and accumulation is difficult to be addressed by external encapsulation. Here it is shown that the addition of a conjugated phosphonic acid (CPA) to the Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD benchmark HTL can greatly enhance the device efficiency and intrinsic stability. Featuring an optimal diprotic&#8208;acid structure, indolo(3,2&#8208;b)carbazole&#8208;5,11&#8208;diylbis(butane&#8208;4,1&#8208;diyl) bis(phosphonic acid) (BCZ) is developed to promote morphological uniformity and mitigate ion migration across both perovskite/HTL and HTL/Ag interfaces, leading to superior charge conductivity, reinforced ion immobilization, and remarkable film stability. The dramatically improved interfacial charge collection endows BCZ&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.51%. More encouragingly, the BCZ&#8208;based devices demonstrate remarkable stability under harsh environmental conditions by retaining 90% of initial efficiency after 3000&#160;h in air storage. This work paves the way for further developing robust organic HTLs for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Rewritable Photoluminescence and Structural Color Display for Dual&#8208;Responsive Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration and light intensity&#8208;tunable photoluminescence are independently and reliably manipulated in the thin polymer&#8208;based film. A rewritable dual&#8208;responsive encryption display that has the benefit of direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information by the human eye is presented, enabling high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Optical encryption using coloration and photoluminescent (PL) materials can provide highly secure data protection with direct and intuitive identification of encrypted information. Encryption capable of independently controlling wavelength&#8208;tunable coloration as well as variable light intensity PL is not adequately demonstrated yet. Herein, a rewritable PL and structural color (SC) display suitable for dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption developed with a stimuli&#8208;responsive SC of a block copolymer (BCP) photonic crystal (PC) with alternating in&#8208;plane lamellae, of which a variety of 3D and 2D perovskite nanocrystals is preferentially self&#8208;assembled with characteristic PL, is presented. The SC of a BCP PC is controlled in the visible range with different perovskite precursor doping times. The perovskite nanocrystals developed in the BCP PC are highly luminescent, with a PL quantum yield of &#8776;33.7%, yielding environmentally stable SC and PL dual&#8208;mode displays. The independently programmed SC and PL information is erasable and rewritable. Dual&#8208;responsive optical encryption is demonstrated, in which true Morse code information is deciphered only when the information encoded by SCs is properly combined with PL information. Numerous combinations of SC and PL realize high security level of data anticounterfeiting. This dual&#8208;mode encryption display offers novel optical encryption with high information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Validating Operating Stability And Biosecurity Towards Biocompatible Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wearable and implantable electronics are standing at the frontiers of science and technology, driven by the increasing demands from modernized lifestyles. Zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) are regarded as ideal energy suppliers for these biocompatible electronics, but the corresponding biocompatibility validation is still in the initial stage. Meanwhile, complicated working conditions and some extreme electrolyte environments raise strict challenges, leaving less choices for biocompatible ZBs. Toward higher biocompatibility, we propose a hydrogel electrolyte featuring the moisture maintaining ability and a robust interface, which could further provide a milder environment for biocompatible Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries and Zn&#8208;air batteries. The cytotoxicity and tissue injury of batteries are evaluated with human cell lines and battery implantations on the animal models, which demonstrate the high biosecurity of biocompatible ZBs, while preliminary wearable devices implementation further verifies their operating stability. This work may provide a pathway for developing and validating biocompatible ZBs, contributing to their future practical employment in relevant fields.

         <title>Biomimetic Self&#8208;Maturation Mineralization System for Enamel Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Enamel repair is crucial for restoring tooth function and halting dental caries. However, contemporary research often overlooks the retention of organic residues within the repair layer, which hinders the growth of dense crystals and compromises the properties of the repaired enamel. During maturation of natural enamel, the organic matrix undergoes enzymatic processing to facilitate further crystal growth, resulting in a highly mineralized tissue. Inspired by this process, a biomimetic self&#8208;maturation mineralization system was developed, comprising RNA&#8208;stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (RNA&#8208;ACP) and RNase. The RNA&#8208;ACP induced initial mineralization in the form of epitaxial crystal growth, while the RNase present in saliva automatically triggered a biomimetic self&#8208;maturation process. Mechanistic study further indicated that RNA degradation prompted conformational rearrangement of the RNA&#8208;ACP, effectively excluding the organic matter introduced earlier. This exclusion process promoted lateral crystal growth, resulting in the generation of denser enamel&#8208;like apatite crystals that were devoid of organic residues. This strategy of eliminating organic residues from enamel crystals enhanced the mechanical and physiochemical properties of the repaired enamel. The present study introduces a conceptual biomimetic mineralization strategy for effective enamel repair in clinical practice, and offers potential insights into the mechanisms of biomineral formation.

         <title>Flexible, Biodegradable, and Wireless Magnetoelectric Paper for Simple in situ Personalization of Bioelectric Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bioelectronic implants delivering electrical stimulation offer an attractive alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals in electrotherapy. However, achieving simple, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective personalization of these implants for customized treatment in unique clinical and physical scenarios presents a substantial challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the need to ensure safety and minimal invasiveness, requiring essential attributes such as flexibility, biocompatibility, lightness, biodegradability, and wireless stimulation capability. Here, we introduce a flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper with homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality for simple personalization of bioelectronic implants. The bioelectronic paper synergistically combines (i) lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) that facilitate electrical stimulation in response to external magnetic field and (ii) flexible and biodegradable nanofibers (NFs) that enable localization of MENs for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. We show the effectiveness of wireless electrical stimulation in vitro through enhanced neuronal differentiation of neuron&#8208;like PC12 cells and the controllability of their microstructural orientation. Also, we show scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability of the bioelectronic paper by creating various 3D macrostructures using simple paper crafting techniques such as cutting and folding. This platform holds promise for simple and rapid personalization of temporary bioelectronic implants for minimally invasive wireless stimulation therapies.

         <title>Sub&#8208;1&#8208;volt Electrically Programmable Optical Modulator Based on Active Tamm Plasmon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reconfigurable optical devices hold great promise for advancing high&#8208;density optical interconnects, photonic switching, and memory applications. While many optical modulators based on active materials have been demonstrated, it is challenging to achieve a high modulation depth with a low operation voltage in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range, which is a highly sought&#8208;after wavelength window for free&#8208;space communication and imaging applications. Here, we introduce electrically switchable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The device allows for a high modulation depth across the entire near&#8208;infrared range by fully absorbing incident light even under epsilon near zero conditions. Optical modulation exceeding 88% was achieved using a CMOS&#8208;compatible voltage of &#177;1&#160;V. This modulation is facilitated by precise electrical control of the charge carrier density through an electrochemical doping/dedoping process. Additionally, we extend the potential applications of our device for a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;memory state optical device, capable of rewritable optical memory storage and exhibiting long&#8208;term potentiation/depression properties with neuromorphic behavior.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reconfigurable optical devices hold great promise for advancing high-density optical interconnects, photonic switching, and memory applications. While many optical modulators based on active materials have been demonstrated, it is challenging to achieve a high modulation depth with a low operation voltage in the near-infrared (NIR) range, which is a highly sought-after wavelength window for free-space communication and imaging applications. Here, we introduce electrically switchable Tamm plasmon coupled with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The device allows for a high modulation depth across the entire near-infrared range by fully absorbing incident light even under epsilon near zero conditions. Optical modulation exceeding 88% was achieved using a CMOS-compatible voltage of &#177;1&#160;V. This modulation is facilitated by precise electrical control of the charge carrier density through an electrochemical doping/dedoping process. Additionally, we extend the potential applications of our device for a non-volatile multi-memory state optical device, capable of rewritable optical memory storage and exhibiting long-term potentiation/depression properties with neuromorphic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strategies for the Nuclear Delivery of Metal Complexes to Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The nucleus is an essential organelle for the function of cells. It holds most of the genetic material and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Since many antitumoral therapies target nucleic acids to induce cell death, tumor&#8208;specific nuclear drug delivery could potentiate therapeutic effects and prevent potential off&#8208;target side effects on healthy tissue. Due to their great structural variety, good biocompatibility and unique physico&#8208;chemical properties, organometallic complexes and other metal&#8208;based compounds have sparked great interest as promising anticancer agents. In this review, strategies for specific nuclear delivery of metal complexes are summarized and discussed to highlight crucial parameters to consider for the design of new metal complexes as anticancer drug candidates. Moreover, the existing opportunities and challenges of tumor&#8208;specific, nucleus&#8208;targeting metal complexes are emphasized to outline some new perspectives and help in the design of new cancer treatments.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Optical Detection and Elimination of Residual Microtumors with A Postoperative Implantable Hydrogel Sensor for Preventing Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In vivo optical imaging of trace biomarkers in residual microtumors holds significant promise for cancer prognosis but poses a formidable challenge. Here, we present a novel hydrogel sensor designed for ultrasensitive and specific imaging of the elusive biomarker. This hydrogel sensor seamlessly integrates a molecular beacon nanoprobe with fibroblasts, offering both high tissue retention capability and an impressive signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for imaging. Signal amplification is accomplished through exonuclease I&#8208;mediated biomarker recycling. The resulting hydrogel sensor sensitively detected the biomarker carcinoembryonic antigen with a detection limit of 1.8 pg/mL in test tubes. Moreover, it successfully identified residual cancer nodules with a median diameter of less than 2&#160;mm in mice bearing partially removed primary triple&#8208;negative breast carcinomas (4T1). Notably, this hydrogel sensor was proven effective for the sensitive diagnosis of invasive tumors in post&#8208;surgical mice with infiltrating 4T1 cells, leveraging the role of fibroblasts in locally enriching tumor cells. Furthermore, the residual microtumor is rapidly photothermal ablation by polydopamine&#8208;based nanoprobe under the guidance of visualization, achieving nearly 100% suppression of tumor recurrence and lung metastasis. Our work offers a promising alternative strategy for visually detecting residual microtumors, potentially enhancing the prognosis of cancer patients following surgical interventions.

         <title>Topological Engineering Electrodes with Ultrafast Oxygen Transport for Super&#8208;Power Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1NaO2) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive and thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm&#8722;2) and superior output power. Herein, we adopted 3D&#8208;printing technology to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density up to 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm&#8722;2. The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries towards practical applications.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Li2s Cathodes Enabled by An In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Li+ Conductor for Graphite&#8208;Li2s Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Using Li2S cathodes instead of S cathodes presents an opportunity to pair them with Li&#8208;free anodes (e.g., graphite), thereby circumventing anode&#8208;related issues, such as poor reversibility and safety, encountered in Li&#8208;S batteries. However, the moisture&#8208;sensitive nature of Li2S causes the release of hazardous H2S and formation of insulative by&#8208;products, increasing the manufacturing difficulty and adversely affecting cathode performance. Here, Li4SnS4, a Li+ conductor that is air&#8208;stable according to the hard&#8211;soft acid&#8211;base principle, is formed in situ and uniformly on Li2S particles because Li2S itself participates in Li4SnS4 formation. When exposed to air (20% relative humidity), the protective Li4SnS4 layer maintains its components and structure, thus contributing to the enhanced stability of the Li2S@Li4SnS4 composite. In addition, the Li4SnS4 layer can accelerate the sluggish conversion of Li2S because of its favorable interfacial charge transfer, and continuously confine lithium polysulfides owing to its integrity during electrochemical processes. We construct a graphite&#8208;Li2S pouch cell containing a Li2S@Li4SnS4 cathode, which showed stable cyclability with 97% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Hence, combining a desirable air&#8208;stable Li2S cathode and a highly reversible Li&#8208;free configuration offers potential practical applications of graphite&#8208;Li2S full cells.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Pouch Cell Using Cu3p Nanowires In&#8208;Situ Grown on Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AFSMB) promises a high energy density, but suffers from the difficulty of maintaining high cycling stability. Nonuniform sodium (Na) deposition on current collector is largely responsible for capacity decay in the cycling process of AFSMB. Here, a unique Cu3P nanowires was constructed on copper (Cu3P@Cu) as sodium deposition substrate by an in&#8208;situ growth method. Superior electrochemical performance of Cu3P@Cu anode was delivered in asymmetric cells with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for over 800 cycles at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 Am h cm&#8722;2. Symmetric cell of Cu3P@Cu displayed a cycling lifespan of over 2000&#160;h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 Am h cm&#8722;2. Cryo&#8208;TEM characterization and first principles calculation revealed that the low Na+ absorption energy and low Na+ diffusion energy barrier on Na3P promoted the uniform Na nucleation and deposition, thus enhancing the Na surface stability. Moreover, anode&#8208;free Na3V2(PO4)3//Cu3P@Cu full pouch cell delivered a considerable cycling capacity of &#8764;15&#160;mA h in 170 cycles, demonstrating its practical feasibility.

         <title>Constructing Ultra&#8208;Shallow Near&#8208;Edge States for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Electronic band structure engineering of metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHP) lies at the core of fundamental materials research and photovoltaic applications. However, reconfiguring the band structures in MHP for optimized electronic properties remains challenging. Here, we report a generic strategy for constructing near&#8208;edge states to improve carrier properties, leading to enhanced device performances. The near&#8208;edge states are designed around the valence band edge using theoretical prediction and constructed through tailored material engineering. These states are experimentally revealed with activation energies of around 23 milli&#8208;electron volts by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy. Such small activation energies enable prolonged carrier lifetime with efficient carrier transition dynamics and low non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, as corroborated by the millisecond lifetimes of microwave conductivity. By constructing near&#8208;edge states in positive&#8208;intrinsic&#8208;negative inverted cells, we achieve a champion efficiency of 25.4% (25.0% certified) for a 0.07&#8208;cm2 cell and 23.6% (22.7% certified) for a 1&#8208;cm2 cell. The most stable encapsulated cell retains 90% of its initial efficiency after 1,100 hours of maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination (100&#160;mW/cm2) at 65 &#176;C in ambient air.

         <title>Dynamic Li+ Capture Through Ligand&#8208;Chain Interaction for the Regeneration of Depleted LiFePO4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
After application in electric vehicles, spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries are typically decommissioned. Traditional recycling methods face economic and environmental constraints. Therefore, direct regeneration has emerged as a promising alternative. However, irreversible phase changes can significantly hinder the efficiency of the regeneration process owing to structural degradation. Moreover, improper storage and treatment practices can lead to metamorphism, further complicating the regeneration process. In this study, we propose a sustainable recovery method for the electrochemical repair of LFP batteries. We utilize a ligand&#8208;chain Zn&#8208;complex (ZnDEA) as a structural regulator, with its &#9472;NH&#9472; group alternatingly facilitating the binding of preferential transition metal ions (Fe3+ during charging and Zn2+ during discharging). This dynamic coordination ability helps to modulate volume changes within the recovered LFP framework. Consequently, the recovered LFP framework can store more Li&#8208;ions, enhance phase transition reversibility between LFP and FePO4 (FP), modify the initial Coulombic efficiency, and reduce polarization voltage differences. The recovered LFP cells exhibit excellent capacity retention of 96.30% after 1500 cycles at 2 C. The ligand chain repair mechanism promotes structural evolution to facilitate ion migration, providing valuable insights into the targeted ion compensation for environmentally friendly recycling in practical applications.

         <title>Mismatched Refractive Index Strategy for Fabricating Laser&#8208;Driven Wood Diffusers from Bulk Wood for Illumination Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Laser&#8208;diode&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lighting is primarily used in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art illumination systems. However, these systems rely on light&#8208;converting inorganic phosphors, which have low quantum efficiencies and complex manufacturing conditions. In this study, w e propose a mismatched refractive index strategy to directly convert natural bulk wood into a laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser using a simple delignification and polymer infiltration method. The resulting material has potential to be used in laser&#8208;driven diffuse illumination applications. The optical performance of the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is optimized by changing the density of natural wood. The optimal coefficient of illuminance variation of the wood diffuser is as low as 17.7%, which is significantly lower than that of commercial diffusers. The illuminance uniformity is larger than 0.9, which is significantly higher than the ISO requirements for indoor workplace lighting. The laser damage threshold is 7.9 J&#183;cm&#8722;2, which is considerably higher than those of the substrates of commercially&#8208;available phosphors. Furthermore, the optimized wood diffuser exhibits outstanding mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, tolerance to harsh environmental conditions, and low speckle contrast. These results show that the laser&#8208;driven wood diffuser is a promising laser&#8208;color converter that is suitable for indoor, long&#8208;distance outdoor, undersea, and other high&#8208;luminance laser lighting applications.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adaptive Pyroptosis Inducer: Optimizing the Catalytic Microenvironment of Nanozymes by Membrane&#8208;Adhered Microbe Enables Potent Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer to optimize catalytic performance of nanozyme by the respiration of membrane&#8208;adhered microbe, which induces eruptive ROS to trigger pyroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy. The utilization of self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer will motivate the development of self&#8208;adaptive nano&#8208;catalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy and provide new insights into the treatments of other diseases.








Abstract
Pyroptosis has garnered increasing attention in cancer immunotherapy. Moreover, increasing plasma membrane damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered an effective strategy for promoting pyroptosis. However, the current tactics for enhancing membrane rupture in pyroptosis are limited by the inherent drawbacks of ROS and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a self&#8208;adaptive pyroptosis inducer (LPZ) is designed by integrating Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and an enzyme&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework to achieve potent pyroptosis immunotherapy. LPZ can adhere to cancer cell membranes through the interaction between the pili of LGG and the mucin of cancer cells. In particular, the adaptive formula can gradually enhance the ability of nanozymes to produce ROS by creating an acidic microenvironment through anaerobic respiration. These results verify that LPZ could generate high levels of ROS both on the membrane and within cancer cells, leading to pyroptotic cell death and strong antitumor immunity. Meanwhile, LGG are eventually killed by ROS in this process to halt their respiration and prevent potential biosafety concerns. Overall, this work provides new inspiration for the design of self&#8208;adaptive nanocatalytic drugs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>ACE2 Receptor&#8208;Targeted Inhaled Nanoemulsions Inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Attenuate Inflammatory Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;modified inhaled nanoemulsions (NEs) are developed, which can target the Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway epithelial cells. The inhaled remdesivir NEs inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection and replication. The inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice.








Abstract
Three kinds of coronaviruses are highly pathogenic to humans, and two of them mainly infect humans through Angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 &#65288;ACE2&#65289;receptors. Therefore, specifically blocking ACE2 binding at the interface with the receptor&#8208;binding domain is promising to achieve both preventive and therapeutic effects of coronaviruses. Alternatively, drug&#8208;targeted delivery based on ACE2 receptors can further improve the efficacy and safety of inhalation drugs. Here, these two approaches are innovatively combined by designing a nanoemulsion (NE) drug delivery system (termed NE&#8208;AYQ) for inhalation that targets binding to ACE2 receptors. This inhalation&#8208;delivered remdesivir nanoemulsion (termed RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) effectively inhibits the infection of target cells by both wild&#8208;type and mutant viruses. The RDSV&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ strongly inhibits Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at two dimensions: they not only block the binding of the virus to host cells at the cell surface but also restrict virus replication intracellularly. Furthermore, in the mouse model of acute lung injury, the inhaled drug delivery system loaded with anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (TPCA&#8208;1&#8208;NE&#8208;AYQ) can significantly alleviate the lung tissue injury of mice. This smart combination provides a new choice for dealing with possible emergencies in the future and for the rapid development of inhaled drugs for the treatment of respiratory diseases.

         <title>Hard Magnetic Graphene Nanocomposite for Multimodal, Reconfigurable Soft Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The HMGN combines the advantages of porous conductive materials and hard magnetic materials to enable multimodal, reconfigurable soft electronics with magnetism&#8208;enhanced sensing performance and magnetism&#8208;assisted electrical interconnection, allowing for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage.








Abstract
Soft electronics provide effective means for continuous monitoring of a diverse set of biophysical and biochemical signals from the human body. However, the sensitivities, functions, spatial distributions, and many other features of such sensors remain fixed after deployment and cannot be adjusted on demand. Here, laser&#8208;induced porous graphene is exploited as the sensing material, and dope it with permanent magnetic particles to create hard magnetic graphene nanocomposite (HMGN) that can self&#8208;assemble onto a flexible carrying substrate through magnetic force, in a reversible and reconfigurable manner. A set of soft electronics in HMGN exhibits enhanced performances in the measurements of electrophysiological signals, temperature, and concentrations of metabolites. All these flexible HMGN sensors can adhere to a carrying substrate at any position and in any spatial arrangement, to allow for wearable sensing with customizable sensitivity, modality, and spatial coverage. The HMGN represents a promising material for constructing soft electronics that can be reconfigured for various applications.

         <title>Electron Localization&#8208;Triggered Proton Pumping Toward Cu Single Atoms for Electrochemical CO2 Methanation of Unprecedented Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of electron transfer and directional *H transport enabled by electron localization is developed. VBi as an initiator can induce the electron localization at Cu single atoms, which enhances the adsorption and activation of CO2 in single&#8208;atom Cu sites for electrocatalytic CH4 synthesis of unprecedented selectivity, apart from acting as active sites of H2O dissociation and pumping proton.








Abstract
Slow multi&#8208;proton coupled electron transfer kinetics and unexpected desorption of intermediates severely hinder the selectivity of CO2 methanation. In this work, a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;bird strategy of pumping protons and improving adsorption configuration/capability enabled by electron localization is developed to be highly efficient for CH4 electrosynthesis over Cu single atoms anchored on bismuth vacancies of BiVO4 (Bi1&#8208;xVO4&#9472;Cu), with superior kinetic isotope effect and high CH4 Faraday efficiency (92%), far outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for CO2 methanation. Control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the bismuth vacancies (VBi) not only act as active sites for H2O dissociation but also induce electron transfer toward Cu single&#8208;atom sites. The VBi&#8208;induced electron localization pumps *H from VBi sites to Cu single atoms, significantly promoting the generation and stabilization of the pivotal intermediate (*CHO) for highly selective CH4 electrosynthesis. The metal vacancies as new initiators show enormous potential in the proton transfer&#8208;involved hydrogenative conversion processes.

         <title>Ultrafast Negative Capacitance Transition for 2D Ferroelectric MoS2/Graphene Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The subthreshold swing (SS) serves as the key performance parameter for high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power electronics. Boltzmann distribution limits the SS to 60&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in conventional field effect transistors. Here, in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device architecture, ultralow SS across the five decades of drain current is&#160;achieved by utilizing efficient Dirac contacts and ultrafast negative&#8208;capacitance transition in layered ferroelectric gate insulator.








Abstract
Negative capacitance gives rise to subthreshold swing (SS) below the fundamental limit by efficient modulation of surface potential in transistors. While negative&#8208;capacitance transition is reported in polycrystalline Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (PZT) and HfZrO2 (HZO) thin&#8208;films in few microseconds timescale, low SS is not persistent over a wide range of drain current when used instead of conventional dielectrics. In this work, the clear nano&#8208;second negative transition states in 2D single&#8208;crystal CuInP2S6 (CIPS) flakes have been demonstrated by an alternative fast&#8208;transient measurement technique. Further, integrating this ultrafast NC transition with the localized density of states of Dirac contacts and controlled charge transfer in the CIPS/channel (MoS2/graphene) a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device architecture, negative capacitance Dirac source drain field effect transistor (FET) is introduced. This yields an ultralow SS of 4.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with an average sub&#8208;10 SS across five decades with on&#8208;off ratio exceeding 107, by simultaneous improvement of transport and body factors in monolayer MoS2&#8208;based FET, outperforming all previous reports. This approach could pave the way to achieve ultralow&#8208;SS FETs for future high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power electronics.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Protein&#8208;Escaping Dyes Enable High&#8208;Contrast and Long&#8208;Term Prognosis Evaluation of Flap Transplantation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein&#8208;escaping dyes are designed to exhibit a low affinity for serum proteins, allowing them to avoid in situ covalent binding with proteins while maintaining much&#8208;enhanced imaging contrast. These dyes enable short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging, serving as a noninvasive and reliable method for monitoring flap viability after transplantation.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time vascular positioning, postoperative flap monitoring, and vascular reconstruction assessment are of great importance in flap transplantation. Cyanine dyes offer the advantage of high resolution in the Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;imaging window. However, the nonspecific binding of many cyanine dyes to endogenous albumin leads to high organ accumulation and skin absorption, resulting in low&#8208;quality imaging and poor reproducibility of contrast during long&#8208;term (e.g., 7 days) postoperative monitoring. Here, a novel strategy is proposed that can be widely applied to prevent protein binding for NIR&#8208;I/II&#160;Cl&#8208;containing cyanine dyes. This strategy produces protein&#8208;escaping dyes, ensuring high fluorescence enhancement in the blood with rapid clearance and no residual fluorescence, allowing for short&#8208;term repeatable injections for vascular imaging. This strategy in the perioperative monitoring of pedicle perforator flap models in mice and rats is successfully applied. Furthermore, leveraging the universality of this strategy, multiple nonoverlapping protein&#8208;escaping probes that achieve dual&#8208;excitation (808 and 1064&#160;nm) interference&#8208;free imaging of nerve&#8208;vessel and tumor&#8208;vessel simultaneously are designed and synthesized. These protein&#8208;escaping dyes enable long&#8208;term repeatable dual&#8208;color imaging of tumor localization, resection, and tumor&#8208;vessel reconstruction at the wound site.

         <title>Pericardial Delivery of SDF&#8208;1&#945; Puerarin Hydrogel Promotes Heart&#160;Repair and Electrical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4 is effective for MI treatment, excessive monocytes/macrophages recruitment or activation can cause unwanted inflammation simultaneously. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling. The degradable SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE hydrogel simultaneously enhances the recruitment of endogenous cells and reverses the adverse effects, which improves cardiac function and reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
The stromal&#8208;derived factor 1&#945;/chemokine receptor 4 (SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4)&#160;axis contributes to myocardial protection after myocardial infarction (MI) by recruiting endogenous stem cells into the ischemic tissue. However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, SDF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE) is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and immune cells are recruited while SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE efficiently polarizes the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of connexin 43 (Cx43) expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved &#8220;soil&#8221;, the recruited stem cells mediate an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size. These findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic platform for MI that not only facilitates heart regeneration but also reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

The degradable SDF-1&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;@PUE hydrogel simultaneously enhances the recruitment of endogenous cells and reverses the adverse effects, which improves cardiac function and reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stromal-derived factor 1&#945;/chemokine receptor 4 (SDF-1&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;/CXCR4)&#160;axis contributes to myocardial protection after myocardial infarction (MI) by recruiting endogenous stem cells into the ischemic tissue. However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, SDF-1&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF-1&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;@PUE) is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and immune cells are recruited while SDF-1&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;@PUE efficiently polarizes the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of connexin 43 (Cx43) expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved &#8220;soil&#8221;, the recruited stem cells mediate an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size. These findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic platform for MI that not only facilitates heart regeneration but also reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Charge Separation of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Boron Nitride with Isolated Co Atoms for Enhancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co atoms are successfully anchored on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (Co/BNF) to enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The uniformly dispersed Co atoms with a CoO2N1 coordination geometry play an essential role in promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and lowering the reaction energy barriers, thus boosting the activity and selectivity of Co/BNF for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
To alleviate the greenhouse effect and address the related energy crisis, solar&#8208;driven reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added products is considered as a sustainable strategy. However, the insufficient separation and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalysis greatly limit their reduction efficiency and practical application potential. Here, isolated Cobalt (Co) atoms are successfully decorated into oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (BN)&#160;via an in situ pyrolysis method, achieving greatly improved catalytic activity and selectivity to the carbon monoxide (CO) product. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Co atoms are stabilized by the O and N atoms with an unsaturated CoO2N1 configuration. Further experimental investigation and theoretical simulations confirm that the decorated Co atoms not only work as the real active center during the CO2 reduction process, but also perform as the electron pump to promote the electron/hole separation and transfer, resulting in greatly accelerated reaction kinetics and improved activity. In addition, the CoO2N1 coordination geometry is favorable to the conversion from *CO2 to *COOH, which shall be considered as a selectivity&#8208;determining step for the evolution of the CO products. The surface modulation strategy at the atomic level opens a new avenue for regulating the reaction kinetics for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Assisted Surface Modification of Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide toward High Anionic Redox Reversibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;assisted modification is introduced for the construction of SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating and sulfur atoms substituting lattice oxygen. The sulfur anions in the lattice enhance the reversibility of the anionic redox by modulating the band of the redox&#8208;active center. The additional coating effectively traps the escaping active oxygen, and the trapped oxygen and coating return to the pristine upon discharge.








Abstract
Energy storage via anionic redox provides extra capacity for lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes at high voltage but causes gradual structural collapse and irreversible capacity loss with generation of On&#8722; (0 &#8804; n &lt; 2) species upon deep oxidation. Herein, the stability and reversibility of anionic redox reactions are enhanced by a simple sulfur&#8208;assisted surface modification method, which not only modulates the material's energy band allowing feasible electron release from both bonding and antibonding bands, but also traps the escaping On&#8722; via an as&#8208;constructed SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating layer and return them to the host lattice upon discharge. The regulation of anionic redox inhibits the irreversible structural transformation and parasitic reactions, maintaining the specific capacity retention of as&#8208;modified cathode up to 94% after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, along with outstanding voltage stability. The reported strategy incorporating energy band modulation and oxygen trapping is promising for the design and advancement of other cathodes storing energy through anion redox.

         <title>Modular Aptamer Switches for the Continuous Optical Detection of Small&#8208;Molecule Analytes in Complex Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A duplex&#8208;bubble switch architecture enables precise modulation of kinetics and thermodynamics without prior knowledge of the ligand binding site. Its integration with fiber&#8208;optic probes and applicability in real&#8208;time optical detection by achieving reversible and binding&#8208;induced fluorescence responses to dopamine and cortisol in complex matrices are demonstrated. This approach promises a universal solution for rapid aptamer&#8208;based sensor development in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers are a promising class of affinity reagents because signal transduction mechanisms can&#160;be built into the reagent, so that they can directly produce a physically measurable output signal upon target binding. However, endowing the signal transduction functionality into an aptamer remains a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process that can compromise its affinity or specificity and typically requires knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure. In this work, a design architecture that can convert an existing aptamer into a &#8220;reversible aptamer switch&#8221; whose kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be tuned without a priori knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure is described. Finally, by combining these aptamer switches with evanescent&#8208;field&#8208;based optical detection hardware that minimizes sample autofluorescence, this study demonstrates the first optical biosensor system that can continuously measure multiple biomarkers (dopamine and cortisol) in complex samples (artificial cerebrospinal fluid and undiluted plasma) with second and subsecond&#8208;scale time responses at physiologically relevant concentration ranges.

         <title>Electrochemical Evolution of Ru&#8208;Based Polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;Codoped RuOx for Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils the synthesis of a robust, bifunctional electrocatalyst via the electrochemical evolution of Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx (RuSiW) for efficient acidic water splitting. Exploiting the synergistic effects of Si and W codoping, RuSiW catalyst achieves remarkable activity and stability for acidic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Despite intensive studies over decades, the development of electrocatalysts for acidic water splitting still relies on platinum group metals, especially Pt and Ir, which are scarce, expensive, and poorly sustainable. Because such problems can be alleviated, Ru&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts such as rutile RuO2 have recently emerged. However, RuO2 has a relatively low activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and low stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) under acidic conditions. In this study, the synthesis of a RuOx&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst (RuSiW) for acidic water splitting via the electrochemical evolution from Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates at cathodic potentials is reported. RuSiW consists of the nanocrystalline RuO2 core and Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx shell. RuSiW exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity comparable to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, with high stability. Computational analysis suggests that the codoping of RuOx with W and Si synergistically improves the HER activity of otherwise poor RuO2 by shifting the d&#8208;band center and optimizing atomic configurations beneficial for proper hydrogen adsorption. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis of unprecedented bifunctional electrocatalysts using catalytically inactive and less explored elements, such as Si and W.

&lt;/i&gt;-based bifunctional catalyst (RuSiW) for acidic water splitting via the electrochemical evolution from Ru-based polyoxometalates at cathodic potentials is reported. RuSiW consists of the nanocrystalline RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core and Si,W-codoped RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; shell. RuSiW exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity comparable to Pt/C and RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, with high stability. Computational analysis suggests that the codoping of RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; with W and Si synergistically improves the HER activity of otherwise poor RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by shifting the d-band center and optimizing atomic configurations beneficial for proper hydrogen adsorption. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis of unprecedented bifunctional electrocatalysts using catalytically inactive and less explored elements, such as Si and W.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Humidity/Oxygen&#8208;Insensitive Organic Synaptic Transistors Based on Optical Radical Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The improvement of the stability and environmental durability of organic electronics is a challenge for the promising applications in universal environments. Herein, a stable organic photosynaptic transistor based on a photoinitiator is developed with broad operation capabilities in vacuum, dried air, and high&#8208;humidity environment. This design provides a promising platform for long&#8208;term stable organic synaptic electronics.








Abstract
For most organic synaptic transistors based on the charge trapping effect, different atmosphere conditions lead to significantly different device performance. Some devices even lose the synaptic responses under vacuum or inert atmosphere. The stable device performance of these organic synaptic transistors under varied working environments with different humidity and oxygen levels can be a challenge. Herein, a moisture&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;insensitive organic synaptic device based on the organic semiconductor and photoinitiator molecules is reported. Unlike the widely reported charge trapping effect, the photoinduced free radical is utilized to realize the photosynaptic performance. The resulting synaptic transistor displays typical excitatory postsynaptic current, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning, and forgetting behaviors. Furthermore, the device exhibits decent and stable photosynaptic performances under high humidity and vacuum conditions. This type of organic synaptic device also demonstrates high potential in ultraviolet B perception based on its environmental stability and broad ultraviolet detection capability. Finally, the contrast&#8208;enhanced capability of the device is successfully validated by the single&#8208;layer&#8208;perceptron/double&#8208;layer network based Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition. This work could have important implications for the development of next&#8208;generation environment&#8208;stable organic synaptic devices and systems.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional MXene&#8208;Based Bioanode for Wearable Self&#8208;Charging Biosupercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional MXene&#8208;based bioanode is prepared with a 3D hierarchical structure for wearable self&#8208;charging biosupercapacitors. The device is designed in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure, and successfully realizes conformal and adhesion with human skin in a flexible environment. The skin&#8208;mountable device exhibits superior energy harvesting and storing performance from human sweat under both relaxed and stretching conditions.








Abstract
As a reliable energy&#8208;supply platform for wearable electronics, biosupercapacitors combine the characteristics of biofuel cells and supercapacitors to harvest and store the energy from human's sweat. However, the bulky preparation process and deep embedding of enzyme active sites in bioelectrodes usually limit the energy&#8208;harvesting process, retarding the practical power&#8208;supply sceneries especially during the complicated in vivo motion. Herein, a MXene/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube/lactate oxidase hierarchical structure as the dual&#8208;functional bioanode is designed, which can not only provide a superior 3D catalytic microenvironment for enzyme accommodation to harvest energy from sweat, but also offers sufficient capacitance to store energy via the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor. A wearable biosupercapacitor is fabricated in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure with a composite bioanode, active carbon/Pt cathode, polyacrylamide hydrogel substrate, and liquid metal conductor. The device exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;of 0.48&#160;V and the high power density of 220.9 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The compact conformal adhesion with skin is successfully maintained under stretching/bending conditions. After repeatedly stretching the devices, there is no significant power attenuation in pulsed output. The unique bioelectrode structure and attractive energy harvesting/storing properties demonstrate the promising potential of this biosupercapacitor as a micro self&#8208;powered platform of wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Carrier Transport in Monolayer MoS2 through Interlayer Coupling with 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacing of monolayer MoS2 with 2DCOF films determines a major enhancement in the charge transport through the 2D semiconductor. Electron doping intensity is amplified by the superlattice's long&#8208;range order, while the lattice vibration is suppressed by the high mechanical stiffness yielding a confinement effect. The MoS2 /2D&#8208;COF heterostructures represent a novel strategy to develop high&#8208;performance 2D electronics.








Abstract
The coupling of different 2D materials (2DMs) to form van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a powerful strategy for adjusting the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors, for applications in opto&#8208;electronics and quantum computing. 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) represents an archetypical semiconducting, monolayer thick versatile platform for the generation of hybrid vdWH with tunable charge transport characteristics through its interfacing with molecules and assemblies thereof. However, the physisorption of (macro)molecules on 2D MoS2 yields hybrids possessing a limited thermal stability, thereby jeopardizing their technological applications. Herein, the rational design and optimized synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) for the generation of MoS2/2D&#8208;COF vdWHs exhibiting strong interlayer coupling effects are reported. The high crystallinity of the 2D&#8208;COF films makes it possible to engineer an ultrastable periodic doping effect on MoS2, boosting devices&#8217; field&#8208;effect mobility at room temperature. Such a performance increase can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the efficient interfacial electron transfer process and the pronounced suppression of MoS2&#8217;s lattice vibration. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work validates an unprecedented approach for the efficient modulation of the electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward high&#8208;performance (opto)electronics for CMOS digital circuits.

         <title>Overcoming Barriers Associated with Oral Delivery of Differently Sized Fluorescent Core&#8208;Shell Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles (5&#8211;50) nm and major barriers associated with oral delivery are studied. Ultrasmall nanoparticles (&lt;10 nm) rapidly diffuse through intestinal mucus, passively permeate intestinal epithelial cell layers, and are found in mouse urine after oral gavage. Together with earlier in vivo results, suggest these nanoparticles are promising candidates for oral administration.








Abstract
Oral delivery, while a highly desirable form of nanoparticle&#8208;drug administration, is limited by challenges associated with overcoming several biological barriers. Here, the authors study how fluorescent and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles sized 5 to 50&#160;nm interact with major barriers including intestinal mucus, intestinal epithelium, and stomach acid. From imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies using quasi&#8208;total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, diffusion of nanoparticles through highly scattering mucus is progressively hindered above a critical hydrodynamic size around 20&#160;nm. By studying Caco&#8208;2 cell monolayers mimicking the intestinal epithelia, it is observed that ultrasmall nanoparticles below 10&#160;nm diameter (Cornell prime dots, [C&#8217; dots]) show permeabilities correlated with high absorption in humans from primarily enhanced passive passage through tight junctions. Particles above 20&#160;nm diameter exclusively show active transport through cells. After establishing C&#8217; dot stability in artificial gastric juice, in vivo oral gavage experiments in mice demonstrate successful passage through the body followed by renal clearance without protein corona formation. Results suggest C&#8217; dots as viable candidates for oral administration to patients with a proven pathway towards clinical translation and may generate renewed interest in examining silica as a food additive and its effects on nutrition and health.

         <title>MOFs for Ultrahigh Efficiency Pulsed Laser Micropropulsion</title>

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which are composed of metal cations and organic ligands forming ordered structures through coordination, with their unique composition eliminating the problem of local hot zones and uneven mixing encountered in laser micropropulsion (LMP), allowing for enhanced propulsion efficiency.








Abstract
Conventional propellant materials, such as polymers and single metal elements, have long been investigated for their potential in pulsed laser micropropulsion (LMP) technology. However, achieving superior LMP efficiency through physical mixing of these materials remains a significant challenge. This study presents a paradigm shift by introducing porous crystalline polymers, known as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as novel propellants in pulsed LMP. MOFs are composed of metal cations and organic ligands that form ordered structures through coordination, eliminating the problem of local hot zones arising from uneven physical mixing encountered in LMP. In direct comparison to conventional polymers and single element targets, MOFs exhibit substantially higher LMP efficiency. By precisely tailoring the metal atom fraction within MOFs, an extraordinary ultrahigh efficiency of 51.15% is achieved in pulsed LMP, surpassing the performance of similar materials previously reported in the literature. This pioneering application of MOFs not only revolutionizes the field of LMP but also opens up new frontiers for MOF utilization in various energy applications.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biohybrid Microstructures Enable Transplantation and Vascularization of Microtissues in the Anterior Chamber of the Eye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transplanting 3D&#8208;printed biohybrid microstructures to the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) with the aim of vascular engraftment is investigated. The ACE is an ideal platform for studying interactions between host tissues and transplant, as well as for biomedical device trans/&#8208;implantation. The results identify pupillary dynamics as an effective factor involved in graft integrity to the host. Microstructures that provide a more static configuration lead to successful vascularization even in a no&#8208;contact mode (to the vessel source) and a fluidic microenvironment.








Abstract
Hybridizing biological cells with man&#8208;made sensors enable the detection of a wide range of weak physiological responses with high specificity. The anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) is an ideal transplantation site due to its ocular immune privilege and optical transparency, which enable superior noninvasive longitudinal analyses of cells and microtissues. Engraftment of biohybrid microstructures in the ACE may, however, be affected by the pupillary response and dynamics. Here, sutureless transplantation of biohybrid microstructures, 3D printed in IP&#8208;Visio photoresin, containing a precisely localized pancreatic islet to the ACE of mice is presented. The biohybrid microstructures allow mechanical fixation in the ACE, independent of iris dynamics. After transplantation, islets in the microstructures successfully sustain their functionality for over 20 weeks and become vascularized despite physical separation from the vessel source (iris) and immersion in a low&#8208;viscous liquid (aqueous humor) with continuous circulation and clearance. This approach opens new perspectives in biohybrid microtissue transplantation in the ACE, advancing monitoring of microtissue&#8211;host interactions, disease modeling, treatment outcomes, and vascularization in engineered tissues.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intrinsic Aqueous Dispersibility for Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable, dispersible conductive particles are simply afforded via acid crystallization of commercial poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) in solution. The particles feature a tunable internal surfactant which enables intrinsic aqueous processibility for incorporation within hydrogels without complex additives or surfactants. The particles are loaded into a resin and printed via microstereolithography, offering hydrogels with biocompatibility, structural fidelity, and high conductivity (1&#8211;10 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels are promising materials with mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction to interface living tissue (ionic signal transmission) with medical devices (electronic signal transmission). The hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet/soft biological environment with the dry/hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials, fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid&#8208;crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable nonsolvent induced phase separation method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm&#8722;1, and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (&lt; 150 &#181;m)&#160;are&#160;printed with up to 10% particle loading . The ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Area&#8208;Emissive White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform area&#8208;emissive white OLET device with an efficiency of 13.9% is realized by incorporating phosphorescent blue emissive and fluorescent yellow emissive guests in the active layer based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration, which is the highest value in the field and demonstrates great potential for full&#8208;color display as backlight source for the first time.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;performance white organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) with uniform area emission is crucial for smart display technologies but remains greatly challenging. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency uniform area&#8208;emissive OLETs based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration which incorporates efficient energy transfer of phosphorescent and fluorescent guests, enabling color&#8208;tunable and white emission, are demonstrated. Through precisely regulating the energy transfer between host and guests, high external quantum efficiency of 13.9% for white&#8208;emission OLETs is achieved due to the improved high exciton utilization and light outcoupling efficiency which is the highest value reported so far for OLETs and prevents exciton&#8208;charge annihilation and electrode photon losses. Moreover, good loop stability is also achieved, along with effective gate tunability and ultralow driving voltage of below 5&#160;V. Finally, a 4 &#215; 6 white&#8208;emission OLET array for full&#8208;color display is demonstrated for the first time, suggesting its great potential applications for advanced display technologies.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect healing treatment is reported to rejuvenate the aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which could effectively heal the surface matrix defects and revive the morphology of aged PQDs, substantially improving the optoelectronic properties and orientation of PQD solids. Consequently, solar cells fabricated using rejuvenated PQDs show comparable photovoltaic performance with the control solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solar cells owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, the optoelectronic properties of PQDs suffer from severe degradation in storage due to the dynamically binding ligands, predominantly affecting photovoltaic applications. Herein, an in situ defect healing treatment (DHT) is reported to effectively rejuvenate aged PQDs. Systematically, experimental studies and theoretical calculations are performed to fundamentally understand the causes leading to the recovered optoelectronic properties of aged PQDs. The results reveal that the I3&#8722; anions produced from tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylammonium iodide and iodine could strongly anchor on the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs, substantially diminishing the nonradiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, an DHT could also renovate the morphology of aged PQDs and thus improve the stacking orientation of PQD solids, substantially ameliorating charge carrier transport within PQD solids. Consequently, by using a DHT, the PQD solar cell (PQDSC) yields a high efficiency of up to 15.88%, which is comparable with the PQDSCs fabricated using fresh PQDs. Meanwhile, the stability of PQDSCs fabricated using the rejuvenated PQDs is also largely improved.

&lt;p&gt;An in situ defect healing treatment is reported to rejuvenate the aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which could effectively heal the surface matrix defects and revive the morphology of aged PQDs, substantially improving the optoelectronic properties and orientation of PQD solids. Consequently, solar cells fabricated using rejuvenated PQDs show comparable photovoltaic performance with the control solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next-generation solar cells owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, the optoelectronic properties of PQDs suffer from severe degradation in storage due to the dynamically binding ligands, predominantly affecting photovoltaic applications. Herein, an in situ defect healing treatment (DHT) is reported to effectively rejuvenate aged PQDs. Systematically, experimental studies and theoretical calculations are performed to fundamentally understand the causes leading to the recovered optoelectronic properties of aged PQDs. The results reveal that the I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions produced from tetra-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-octylammonium iodide and iodine could strongly anchor on the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs, substantially diminishing the nonradiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, an DHT could also renovate the morphology of aged PQDs and thus improve the stacking orientation of PQD solids, substantially ameliorating charge carrier transport within PQD solids. Consequently, by using a DHT, the PQD solar cell (PQDSC) yields a high efficiency of up to 15.88%, which is comparable with the PQDSCs fabricated using fresh PQDs. Meanwhile, the stability of PQDSCs fabricated using the rejuvenated PQDs is also largely improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Formation of 2D Perovskite Seeding for Record&#8208;Efficiency Indoor Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the issue of efficiency loss due to increased cell size for indoor perovskite photovoltaics by developing an in situ pre&#8208;nucleation strategy is addressed. A trace amount of &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, which spontaneously reacts with PbI2 to form 2D perovskite seed crystals to facilitate 3D perovskite growth.








Abstract
With 40% efficiency under room light intensity, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will be promising power supplies for low&#8208;light applications, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and indoor electronics, shall they become commercialized. Herein, &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is utilized to spontaneously form a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds for improved film uniformity, crystallization quality, and solar cell performance. It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10&#8208;fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small&#8208;area (0.09 cm2) PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large&#8208;area cells (1.00 cm2, and 2.56 cm2) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale&#8208;up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs (i&#8208;PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large&#8208;area printing technology.

         <title>A Practical Approach Toward Highly Reproducible and High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Films Based on an Aging Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quality and reproducibility of perovskite thin films are severely influenced by spin&#8208;coating parameters and annealing conditions. Here, a facile and cost&#8208;effective aging treatment is developed to improve film coverage and uniformity. The resulting devices achieve higher device performance reproducibility and impressive operational stability under both air and vacuum conditions.








Abstract
Solution processing of hybrid perovskite semiconductors is a highly promising approach for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, challenges with this approach lie in overcoming the controllability of the perovskite film morphology and the reproducibility of device efficiencies. Here, a facile and practical aging treatment (AT) strategy is reported to modulate the perovskite crystal growth to produce sufficiently high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films with improved homogeneity and full&#8208;coverage morphology. The resulting AT&#8208;films exhibit fewer defects, faster charge carrier transfer/extraction, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination compared with reference. The AT&#8208;devices achieve a noticeable improvement in the reproducibility, operational stability, and photovoltaic performance of devices, with the average efficiency increased by 16%. It also demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of AT strategy in optimizing the film morphology and device performance for other perovskite components including MAPbI3, (MAPbBr3)15(FAPbI3)85, and Cs0.05(MAPbBr3)0.17(FAPbI3)0.83. This method opens an effective avenue to improve the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.

         <title>Sampling the Materials Space for Conventional Superconducting Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;scale, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated study of conventional superconducting materials is presented, wherein the transition temperatures of approximately 200 000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are close to the convex hull of thermodynamic stability to maximize the probability of synthesizability. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds.








Abstract
A large scale study of conventional superconducting materials using a machine&#8208;learning accelerated high&#8208;throughput workflow is performed, starting by creating a comprehensive dataset of around 7000 electron&#8211;phonon calculations performed with reasonable convergence parameters. This dataset is then used to train a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the electron&#8211;phonon and superconducting properties based on structural, compositional, and electronic ground&#8208;state properties. Using this machine, the transition temperatures (Tc) of approximately 200&#160;000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are on the convex hull of thermodynamic stability (or close to it) to maximize the probability of synthesizability. Compounds predicted to have Tc values exceeding 5&#160;K are further validated using density&#8208;functional perturbation theory. As a result, 541 compounds with Tc values surpassing 10&#160;K, encompassing a variety of crystal structures and chemical compositions, are identified. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds. Particularly noteworthy is LiMoN2, which is predicted to be superconducting in the stoichiometric trigonal phase, with a Tc exceeding 38&#160;K. LiMoN2 has previously been synthesized in this phase, further heightening its potential for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Atomic Zincophilic Sites Regulating Microspace Electric Fields for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CoSA/C additive with strong Zn affinity can preferentially absorb on the Zn surface in which the curvature&#8208;adjusted absorption enables a self&#8208;adaptive distribution. Atomic zincophilic Co&#8208;N3 sites with strong charge polarization effect redistribute the microspace electric field and ion flux, thus guiding uniform Zn deposition. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping guarantees a sustainable regulation.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic advantages. However, Zn tends to deposit irregularly and forms dendrites driven by the uneven space electric field distribution near the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Herein it is demonstrated that trace addition of Co single atom anchored carbon (denoted as CoSA/C) in the electrolyte regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase and unifies Zn deposition. Through preferential adsorption of CoSA/C on the Zn surface, the atomically dispersed Co&#8208;N3 with strong charge polarization effect can redistribute the local space electric field and regulate ion flux. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping offers sustainable long&#8208;term regulation. Therefore, Zn||Zn symmetric cells with CoSA/C electrolyte additive deliver stable cycling up to 1600&#160;h (corresponding to a cumulative plated capacity of 8 Ah cm&#8722;2) at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating the sustainable feature of microspace electric field regulation at high current density and capacity.

         <title>Engineering A Boron&#8208;Rich Interphase with Nonflammable Electrolyte toward Stable Li||NCM811 Cells Under Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of boron&#8208;rich CEI is proposed by selecting salts and solvents with reasonable HOMO levels, which can stabilize the NCM811 at both RT and high temperature by suppressing the degradation of particles and decreasing the consumption of electrolytes. Besides, it improves the flame&#8208;retardancy to decrease the safety risk of NCM811||Li battery.








Abstract
Despite the high energy of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode, it still suffers serious decay due to the continuous solvents decomposition and unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers, especially under high temperatures. The intense exothermic reaction between delithiated NCM811 and flammable electrolyte, on the other hand, pushes the batteries to their safety limit. Herein, these two issues are tackled via engineering the electrolytes, that is, utilizing salts with higher HOMO levels and nonflammable solvents with lower HOMO levels, to reduce the massive decomposition of solvents and improve battery safety under elevated temperatures. Consequently, a thin and boron&#8208;rich CEI is generated, which effectively inhibited the side reactions, thus improving the cycling stability and safety. Deviated from the highly concentrated electrolytes which heavily relies on the usage of massive salts, the electrolyte recipe can introduce a robust inorganic&#8208;rich CEI but use much less salt (i.e., dilute electrolyte), and thus, offer an encouraging alternative toward practical applications. As such, the NCM811 cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 81.2% after 950 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C and 75% after 300 cycles at 55&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a universal electrolyte design strategy for designing stable and safe high&#8208;temperature electrolytes for the NCM811 cathode.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Nanopores for Highly Selective Separation of Monovalent Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalized graphene nanopores exhibit distinct monovalent ions transport behaviors including transport&#8208;rectification and exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity through precise pore structure and surface functional groups regulation. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultra&#8208;low permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene but also attribute to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.








Abstract
Biological ion channels possess prominent ion transport performances attributed to their critical chemical groups across the continuous nanoscale filters. However, it is still a challenge to imitate these sophisticated performances in artificial nanoscale systems. Herein, this work develops the strategy to fabricate functionalized graphene nanopores in pioneer based on the synergistic regulation of the pore size and chemical properties of atomically thin confined structure through decoupling etching combined with in situ covalent modification. The modified graphene nanopores possess asymmetric ion transport behaviors and efficient monovalent metal ions sieving (K+/Li+ selectivity &#8776;48.6). Meanwhile, it also allows preferential transport for cations, the resulting membranes exhibit a K+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 76 and a H+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 59.3. The synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions imposing a higher energy barrier for Cl&#8722; or Li+ across nanopores lead to ultra&#8208;selective H+ or K+ transport. Further, the functionalized graphene nanopores generate a power density of 25.3&#160;W m&#8722;2 and a conversion efficiency of 33.9%, showing potential application prospects in energy conversion. The theoretical studies quantitatively match well with the experimental results. The feasible preparation of functionalized graphene nanopores paves the way toward direct investigation on ion transport mechanism and advanced design in devices.

         <title>Halide Perovskites&#8208;Based Diffusive Memristors for Artificial Mechano&#8208;Nociceptive System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic of threshold response in the MAPbI3:Ag&#8208;based artificial nociceptor neurons and threshold firing of output current. The mechano&#8208;nociceptive system, utilizing halide perovskites&#8208;based memristors with a force sensing resistor, demonstrates the capability to detect detrimental impacts through sensitization responses. Scaling up to a 5 &#215; 5 crossbar array, the artificial skin system achieves successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses.








Abstract
Numerous efforts for emulating organ systems comprised of multiple functional units have driven substantial advancements in bio&#8208;realistic electronics and systems. The resistance change behavior observed in diffusive memristors shares similarities with the potential change in biological neurons. Here, the diffusive threshold switching phenomenon in Ag&#8208;incorporated organometallic halide perovskites is utilized to demonstrate the functions of afferent neurons. Halide perovskites&#8208;based diffusive memristors show a low threshold voltage of &#8776;0.2&#160;V with little variation, attributed to the facile migration of Ag ions uniformly dispersed within the halide matrix. Based on the reversible and reliable volatile threshold switching, the memristors successfully demonstrate fundamental nociceptive functions including threshold firing, relaxation, and sensitization. Furthermore, to replicate the biological mechano&#8208;nociceptive phenomenon at a system level, an artificial mechano&#8208;nociceptive system is built by integrating a diffusive memristor with a force&#8208;sensing resistor. The presented system is capable of detecting and discerning the detrimental impact caused by a heavy steel ball, effectively exhibiting the corresponding sensitization response. By further extending the single nociceptive system into a 5 &#215; 5 array, successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses is achieved in the artificial skin system through array&#8208;scale sensitization. These results represent significant progress in the field of bio&#8208;inspired electronics and systems.

         <title>Inkjet Printed Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystal Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterned arrays of photonic cellulose nanocrystal microfilms are prepared by inkjet printing. By dispensing directly through an oil layer, the printing and drying processes can be decoupled, which avoids the coffee stain effect and enables complex arrays to be produced. By adjusting the formulation of each individual drop via overprinting and coalescence, a spectrum of colors can be printed on&#8208;demand.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;sourced cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated, birefringent nanoparticles that can undergo cholesteric self&#8208;assembly in water to produce vibrant, structurally colored films. As such, they are an ideal candidate for use as sustainable and cost&#8208;effective inks in the printing of scalable photonic coatings and bespoke patterns. However, the small volume and large surface area of a sessile CNC drop typically leads to rapid evaporation, resulting in microfilms with a coffee&#8208;stain&#8208;like morphology and very weak coloration. Here, it is demonstrated that inkjet printing of CNC drops directly through an immiscible oil layer can immediately inhibit water loss, resulting in reduced internal mass flows and greater time for cholesteric self&#8208;assembly. The color of each microfilm is determined by the initial composition of the drop, which can be tuned on&#8208;demand by exploiting the overprinting and coalescence of multiple smaller drops of different inks. This enables the production of multicolored patterns with complex optical behaviors, such as angle&#8208;dependent color and polarization&#8208;selective reflection. Finally, the array can be made responsive to stimuli (e.g., UV light, polar solvent) by the inclusion of a degradable additive. This suite of functional properties promotes inkjet&#8208;printed photonic CNC arrays for smart colorimetric labeling or optical anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Suppressing Bulk Strain and Surface O2 Release in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes by Just Tuning the Li Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>

A coherent thin spinel&#8208;like structure is formed on the surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides by controlling the Li content during the synthesis. The combined in situ XRD and atomic&#8208;scale imaging of the structural evolution reveal that the surface layer simultaneously suppresses the bulk strain accumulation and surface O2 release, resulting in outstanding electrochemical performance and structural stability.








Abstract
Layered oxides represent a prominent class of cathodes employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The structural degradation of layered cathodes causes capacity decay during cycling, which is generally induced by anisotropic lattice strain in the bulk of cathode particle and oxygen release at the surface. However, particularly in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here a thin (1&#8208;nm) and coherent spinel&#8208;like phase is constructed on the surface of LLOs particle to suppress bulk strain and surface O2 release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel&#8208;like phase hinders the surface O2 release by accommodating O2 inside the surface layer, while the trapped O2 in the bulk impedes strain evolution by &#8776;70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability leads to an improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.5% after 100 cycles at 0.1&#176;C. These findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high&#8208;capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.

         <title>Manipulating Surface Band Bending of III&#8208;Nitride Nanowires with Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics: A Pathway Toward Advanced Photoswitching Logic Gates and Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors for the first time. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates and secured image transmission system.








Abstract
The operational principle of semiconductor devices critically relies on the band structures that ultimately govern their charge&#8208;transfer characteristics. Indeed, the precise orchestration of band structure within semiconductor devices, notably at the semiconductor surface and corresponding interface, continues to pose a perennial conundrum. Herein, for the first time, this work reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Specifically, the surface band bending of p&#8208;type aluminum&#8208;gallium&#8208;nitride (p&#8208;AlGaN) nanowires grown on n&#8208;Si can be precisely controlled by depositing different carbon layers as guided by theoretical calculations, which eventually regulate the ambipolar charge&#8208;transfer behavior between the p&#8208;AlGaN/electrolyte and p&#8208;AlGaN/n&#8208;Si interface in an electrolyte environment. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, and &#8220;NOT&#8221; in a single device. Finally, this work constructs a secured image transmission system where the optical signals are encrypted through the &#8220;XOR&#8221; logic operations. The proposed continuous surface band tuning strategy provides an effective avenue for the development of multifunctional integrated&#8208;photonics systems implemented with nanophotonics.

         <title>Dynamically Adaptive Bubbling for Upgrading Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Lamellar Fern&#8208;Like Alloy Aerogel Self&#8208;Standing Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) as a self&#8208;standing electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. LFA not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities.








Abstract
Adopting renewable electricity to produce &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen has been a critical challenge because at a high current density the mass transfer capability of most catalytic electrodes deteriorates significantly. Herein, a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation is reported. The LFA electrode is intrinsically highly catalytic&#8208;active and shows a highly porous, resilient, hierarchically ordered, and well&#8208;percolated conductive network. It not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities, showing the record lowest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 244&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stably over 6000 h. With the merits of mechanical robustness, excellent electron transport, and efficient bubble evacuation, LFA can be self&#8208;standing catalytic electrode and&#160;gas diffusion layers in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), which can achieve 3000 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.88&#160;V and can sustain stable electrolysis at 2000&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1300 h. This strategy can be extended to various gas evolution reactions as a general design rule for multiphase catalysis applications.

         <title>Regulating Crystal Orientation via Ligand Anchoring Enables Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed, which significantly promotes the desired (001) crystal orientation. Thus, opaque and semitransparent 1.66 eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells realize efficiencies of 22.40% and 20.13%, respectively. Furthermore, four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells deliver a remarkable efficiency of 28.06%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications in tandem solar cells. However, the predominant obstacles impeding their widespread adoption are substantial open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation. To tackle these challenges, a crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed. This method significantly promotes the desired crystal orientation, passivates defects, and mitigates photo&#8208;induced halide phase segregation in perovskite films, leading to substantially reduced nonradiative recombination, minimized VOC deficits, and enhanced operational stability of the devices. The resulting 1.66&#160;eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% (certified at 21.97%), with the smallest VOC deficit recorded at 0.39&#160;V. Furthermore, the fabricated semitransparent WBG devices exhibit a competitive PCE of 20.13%. Consequently, four&#8208;terminal tandem cells comprising WBG perovskite top cells and 1.25&#160;eV bandgap perovskite bottom cells showcase an impressive PCE of 28.06% (stabilized 27.92%), demonstrating great potential for efficient multijunction tandem solar cell applications.

         <title>Oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kagome (kgm)&#160;topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are rationally designed for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. COF&#8208;954 shows high and stable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance in water, 3% NaCl solution, and seawater. The water&#8208;drainage experiments also suggest the potential of COF&#8208;954 in the practical applications for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great advantages as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two Kagome (kgm) topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based COFs are designed and synthesized for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF&#8208;954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibits high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF&#8208;954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8211;vis) light irradiation. Additionally, the water&#8208;drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25 and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 min under UV&#8211;vis light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrates an effective design strategy toward highly efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

&lt;p&gt;Two kagome (kgm)&#160;topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are rationally designed for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Hetero[6]helicenes Showing Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Toward High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical extension strategy is introduced to engineer deep&#8208;blue hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters for circularly polarized OLEDs. Besides satisfactory chiroptical performance, this strategy endows the emitters with enhanced quantum yield and narrower emission bands compared to their precursor. The devices display record efficiencies, high color purity, and distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, marking a significant advance in chiroptical materials for high&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
Helicenes exhibit substantial potential as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active molecules. However, their application in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) is typically hindered by the challenge of integrating both high color purity and efficient triplet&#8208;harvesting capability, particularly in the blue spectral region. Herein, a series of hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters that is strategically engineered through the helical extension of a deep&#8208;blue double&#8208;boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) motif, is introduced. Importantly, the helical extension does not cause apparent structural deformation or perturb frontier molecular orbitals; thus, preserving the deep&#8208;blue emission and MR&#8208;TADF characteristics of the parent molecule. This approach also leads to reduced reorganization energy, resulting in emitters with narrower linewidth and higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Further, the helical motif enhances the racemization barrier and leads to improved CPL performance with luminescence dissymmetry factor values up to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Exploiting these merits, devices incorporating the chiral dopants demonstrate deep&#8208;blue emission within the Broadcast Service Television 2020 color&#8208;gamut range, record external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 29.3%, and have distinctive circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals. Overall, the authors&#8217; findings underscore the helical extension as a promising strategy for designing narrowband chiroptical materials and advancing high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Nanolayer&#8208;Derived Zincophilicity Suppressing Metallic Zinc Dendrites and Its Efficacy in Improving Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

From the initial Zn deposition, a Zn&#8208;Au alloy grows from the Au&#8208;coating layer. This further results in smooth Zn deposition, which stabilizes long&#8208;term Zn stripping/plating without Zn dendrite via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217;.








Abstract
Herein, an Au&#8208;coating layer adjusted on the surface of a Zn metal electrode that effectively suppresses the dendrite growth as well as the mechanisms underlying the dendrite suppression as a result of the zincophilic character of Au is introduced. For the Au&#8208;coated Zn metal symmetric cell, uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;derived compounds&#160;was revealed by operando synchrotron tomography. Microscopic studies demonstrate that the Au&#8208;coating layer is induced to form a new Zn&#8211;Au alloy during the initial Zn deposition, resulting in stabilized long&#8208;term stripping/plating of Zn via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217; that intimately accommodates Zn deposition for further cycles. This property supports the successful operation of symmetrical cells up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. According to Zn electrodeposition simulation, it is verified that the suppression of dendrite growth is responsible for the electro&#8208;conducting Au nanolayer that uniformly distributes the electric field and protects the Zn electrode from corrosion, ultimately promoting uniform Zn growth. The compatibility of the Au&#8208;coating layer for full cell configuration is verified using NaV3O8 as a cathode material over 1&#160;000 cycles. This finding provides a new pathway for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of ZIBs by suppressing the dendritic growth of Zn by means of a zincophilic Au nanolayer.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Thin Films for Pseudocapacitive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow evaporation from a pure water solution provides high charging rate pseudocapacitive conjugated polyelectrolyte films that are stable in aqueous electrolytes. Key to stability is increased crystallinity and a high electrolyte concentration for decreasing interchain electrostatic repulsion. This strategy may be applied for integrating organic mixed ionic electronic conductors in applications such as batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, or electrochemical sensors.








Abstract
A subclass of organic semiconductors known as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is characterized by a conjugated backbone with ionic pendant groups. The water solubility of CPEs typically hinders applications of thin films in aqueous media. Herein, it is reported that films of an anionic CPE, namely CPE&#8208;K, drop cast from water produces single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state pseudocapacitive electrodes that are insoluble in aqueous electrolyte. That X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments reveal a more structurally ordered film, relative to the as&#8208;obtained powder from chemical synthesis, and dynamic light scattering measurements show an increase in aggregate particle size with increasing [KCl] indicate that CPE&#8208;K films are insoluble because of tight interchain contacts and electrostatic screening by the electrolyte. CPE&#8208;K film electrodes can maintain 85% of their original capacitance (84 F g&#8722;1) at 500 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit excellent cycling stability, where a capacitance retention of 93% after 100&#160;000 cycles at a current density of 35 A g&#8722;1. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to use initially water soluble ionic&#8208;organic materials in aqueous electrolytes, by increasing the electrolyte concentration. This strategy can be applied to the application of conjugated polyelectrolytes in batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, and electrochemical sensors, where fast electron and ion transport are required.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Modification of High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life LiCoO2 Cathode with Concentration Gradient Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The essence of the currently proposed one&#8208;step multi&#8208;modification strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode candidates&#160;lies in its &#8243;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8243; functionality, which systematically and comprehensively considers both the localized environment (e.g., TM&#9472;O bonding state, Li/Co migration pathway, TM&#8208;derived catalytic site for electrolyte decomposition) and the overall architecture (e.g., cathode/electrolyte interface reinforcement, gliding stacking faults reformation).








Abstract
Raising the charging cut&#8208;off voltage of layered oxide cathodes can improve their energy density. However, it inevitably introduces instabilities regarding both bulk structure and surface/interface. Herein, exploiting the unique characteristics of high&#8208;valence Nb5+ element, a synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk&#8208;modified LiCoO2 featuring Li3NbO4 surface coating layer, Nb&#8208;doped bulk, and the desired concentration gradient architecture through one&#8208;step calcination is achieved. Such a multifunctional structure facilitates the construction of high&#8208;quality cathode/electrolyte interface, enhances Li+ diffusion, and restrains lattice&#8208;O loss, Co migration, and associated layer&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase distortion.

This multifunctional one&#8208;step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion cathode materials.

     alt="One-Step Surface-to-Bulk Modification of High-Voltage and Long-Life LiCoO2 Cathode with Concentration Gradient Architecture"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of the currently proposed one-step multi-modification strategy for high-energy-density cathode candidates&#160;lies in its &#8243;all-in-one&#8243; functionality, which systematically and comprehensively considers both the localized environment (e.g., TM&#9472;O bonding state, Li/Co migration pathway, TM-derived catalytic site for electrolyte decomposition) and the overall architecture (e.g., cathode/electrolyte interface reinforcement, gliding stacking faults reformation).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising the charging cut-off voltage of layered oxide cathodes can improve their energy density. However, it inevitably introduces instabilities regarding both bulk structure and surface/interface. Herein, exploiting the unique characteristics of high-valence Nb&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; element, a synchronous surface-to-bulk-modified LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; featuring Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NbO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; surface coating layer, Nb-doped bulk, and the desired concentration gradient architecture through one-step calcination is achieved. Such a multifunctional structure facilitates the construction of high-quality cathode/electrolyte interface, enhances Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, and restrains lattice-O loss, Co migration, and associated layer-to-spinel phase distortion. Therefore, a stable operation of Nb-modified LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; half-cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Long-life 250&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4.7&#160;V-class 550&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; pouch cells assembled with graphite and thin Li anodes are harvested (both beyond 87% after 1600 and 200 cycles). This multifunctional one-step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high-energy density and long-life lithium-ion cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Chemically Replaced Interfacial Layer via Unveiling the Influence of Zn Crystal Facets for Practical Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the effect of Zn crystal facets in Sn&#8208;based chemical replacement reaction (CRR), a Sn&#8208;based interfacial architecture (ZnTCF@Sn) via a novel two&#8208;step CRR is developed. Owing to its unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side reactions of metallic Sn) merits, ZnTCF@Sn can approach a practical Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) undergo irregular deposition and unfavorable side reactions, which hinders the practical application of aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries (ARZMBs). Chemical replacement reaction (CRR) strategies can achieve stable ZMAs, but the effect of the crystal facets of metallic Zn as reductants remains poorly understood. In this study, based on the observation that preferentially exposed Zn crystal facets affect the surface characteristics of chemically replaced layers in Sn&#8208;based CRR, a multifunctional Sn&#8208;based interfacial layer (ZnTCF@Sn) is designed on the Zn with textured crystal facets using a novel two&#8208;step CRR process. ZnTCF@Sn simultaneously provides abundant zincophilic sites and high surface energy and homogenizes the distribution of current/Zn2+ flux, resulting in fast electrochemical kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free deposition. Furthermore, the uniform Sn coverage on the ZnTCF@Sn surface inhibits side reactions and enhances reversibility during Zn deposition/dissolution. Thus, the ZnTCF@Sn achieves exceptional cyclability over 1200&#160;h even under harsh operating conditions with a cumulative capacity of 24 Ah cm&#8722;2. This study contributes to the development of practical ARZMBs by providing new insights into the effect of the Zn crystal facets on the surface modification of ZMAs through various CRRs.

         <title>Targeting DNA Damage and Repair Machinery via Delivering WEE1 Inhibitor and Platinum (IV) Prodrugs to Stimulate STING Pathway for Maximizing Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticle loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775), which can increase DNA damage, activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, ultimately enhancing chemo&#8208;immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Moreover, the nanoparticle elicits long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors when combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Both cisplatin&#8208;based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)&#8208;based immunotherapy are the first&#8208;line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Cancer cells can develop resistance to cisplatin through extensive DNA repair, while a low response rate to ICBs is mostly due to the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and low PD&#8208;L1 expression. Herein, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP2) loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775) is designed. NP2 can be triggered by GSH in cancer cells, and the released MK1775 can inhibit the activity of WEE1 protein, which ultimately increases DNA damage by cisplatin. Genome&#8208;wide RNA sequencing first reveals that NP2 can inhibit DNA repair machinery by interfering with the cell cycle and significantly activate the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Tumor growth is significantly inhibited by NP2 in vivo. As innate and adaptive immune responses are stimulated, the immunosuppressive microenvironment is modified, and the &#8220;immune cold tumor&#8221; is transformed into an &#8220;immune hot tumor". In addition, NP2 can upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, thereby increasing the response rate of PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) and eliciting long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Both cisplatin-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)-based immunotherapy are the first-line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer.

         <title>Energy Band Engineering Guided Design of Bidirectional Catalyst for Reversible Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and understanding of the relationship between structure and performance are essential. Under the guidance of energy band engineering, a highly efficient catalyst is designed and shows obvious bidirectional effect for CO2 redox. This work offers new avenues for designing excellent electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;CO2 batteries arouse great interest in the context of carbon neutralization, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 redox reaction kinetics at the cathode, which brings about formidable challenges such as high overpotential and low Coulombic efficiency. For the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and the understanding of the relationship between electron state and performance are essential for the CO2 redox. However, little attention is paid to it. In this work, using Co3S4 as a model system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adjusted d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band centers of Co3S4 with the introduction of Cu and sulfur vacancies are hybridized between CO2 and Li species, respectively, which is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the decomposition of Li2CO3, and the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of energy band engineering. As a result, a highly efficient bidirectional catalyst is produced and shows an ultra&#8208;small voltage gap of 0.73&#160;V and marvelous Coulombic efficiency&#160;of 92.6%, surpassing those of previous catalysts under similar conditions. This work presents an effective catalyst design and affords new insight into the high&#8208;performance cathode catalyst materials for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

A new super fuel cell (SFC) with single&#8208;atomic Pt on hollow porous carbon nanorods catalyst has super&#8208;high output ability through two creations of &#8220;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) + electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC)&#8221; parallel discharging and self&#8208;charging to overcome sluggish ORR process. The promising SFC offers a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.








Abstract
Pursuing high power density with low platinum catalysts loading is a huge challenge for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cells (FCs). Herein, a new super fuel cell (SFC) is proposed with ultrahigh output power via specific electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) + oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) parallel discharge, which is achieved using the newly prepared catalyst, single&#8208;atomic platinum on bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hollow porous carbon nanorods (PtSA/HPCNR). The PtSA&#8208;1.74/HPCNR&#8208;based SFC has a 3.4&#8208;time higher transient specific power density and 13.3&#8208;time longer discharge time with unique in situ self&#8208;charge and energy storage ability than 20% Pt/C&#8208;based FCs. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscope, and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored on carbon defects significantly boosts its electron transfer, ORR catalytic activity, durability, and rate performance, realizing rapid &#8220; ORR+EDLC&#8221; parallel discharge mechanism to overcome the sluggish ORR process of traditional FCs. The promising SFC leads to a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.

         <title>High&#8208;Reversibility Sulfur Anode for Advanced Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8596;Na2S conversion is identified as a promising anodic reaction with low potential. The viability of S anode is established in S&#8211;I2 battery that uses a cost&#8208;effective and scalable sulfonated polysulfone membrane to mitigate &#8220;shuttle effects.&#8221; Compared to Zn anode, S anode avoids dendrite formation and hydrogen evolution, and it can withstand super&#8208;high utilization (100% vs &lt; 1% for Zn).








Abstract
Despite being extensively explored as cathodes in batteries, sulfur (S) can function as a low&#8208;potential anode by changing charge carriers in electrolytes. Here, a highly reversible S anode that fully converts from S80 to S2&#8722; in static aqueous S&#8211;I2 batteries by using Na+ as the charge carrier is reported. This S anode exhibits a low potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V (vs standard hydrogen electrode) and a near&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity of 1404&#160;mA h g&#8722;1. Importantly, it shows significant advantages over the widely used Zn anode in aqueous media by obviating dendrite formation and H2 evolution. To suppress &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; faced by both S and I2 electrodes, a scalable sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) membrane is proposed, which is superior to commercial Nafion in cost (US$1.82 m&#8722;2&#160;vs $3500 m&#8722;2) and environmental benignity. Because of its ultra&#8208;high selectivity in blocking polysulfides/iodides, the battery with SPSF displays excellent cycling stability. Even under 100% depth of discharge, the battery demonstrates high capacity retention of 87.6% over 500 cycles, outperforming Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with 3.1% capacity under the same conditions. These findings broaden anode options beyond metals for high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost, and fast&#8208;chargeable batteries.

         <title>Reinforcing the Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium Metal Batteries Employing Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte based on trifluoromethoxybenzene cosolvent is proposed for lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes, through a comparative study of three fluorinated aromatic cosolvents. The generated solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on anodes and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in organic cation&#8208;derived species on cathodes enable stable cycling of Li/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cells.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, but the lack of sufficiently protective electrode/electrolyte interphases (EEIs) limits their cyclability. Herein, trifluoromethoxybenzene is proposed as a cosolvent for locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) to reinforce the EEIs. With a comparative study of a neat ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) and three LCILEs employing fluorobenzene, trifluoromethylbenzene, or trifluoromethoxybenzene as cosolvents, it is revealed that the fluorinated groups tethered to the benzene ring of the cosolvents not only affect the electrolytes&#8217; ionic conductivity and fluidity, but also the EEIs&#8217; composition via adjusting the contribution of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Emim+) and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion. Trifluoromethoxybenzene, as the optimal cosolvent, leads to a stable cycling of LMBs employing 5 mAh cm&#8722;2 lithium metal anodes (LMAs), 21&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05 (NCA) cathodes, and 4.2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolytes for 150 cycles with a remarkable capacity retention of 71%, thanks to a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on LMAs and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in Emim+&#8208;derived species on NCA cathodes. By contrast, the capacity retention under the same condition is only 16%, 46%, and 18% for the neat ILE and the LCILEs based on fluorobenzene and benzotrifluoride, respectively.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxometalates Act as Superchaotropic Membrane Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic anions of the polyoxometalate type display a new biological activity: They efficiently transport cationic peptides across lipidic and cellular membranes. This function is related to their superchaotropic nature, resulting in strong and concomitant interactions with peptides and lipids. Mixed&#8208;metal Keggin&#8208;type anions show the required hydrolytic stability and sufficiently low charge density that are prerequisites for the desirable carrier utility.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are known antitumoral, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents and considered as next&#8208;generation metallodrugs. Herein, a new biological functionality in neutral physiological media, where selected mixed&#8208;metal POMs are sufficiently stable and able to affect membrane transport of impermeable, hydrophilic, and cationic peptides (heptaarginine, heptalysine, protamine, and polyarginine) is reported. The uptake is observed in both, model membranes as well as cells, and attributed to the superchaotropic properties of the polyoxoanions. In view of the structural diversity of POMs these findings pave the way toward their biomedical application in drug delivery or for cell&#8208;biological uptake studies with biological effector molecules or staining agents.

         <title>Recycled Tandem Catalysts Promising Ultralow Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One critical challenge&#160;of lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries&#160;is to develop highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts with precise structure. A tandem catalyst with an in&#8208;built electric field is elaborately recycled from the spent batteries and exhibits remarkable bidirectional activities. This work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO2 redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER) kinetics with an in&#8208;built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface&#8208;induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO2RR and CO2ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics&#8208;derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultralow voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 92.4%.

&lt;p&gt;One critical challenge&#160;of lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries&#160;is to develop highly efficient and low-cost catalysts with precise structure. A tandem catalyst with an in-built electric field is elaborately recycled from the spent batteries and exhibits remarkable bidirectional activities. This work affords new opportunities to fabricate low-cost electrocatalysts and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation to engineer better Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low-cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium-ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and evolution reactions (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER) kinetics with an in-built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface-induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics-derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultralow voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 92.4%. Profoundly, this work affords new opportunities to fabricate low-cost electrocatalysts from recycled spent electronics and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation including but not limited to BEF to engineer better Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermochromic Photonic Crystal Paper with Integrated Multilayer Structure and Fast Thermal Response: A Waterproof and Mechanically Stable Material for Structural&#8208;Colored Thermal Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para) multilayer film is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing. The fast thermal response enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure ensures good stability in daily liquids and enhances its mechanical stability for better user experience.








Abstract
Thermochromic photonic crystals are promising materials for thermal printing due to their unfaded colors under chemical/illuminated environments and the absence of toxic chemicals. However, the slow thermochromic response, the multistep printing procedures, the use of inks or developing liquids, and the requirement of expensive parts in printers limit their applications. Here, a thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para)&#160;film with an integrated multilayer structure is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing that is fully compatible with commercial printers. The fast thermochromic response in milliseconds enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing as the paraffin infiltration and the color change can be finely controlled in a microscale range. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure renders the thermochromic film good stability in daily liquids, which addresses the long&#8208;existing concern of print fading. Meanwhile, the integrated multilayer structure also enhances the mechanical stability when it is deposited on fibrous paper so that people can fold, cut, or staple the thermal papers, and make notes confidently in practical usage.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Modulated Ionic Polymer as an Adaptable Electron Transport Material for Optically Switchable Pixel&#8208;Free Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer comprising photocrosslinkable moieties and electron transport moieties enables organic light&#8208;emitting devices to be switched by external optical direct writing and erasing. Independent solution&#8208;processed electron transport layer (ETL) using photo&#8208;modulated ionic polymer realizes the fabrication of optically switchable pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) with tunable illuminants and seamless imaging capability.








Abstract
In addition to electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED)&#160;displays that rely on complicated and costly circuits for switching individual pixel illumination, developing a facile approach that structures pixel&#8208;free light&#8208;emitting displays with exceptional precision and spatial resolution via external photo&#8208;modulation holds significant importance for advancing consumer electronics. Here, optically switchable organic light&#8208;emitting pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) are presented and fabricated by judiciously combining an adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer as electron transport materials (ETM) with external photo&#8208;modulation as the switching mode while ensuring superior illumination performance and seamless imaging capability. By irradiating the solution&#8208;processed OSPFDs with light at specific wavelengths, efficient and reversible tuning of both electron transport and electroluminescence is achieved simultaneously. This remarkable control is achieved by altering the energetic matching within OSPFDs, which also exhibits a high level of universality and adjustable flexibility in the three primary color&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting displays. Moreover, the ease of creating and erasing desired pixel&#8208;free emitting patterns through a non&#8208;invasive photopatterning process within a single OSPFD is demonstrated, thereby rendering this approach promising for commercial displaying devices and highly precise pixelated illuminants.

         <title>Fabrication of Oriented Polycrystalline MOF Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have progressed beyond powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials towards polycrystalline superstructures. A current challenge is&#160;the fabrication of superstructures with defined crystalline orientation to access anisotropic properties. This perspective examines methods for the fabrication of oriented MOF superstructures (colloidal assembly, external fields, heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF, and other emerging methods), to promote the development of systems with oriented pore channels.








Abstract
The field of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has progressed beyond the design and exploration of powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials. A current challenge is the fabrication of organized superstructures that can harness the directional properties of the individual constituent MOF crystals. To date, the progress in the fabrication methods of polycrystalline MOF superstructures has led to close&#8208;packed structures with defined crystalline orientation. By controlling the crystalline orientation, the MOF pore channels of the constituent crystals can be aligned along specific directions: these systems possess anisotropic properties including enhanced diffusion along specific directions, preferential orientation of guest species, and protection of functional guests. In this perspective, we&#160;discuss the current status of MOF research in the fabrication of oriented polycrystalline superstructures focusing on the specific crystalline directions of orientation. Three methods are examined in detail: the assembly from colloidal MOF solutions, the use of external fields for the alignment of MOF particles, and the heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF growth. This perspective aims at promoting the progress of this field of research and inspiring the development of new protocols for the preparation of MOF systems with oriented pore channels, to enable advanced MOF&#8208;based devices with anisotropic properties.

         <title>Amphoteric Ion Bridged Buried Interface for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphoteric organic salt, 4FPEAPSA, is applied as the buried interface bridged layer to induce large&#8208;grain perovskite film with uniform morphology. 4FPEAPSA treatment can facilitate the matchable energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface, reducing defect recombination loss. Such a multi&#8208;functional bridged layer enables a high efficiency of 25.03% and preferable stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs).








Abstract
Synergistic morphology and defects management at the buried perovskite interface are challenging but crucial for the further improvement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Herein, an amphoteric organic salt, 2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethylammonium&#8208;4&#8208;methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA), is designed to optimize the film morphology and energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface. 4FPEAPSA treatment promotes the growth of a void&#8208;free, coarse&#8208;grained, and hydrophobic film by inducing the crystal orientation. Besides, the dual&#8208;functional 4FPEAPSA can chemically interact with the perovskite film, and passivate the defects of iodine and formamidine vacancies, tending to revert the fermi level of perovskite to its defect&#8208;free state. Meanwhile, the formation of a p&#8208;type doping buried interface can facilitate the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PerSCs for reduced carrier recombination loss. Consequently, 4FPEAPSA treatment improves the efficiency of the perovskite devices to 25.03% with better storage, heat, and humidity stability. This work contributes to strengthening the systematic understanding of the perovskite buried interface, providing a synergetic approach to realize precise morphology control, effective defect suppression, and energy level alignment for efficient PerSCs.

         <title>Selenophene Substitution Enabled High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Glucose Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With selenophene substitution, the resulting polymers demonstrate enhanced charge transport properties and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities, resulting in unprecedented performance for n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors. These advancements hold great promise for various biosensing applications, exemplified by the successful development of a highly sensitive glucose sensor.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n&#8208;type polymers (f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene&#8208;based counterpart as the control, it is demonstrated that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, boosted charge&#8208;transport properties, and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities. Therefore, a remarkable volumetric capacitance (C*) of 387.2 F cm&#8722;3 and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECT electron mobility (&#181;e,OECT) of 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are synchronously achieved for f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN having the highest selenophene content, yielding an unprecedented geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 71.4 S cm&#8722;1 and record figure of merit (&#181;C*) value of 191.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type OECTs. Thanks to such excellent performance of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN&#8208;based OECTs, a glucose sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 10&#160;nMm and decent selectivity is further implemented, demonstrating the power of selenophene substitution strategy in enabling high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type PMIECs for biosensing applications.

&lt;p&gt;High-performance n-type polymeric mixed ionic-electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)-based low-power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n-type polymers (f-BTI2g-SVSCN and f-BSeI2g-SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene-based counterpart as the control, it is demonstrated that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, boosted charge-transport properties, and improved ion-uptake capabilities.

         <title>Unraveling the Coupling Effect between Cathode and Anode toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Butler&#8211;Volmer equation fundamentally describes the relationship between electrode overpotential and local current densities. Inspired by the equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) is proposed to guide the design of sulfur cathodes. This descriptor can evaluate the influence of mass transport and charge transfer on reaction kinetics, and unravel the coupling effect between sulfur cathode and Li anode.








Abstract
The localized reaction heterogeneity of the sulfur cathode and the uneven Li deposition on the Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries under practical operation. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing the sulfur cathode or Li anode, a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between the cathode and anode is still lacking. In this work, inspired by the Butler&#8211;Volmer equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass&#8208;transport index (Imass) and the charge&#8208;transfer index (Icharge) is identified, and subsequently the relationship between IBD and the morphological evolution of Li anode is established. Guided by the IBD, a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions is reported. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 473&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell can be achieved by the design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high&#8208;energy practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Layered Bi2Te3@PPy Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanism and Application in Printed Flexible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors analyze the reaction mechanism of Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) and demonstrate that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. The authors also demonstrate the great application prospect of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, safe, and environmental&#8208;friendly rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices for wearable electronics among other applications. However, sluggish ionic transport kinetics and the unstable electrode structure during ionic insertion/extraction hamper their deployment. Herein, a new cathode material based on a layered metal chalcogenide (LMC), bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), coated with polypyrrole (PPy) is proposed. Taking advantage of the PPy coating, the Bi2Te3@PPy composite presents strong ionic absorption affinity, high oxidation resistance, and high structural stability. The ZIBs based on Bi2Te3@PPy cathodes exhibit high capacities and ultra&#8208;long lifespans of over 5000 cycles. They also present outstanding stability even under bending. In addition, here the reaction mechanism is analyzed using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and computational tools and it is demonstrated that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. Overall, this work not only shows the great potential of LMCs as ZIB cathode materials and the advantages of PPy coating, but also clarifies the charge/discharge mechanism in rechargeable ZIBs based on LMCs.

         <title>Regulating Phase Separation Kinetics for High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a random terpolymer PBDB&#8208;TFCl and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation and reinforced molecular packing are obtained. Resulting flexible organic solar modules exhibit maximum power conversion efficiency of 12.7% and excellent mechanical properties and photostability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) possess excellent operation stability and mechanical robustness than other types of organic solar cells, thereby attracting considerable attention for wearable flexible electron devices. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;PSCs are still lagging behind those of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based systems owing to the limitation of photoactive materials and unsatisfactory blend morphology. In this work, a novel terpolymer, denoted as PBDB&#8208;TFCl (poly4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;4&#8208;fluorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;5,7&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H,8H&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione&#8208;4,8&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene), is used as an electron donor coupled with a ternary strategy to optimize the performance of all&#8208;PSCs. The addition of PBDB&#8208;TCl unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, reducing voltage losses. Moreover, the introduction of the guest donor (D18&#8208;Cl) effectively regulates the phase&#8208;transition kinetics of PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT during the film formation, leading to ideal size of aggregations and enhanced crystallinity. PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT devices exhibit a PCE of 18.6% (certified as 18.3%), judged as the highest value so far obtained with all&#8208;PSCs. Besides, based on the ternary active layer, the manufactured 36 cm2 flexible modules exhibit a PCE of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs exhibit superior photostability and mechanical stability. In summary, the proposed strategy, based on molecular design and the ternary strategy, allows optimization of the all&#8208;polymer blend morphology and improvement of the photovoltaic performance for stable large&#8208;scale flexible PSCs.

In this work, a novel terpolymer, denoted as PBDB-TFCl (poly4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b&#8243;]dithiophene-1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,8&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c&#8243;]dithiophene-4,8-dione-4,8-bis(4-chloro-5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b&#8242;]dithiophene), is used as an electron donor coupled with a ternary strategy to optimize the performance of all-PSCs. The addition of PBDB-TCl unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, reducing voltage losses. Moreover, the introduction of the guest donor (D18-Cl) effectively regulates the phase-transition kinetics of PBDB-TFCl:D18-Cl:PY-IT during the film formation, leading to ideal size of aggregations and enhanced crystallinity. PBDB-TFCl:D18-Cl:PY-IT devices exhibit a PCE of 18.6% (certified as 18.3%), judged as the highest value so far obtained with all-PSCs. Besides, based on the ternary active layer, the manufactured 36 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible modules exhibit a PCE of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs exhibit superior photostability and mechanical stability. In summary, the proposed strategy, based on molecular design and the ternary strategy, allows optimization of the all-polymer blend morphology and improvement of the photovoltaic performance for stable large-scale flexible PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How Photogenerated I2 Induces I&#8208;Rich Phase Formation in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated I2 in the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite induces I&#8208;rich phase formation through a chemical chain reaction. The Br&#8722; binding strength in the perovskite regulates the chemical chain reaction and thus the I&#8208;rich phase formation. This study demonstrates the increasing of Br&#8208;binding strength and eliminating of defects leading to I2 photogeneration in the lattice to stabilize the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite.








Abstract
Bandgap tunability of lead mixed halide perovskites (LMHPs) is a crucial characteristic for versatile optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, LMHPs show the formation of iodide&#8208;rich (I&#8208;rich) phase under illumination, which destabilizes the semiconductor bandgap and impedes their exploitation. Here, it is shown that how I2, photogenerated upon charge carrier trapping at iodine interstitials in LMHPs, can promote the formation of I&#8208;rich phase. I2 can react with bromide (Br&#8722;) in the perovskite to form a trihalide ion I2Br&#8722; (I&#948;&#8722;&#8208;I&#948;+&#8208;Br&#948;&#8722;), whose negatively charged iodide (I&#948;&#8722;) can further exchange with another lattice Br&#8722; to form the I&#8208;rich phase. Importantly, it is observed that the effectiveness of the process is dependent on the overall stability of the crystalline perovskite structure. Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I2 production and the Br&#8722; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, this study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Grain Engineering of Sb2S3 Thin Films to Enable Efficient Planar Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves large&#8208;grained Sb2S3 films by incorporating Ce3+ into the precursor solution for hydrothermal deposition. The formation of ultrathin Ce2S3 at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface is proposed to mediate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 grains. Planar Sb2S3 solar cells are achieved with an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;close to 800 mV (the highest reported to date), along with competitive efficiencies up to 7.66%.








Abstract
Sb2S3 is a promising environmentally friendly semiconductor for high performance solar cells. But, like many other polycrystalline materials, Sb2S3 is limited by nonradiative recombination and carrier scattering by grain boundaries (GBs). This work shows how the GB density in Sb2S3 films can be significantly reduced from 1068&#160;&#177;&#160;40&#160;to 327&#160;&#177;&#160;23&#160;nm &#181;m&#8722;2 by incorporating an appropriate amount of Ce3+ into the precursor solution for Sb2S3 deposition. Through extensive characterization of structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties, complemented with computations, it is revealed that a critical factor is the formation of an ultrathin Ce2S3 layer at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface, which can reduce the interfacial energy and increase the adhesion work between Sb2S3 and the substrate to encourage heterogeneous nucleation of Sb2S3, as well as promote lateral grain growth. Through reductions in nonradiative recombination at GBs and/or the CdS/Sb2S3 heterointerface, as well as improved charge&#8208;carrier transport properties at the heterojunction, this work achieves high performance Sb2S3 solar cells with a power conversion efficiency reaching 7.66%. An impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 796&#160;mV is achieved, which is the highest reported thus far for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously regulate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 absorber films for enhanced device performance.

         <title>Spontaneous Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs and Their Topological Transitions in a Chiral&#8208;Lattice Magnet</title>

         <dc:description>
The emerging field of quantum computing, which relies on multiple electronic states, has recently garnered significant attention. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including (anti)merons with N&#160;=&#160;&#177;1/2, bimerons, and skyrmions with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is presented. The transformations among these states through the application of magnetic fields and electric currents are demonstrated.








Abstract
The spontaneous formation and topological transitions of vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs have implications for a broad range of emergent phenomena, for example, from superconductivity to quantum computing. Unlike magnets exhibiting collinear spin textures, helimagnets with noncollinear spin textures provide unique opportunities to manipulate topological forms such as (anti)merons and (anti)skyrmions. However, it is challenging to achieve multiple topological states and their interconversion in a single helimagnet due to the topological protection for each state. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple topological states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including a spontaneous vortex pair of meron with topological charge N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1/2 and antimeron with N&#160;=&#160;1/2, and a vortex&#8208;antivortex bundle, that is, a bimeron (meron pair) with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is reported. The mutual transformation between skyrmions and bimerons with respect to the competitive effects of magnetic field and magnetic shape anisotropy is demonstrated. It is shown that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.

A cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based bilayer scaffold for atmospheric water harvesting has been developed through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying, which introduces both a&#160;millimeter&#8208;sized grid structure for water sorption and evaporation enhancement, and a micrometer&#8208;sized pore structure for lithium chloride confinement. Benefiting from the milli/micrometer pore structures, the scaffold shows an excellent water sorption/release performance and good cyclic stability.








Abstract
Hygroscopic salt&#8208;based composite sorbents are considered ideal candidates for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The primary challenge for the sorbents lies in exposing more hygroscopically active sites to the surrounding air while preventing salt leakage. Herein, a hierarchically structured scaffold is constructed by integrating cellulose nanofiber and lithium chloride (LiCl) as building blocks through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying. The milli/micrometer multiscale pores can effectively confine LiCl and simultaneously provide a more exposed active area for water sorption and release, accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D printed structure. Compared to a conventional freeze&#8208;dried aerogel, the 3D printed scaffold exhibits a water sorption rate that is increased 1.6&#8208;fold, along with a more than 2.4&#8208;fold greater water release rate. An array of bilayer scaffolds is demonstrated, which can produce 0.63&#160;g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 of water outdoors under natural sunlight. This article provides a sustainable strategy for collecting freshwater from the atmosphere.

         <title>Orderly Nanodendritic Nickel Substitute for Raney Nickel Catalyst Improving Alkali Water Electrolyzer</title>

Orderly dendritic nickel catalyst enables more effective charge/mass transport for high current density hydrogen evolution and promises an alternative to commercial Raney nickel in alkaline water electrolyzers.








Abstract
The development of nonprecious metal catalysts to meet the activity&#8208;stability balance at industrial&#8208;grade large current densities remains a challenge toward practical alkali&#8208;water electrolysis. Here, this work develops an orderly nanodendritic nickel (ND&#8208;Ni) catalyst that consists of ultrafine nanograins in chain&#8208;like&#160;conformation, which shows both excellent activity and robust stability for large current density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, superior to currently applied Raney nickel (R&#8208;Ni) catalyst in commercial alkali&#8208;water electrolyzer (AWE). The ND&#8208;Ni catalyst featured by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnecting microporous structure endows with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity, which together afford superior charge/mass transport favorable to HER kinetics at high current densities. An actual AWE with ND&#8208;Ni catalyst demonstrates durable water splitting with 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.71&#160;V under industrial conditions and renders a record&#8208;low power consumption of 3.95&#160;kW h Nm&#8722;3 with an energy efficiency close to 90%. The hydrogen price per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) is calculated to be &#8776;$0.95, which is less than the target of $2.0 per GGE by 2026 from the U.S. Department of Energy. The results suggest the feasibility of ND&#8208;Ni substitute for R&#8208;Ni catalyst in commercial AWE.

         <title>Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Inorganics&#8211;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Robust Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable during the long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. More than 6 times longer cycles compared with routine cells are achieved in 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type cells. The onset and triggering temperatures during the thermal runaway are increased from 70.8 and 117.4 to 100.6 and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
Severe dendrite growth and high&#8208;level activity of the lithium metal anode lead to a short life span and poor safety, seriously hindering the practical applications of lithium metal batteries. With a trisalt electrolyte design, an F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8211;rich solid electrolyte interphase on a lithium anode is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable over long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. As a result, its Coulombic efficiency can be maintained over&#160;98.98% for 400 cycles. An 85.0% capacity can be retained for coin&#8208;type full cells with a 3.14 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode after 200 cycles and 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type full cells with a 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode after 72 cycles. During the thermal runaway tests of a cycled 1.0 Ah pouch cell, the onset and triggering temperatures&#160;were increased from 70.8 &#176;C&#160;and 117.4 &#176;C&#160;to 100.6 &#176;C&#160;and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively, indicating a greatly enhanced safety performance. This work gives&#160;novel insights into electrolyte and interface design, potentially paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span, and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Manipulating Electron Redistribution in Ni2P for Enhanced Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv is successfully synthesized through manipulation of electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. Bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required high current densities at low voltages for overall seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH seawater. In Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv, P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity, and Ni sites are the dominant oxygen evolution reaction active centers; meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER, synergistically improve electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting remains a persistent challenge. Herein, an approach is proposed through density functional theory (DFT) preanalysis to manipulate electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. The needle&#8208;like Fe&#8208;doped Ni2P with P vacancy (Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv) is successfully synthesized on nickel foam, exhibiting a superior bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity for seawater electrolysis in alkaline condition. As a result, bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required current densities of 1.0 and 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 at low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73&#160;V, respectively, for seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH circumstances. The theoretical calculation and the experimental results collectively reveal the reasons for the enhancement of catalyst activity. Specifically, Fe doping and P vacancies can accelerate the reconstruction of OER active species and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) for HER. In addition, the active sites of Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. The study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel&#8208;based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction
In article number 2307925, Cheng Yang and co&#8208;workers develop a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like aerogel electrode, showing dynamically adaptive bubbling capability, which can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. Such a method features potentially major advances in nanostructured electrodes for high&#8208;performance alkaline hydrolysis membrane electrodes under industrial
working conditions.

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries
Chemically replaced interfacial layer design, via unveiling the influence of zinc (Zn) crystal facets for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries, is introduced by Dong&#8208;Wan Kim and co&#8208;workers in article number 2308684. Owing to the unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side&#8208;reactions of metallic Sn) merits of the chemically replaced layer, uniform dendrite&#8208;free Zn(002)&#8208;preferred Zn deposition is guided and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions are suppressed. A superior performance even under practical operating conditions is thereby achieved.

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2305128, Qing Sun, Shang Wang, Yanhong Tian, Andreu Cabot, and co&#8208;workers report an investigation of the energy&#8208;storage mechanism of a layered Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). They demonstrate that the zinc ion is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed; in contrast, proton charge&#8208;storage dominates the process. They also demonstrate the great application prospects of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.

Zinc Anodes
In article number 2307219, Huanlei Wang, Jingyi Wu, Guihua Yu, and co&#8208;workers report Co single atoms as an electrolyte additive to facilitate dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes. The additive can be preferentially adsorbed on the zinc surface in which the atomically dispersed zincophilic active site with strong charge polarization effect regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8211;electrolyte interphase, thus promoting uniform zinc deposition.

Graphene Nanopores
In article number 2307242, Liping Guo, Luda Wang, and co&#8208;workers report functionalized graphene nanopores that exhibit distinct monovalent&#8208;ion transport behaviors including exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultralow permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene, but they also are attributed to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.

Atmospheric Water Harvesting
In article number 2306653, Wenshuai Chen, Gang Chen, Feng Jiang, and co&#8208;workers report a hierarchically structured cellulose nanofiber/lithium chloride scaffold through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying methods for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting.

         <title>Liquid Metal Actuators: A Comparative Analysis of Surface Tension Controlled Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the operation and design principles of surface tension&#8208;controlled actuation by liquid metals and discusses their performance and functionalities. Theoretical pathways toward higher performances, thanks to the unique scaling law of surface tension, are analyzed and compared to other popular soft actuators. The review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research&#160;directions.








Abstract
Liquid metals, with their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties, offer great opportunities for actuation based on surface tension modulation. Thanks to the scaling laws of surface tension, which can be electrochemically controlled at low voltages, liquid metal actuators stand out from other soft actuators for their remarkable characteristics such as high contractile strain rates and higher work densities at smaller length scales. This review summarizes the principles of liquid metal actuators and discusses their performance as well as theoretical pathways toward higher performances. The objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the ongoing development of liquid metal actuators. The design principles of the liquid metal actuators are analyzed, including low&#8208;level elemental principles (kinematics and electrochemistry), mid&#8208;level structural principles (reversibility, integrity, and scalability), and high&#8208;level functionalities. A wide range of practical use cases of liquid metal actuators from robotic locomotion and object manipulation to logic and computation is reviewed. From an energy perspective, strategies are compared for coupling the liquid metal actuators with an energy source toward fully untethered robots. The review concludes by offering a roadmap of future research directions of liquid metal actuators.

         <title>Coplanar Conformational Structure of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coplanar conformational segment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer is a unique structure with a rigid backbone, long effective conjugated length, and narrow bandgap, which may enhance emission behavior, strengthen &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and improve charge transport. This overview mainly reports the recent development of coplanar conformational structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. The characteristics, analysis methods, preparation, and their optoelectronic application are introduced and summarized systematically.








Abstract
Hierarchical structure of conjugated polymers is critical to dominating their optoelectronic properties and applications. Compared to nonplanar conformational segments, coplanar conformational segments of conjugated polymers (CPs) demonstrate favorable properties for applications as a semiconductor. Herein, recent developments in the coplanar conformational structure of CPs for optoelectronic devices are summarized. First, this review comprehensively summarizes the unique properties of planar conformational structures. Second, the characteristics of the coplanar conformation in terms of optoelectrical properties and other polymer physics characteristics are emphasized. Five primary characterization methods for investigating the complanate backbone structures are illustrated, providing a systematical toolbox for studying this specific conformation. Third, internal and external conditions for inducing the coplanar conformational structure are presented, offering guidelines for designing this conformation. Fourth, the optoelectronic applications of this segment, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are briefly summarized. Finally, a conclusion and outlook for the coplanar conformational segment regarding molecular design and applications are provided.

         <title>3D Motion Manipulation for Micro&#8208; and Nanomachines: Progress and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the latest progress made in micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion capabilities by different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms and their corresponding applications, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for guiding the future design direction in controllable 3D motile MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.








Abstract
In the past decade, micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) have made outstanding achievements in the fields of targeted drug delivery, tumor therapy, microsurgery, biological detection, and environmental monitoring and remediation. Researchers have made significant efforts to accelerate the rapid development of MNMs capable of moving through fluids by means of different energy sources (chemical reactions, ultrasound, light, electricity, magnetism, heat, or their combinations). However, the motion of MNMs is primarily investigated in confined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) horizontal setups. Furthermore, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion control remains challenging, especially for vertical movement and control, significantly limiting its potential applications in cargo transportation, environmental remediation, and biotherapy. Hence, an urgent need is to develop MNMs that can overcome self&#8208;gravity and controllably move in 3D spaces. This review delves into the latest progress made in MNMs with 3D motion capabilities under different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for controllable 3D motion in MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.

         <title>Bistable Spin&#8208;Crossover Nanoparticles for Molecular Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover materials showing bistability are very attractive for fabricating molecular electronic devices. Departing from chemical design, this paper reports on how the miniaturization as nanoparticles and their integration into various architectures, in particular combining them with two&#8208;dimensional materials,&#160;provides a suitable approach to prepare robust and resilient devices for electrically sensing spin transitions.








Abstract
The field of spin&#8208;crossover complexes is rapidly evolving from the study of the spin transition phenomenon to its exploitation in molecular electronics. Such spin transition is gradual in a single&#8208;molecule, while in bulk it can be abrupt, showing sometimes thermal hysteresis and thus a memory effect. A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin&#8208;crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles (NPs). Here, the most recent advances in the chemical design of these NPs and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio are reviewed. Then, integrating spin&#8208;crossover NPs over 2D materials is focused to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.

A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin-crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles (NPs). Here, the most recent advances in the chemical design of these NPs and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio are reviewed. Then, integrating spin-crossover NPs over 2D materials is focused to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inorganic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries: Electrolyte Designing and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes various inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (such as oxide&#8208;based, NASICON&#8208;type, sulfide&#8208;based, etc.) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. Their crystal structures, and modification strategies to enhance ionic conductivity are discussed. Additionally, methods for modifying the interfaces between solid electrolytes and cathodes/anodes, and optimizing full battery performance are explored. Lastly, the future development directions of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (IASSSBs) are emerged as promising candidates to replace commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their potential advantages, such as abundant raw materials, robust safety, low price, high&#8208;energy density, favorable reliability and stability. Inorganic sodium solid electrolytes (ISSEs) are an indispensable component of IASSSBs, gaining significant attention. Herein, this review begins by discussing the fundamentals of ISSEs, including their ionic conductivity, mechanical property, chemical and electrochemical stabilities. It then presents the crystal structures of advanced ISSEs (e.g., &#946;/&#946;''&#8208;alumina, NASICON, sulfides, complex hydride and halide electrolytes) and the related issues, along with corresponding modification strategies. The review also outlines effective approaches for forming intimate interfaces between ISSEs and working electrodes. Finally, current challenges and critical perspectives for the potential developments and possible directions to improve interfacial contacts for future practical applications of ISSEs are highlighted. This comprehensive review aims to advance the understanding and development of next&#8208;generation rechargeable IASSSBs.

         <title>Leveraging Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been widely used in tumor treatment. Through modification, SPNs can encapsulate or conjugate with various types of immune modulators. This review summarizes the recent progress of SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy and highlights the synergetic effect that amplifies the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has become a promising method for cancer treatment, bringing hope to advanced cancer patients. However, immune&#8208;related adverse events caused by immunotherapy also bring heavy burden to patients. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an emerging nanomaterial with high biocompatibility, can eliminate tumors and induce tumor immunogenic cell death through different therapeutic modalities, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and sonodynamic therapy. In addition, SPNs can work as a functional nanocarrier to synergize with a variety of immunomodulators to amplify anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In this review, SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy is comprehensively summarized according to the SPNs&#8217; therapeutic modalities and the type of loaded immunomodulators. The in&#8208;depth understanding of existing SPNs&#8208;based therapeutic modalities will hopefully inspire the design of more novel nanomaterials with potent anti&#8208;tumor immune effects, and ultimately promote their clinical translation.

         <title>Wearable and Implantable Cortisol&#8208;Sensing Electronics for Stress Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable and implantable device can be placed on the body to continuously monitor the status of the subject. Cortisol, a hormone released in response to stress, varies in concentration among individuals and its fluctuations are not consistent. In this review, recent research that utilizes continuous measurements to analyze the dynamic stress response is examined.








Abstract
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released from the body in response to stress. Although a moderate level of cortisol secretion can help the body maintain homeostasis, excessive secretion can cause various diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Conventional methods for cortisol measurement undergo procedures that limit continuous monitoring, typically collecting samples of bodily fluids, followed by separate analysis in a laboratory setting that takes several hours. Thus, recent studies demonstrate wearable, miniaturized sensors integrated with electronic modules that enable wireless real&#8208;time analysis. Here, the primary focus is on wearable and implantable electronic devices that continuously measure cortisol concentration. Diverse types of cortisol&#8208;sensing techniques, such as antibody&#8208;, DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;, and molecularly imprinted polymer&#8208;based sensors, as well as wearable and implantable devices that aim to continuously monitor cortisol in a minimally invasive fashion are discussed. In addition to the cortisol monitors that directly measure stress levels, other schemes that indirectly measure stress, such as electrophysiological signals and sweat are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in stress monitoring and management electronics are reviewed.

         <title>Material Breakthroughs in Smart Food Monitoring: Intelligent Packaging and On&#8208;Site Testing Technologies for Spoilage and Contamination Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper comprehensively reviews material breakthroughs in in situ and on&#8208;site food monitoring. Base material substrates are discussed, both with regards to their intrinsic material properties and their contributions within recently reported sensing platforms. Biogenic amine, pH, and pathogen monitoring are all examined. Finally, a situational assessment and anticipated future directions are outlined.








Abstract
Despite extensive commercial and regulatory interventions, food spoilage and contamination continue to impose massive ramifications on human health and the global economy. Recognizing that such issues will be significantly eliminated by the accurate and timely monitoring of food quality markers, smart food sensors have garnered significant interest as platforms for both real&#8208;time, in&#8208;package food monitoring and on&#8208;site commercial testing. In both cases, the sensitivity, stability, and efficiency of the developed sensors are largely informed by underlying material design, driving focus toward the creation of advanced materials optimized for such applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of emerging intelligent materials and sensors developed in this space is provided, through the lens of three key food quality markers &#8211; biogenic amines, pH, and pathogenic microbes. Each sensing platform is presented with targeted consideration toward the contributions of the underlying metallic or polymeric substrate to the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Further, the real&#8208;world applicability of presented works is considered with respect to their capabilities, regulatory adherence, and commercial potential. Finally, a situational assessment of the current state of intelligent food monitoring technologies is provided, discussing material&#8208;centric strategies to address their existing limitations, regulatory concerns, and commercial considerations.

         <title>Review of Carbon Support Coordination Environments for Single Metal Atom Electrocatalysts (SACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon support single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are widely investigated in numerous electrocatalytic systems due to their high selectivity and activity from size effects and unique metal&#8208;support interactions. This review summarizes the recent progress on carbon&#8208;supported SACs in key electrocatalytic systems from the perspective of their coordination environment regulations that greatly affect the electrocatalytic activity and electrocatalytic selectivity.








Abstract
This topical review focuses on the distinct role of carbon support coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalysis. The article begins with an overview of atomic coordination configurations in SACs, including a discussion of the advanced characterization techniques and simulation used for understanding the active sites. A summary of key electrocatalysis applications is then provided. These processes are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The review then shifts to modulation of the metal atom&#8208;carbon coordination environments, focusing on nitrogen and other non&#8208;metal coordination through modulation at the first coordination shell and modulation in the second and higher coordination shells. Representative case studies are provided, starting with the classic four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#63743;N4) based SACs. Bimetallic coordination models including homo&#8208;paired and hetero&#8208;paired active sites are also discussed, being categorized as emerging approaches. The theme of the discussions is the correlation between synthesis methods for selective doping, the carbon structure&#8211;electron configuration changes associated with the doping, the analytical techniques used to ascertain these changes, and the resultant electrocatalysis performance. Critical unanswered questions as well as promising underexplored research directions are identified.

These processes are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). The review then shifts to modulation of the metal atom-carbon coordination environments, focusing on nitrogen and other non-metal coordination through modulation at the first coordination shell and modulation in the second and higher coordination shells. Representative case studies are provided, starting with the classic four-nitrogen-coordinated single metal atom (M&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) based SACs. Bimetallic coordination models including homo-paired and hetero-paired active sites are also discussed, being categorized as emerging approaches. The theme of the discussions is the correlation between synthesis methods for selective doping, the carbon structure&#8211;electron configuration changes associated with the doping, the analytical techniques used to ascertain these changes, and the resultant electrocatalysis performance. Critical unanswered questions as well as promising underexplored research directions are identified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregation Strategy toward Potentiated NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging of Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphatically concentrates on the detailed summary of strategic design and comprehensive overview of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregated scaffolds for perfecting and extending the NIR&#8208;II imaging window. By overviewing the nowadays research advances, this review paves the way for constructing bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregated emitters to promote bioimaging applications.








Abstract
Molecular fluorophores emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) window with strong optical harvesting and high quantum yields hold great potential for in vivo deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution biosensing. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are harnessed to engineer long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters and show unique superiority in tumor detection, vessel mapping, surgical navigation, and phototheranostics due to their bathochromic&#8208;shifted optical bands in the required slip&#8208;stacked arrangement aggregation state. However, despite the preliminary progress of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates and theoretical study of structure&#8208;property relationships, further paradigms of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates remain scarce due to the lack of study on aggregated fluorophores with slip&#8208;stacked fashion. In this effort, how to utilize the specific molecular structure to form slip&#8208;stacked packing motifs with J&#8208;type aggregated exciton coupling is emphatically elucidated. First, several molecular regulating strategies to achieve NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates containing intermolecular interactions and external conditions are positively summarized and deeply analyzed. Then, the recent reports on J&#8208;aggregates for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and theranostics are systematically summarized to provide a clear reference and direction for promoting the development of NIR&#8208;II organic fluorophores. Eventually, the prospective efforts on ameliorating and promoting NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to further clinical practices are outlined.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Liquid&#8208;Phase Molecular Separations: State of the Field, Common Pitfalls, and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation molecular sieves due to their uniform, tunable pores, but inconsistent characterization practices are currently leading this subfield astray. This review identifies common characterization pitfalls in existing 2D COF membrane literature and establishes rigorous protocols for assigning membrane structures and molecular transport mechanisms to direct the field toward achieving its long&#8208;term promise.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are attractive candidates for next&#8208;generation membranes due to their robust linkages and uniform, tunable pores. Many publications have claimed to achieve selective molecular transport through COF pores, but reported performance metrics for similar networks vary dramatically, and in several cases the reported experiments are inadequate to support such conclusions. These issues require a reevaluation of the literature. Published examples of 2D COF membranes for liquid&#8208;phase separations can be broadly divided into two categories, each with common performance characteristics: polycrystalline COF films (most &gt;1&#160;&#181;m thick) and weakly crystalline or amorphous films (most &lt;500&#160;nm thick). Neither category has demonstrated consistent relationships between the designed COF pore structure and separation performance, suggesting that these imperfect materials do not sieve molecules through uniform pores. In this perspective, rigorous practices for evaluating COF membrane structures and separation performance are described, which will facilitate their development toward molecularly precise membranes capable of performing previously unrealized chemical separations. In the absence of this more rigorous standard of proof, reports of COF&#8208;based membranes should be treated with skepticism. As methods to control 2D polymerization improve, precise 2D polymer membranes may exhibit exquisite and energy efficient performance relevant for contemporary separation challenges.

         <title>3D Printed Architectured Silicones with Autonomic Self&#8208;Healing and Creep&#8208;Resistant Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing silicones that are able to restore the functionalities and extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications. However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self&#8208;heal or suffer from creep&#8208;induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, we design and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and architecture levels to achieve self&#8208;healing at room temperature while simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self&#8208;healing vitrimers, whereas conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep&#8208;resistant elastomers. When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale, layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks. A patient&#8208;specific vascular phantom is printed to demonstrate the potential of architectured silicones in creating damage&#8208;resilient functional devices using molecularly designed elastomer materials.

         <title>Exploiting the Mechanical Bond Effect for Enhanced Molecular Recognition and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ubiquity of charged species in biological and industrial processes has resulted in ever&#8208;increasing interest in their selective recognition, detection and environmental remediation. Building on the established coordination chemistry principles of the chelate and macrocyclic effects, and host preorganization, supramolecular chemists seek to construct specific three&#8208;dimensional binding cavities reminiscent of biotic systems to enhance host&#8208;guest binding affinity and selectivity. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) present a wholly unique platform for synthetic host design, wherein topologies afforded by the mechanical bond enable the decoration of three&#8208;dimensional cavities for non&#8208;covalent interactions with a range of target guest geometries. Notably, MIM host systems exhibit mechanical bond effect augmented affinities and selectivities for a variety of charged guest species, compared to non&#8208;interlocked acyclic and macrocycle host analogues. Furthermore, the modular nature of MIM synthesis facilitates incorporation of optical and electrochemical reporter groups, enabling fabrication of highly sensitive and specific molecular sensors. This review discusses the development of recognition and sensing MIMs, from the first reports in the late 20th century through to the present day, delineating how their topologically preorganized and dynamic host cavities enhance charged guest recognition and sensing, demonstrating the mechanical bond effect as a potent tool in future chemosensing materials.

         <title>Revamping Triboelectric Output by Deep Trap Construction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible TENG with ultrahigh electrical output for application in IoT is developed by constructing deep traps from the incorporation of KH556. The deep traps can effectively trap triboelectric charges and reduce the rate of charge dissipation, resulting in a 1300% enhancement in output power density.








Abstract
High output performance is critical for building triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for future multifunctional applications. Unfortunately, the high triboelectric charge dissipation rate has a significant negative&#160;impact on its electrical output performance. Herein, a new&#160;tribolayer is designed through introducing self&#8208;assembled molecules with large energy gaps on commercial PET fibric to&#160;form carrier deep traps, which improve charge retention while decreasing dissipation rates. The deep trap density of the PET increases by two orders of magnitude, resulting in an 86% reduction in the rate of charge dissipation and a significant increase in the charge density that can be accumulated on tribolayer during physical contact. The key explanation is that increasing the density of deep traps improves the dielectric's ability to store charges, making it more difficult for the triboelectric charges trapped by the tribolayer to escape from the deep traps, lowering the rate of charge dissipation. This TENG has a 1300% increase in output power density as a result of altering the deep trap density, demonstrating a significant improvement. This work describes a simple yet&#160;efficient method for building TENGs with&#160;ultra&#8208;high electrical output and promotes their practical implementation in the sphere of the Internet of Things.

Abstract
Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for 240&#160;h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6&#160;M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 500&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

         <title>Electrically Confined Electroluminescence of Neutral Excitons in WSe2 Light&#8208;emitting Transistors</title>

Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have drawn significant attention for their potential in optoelectronic applications due to their direct band gap and exceptional quantum yield. However, TMD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices have shown low external quantum efficiencies as imbalanced free carrier injection often leads to the formation of non&#8208;radiative charged excitons, limiting practical applications. Here, we demonstrate electrically confined electroluminescence (EL) of neutral excitons in WSe2 light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) based on the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. The WSe2 channel is locally doped to simultaneously inject electrons and holes to the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) region by a local graphene gate. At balanced concentrations of injected electrons and holes, the WSe2 LETs exhibited strong EL with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8764;8.2% at room temperature. Our experimental and theoretical results consistently show that the enhanced EQE could be attributed to dominant exciton emission confined at the 1D region while expelling charged excitons from the active area by precise control of external electric fields. Our work shows a promising approach to enhancing the EQE of 2D light&#8208;emitting transistors and modulating the recombination of exciton complexes for excitonic devices.

         <title>Ultraviolet Light Debondable Optically Clear Adhesives for Flexible Displays through Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Curing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;removable optically clear adhesive (OCA) is introduced, ideal for the sustainability&#8208;focused electronics industry, particularly for foldable devices requiring easy disassembly and robust, eco&#8208;friendly materials.








Abstract
With growing sustainability concerns, the need for products that facilitate easy disassembly and reuse has increased. Adhesives, initially designed for bonding, now face demands for selective removal, enabling rapid assembly&#8208;disassembly and efficient maintenance across industries. This need is particularly evident in the display industry, with the rise of foldable devices necessitating specialized adhesives. A novel optically clear adhesive (OCA) is presented for foldable display, featuring a unique UV&#8208;stimulated selective removal feature. This approach incorporates benzophenone derivatives into the polymer network, facilitating rapid debonding under UV irradiation. A key feature of this method is the adept use of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical polymerization for OCA film fabrication. This method shows remarkable compatibility with various monomers and exhibits orthogonal reactivity to benzophenone, rendering it ideal for large&#8208;scale production. The resultant OCA not only has high transparency and balanced elasticity, along with excellent resistance to repeated folding, but it also exhibits significantly reduced adhesion when exposed to UV irradiation. By merging this customized formulation with strategically integrated UV&#8208;responsive elements, an effective solution is offered that enhances manufacturing efficiency and product reliability in the rapidly evolving field of sustainable electronics and displays. This research additionally contributes to eco&#8208;friendly device fabrication, aligning with emerging technology demands.

         <title>Wearable Sensors for Breath Monitoring Based on Water&#8208;based Hexagonal Boron Nitride Inks Made with Supramolecular Functionalization</title>

Abstract
Wearable humidity sensors are attracting strong attention as they allow to continuously monitor in real time important physiological information by enabling activity tracking as well as air quality assessment. Amongst 2&#8208;Dimensional (2D) materials, Graphene Oxide (GO) is very attractive for humidity sensing due to its tuneable surface chemistry, high surface area, processability in water and easy integration onto flexible substrates. However, large hysteresis, low sensitivity and strong cross&#8208;sensitivity issues limit the use of GO in practical applications, where continuous monitoring is preferred. Herein, we demonstrate a wearable and wireless impedance&#8208;based humidity sensor made with pyrene&#8208;functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets, which shows enhanced sensitivity towards relative humidity, RH (&gt;1010 Ohms/%RH in the range from 5% to 100%RH), fast response (0.1&#160;ms), no appreciable hysteresis and cross&#8208;sensitivity in the range of 25&#8211;60&#176;C. We finally demonstrate that the h&#8208;BN based sensor is able to monitor the whole breathing cycle process of exhaling and inhaling, hence enabling to record in real time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, without requiring any direct contact with the individual.

         <title>Localization of Cancer Cells for Subsequent Robust Photodynamic Therapy by ROS Responsive Polymeric Nanoparticles With Anti&#8208;Metastasis Complexes NAMI&#8208;A</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most cancer&#8208;related deaths are caused by tumor metastasis. This study pioneers a new photodynamic therapy that can precisely target the primary tumor while capable of halting tumor metastasis, enabling the siege of highly metastatic triple&#8208;negative breast tumors and providing a promising paradigm for the treatment of highly metastatic cancers.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a new type of light&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) cancer therapy, has the advantages of high therapeutic efficiency, non&#8208;resistance, and less trauma than traditional cancer therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, oxygen&#8208;dependent PDT further exacerbates tumor metastasis. To this end, a strategy that circumvents tumor metastasis to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT is proposed. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;activated photosensitive polymer is synthesized and branched the anti&#8208;metastatic ruthenium complex NAMI&#8208;A on the side, which is further assembled to form nanoparticles (NP2) for breast cancer therapy. NP2 can kill tumor cells by generating ROS under 808&#160;nm radiation (NP2 + L), reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2/9) in cancer cells, decrease the invasive and migration capacity of cancer cells, and eliminate cancer cells. Further animal experiments show that NP2 + L can inhibit tumor growth and reduce liver and lung metastases. In addition, NP2 + L can activate the immune system in mice to avoid tumor recurrence. In conclusion, a PDT capable of both preventing tumor metastasis and precisely hitting the primary tumor to achieve effective treatment of highly metastatic cancers is developed.

Abstract
In the era of information, characterized by an exponential growth in data volume and an escalating level of data abstraction, there has been a substantial focus on brain&#8208;like chips, which are known for their robust processing power and energy&#8208;efficient operation. Memristors are widely acknowledged as the optimal electronic devices for the realization of neuromorphic computing, due to their innate ability to emulate the interconnection and information transfer processes witnessed among neurons. This review paper focuses on memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic chips, which provide an extensive description of the working principle and characteristic features of memristors, along with their applications in the realm of neuromorphic chips. Subsequently, a thorough discussion of the memristor array, which serves as the pivotal component of the neuromorphic chip, as well as an examination of the present mainstream neural networks, is delved. Furthermore, the design of the neuromorphic chip is categorized into three crucial sections, including synapse&#8208;neuron cores, networks on chip (NoC), and neural network design. Finally, the key performance metrics of the chip is highlighted, as well as the key metrics related to the memristor devices are employed to realize both the synaptic and neuronal components.

         <title>Ultrastrong and High Thermal Insulating Porous High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics up to 2000&#176;C</title>

Abstract
High mechanical load&#8208;carrying capability and thermal insulating performance are crucial to thermal&#8208;insulation materials under extreme conditions. However, these features are often difficult to achieve simultaneously in conventional porous ceramics. Here, for the first time, we report a multiscale structure design and fast fabrication of 9&#8208;cation porous high&#8208;entropy diboride ceramics via an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature synthesis technique that can lead to exceptional mechanical load&#8208;bearing capability and high thermal insulation performance. With the construction of multiscale structures involving ultrafine pores at the microscale, high&#8208;quality interfaces between building blocks at the nanoscale, and severe lattice distortion at the atomic scale, our materials with a &#8764;50% porosity exhibit an ultrahigh compressive strength of up to &#8764;337&#160;MPa at room temperature and a thermal conductivity as low as &#8764;0.76&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. More importantly, they demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, with merely &#8764;2.4% volume shrinkage after 2000&#176;C annealing. They also show an ultrahigh compressive strength of &#8764;690&#160;MPa up to 2000&#176;C, displaying a ductile compressive behavior. The excellent mechanical and thermal insulating properties offer an attractive material for reliable thermal insulation under extreme conditions.

         <title>Angular Engineering Strategy for Enhanced Surface Nonlinear Frequency Conversion in Centrosymmetric Topological Semimetal HfGe0.92Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Surface nonlinear optics are essential for developments in integrated photonics and micro/nano optoelectronics. However, the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency on a surface is restricted by the finite nonlinear susceptibility of matter and the intrinsic atomic&#8208;layered interaction length between light and matter. In this work, based on an angular engineering strategy, we demonstrated that the centrosymmetric topological semimetal HfGe0.92Te crystal has a giant and anisotropic surface second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility up to 5535&#177;308&#160;pm&#183;V&#8722;1 and exhibits efficient and unprecedented second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). The maximum optical conversion efficiency was found to be up to 3.75&#8240;, which is 104 times higher than that obtained from a silicon surface. Because of the linear dispersion over a wide range of energies around the Dirac points, this high conversion efficiency can be maintained with SHG wavelengths ranging from the visible region (779&#160;nm) to the deep&#8208;ultraviolet region (257.5&#160;nm). Our study can facilitate the development of topological photonics and integrated nonlinear photonics based on topological semimetals.

         <title>An Nir&#8208;Ii Excitable Aie Small Molecule with Multimodal Phototheranostic Features for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics, referring to a single component simultaneously exhibiting multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities, has attracted significant attention due to its excellent performance in cancer treatment. Benefitting from the superiority in balancing the diverse competing energy dissipation pathways, aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have been proven to be ideal templates for constructing one&#8208;for&#8208;all multimodal phototheranostic agents. However, to our knowledge, the all&#8208;round AIEgens that can be triggered by a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) light have not been reported. Given the deep tissue penetration and high maximum permissible exposure of the NIR&#8208;II excitation light, herein, we reported for the first time an NIR&#8208;II laser excitable AIE small molecule (named BETT&#8208;2) with multimodal phototheranostic features by taking full use of the advantage of AIEgens in single molecule&#8208;facilitated versatility as well as synchronously maximizing the molecular donor&#8208;acceptor strength and conformational distortion. As formulated into nanoparticles (NPs), the high performance of BETT&#8208;2 NPs in NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic&#8208;photothermal synergistic therapy of orthotopic mouse breast tumors was fully demonstrated by the systematic in vitro and in vivo evaluations. This work offers valuable insights for developing NIR&#8208;II laser activatable one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostic systems.

         <title>Perspectives on the Novel Multifunctional Nerve Guidance Conduits: From Specific Regenerative Procedures to Motor Function Rebuilding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review highlights the contribution of multifunctional nerve guidance conduits (NGC) and influence of their microscale biomaterial architecture on the nerve repairment. Chemical molecule induction, heterogeneous topographical morphology, anisotropic assembly microstructure, electroactivity and magnetic&#8208;sensitivity are expected to be pioneering features in the effective NGCs. The biosafety assessment and clinical trials of multifunctional NGCs are urgently required before the commercial application.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury potentially destroys the quality of life by inducing functional movement disorders and sensory capacity loss, which results in severe disability and substantial psychological, social, and financial burdens. Autologous nerve grafting has been commonly used as treatment in the clinic; however, its rare donor availability limits its application. A series of artificial nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) with advanced architectures are also proposed to promote injured peripheral nerve regeneration, which is a complicated process from axon sprouting to targeted muscle reinnervation. Therefore, exploring the interactions between sophisticated NGC complexes and versatile cells during each process including axon sprouting, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, nerve myelination, and muscle reinnervation is necessary. This review highlights the contribution of functional NGCs and the influence of microscale biomaterial architecture on biological processes of nerve repair. Progressive NGCs with chemical molecule induction, heterogenous topographical morphology, electroactive, anisotropic assembly microstructure, and self&#8208;powered electroactive and magnetic&#8208;sensitive NGCs are also collected, and they are expected to be pioneering features in future multifunctional and effective NGCs.

         <title>Multiscale Bioresponses of Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) are well&#8208;recognized as novel nano&#8208;agents for addressing deficiency in nanomedicine, whose biology&#8208;related fundamentals and recent advances are summarized in this review with emphasis on their multiscale bioresponses from the molecular, cellular, to organismal levels, allowing a clear and comprehensive understanding to meet the design requirements toward the highly efficient nanomedical modalities.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) are well&#8208;recognized novel nano&#8208;agents that hold great promise for applications in nanomedicine because of their ultrafine size, low toxicity, and high renal clearance. As foreign substances, however, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the bioresponses to metal NCs is necessary but is still far from being realized. Herein, this review is deployed to summarize the biofates of metal NCs at various biological levels, emphasizing their multiscale bioresponses at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. In the parts&#8208;to&#8208;whole schema, the interactions between biomolecules and metal NCs are discussed, presenting typical protein&#8208;dictated nano&#8211;bio interfaces, hierarchical structures, and in vivo trajectories. Then, the accumulation, internalization, and metabolic evolution of metal NCs in the cellular environment and as&#8208;imparted theranostic functionalization are demonstrated. The organismal metabolism and transportation processes of the metal NCs are subsequently distilled. Finally, this review ends with the conclusions and perspectives on the outstanding issues of metal NC&#8208;mediated bioresponses in the near future. This review is expected to provide inspiration for tailoring the customization of metal NC&#8208;based nano&#8208;agents to meet practical requirements in different sectors of nanomedicine.

&lt;p&gt;Metal nanoclusters (NCs) are well-recognized as novel nano-agents for addressing deficiency in nanomedicine, whose biology-related fundamentals and recent advances are summarized in this review with emphasis on their multiscale bioresponses from the molecular, cellular, to organismal levels, allowing a clear and comprehensive understanding to meet the design requirements toward the highly efficient nanomedical modalities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal nanoclusters (NCs) are well-recognized novel nano-agents that hold great promise for applications in nanomedicine because of their ultrafine size, low toxicity, and high renal clearance. As foreign substances, however, an in-depth understanding of the bioresponses to metal NCs is necessary but is still far from being realized. Herein, this review is deployed to summarize the biofates of metal NCs at various biological levels, emphasizing their multiscale bioresponses at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. In the parts-to-whole schema, the interactions between biomolecules and metal NCs are discussed, presenting typical protein-dictated nano&#8211;bio interfaces, hierarchical structures, and in vivo trajectories. Then, the accumulation, internalization, and metabolic evolution of metal NCs in the cellular environment and as-imparted theranostic functionalization are demonstrated. The organismal metabolism and transportation processes of the metal NCs are subsequently distilled. Finally, this review ends with the conclusions and perspectives on the outstanding issues of metal NC-mediated bioresponses in the near future. This review is expected to provide inspiration for tailoring the customization of metal NC-based nano-agents to meet practical requirements in different sectors of nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terahertz Conductivity of Free&#8208;Standing 3D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Fabricated via Triple&#8208;Layer&#8208;Dual Interfacial Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a unique triple&#8208;layer&#8208;dual interfacial (TLDI) approach for the simultaneous synthesis of two 3D covalent organic framework membranes (3D COFMs) is developed. Besides, the optical conductivity of these free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is analyzed using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in transmission mode. Interestingly, these membranes show excellent transmittance at THz frequencies with high intrinsic THz conductivities.








Abstract
Processable covalent organic framework membranes (COFM) are emerging as potential semiconducting materials for device applications. Nevertheless, the fabrication of crystalline and free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is challenging. In this work, a unique time and solvent&#8208;efficient triple&#8208;layer&#8208;dual interfacial (TLDI) approach for the simultaneous synthesis of two 3D COFMs from a single system is developed. Besides, for the first time, the optical conductivity of these free&#8208;standing 3D COFMs is analyzed using terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in transmission mode. Interestingly, these membranes show excellent transmittance at THz frequencies with very high intrinsic THz conductivities. The evaluated scattering time and plasma frequency of the free carriers of the COFMs are highly promising for future applications in optoelectronic devices in THz frequencies.

Porifera&#8208;inspired lightweight, thin, wrinkle&#8208;resistant, and multifunctional MXene foam. Schematic illustration of the fabrication, structure, multifunction, and potential application of porifera&#8208;inspired MXene foam.








Abstract
Transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) demonstrate a massive potential in constructing lightweight, multifunctional wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields for application in various fields. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to develop a facile, scalable approach to prepare the MXene&#8208;based macrostructures characterized by low density, low thickness, high mechanical flexibility, and high EMI SE at the same time. Herein, the ultrathin MXene/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ag foams with a porifera&#8208;inspired hierarchically porous microstructure are prepared by combining Zn2+ diffusion induction and hard template methods. The hierarchical porosity, which includes a mesoporous skeleton and a microporous MXene network within the skeleton, not only exerts a regulatory effect on stress distribution during compression, making the foams rubber&#8208;like resistant to wrinkling but also provides more channels for multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves. Due to the interaction between Ag nanosheets, MXene/rGO, and porous structure, it is possible to produce an outstanding EMI shielding performance with the specific surface shielding effectiveness reaching 109152.4&#160;dB&#160;cm2&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the foams exhibit multifunctionalities, such as transverse Joule heating, longitudinal heat insulation, self&#8208;cleaning, fire resistance, and motion detection. These discoveries open up a novel pathway for the development of lightweight MXene&#8208;based materials with considerable application potential in wearable electromagnetic anti&#8208;interference devices.

         <title>Mechanochemically Reprogrammed Interface Orchestrates Neutrophil Bactericidal Activity and Apoptosis for Preventing Implant&#8208;Associated Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implant surface with phytic acid&#8211;Zn2+ coordinated nanopillars and oxygen self&#8208;supporting nanoparticles, named as CPZTs, is mechanochemically reprogrammed. CPZTs prevent implant&#8208;associated infection by repelling bacterial adhesion, killing attached bacteria, and facilitating neutrophil bactericidal activity. Meanwhile, self&#8208;supporting oxygen allows neutrophils to orchestrate intracellular bactericidal activity and apoptosis under hypoxia, contributing to inflammation resolution.








Abstract
The onset of implant&#8208;associated infection (IAI) triggers a cascade of immune responses, which are initially dominated by neutrophils. Bacterial aggregate formation and hypoxic microenvironment, which occur shortly after implantation, may be two major risk factors that impair neutrophil function and lead to IAI. Here, the implant surface with phytic acid&#8211;Zn2+ coordinated TiO2 nanopillar arrays (PA&#8211;Zn@TiNPs) and oxygen self&#8208;supporting CaO2 nanoparticles, named as CPZTs, is mechanochemically reprogrammed. The engineered CPZTs interface integrates multiple properties to inhibit the formation of nascent biofilm, encompassing antibacterial adhesion, mechanobactericidal effect, and chemobiocidal effect. Meanwhile, continuous oxygenation fuels the neutrophils with reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient bacterial elimination on the implant surface and inside the neutrophils. Furthermore, this surface modulation strategy accelerates neutrophil apoptosis and promotes M2 macrophage&#8208;mediated osteogenesis both in vitro and in a rat model of IAI. In conclusion, targeting neutrophils for immunomodulation is a practical and effective strategy to prevent IAI and promote bone&#8211;implant integration.

         <title>Ordered Mesoporous Crystalline Frameworks Toward Promising Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ordered mesoporous crystalline frameworks (MCFs), which possess both functional frameworks and well&#8208;defined porosity, have been receiving considerable attention because of their unique properties including high surface areas, large pore sizes, tailored porous structures and compositions. Construction of novel crystalline mesoporous architectures that allows for rich accessible active sites and efficient mass transfer is envisaged to offer ample opportunities for potential energy&#8208;related applications. In this review, the rational synthesis, unique structures, and energy applications of MCFs are the main focus. After summarizing the synthetic approaches, an emphasis is placed on the delicate control of crystallites, mesophases, nano&#8208;architectures by concluding basic principles and showing representative examples. Afterwards, the currently fabricated components of MCFs such as metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal&#8208;organic frameworks are described in sequence. Furthermore, typical applications of MCFs in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis are highlighted. This review ends with the possible development and synthetic challenges of MCFs as well as a future prospect for high&#8208;efficiency energy applications, which underscores a pathway for developing advanced materials.

         <title>Additively Manufactured Flexible Liquid Metal&#8211;Coated Self&#8208;Powered Magnetoelectric Sensors with High Design Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible magnetoelectric sensors with high design freedom are fabricated through selective laser sintering and the subsequent liquid metal 3D transfer printing process. Liquid metal forms a conductive network to serve as the conductive part of the magnetoelectric sensor that has the capability of mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion. The induced voltage can be generated through compression, stretching, bending, and torsion.








Abstract
Although additive manufacturing enables controllable structural design and customized performance for magnetoelectric sensors, their design and fabrication still require careful matching of the size and modulus between the magnetic and conductive components. Achieving magnetoelectric integration remains challenging, and the rigid coils limit the flexibility of the sensors. To overcome these obstacles, this study proposes a composite process combining selective laser sintering (SLS) and 3D transfer printing for fabricating flexible liquid metal&#8208;coated magnetoelectric sensors. The liquid metal forms a conformal conductive network on the SLS&#8208;printed magnetic lattice structure. Deformation of the structure alters the magnetic flux passing through it, thereby generating voltage. A reverse model segmentation and summation method is established to calculate the theoretical magnetic flux. The impact of the volume fraction, unit size, and height of the sensors on the voltage is studied, and optimization of these factors yields a maximum voltage of 45.6 &#181;V. The sensor has excellent sensing performance with a sensitivity of 10.9&#160;kPa&#8722;1 and a minimum detection pressure of 0.1&#160;kPa. The voltage can be generated through various external forces. This work presents a significant advancement in fabricating liquid metal&#8208;based magnetoelectric sensors by improving their structural flexibility, magnetoelectric integration, and design freedom.

The impact of the volume fraction, unit size, and height of the sensors on the voltage is studied, and optimization of these factors yields a maximum voltage of 45.6 &#181;V. The sensor has excellent sensing performance with a sensitivity of 10.9&#160;kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a minimum detection pressure of 0.1&#160;kPa. The voltage can be generated through various external forces. This work presents a significant advancement in fabricating liquid metal-based magnetoelectric sensors by improving their structural flexibility, magnetoelectric integration, and design freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sr&#8208;Stabilized IrMnO2 Solid Solution Nano&#8208;Electrocatalysts with Superior Activity and Excellent Durability for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sr&#8208;doped solid solution structural ultrafine IrMnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on the CNTs (Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs) are efficient and durable catalysts for the acidic OER. The solid solution structure promotes the s electronic coupling between Ir and Mn, improving their OER activity, while the Sr doping enhances the stability of Sr&#8208;IrMnO2, improving the durability of the Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs.








Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is of paramount importance. This work reports that Sr&#8208;doped solid solution structural ultrafine IrMnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) (&#8776;1.56&#160;nm) on the carbon nanotubes&#160;(Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs) are efficient catalysts for the acidic OER. Even with the Ir use dosage 3.5 times lower than that of the commercial IrO2, the Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs only need an overpotential of 236.0&#160;mV to drive 10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and show outstanding stability for &gt;400.0 h. Its Ir mass activity is 39.6 times higher than that of the IrO2 at 1.53&#160;V. The solid solution and Sr&#8208;doping structure of Sr&#8208;IrMnO2 are the main origin of the high catalytic activity and excellent stability of the Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs. The density function theory calculations indicate that the solid solution structure can promote strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn, lowering the energy barrier of the OER rate&#8208;determining step. The Sr&#8208;doping can enhance the stability of Ir against the chemical corrosion and demetallation. Water electrolyzers and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers assembled with the Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs show superb performance and excellent durability in the acid media.

         <title>Soybean Oil&#8208;Derived Lipids for Efficient mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved soybean oil, new soybean oil&#8208;derived lipids are facilely synthesized for efficient mRNA delivery. These lipids demonstrate excellent performance in delivering Cre mRNA for gene editing applications, highlighting their potential for diverse biomedical applications, especially those requiring efficient mRNA delivery and organ&#8208;specific targeting.








Abstract
The rapid progress in the development of COVID&#8208;19 mRNA vaccines during the initial year of the pandemic has highlighted the significance of lipid nanoparticles in therapeutic delivery. Various lipid types have been investigated for the effective delivery of mRNA, each with unique functions and versatile applications. These range from their use in cancer immunotherapy and gene editing to their role in developing vaccines against infectious diseases. Nonetheless, continued exploration of novel lipids and synthetic approaches is necessary to further advance the understanding and expand the techniques for optimizing mRNA delivery. In this work, new lipids derived from FDA&#8208;approved soybean oil are facilely synthesized and these are employed for efficient mRNA delivery. EGFP and Fluc mRNA are used to evaluate the delivery efficacy of the lipid formulations both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, organ&#8208;specific targeting capabilities are observed in certain formulations, and their outstanding performance is demonstrated in delivering Cre mRNA for gene editing. These results showcase the potential of soybean oil&#8208;derived lipids in mRNA delivery, offering utility across a broad spectrum of bioapplications.

         <title>Way to a Library of Ti&#8208;Series Oxide Nanofiber Sponges that are Highly Stretchable, Compressible, and Bendable</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Ti&#8208;series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability are synthesized, which hold extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices.








Abstract
Ti&#8208;series oxide ceramics in the form of aerogels, such as TiO2, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and CaCu3Ti4O12, hold tremendous potential as functional materials owing to their excellent optical, dielectric, and catalytic properties. Unfortunately, these inorganic aerogels are usually brittle and prone to pulverization owing to weak inter&#8208;particulate interactions, resulting in restricted application performance and serious health risks. Herein, a novel strategy is reported to synthesize an elastic form of an aerogel&#8208;like, highly porous structure, in which activity&#8208;switchable Ti&#8208;series oxide sols transform from the metastable state to the active state during electrospinning, resulting in condensation and solidification at the whipping stage to obtain curled nanofibers. These curled nanofibers are further entangled when flying in the air to form a physically interlocked, elastic network mimicking the microstructure of high&#8208;elasticity hydrogels. This strategy provides a library of Ti&#8208;series oxide nanofiber sponges with unprecedented stretchability, compressibility, and bendability, possessing extensive opportunities for greener, safer, and broader applications as integrated or wearable functional devices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a new, elastic form of TiO2, composed of both &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; TiO2 nanofiber sponges, is constructed as spontaneous air&#8208;conditioning textiles in smart clothing, buildings, and vehicles, with unique bidirectional regulation of radiative cooling in summer and solar heating in winter.

         <title>Piezoelectric Interlayer Enabling a Rechargeable Quasisolid&#8208;State Sodium Battery at 0&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric interlayer design between an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte and sodium metal is demonstrated to solve the interfacial issues against low&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. A piezoelectric ZnO layer proves a favorable interlayer with matched modulus, high Na&#8208;adhesion, sufficient piezoelectricity to thoroughly reduce the interfacial resistance and promote a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na2MnFe(CN)6&#8208;based full cell operating at a harsh condition of 0 &#176;C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium (Na) batteries (SSNBs) hold great promise but suffer from several major issues, such as high interfacial resistance at the solid electrolyte/electrode interface and Na metal dendrite growth. To address these issues, a piezoelectric interlayer design for an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) solid electrolyte is proposed herein. Two typical piezoelectric films, AlN and ZnO, coated onto NZSP function as interlayers designed to generate a local stress&#8208;induced field for alleviating interfacial charge aggregation coupling stress concentration and promoting uniform Na plating. The results reveal that the interlayer (ZnO) with matched modulus, high Na&#8208;adhesion, and sufficient piezoelectricity can provide a favorable interphase. Low interfacial resistances of 91 and 239 &#937; cm2 are achieved for the ZnO layer at 30 and 0&#160;&#176;C, respectively, which are notably lower than those for bare NZSP. Moreover, steady Na plating/stripping cycles are rendered over 850 and 4900&#160;h at 0 and 30&#160;&#176;C, respectively. The superior anodic performance is further manifested in an Na2MnFe(CN)6&#8208;based full cell which delivers discharge capacities of 125&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 over 1600 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C and 90&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 0&#160;&#176;C. A new interlayer&#8208;design insight is clearly demonstrated for SSNBs breaking low&#8208;temperature limits.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discovers how RNA and 
mAbs&#160;are shaping the future of personalized cancer nanomedicine. This also dives into the current landscape and nanotechnology's battle with protein corona phenomena, explores strategies for enhanced tumor access and penetration, and confronts the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must conquer to reach intracellular domains. Perspectives on the remaining challenges and potential prospects are discussed.








Abstract
The success of personalized medicine in oncology relies on using highly effective and precise therapeutic modalities such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Unfortunately, the clinical exploitation of these biological drugs has encountered obstacles in overcoming intricate biological barriers. Drug delivery technologies represent a plausible strategy to overcome such barriers, ultimately facilitating the access to intracellular domains. Here, an overview of the current landscape on how nanotechnology has dealt with protein corona phenomena as a first and determinant biological barrier is presented. This continues with the analysis of strategies facilitating access to the tumor, along with conceivable methods for enhanced tumor penetration. As a final step, the cellular barriers that nanocarriers must confront in order for their biological cargo to reach their target are deeply analyzed. This review concludes with a critical analysis and future perspectives of the translational advances in personalized oncological nanomedicine.

         <title>Efficient Thermo&#8208;Spin Conversion in van der Waals Ferromagnet FeGaTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative thermo&#8208;spin conversion has been found in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe. The unique thermoelectric property, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in opposite directions under a temperature gradient, produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature. The maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient is found to reach 440 nV&#160;K&#8722;1 with a notable Nernst angle over 60%. 








Abstract
Recent discovery of 2D van der Waals magnetic materials has spurred progress in developing advanced spintronic devices. A central challenge lies in enhancing the spin&#8208;conversion efficiency for building spin&#8208;logic or spin&#8208;memory devices. Here, the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects are systematically investigated to uncover significant spin&#8208;conversion effects in above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet FeGaTe with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The anomalous Hall effect demonstrates an efficient electric spin&#8208;charge conversion with a notable spin Hall angle of over 6%. In addition, the anomalous Nernst effect produces a significant transverse voltage at room temperature without a magnetic field, displaying unique temperature dependence with a maximum transverse Seebeck coefficient of 440 nV&#160;K&#8722;1 and a Nernst angle of &#8776;62%. Such an innovative thermoelectric signal arises from the efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion effect, where the up&#8208;spin and down&#8208;spin electrons move in opposite directions under a temperature gradient. The present study highlights the potential of FeGaTe to enhance thermoelectric devices through efficient thermo&#8208;spin conversion without the need for a magnetic&#160;field.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Electrocatalytic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free pathway for synthesizing metal&#8208;containing porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks (MPOR&#8208;COFs) is presented. The roles of synthetic conditions and the transition metals chelating with porphyrin are highlighted through both experimental and computational works. This study sets forth a unique approach to the synthesis and integration of electrocatalysts into electrode architectures, propelling applications into the cutting&#8208;edge realm.








Abstract
The inability to process many covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as thin films plagues their widespread utilization. Herein, a vapor&#8208;phase pathway for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a class of porphyrin&#8208;based COFs is presented. This approach allows integrating electrocatalysts made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;containing COFs into the electrodes&#8217; architectures in a single&#8208;step synthesis and deposition. By precisely controlling the metal sites at the atomic level, remarkable electrocatalytic performance is achieved, resulting in unprecedentedly high mass activity values. How the choice of metal atoms, i.e., cobalt and copper, can determine the catalytic activities of POR&#8208;COFs is demonstrated. The theoretical data proves that the Cu site is highly active for nitrate conversion to ammonia on the synthesized COFs.

         <title>Satellite&#8208;Based On&#8208;Orbit Printing of 3D Tumor Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Satellite&#8208;based space 3D bioprinting holds significant potential for space biology research and has yet to be demonstrated. This study achieved on&#8208;orbit printing, in situ culture, and automated fluorescence imaging of 3D tumor models and revealed that 3D tumor models are more sensitive to antitumor drugs in space than on Earth, offering new possibilities for future tumor treatments.








Abstract
Space three dimension (3D&#65289; bioprinting provides a precise and bionic tumor model for evaluating the compound effect of the space environment on tumors, thereby providing insight into the progress of the disease and potential treatments. However, space 3D bioprinting faces several challenges, including prelaunch uncertainty, possible liquid leakage, long&#8208;term culture in space, automatic equipment control, data acquisition, and transmission. Here, a novel satellite&#8208;based 3D bioprinting device with high structural strength, small volume, and low weight (&lt;6&#160;kg) is developed. A microgel&#8208;based biphasic thermosensitive bioink and suspension medium that supports the on&#8208;orbit printing and in situ culture of complex tumor models is developed. An intelligent control algorithm that enables the automatic control of 3D printing, autofocusing, fluorescence imaging, and data transfer back to the ground is developed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that on&#8208;orbit printing of tumor models is achieved in space with stable morphology and moderate viability via a satellite. It is found that 3D tumor models are more sensitive to antitumor drugs in space than on Earth. This study opens up a new avenue for 3D bioprinting in space and offers new possibilities for future research in space life science and medicine.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Polymer Electrolyte Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The composite membrane with an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and PFPE rubber is fabricated by PFPE precursor diffusion into electrolyte membrane backbone and curing process. The membrane increases the fatigue threshold by a factor of 2.5 compared to Nafion membranes. In the fuel cell test, the composite membrane exhibits a lifespan of 1.7 times longer than Nafion membranes.








Abstract
In a hydrogen fuel cell, an electrolyte membrane conducts protons, but blocks electrons, hydrogen molecules, and oxygen molecules. The fuel cell often runs unsteadily, resulting in fluctuating water production, causing the membrane to swell and contract. The cyclic deformation can cause fatigue crack growth. This paper describes an approach to develop a fatigue&#8208;resistant polymer electrolyte membrane. The membrane is prepared by forming an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and a rubber. The former conducts protons, and the latter enhances fatigue resistance. The introduction of the rubber modestly reduces electrochemical performance, but significantly increases fatigue threshold and lifespan. Compared to pristine plastic electrolyte, Nafion, an interpenetrating network of Nafion and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) reduces the maximum power density by 20%, but increases the fatigue threshold by 175%. Under the wet/dry accelerated stress test, the fuel cell with the Nafion&#8208;PFPE membrane has a lifespan 1.7 times that of a fuel cell with the Nafion membrane.

         <title>Unrestricted Chiral Patterning by Laser Writing in Liquid Crystalline and Plasmonic Nanocomposite Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling chirality of materials is crucial for optoelectronic and spintronic technologies. This study presents a universal approach for governing the chirality in thin films of compounds exhibiting chirality synchronization. The developed system based on laser writing locally melts and guides the crystallization front of the material. Combined with autonomous analysis of chirality, it enables unrestricted formation of chiral patterns.








Abstract
Obtaining hierarchical structures with arbitrarily controlled chirality remains a challenge. Here, thin films featuring chiroptically bipolar patterns are produced by a device utilizing microscale photothermal re&#8208;melting of materials exhibiting chirality synchronization. This device operates autonomously, guided by an algorithm that facilitates the homochiral growth of supramolecular organic helices through controlling their re&#8208;melting. The chirality synchronization phenomena of constitutionally achiral molecules grants availability of both handednesses of the helices, enabling unrestricted chiral writing in the film. The collective chiroptical response of assembled molecules is utilised to guide the patterning process, creating a foundation for optically secured information. The established methodology enables achieving dissymmetry factor values for circular dichroism (CD) a magnitude higher than previously reported, as confirmed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, synchrotron&#8208;based Mueller matrix polarimetry (MMP). Moreover, the developed method is extended to nanocomposites comprising gold nanoparticles, providing the opportunity to tune the CD toward the plasmonic region.

&lt;p&gt;Controlling chirality of materials is crucial for optoelectronic and spintronic technologies. This study presents a universal approach for governing the chirality in thin films of compounds exhibiting chirality synchronization. The developed system based on laser writing locally melts and guides the crystallization front of the material. Combined with autonomous analysis of chirality, it enables unrestricted formation of chiral patterns.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtaining hierarchical structures with arbitrarily controlled chirality remains a challenge. Here, thin films featuring chiroptically bipolar patterns are produced by a device utilizing microscale photothermal re-melting of materials exhibiting chirality synchronization. This device operates autonomously, guided by an algorithm that facilitates the homochiral growth of supramolecular organic helices through controlling their re-melting. The chirality synchronization phenomena of constitutionally achiral molecules grants availability of both handednesses of the helices, enabling unrestricted chiral writing in the film. The collective chiroptical response of assembled molecules is utilised to guide the patterning process, creating a foundation for optically secured information. The established methodology enables achieving dissymmetry factor values for circular dichroism (CD) a magnitude higher than previously reported, as confirmed with state-of-the-art, synchrotron-based Mueller matrix polarimetry (MMP). Moreover, the developed method is extended to nanocomposites comprising gold nanoparticles, providing the opportunity to tune the CD toward the plasmonic region. This strategic application of photothermal processing, specifically laser-directed melting, uncovers the potential to broaden the selection of nanostructured materials with precisely designed functionalities for photonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Wired Memristive Crossbar Array for Effective Graph Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a cross&#8208;wired crossbar array (cwCBA) using a Pt/Ta2O5/HfO2/TiN memristor for precise physical graph representation (PGR) and dynamic node state control. The cwCBA, with enhanced PGR precision, successfully executes a dynamic path&#8208;finding algorithm with significantly lower processing complexity and analyzes complex protein&#8211;protein interaction networks, showing notable improvements in predictive accuracy over conventional methods.








Abstract
Graphs adequately represent the enormous interconnections among numerous entities in big data, incurring high computational costs in analyzing them with conventional hardware. Physical graph representation (PGR) is an approach that replicates the graph within a physical system, allowing for efficient analysis. This study introduces a cross&#8208;wired crossbar array (cwCBA), uniquely connecting diagonal and non&#8208;diagonal components in a CBA by a cross&#8208;wiring process. The cross&#8208;wired diagonal cells enable cwCBA to achieve precise PGR and dynamic node state control. For this purpose, a cwCBA is fabricated using Pt/Ta2O5/HfO2/TiN (PTHT) memristor with high on/off and self&#8208;rectifying characteristics. The structural and device benefits of PTHT cwCBA for enhanced PGR precision are highlighted, and the practical efficacy is demonstrated for two applications. First, it executes a dynamic path&#8208;finding algorithm, identifying the shortest paths in a dynamic graph. PTHT cwCBA shows a more accurate inferred distance and &#8776;1/3800 lower processing complexity than the conventional method. Second, it analyzes the protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) networks containing self&#8208;interacting proteins, which possess intricate characteristics compared to typical graphs. The PPI prediction results exhibit an average of 30.5% and 21.3% improvement in area under the curve and F1&#8208;score, respectively, compared to existing algorithms.

         <title>A Synergistic Lipid Nanoparticle Encapsulating mRNA Shingles Vaccine Induces Potent Immune Responses and Protects Guinea Pigs from Viral Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic lipid nanoparticle (Syn&#8208;LNP) containing two ionizable lipids is developed for the efficient delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine. Syn&#8208;LNP encapsulating the full VZV glycoprotein E&#8208;encoding mRNA elicits potent humoral and cellular immune responses in two strains of mice and protects vaccinated guinea pigs against live VZV challenges.








Abstract
Shingles is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) and manifests as painful skin rashes. While the recombinant protein&#8208;based vaccine proves highly effective, it encounters supply chain challenges due to a shortage of the necessary adjuvant. Messenger RNA (mRNA)&#8208;based vaccines can be rapidly produced on a large scale, but their effectiveness relies on efficient delivery and sequence design. Here, an mRNA&#8208;based VZV vaccine using a synergistic lipid nanoparticle (Syn&#8208;LNP) containing two different ionizable lipids is developed. Syn&#8208;LNP shows superior mRNA expression compared to LNPs formulated with either type of ionizable lipid and to a commercialized LNP. After encapsulating VZV glycoprotein E (gE)&#8208;encoding mRNA, mgE@Syn&#8208;LNP induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in two strains of mice. The magnitude of these responses is similar to that induced by adjuvanted recombinant gE proteins and significantly higher than that observed with live&#8208;attenuated VZV. mgE@Syn&#8208;LNP exhibits durable humoral responses for over 7 months without obvious adverse effects. In addition, mgE@Syn&#8208;LNP protects vaccinated guinea pigs against live VZV challenges. Preliminary studies on the mRNA antigen design reveal that the removal of glycosylation sites of gE greatly reduces its immune responses. Collectively, Syn&#8208;LNP encapsulating gE&#8208;encoded mRNA holds great promise as a shingles vaccine.

         <title>Delineating the Impact of Transition&#8208;Metal Crossover on Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation with Ion Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals that cross over from the cathode and deposit on the lithium&#8208;metal anode during high&#8208;voltage cycling (4.6&#160;V) are shown to localize solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and lithium deposition on cycled lithium&#8208;metal anodes through advanced, high&#8208;resolution 3D chemical analysis conducted with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS).








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMB) employing cobalt&#8208;free layered&#8208;oxide cathodes are a sustainable path forward to achieving high energy densities, but these cathodes exhibit substantial transition&#8208;metal dissolution during high&#8208;voltage cycling. While transition&#8208;metal crossover is recognized to disrupt solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on graphite anodes, experimental evidence is necessary to demonstrate this for lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, advanced high&#8208;resolution 3D chemical analysis is conducted with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) to establish spatial correlations between the transition metals and electrolyte decomposition products found on cycled lithium&#8208;metal anodes. Insights into the localization of various chemistries linked to crucial processes that define LMB performance, such as lithium deposition, SEI growth, and transition&#8208;metal deposition are deduced from a precise elemental and spatial analysis of the SEI. Heterogenous transition&#8208;metal deposition is found to perpetuate both heterogeneous SEI growth and lithium deposition on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. These correlations are confirmed across various lithium&#8208;metal anodes that are cycled with different cobalt&#8208;free cathodes and electrolytes. An advanced electrolyte that is stable to higher voltages is shown to minimize transition&#8208;metal crossover and its effects on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. Overall, these results highlight the importance of maintaining uniform SEI coverage on lithium&#8208;metal anodes, which is disrupted by transition&#8208;metal crossover during operation at high voltages.

         <title>Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Oligomers Driven T1&#8211;T2 Switchable Nanoprobes for Early and Accurate Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MRI probe (ASOSN), which encompasses antiferromagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with single&#8208;chain fragment variable antibodies, is developed. The ASOSN leverages the presence of alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) oligomers to orchestrate a switchable T1&#8211;T2 MRI signal. Remarkably, ASOSN exhibits a unique ability to differentiate &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers from neuroinflammation in vivo, enabling the precise identification of endogenous &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers during the early stages of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
The alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) oligomers hold a central role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Achieving accurate detection of &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers in vivo presents a promising avenue for early and accurate diagnosis of PD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with non&#8208;invasion and exceptional tissue penetration, offers a potent tool for visualizing &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers in vivo. Nonetheless, ensuring diagnostic specificity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel MRI probe (ASOSN) is introduced, which encompasses highly sensitive antiferromagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with single&#8208;chain fragment variable antibodies, endowing it with the capacity for discerning recognition and binding to &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers and triggering a switchable T1&#8211;T2 MRI signal. Significantly, ASOSN possesses the unique capability to accurately discriminate &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers from neuroinflammation in vivo. Moreover, ASOSN facilitates the non&#8208;invasive and precise visualizing of endogenous &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers in living systems. This innovative design heralds the development of a non&#8208;invasive visualization strategy for &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers, marking a pivotal advancement for early and accurate diagnosis of PD.

         <title>Defect Engineering of 2D Semiconductors for Dual Control of Emission and Carrier Polarity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical calculations, a general defect engineering strategy is designed to eliminate the negative influence of defects in 2D TMDCs monolayers and achieve the desired optoelectronic properties. The doped samples simultaneously achieve giant PL/PLQY enhancement and effective carrier polarity modulation. Further constructed p&#8208;n homojunctions also shows excellent device performance. 








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are considered as promising materials in post&#8208;Moore technology. However, the low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and single carrier polarity due to the inevitable defects during material preparation are great obstacles to their practical applications. Here, an extraordinary defect engineering strategy is reported based on first&#8208;principles calculations and realize it experimentally on WS2 monolayers by doping with IIIA atoms. The doped samples with large sizes possess both giant PLQY enhancement and effective carrier polarity modulation. Surprisingly, the high PL emission maintained even after one year under ambient environment. Moreover, the constructed p&#8211;n homojunctions shows high rectification ratio (&#8776;2200), ultrafast response times and excellent stability. Meanwhile, the doping strategy is universally applicable to other TMDCs and dopants. This smart defect engineering strategy not only provides a general scheme to eliminate the negative influence of defects, but also utilize them to achieve desired optoelectronic properties for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Broken Inversion Symmetry in Van Der Waals Topological Ferromagnetic Metal Iron Germanium Telluride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Definitive evidence for inversion symmetry breaking in iron germanium telluride (FGT) is reported using second harmonic generation (SHG). Fe&#160;deficiency and temperature&#160;dependent SHG evolution conclude that Fe vacancies break the inversion symmetry and reduce the centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1. These findings add crucial new information to understanding FGT: band topology, intrinsic spin&#160;orbit torque, skyrmion, and topological polar metal states.








Abstract
Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin&#8208;orbit torque, which is crucial for next&#8208;generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit torque is established in the topological van der Waals&#160;(vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique is reported. The data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the threefold SHG pattern with dominant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp threefold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to the understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin&#8208;orbit torque, and topological vdW polar metal states.

         <title>Analogous Design of a Microlayered Silicon Oxide&#8208;Based Electrode to the General Electrode Structure for Thin&#8208;film Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Development of miniaturized thin&#8208;film lithium&#8208;ion batteries (TF&#8208;LIBs) using vacuum deposition techniques are crucial for low&#8208;scale applications, but addressing low energy density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed structures analogous to SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film electrodes with close resemblance to traditional LIB slurry formulations including active material, conductive agent, and binder. The thin&#8208;film was produced using mid&#8208;frequency (MF) sputtering with a single hybrid target consisting of SiOx nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC involved a combination of SiOx and conductive carbon within the plasma&#8208;polymerized fluorocarbon (PPFC) matrix. This resulted in enhanced electronic conductivity and superior elasticity and hardness in comparison to a conventional pure SiOx&#8208;based thin&#8208;film. The electrochemical performance of the half&#8208;cell consisting of thin&#8208;film SiOx/PPFC demonstrated remarkable cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 74.8% up to the 1000th cycle at 0.5 C. In addition, a full cell using the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 thin&#8208;film as the cathode material exhibited an exceptional initial capacity of &#8764;120 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 C and cycle performance, marked by a capacity retention of 90.8% from the first cycle to the 500th cycle at a 1 C rate. This work will be a steppingstone for the AM/CB/B composite electrodes in TF&#8208;LIBs.

         <title>Titanium Multi&#8208;Topology Metamaterials with Exceptional Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additively manufactured metamaterials are architectured cellular materials that can be engineered through structural innovations to achieve unusual mechanical and multifunctional properties. Among these, hollow&#8208;strut lattice (HSL) metamaterials have proven to allow outstanding structural efficiency, with a multifunctional architecture ideal for lightweight, biomedical, microfluidic, and thermal engineering. To capitalize on their structural efficiency and significantly extend their mechanical envelope, we have seamlessly integrated a thin&#8208;plate lattice (TPL) topology into the inner hollow space of an HSL topology. This integration serves a dual purpose: to radically enhance the resistance of the irregular HSL nodes to deformation and to uniformly distribute the applied stresses in the new topology for unparalleled strength. Fabricated in titanium alloy Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4&#160;V with densities of 1.0&#8208;1.8&#160;g/cm3 by additive manufacturing, our thin&#8208;plate hollow&#8208;strut lattice (TP&#8208;HSL) metamaterials achieve relative yield strength that well surpasses the empirical upper limits of all cellular metals, including HSL and solid&#8208;strut lattice (SSL) materials made from various metallic alloys. Furthermore, their absolute yield strength drastically exceeds that of magnesium alloys with comparable densities while inheriting the high corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, heat resistance, and other unique attributes of Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4&#160;V. Titanium multi&#8208;topology metamaterials expand the boundaries of lightweight multifunctional metallic materials.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Layer Controlled Transition from Inverse Rashba&#8208;Edelstein Effect to Inverse Spin Hall Effect in Two&#8208;Dimensional PtSe2 Probed by THz Spintronic Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are ideal platforms for spin&#8208;charge conversion (SCC) as they possess strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetries as well as tuneable band structure, compared to metallic structures. Moreover, SCC can be tuned with the number of layers, electric field or strain. Here, we&#160;study spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion in epitaxially grown 2D PtSe2 by THz spintronic emission since its 1T crystal symmetry and strong SOC favor SCC. High quality of as&#8208;grown PtSe2 layers is demonstrated, followed by in&#8208;situ ferromagnet deposition by sputtering that leaves the PtSe2 unaffected, resulting in well&#8208;defined clean interfaces as evidenced with extensive characterization. Through this atomic growth control and using THz spintronic emission, the unique thickness dependent electronic structure of PtSe2 allows the control of SCC. Indeed, we&#160;demonstrate the transition from the inverse Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect (IREE) in 1&#8208;3 monolayers (ML) to the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in multilayers (&gt;3 ML) of PtSe2 enabling the extraction of the perpendicular spin diffusion length and relative strength of IREE and ISHE. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe2 an ideal candidate to explore the underlying mechanisms and engineering of the SCC but also to develop tuneable THz spintronic&#160;emitters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are ideal platforms for spin-charge conversion (SCC) as they possess strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), reduced dimensionality and crystal symmetries as well as tuneable band structure, compared to metallic structures. Moreover, SCC can be tuned with the number of layers, electric field or strain. Here, we&#160;study spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxially grown 2D PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by THz spintronic emission since its 1T crystal symmetry and strong SOC favor SCC. High quality of as-grown PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers is demonstrated, followed by in-situ ferromagnet deposition by sputtering that leaves the PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unaffected, resulting in well-defined clean interfaces as evidenced with extensive characterization. Through this atomic growth control and using THz spintronic emission, the unique thickness dependent electronic structure of PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows the control of SCC. Indeed, we&#160;demonstrate the transition from the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect (IREE) in 1-3 monolayers (ML) to the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in multilayers (&amp;gt;3 ML) of PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enabling the extraction of the perpendicular spin diffusion length and relative strength of IREE and ISHE. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; an ideal candidate to explore the underlying mechanisms and engineering of the SCC but also to develop tuneable THz spintronic&#160;emitters.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Features of Anisotropic Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural materials are anisotropic. Delivery systems occurring in nature, such as viruses, blood cells, pollen, and many others, do have anisotropy, while delivery systems made artificially are mostly isotropic. There is apparent complexity in engineering anisotropic particles or capsules with micron and submicron sizes. Nevertheless, some promising examples of how to fabricate particles with anisotropic shapes or having anisotropic chemical and/or physical properties have been developed. Anisotropy of particles, once they face biological systems, influences their behaviour. Internalisation by the cells, flow in the bloodstream, biodistribution over organs and tissues, directed release, and toxicity of particles regardless of the same chemistry are all reported to be factors of anisotropy of delivery systems. Here, we review the current methods to introduce anisotropy to particles or capsules, including loading with various therapeutic cargo, variable physical properties primarily by anisotropic magnetic properties, controlling directional motion, and making Janus particles. The advantages of combining different anisotropy in one entity for delivery and common problems and limitations for fabrication are under discussion.

         <title>Atmospheric Humidity Underlies Irreproducibility of Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atmospheric humidity control during the fabrication process crucially influences the phase formation and stability of formamidinium perovskites. This work reveals that controlled humidity during the fabrication process is a key to achieving reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality and stable perovskite films. Thus, precise humidity management is essential to ensure the reproducible, efficient, and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are infamous for their batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch and lab&#8208;to&#8208;lab irreproducibility in terms of stability and performance. Reproducible fabrication of PSCs is a critical requirement for market viability and practical commercialization. PSC irreproducibility plagues all levels of the community; from institutional research laboratories, start&#8208;up companies, to large established corporations. In this work, the critical function of atmospheric humidity to regulate the crystallization and stabilization of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is unraveled. It is demonstrated that the humidity content during processing induces profound variations in perovskite stoichiometry, thermodynamic stability, and optoelectronic quality. Almost counterintuitively, it is shown that the presence of humidity is perhaps indispensable to reproduce phase&#8208;stable and efficient FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Tailored Design of a Water&#8208;Based Nanoreactor Technology for Producing Processable Sub&#8208;40&#160;Nm 3D COF Nanoparticles at Atmospheric Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology that allows for the controlled generation of sub&#8208;40&#160;nm 3D covalent organic frameworks (COF) nanoparticles, boosting processability, and opening new frontiers in nano/microrobotics and biomedicine is presented. This breakthrough clearly overcomes the limitations posed by larger reported 3D COF crystal structures, unlocking exciting possibilities for previously unexplored domains.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline materials with intrinsic porosity that offer a wide range of potential applications spanning diverse fields. Yet, the main goal in the COF research area is to achieve the most stable thermodynamic product while simultaneously targeting the desired size and structure crucial for enabling specific functions. While significant progress is made in the synthesis and processing of 2D COFs, the development of processable 3D COF nanocrystals remains challenging. Here, a water&#8208;based nanoreactor technology for producing processable sub&#8208;40&#160;nm 3D COF nanoparticles at ambient conditions is presented. Significantly, this technology not only improves the processability of the synthesized 3D COF, but also unveils exciting possibilities for their utilization in previously unexplored domains, such as nano/microrobotics and biomedicine, which are limited by larger crystallites.

         <title>Unifying and Suppressing Conduction Losses of Polymer Dielectrics for Superior High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrode and bulk&#8208;limited conduction losses are unified and the conduction and energy losses of polymer dielectric at elevated temperatures are thoroughly suppressed by separately optimizing the surface and bulk phase structures of polymer dielectric. From this, the resultant polymer film exhibits superior high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance at elevated temperatures and electric fields.








Abstract
Superior high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance of polymer dielectrics is critical for the modern film capacitor demanded in the harsh&#8208;environment electronic and electrical systems. Unfortunately, the capacitive performance degrades rapidly at elevated temperatures owing to the exponential growth of conduction loss. The conduction loss is mainly composed of electrode and bulk&#8208;limited conduction. Herein, the contribution of surface and bulk factors is unified to conduction loss, and the loss is thoroughly suppressed. The experimental results demonstrate that the polar oxygen&#8208;containing groups on the surface of polymer dielectrics can act as the charge trap sites to immobilize the injected charges from electrode, which can in turn establish a built&#8208;in field to weaken the external electric field and augment the injection barrier height. Wide bandgap aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticle fillers can serve as deep traps to constrain the transport of injected or thermally activated charges in the bulk phase. From this, at 200 &#176;C, the discharged energy density with a discharge&#8211;charge efficiency of 90% increases by 1058.06% from 0.31 J cm&#8722;3 for pristine polyetherimide to 3.59 J cm&#8722;3 for irradiated composite film. The principle of simultaneously inhibiting the electrode and bulk&#8208;limited conduction losses could be easily extended to other polymer dielectrics for high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Interface Engineering Enables Efficient and 1960&#8208;Hour&#160;ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly adding a cyanoacrylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular additive, namely BT&#8208;T, into the perovskite precursor solution achieves in situ buried&#8208;interface passivation. The power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) for 1.0&#160;cm2 inverted&#8208;structure PSCs reaches 23.48%. The encapsulated perovskite solar cell (PSC)&#160;retains 95.4% of its initial PCE following 1960&#160;h maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking under continuous light illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C (i.e., ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol).








Abstract
High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) typically require interfacial passivation, yet this is challenging for the buried interface, owing to the dissolution of passivation agents during the deposition of perovskites. Here, this limitation is overcome with in situ buried&#8208;interface passivation&#8212;achieved via directly adding a cyanoacrylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular additive, namely BT&#8208;T, into the perovskite precursor solution. Classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that BT&#8208;T spontaneously may self&#8208;assemble at the buried interface during the formation of the perovskite layer on a nickel oxide hole&#8208;transporting layer. The preferential buried&#8208;interface passivation results in facilitated hole transfer and suppressed charge recombination. In addition, residual BT&#8208;T molecules in the perovskite layer enhance its stability and homogeneity. A power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.48% for 1.0&#160;cm2 inverted&#8208;structure PSCs is reported. The encapsulated PSC retains 95.4% of its initial PCE following 1960&#160;h maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking under continuous light illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C (i.e., ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol). The demonstration of operating&#8208;stable PSCs under accelerated ageing conditions represents a step closer to the commercialization of this emerging technology.

&lt;p&gt;Directly adding a cyanoacrylic-acid-based molecular additive, namely BT-T, into the perovskite precursor solution achieves in situ buried-interface passivation. The power-conversion efficiency (PCE) for 1.0&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; inverted-structure PSCs reaches 23.48%. The encapsulated perovskite solar cell (PSC)&#160;retains 95.4% of its initial PCE following 1960&#160;h maximum-power-point tracking under continuous light illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C (i.e., ISOS-L-2I protocol).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) typically require interfacial passivation, yet this is challenging for the buried interface, owing to the dissolution of passivation agents during the deposition of perovskites. Here, this limitation is overcome with in situ buried-interface passivation&#8212;achieved via directly adding a cyanoacrylic-acid-based molecular additive, namely BT-T, into the perovskite precursor solution. Classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that BT-T spontaneously may self-assemble at the buried interface during the formation of the perovskite layer on a nickel oxide hole-transporting layer. The preferential buried-interface passivation results in facilitated hole transfer and suppressed charge recombination. In addition, residual BT-T molecules in the perovskite layer enhance its stability and homogeneity. A power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.48% for 1.0&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; inverted-structure PSCs is reported. The encapsulated PSC retains 95.4% of its initial PCE following 1960&#160;h maximum-power-point tracking under continuous light illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C (i.e., ISOS-L-2I protocol).

         <title>B&#8208;Site Co&#8208;Doping Coupled with Additive Passivation Pushes the Efficiency of Pb&#8211;Sn Mixed Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Over 17%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pb&#8211;Sn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells with a record efficiency of 17.12% are achieved via B&#8208;site Mn co&#8208;doping strategy and introducing benzhydroxamic acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. Mn&#8208;doping contributes to structurally stable inorganic perovskite. While, BHA additive mitigates Sn2+ oxidation, and passivates Sn(II) related defects, forming an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite.








Abstract
Pb&#8211;Sn mixed inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered increasing interest as a viable solution to mitigate the thermal instability and lead toxicity of hybrid lead&#8208;based PSCs. However, the relatively poor structural stability and low device efficiency hinder its further development. Herein, high&#8208;performance manganese (Mn)&#8208;doped Pb&#8211;Sn&#8211;Mn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are successfully developed by introducing Benzhydroxamic Acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. The incorporation of smaller divalent Mn cations contributes to a contraction of the perovskite crystal, leading to an improvement in structural stability. The BHA additive containing a reductive hydroxamic acid group (O&#9552;C&#8211;NHOH) not only mitigates the notorious oxidation of Sn2+ but also interacts with metal ions at the B&#8208;site and passivates related defects. This results in films with high crystallinity and low defect density. Moreover, the BHA molecules tend to introduce a near&#8208;vertical dipole moment that parallels the built&#8208;in electric field, thus facilitating charge carrier extraction. Consequently, the resulting device delivers a champion PCE as high as 17.12%, which represents the highest reported efficiency for Pb&#8211;Sn&#8208;based inorganic PSCs thus far. Furthermore, the BHA molecule provides an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite grain boundary, resulting in significant enhancement of device air stability.

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport for Ultralong&#8208;Cycling Dendrite&#8208;Free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries are of intense current energy storage and materials science interest and considered a game changer for electric vehicles This work reports lithium dendrite&#8208;free battery design&#160;and holds great promise for improving the energy density and performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, particularly in the context of rapidly expanding markets for electric vehicles.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries can address crucial challenges regarding insufficient battery cycling life and energy density. The demonstration of long&#8208;cycling dendrite&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries requires precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). In this work, a proof of concept is reported for precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport of a halide SSE, Li3InCl6, including intragranular (within grains) but also intergranular (between grains) lithium&#8208;ion transport. Lithium&#8208;ion migration tailoring mechanism in crystals is developed by unexpected enhanced Li, In, and Cl vacancy populations and lower energy barrier for hopping. The lithium&#8208;ion transport tailoring mechanism between the grains is determined by the elimination of voids between grains and the formation of unexpected supersonic conducting grain boundaries, boosting the lithium dendrite suppression ability of SSE. Due to boosted lithium&#8208;ion conduction and dendrite&#8208;suppression ability, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries coupled with Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes and lithium metal anodes demonstrate breakthroughs in electrochemical performance by achieving extremely long cycling life at a high current density of 0.5 C (2000 cycles, 93.7% capacity retention). This concept of precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport provides a cost, time, and energy efficient solution to conquer the remaining challenges in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries for fast developing electric vehicle markets.

         <title>Comparative Proteomics Inspired Self&#8208;Stimulated Release Hydrogel Reinforces the Therapeutic Effects of MSC&#8208;EVs on Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here an intelligent hydrogel containing self&#8208;assembled peptides that mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle (MSC&#8208;EV) membrane enzymes can degrade is developed to allow controlled release of MSC&#8208;EVs after intranasal delivery, prolonging their retention and improving their ability to cure Alzheimer's disease. This study introduces a comparative proteomics&#8208;driven hydrogel design, offering promising modality for MSC&#8208;EVs&#8217; clinical applications.









Abstract
The clinical application of extracellular vesicles (EVs)&#8208;based therapeutics continues to be challenging due to their rapid clearance, restricted retention, and low yields. Although hydrogel possesses the ability to impede physiological clearance and increase regional retention, it typically fails to effectively release the incorporated EVs, resulting in reduced accessibility and bioavailability. Here an intelligent hydrogel in which the release of EVs is regulated by the proteins on the EVs membrane is proposed. By utilizing the EVs membrane enzyme to facilitate hydrogel degradation, sustained retention and self&#8208;stimulated EVs release can be achieved at the administration site. To achieve this goal, the membrane proteins with matrix degrading activity in the mesenchymal stem cell&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;EVs) are identified using comparative proteomics. After that, a hydrogel comprised of self&#8208;assembled peptides that are susceptible to degradation by the membrane enzymes present in MSC&#8208;EVs is designed and synthesized. After intranasal administration, this peptide hydrogel facilitates sustained and thermo&#8208;sensitive release of MSC&#8208;EVs, thereby extending the retention of the MSC&#8208;EVs and substantially enhancing their potential for treating Alzheimer's disease. This research presents a comparative proteomics&#8208;driven approach to intelligent hydrogel design, which holds the capacity to significantly enhance the applicability of EVs in clinical settings.

         <title>Synergistic Chemoimmunotherapy Augmentation via Sequential Nanocomposite Hydrogel&#8208;Mediated Reprogramming of Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts in Osteosarcoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential nanocomposite hydrogel reshaping cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast (CAF) behavior is developed, fostering tumor&#8208;infiltrating T&#8208;cells in osteosarcoma. The injectable hydrogel based on carboxymethyl chitosan/ tetrabasic polyethylene glycol regulates the release of a potent CAF suppressor (Nox4 inhibitor) and liposomal Doxorubicin. Combining the gel with a checkpoint inhibitor boosts anti&#8208;tumor immunity in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model.








Abstract
In osteosarcoma, immunotherapy often faces hurdles posed by cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete dense extracellular matrix components and cytokines. Directly removing CAFs may prove ineffective and even promote tumor metastasis. To address this challenge, a sequential nanocomposite hydrogel that reshapes CAF behavior is developed, enhancing tumor&#8208;infiltrating T&#8208;cells in osteosarcoma. The approach utilizes an injectable blend of carboxymethyl chitosan and tetrabasic polyethylene glycol, forming a hydrogel for controlled release of a potent CAF suppressor (Nox4 inhibitor, Nox4i) and liposomal Doxorubicin (L&#8208;Dox) to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) upon in situ administration. Nox4i effectively counters CAF activation, overcoming T&#8208;cell exclusion mechanisms, followed by programmed L&#8208;Dox release for ICD induction in stroma&#8208;rich osteosarcoma models. Combining the co&#8208;delivery gel with &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint inhibitor further enhances its effectiveness in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model. Immunophenotyping data underscore a significant boost in tumor T&#8208;cell infiltration and favorable anti&#8208;tumor immunity at the whole&#8208;animal level.

Nox4&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; effectively counters CAF activation, overcoming T-cell exclusion mechanisms, followed by programmed L-Dox release for ICD induction in stroma-rich osteosarcoma models. Combining the co-delivery gel with &#945;PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor further enhances its effectiveness in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model. Immunophenotyping data underscore a significant boost in tumor T-cell infiltration and favorable anti-tumor immunity at the whole-animal level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Co/Mon Invigorated Bilateral Kinetics Modulation for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the discharging/charging process, S8 molecules are rapidly and stably converted into Li2S due to the synergistic effect of different functional microdomains of Co/MoN. As expected, the Co/MoN decorated separators not only speed up sulfur redox kinetics and inhibit polysulfide shuttling but also realize uniform ion diffusion and stable lithium nucleation growth during cycling based on bilateral kinetics modulation strategy.








Abstract
Sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and Li&#8208;dendrite growth are the main bottlenecks for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Separator modification serves as a dual&#8208;purpose approach to address both of these challenges. In this study, the Co/MoN composite is rationally designed and applied as the modifier to modulate the electrochemical kinetics on both sides of the sulfur cathode and lithium anode. Benefiting from its adsorption&#8208;catalysis function, the decorated separators (Co/MoN@PP) not only effectively inhibit polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and accelerate their electrochemical conversion but also boost Li+ flux, realizing uniform Li plating/stripping. The accelerated LiPSs conversion kinetics and excellent sulfur redox reversibility triggered by Co/MoN modified separators are evidenced by performance, in&#8208;situ Raman detection and theoretical calculations. The batteries with Co/MoN@PP achieve a high initial discharge capacity of 1570 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C with a low decay rate of 0.39%, uniform Li+ transportation at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 800&#160;h. Moreover, the areal capacity of 4.62 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved under high mass loadings of 4.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This study provides a feasible strategy for the rational utilization of the synergistic effect of composite with multifunctional microdomains to solve the problems of Li anode and S cathode toward long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered Cascade Therapy: A Nir&#8208;Ii Aie Luminogen Collaborating with Nitric Oxide Facilitates Efficient Collagen Depletion for Boosting Pancreatic Cancer Phototheranostics</title>

Abstract
The dense extracellular matrix (ECM) in the pancreatic cancer severely hampers the penetration of nanodrugs, which causes inferior therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional liposome, namely, Lip&#8208;DTI/NO, integrating a type&#8208;I photosensitizer DTITBT with glutathione (GSH) or heat&#8208;responsive nitric oxide (NO) donor S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;penicillamine (SNAP) is constructed to deplete the tumor ECM, leading to enhanced drug delivery and consequently improved phototherapy. The loaded DTITBT possesses multiple functions including NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging, efficient superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generation and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, making it feasible for precisely pinpointing the tumor in the phototherapy process. Responding to the intracellular overexpressed glutathione or heat produced by photothermal effect of DTITBT, NO can be released from SNAP. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, Lip&#8208;DTI/NO could selectively induce in situ generation of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO&#8722;) in tumor after cascade processes including O2&#8226;&#8722; production, GSH or heat&#8208;triggered NO release, and rapid reaction between O2&#8226;&#8722; and NO. The generated ONOO&#8722; could activate the expression of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases which could efficiently digest collagen of tumor ECM, thus facilitating enhanced penetration and accumulation of Lip&#8208;DTI/NO in tumor. In vivo evaluation demonstrated the notable therapeutic efficacy via ONOO&#8722;&#8208;potentiated synergistic photodynamic&#8208;photothermal therapies on both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.

         <title>Age&#8208;associated Senescent &#8211; T Cell Signaling Promotes Type 3 Immunity that Inhibits the Biomaterial Regenerative Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging alters immune responses, impairing tissue repair and response to regenerative treatments. In aged animals, injury increases inflammation and IL&#8208;17 signaling, revealing age&#8208;related communication between T cells and senescent cells that promotes type 3 immunity. Inhibiting this response with IL17&#8208;neutralizing antibodies improves healing and biomaterial efficacy, suggesting potential strategies for countering age&#8208;related immune dysregulation to promote tissue repair.








Abstract
Aging is associated with immunological changes that compromise response to infections and vaccines, exacerbate inflammatory diseases and can potentially mitigate tissue repair. Even so, age&#8208;related changes to the immune response to tissue damage and regenerative medicine therapies remain unknown. Here, it is characterized how aging induces changes in immunological signatures that inhibit tissue repair and therapeutic response to a clinical regenerative biological scaffold derived from extracellular matrix. Signatures of inflammation and interleukin (IL)&#8208;17 signaling increased with injury and treatment both locally and regionally in aged animals, and computational analysis uncovered age&#8208;associated senescent&#8208;T cell communication that promotes type 3 immunity in T cells. Local inhibition of type 3 immune activation using IL17&#8208;neutralizing antibodies improves healing and restores therapeutic response to the regenerative biomaterial, promoting muscle repair in older animals. These results provide insights into tissue immune dysregulation that occurs with aging that can be targeted to rejuvenate repair.

         <title>Undercoordination Chemistry of Sulfur Electrocatalyst in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research advances of undercoordination chemistry in sulfur electrocatalysis including operation strategy and underlying working mechanisms are systematically combed in this review. Underlying working mechanisms are detailedly summarized in terms of polysulfide adsorption behaviors, polysulfide conversion kinetics, electron/ion transport, and dynamic reconstruction. Moreover, perspectives regarding the future of undercoordination chemistry are proposed.








Abstract
Undercoordination chemistry is an effective strategy to modulate the geometry&#8208;governed electronic structure and thereby regulate the activity of sulfur electrocatalysts. Efficient sulfur electrocatalysis is requisite to overcome the sluggish kinetics in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries aroused by multi&#8208;electron transfer and multi&#8208;phase conversions. Recent advances unveil the great promise of undercoordination chemistry in facilitating and stabilizing sulfur electrochemistry, yet a related review with systematicness and perspectives is still missing. Herein, it is carefully combed through the recent progress of undercoordination chemistry in sulfur electrocatalysis. The typical material structures and operational strategies are elaborated, while the underlying working mechanism is also detailly introduced and generalized into polysulfide adsorption behaviors, polysulfide conversion kinetics, electron/ion transport, and dynamic reconstruction. Moreover, perspectives on the future development of undercoordination chemistry are further proposed.

A strategy of passivating dipole layer to reconstruct an efficient 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction has been successfully developed, enabling high&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Constructing 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction is a promising approach to integrate the benefits of high efficiency and superior stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, in contrast to n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectural PSCs, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with 3D/2D heterojunction have serious limitations in achieving high&#8208;performance as they suffer from a large energetic mismatch and electron extraction energy barrier from a 3D perovskite layer to a 2D perovskite layer, and serious nonradiative recombination at the heterojunction. Here a strategy of incorporating a thin passivating dipole layer (PDL) onto 3D perovskite and then depositing 2D perovskite without dissolving the underlying layer to form an efficient 3D/PDL/2D heterojunction is developed. It is revealed that PDL regulates the energy level alignment with the appearance of interfacial dipole and strongly interacts with 3D perovskite through covalent bonds, which eliminate the energetic mismatch, reduce the surface defects, suppress the nonradiative recombination, and thus accelerate the charge extraction at such electron&#8208;selective contact. As a result, it is reported that the 3D/PDL/2D junction p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs present a power conversion efficiency of 24.85% with robust stability, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of the 3D/2D junction n&#8208;i&#8208;p devices.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization within Coherent Nano&#8208;Heterocrystal Ensembles for Optimizing Polysulfide Conversion in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>

Construction of coherent nano&#8208;heterocrystal ensembles (CNEs) aims to achieve enhanced electron delocalization, ensure stability of high&#8208;activity crystal facets, improve catalytic efficiency, and lower the energy barriers for sulfur species conversion. The synergistic optimization of multi&#8208;reactive facets facilitates efficient conversion of polysulfides, offering a new approach for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Commercialization of high energy density Lithium&#8208;Sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is impeded by challenges such as polysulfide shuttling, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited Li+ transport. Herein, a jigsaw&#8208;inspired catalyst design strategy that involves in situ assembly of coherent nano&#8208;heterocrystal ensembles (CNEs) to stabilize high&#8208;activity crystal facets, enhance electron delocalization, and reduce associated energy barriers is proposed. On the catalyst surface, the stabilized high&#8208;activity facets induce polysulfide aggregation. Simultaneously, the surrounded surface facets with enhanced activity promote Li2S deposition and Li+ diffusion, synergistically facilitating continuous and efficient sulfur redox. Experimental and DFT computations results reveal that the dual&#8208;component hetero&#8208;facet design alters the coordination of Nb atoms, enabling the redistribution of 3D orbital electrons at the Nb center and promoting d&#8208;p hybridization with sulfur. The CNE, based on energy level gradient and lattice matching, endows maximum electron transfer to catalysts and establishes smooth pathways for ion diffusion. Encouragingly, the NbN&#8208;NbC&#8208;based pouch battery delivers a Weight energy density of 357&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, thereby demonstrating the practical application value of CNEs. This work unveils a novel paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts, which has the potential to shape future research on electrocatalysts for energy storage applications.

         <title>Saltwater&#8208;Induced Rapid Gelation of Photoredox&#8208;Responsive Mucomimetic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach toward injectable, shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels is reported, where bottlebrush polymers are cross&#8208;linked into water&#8208;soluble polymer networks through host&#8211;guest cross&#8208;linking interactions. Injection of the pre&#8208;gel solution into saltwater induces rapid gelation, affording viscous hydrogels with broad adhesive properties that can be converted into shear&#8208;thinning materials in response to heating or through a novel visible&#8208;light photoredox mechanism.








Abstract
Shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels represent an important class of injectable soft materials that are often used in a wide range of biomedical applications. Creation of new shear&#8208;thinning materials often requires that factors such as viscosity, injection rate/force, and needle gauge be evaluated to achieve efficient delivery, while simultaneously protecting potentially sensitive cargo. Here, a new approach to establishing shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels is reported where a host&#8211;guest cross&#8208;linked network initially remains soluble in deionized water but is kinetically trapped as a viscous hydrogel once exposed to saltwater. The shear&#8208;thinning properties of the hydrogelis then &#8220;switched on&#8221; in response to heating or exposure to visible light. These hydrogels consist of polynorbornene&#8208;based bottlebrush copolymers with porphyrin&#8208; and oligoviologen&#8208;containing side chains that are cross&#8208;linked through the reversible formation of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8211;adamantane inclusion complexes. The resultant viscous hydrogels display broad adhesive properties across polar and nonpolar substrates, mimicking that of natural mucous and thus making it easier to distribute onto a wide range of surfaces. Additional control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties (storage/loss moduli) and performance (adhesion) is achieved post&#8208;injection using a low&#8208;energy (blue light) photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer process. This work envisions these injectable copolymers and multimodal hydrogels can serve as versatile next&#8208;generation biomaterials capable of light&#8208;based mechanical manipulation post&#8208;injection.

         <title>Enantioselective Adsorption on Magnetic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
From the beginning of molecular theory, the interplay of chirality and magnetism has intrigued scientists. There is still the question if enantiospecific adsorption of chiral molecules occurs on magnetic surfaces. Enantiomer discrimination was conjectured to arise from chirality&#8208;induced spin separation within the molecules and exchange interaction with the substrate's magnetization. Here we show that single helical aromatic hydrocarbons undergo enantioselective adsorption on ferromagnetic cobalt surfaces. Spin and chirality sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that molecules of opposite handedness prefer adsorption onto cobalt islands with opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetization. As mobility ceases in the final chemisorbed state, it is concluded that enantioselection must occur in a physisorbed transient precursor state. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spin&#8208;resolved ab initio simulations support this scenario by refuting enantio&#8208;dependent chemisorption energies. These findings demonstrate that van der Waals interaction should also include spin&#8208;fluctuations which are crucial for molecular magnetochiral&#160;processes.

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering with Tamed Electrode Interphases for High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the highly instable electrolyte/electrode interphases threat long&#8208;term cycling of high&#8208;energy SIBs. In particular, the instable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage causes persistent electrolyte decomposition, transition metal dissolution and fast capacity fade. Here we propose a balanced principle for molecular design of SIB electrolytes that enable an ultra&#8208;thin, homogeneous and robust CEI layer by coupling an intrinsically oxidation stable succinonitrile solvent with moderately solvating carbonates. The proposed electrolyte not only shows limited anodic decomposition thus leading to a thin CEI, but also suppresses dissolution of CEI components at high voltage. Consequently, the tamed electrolyte/electrode interphases enable extremely stable cycling of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes with outstanding capacity retention (&gt; 90%) over 3000 cycles (eight months) at 1 C with a high charging voltage of 4.3&#8201;V. Further, the NVOPF||hard carbon full cell shows stable cycling over 500&#8201;cycles at 1 C with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. The electrolyte also endows high&#8208;voltage operation of SIBs with great temperature adaptability from &#8722;25 oC to 60&#160;&#176;C, shedding light on the essence of fundamental electrolyte design for SIBs operating under harsh conditions.

         <title>Important Role of Ion Flux Regulated by Separators in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Polyolefin separators are the most common separators used in rechargeable lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. However, the influence of different polyolefin separators on the performance of Li metal batteries (LMBs) has not been well studied. By performing particle injection simulations on the reconstructed three&#8208;dimensional pores of different polyolefin separators, it was revealed that the pore structure of the separator had a significant impact on the ion flux distribution, the Li deposition behavior and consequently, the cycle life of LMBs. It was also discovered that the homogeneity factor of Li ion toward Li metal electrode was positively correlated to the longevity and reproducibility of LMBs. This work not only emphasizes the importance of pore structure of polyolefin separators, but also provides an economic and effective method to screen favorable separators for LMBs.

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Acid Sensing and Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The first synthesis and comprehensive characterization of two vinyl tetrazine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COF), TA&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and TA&#8208;COF&#8208;2, are reported. These materials exhibited high crystallinity and high specific surface areas of 1323 and 1114 m2g&#8211;1. The COFs demonstrated favorable band positions, and narrow band gaps suitable for&#160;light&#8208;driven applications. These advantages enabled TA&#8208;COFs to act as reusable metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in the arylboronic acids oxidation and light&#8208;induced coupling of benzylamines. In addition, these TA&#8208;COFs showed acid sensing capabilities, exhibiting visible and reversible color changes upon exposure to HCl solution, HCl vapor, and NH3 vapor. Furthermore, the TA&#8208;COFs outperformed a wide range of previously reported COF photocathodes. The tetrazine linker in the COF skeleton represents a significant advancement in the field of COF synthesis, enhancing the separation efficiency of charge carriers during the photoreaction and contributing to their photocathodic properties. TA&#8208;COFs can also degrade 5&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;one (NTO), an insensitive explosive present in industrial wastewater, in 20 minutes in a sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalytic process. Thus, revealing the dual functionality of the protonated TA&#8208;COFs as both photodegradation and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts. This pioneering work opens new avenues for harnessing the potential of the tetrazine linker in COF&#8208;based materials, facilitating advances in catalysis, sensing, and other related fields.

         <title>Protonation Stimulates the Layered to Rock Salt Phase Transition of Ni&#8208;Rich Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Protonation of oxide cathodes triggers surface transition metal dissolution and accelerates the performance degradation of Li&#8208;ion batteries. While strategies are developed to improve cathode material surface stability, little is known about the effects of protonation on bulk phase transitions in these cathode materials or their sodium&#8208;ion battery counterparts. Here, using NaNiO2 in electrolytes with different proton&#8208;generating levels as model systems, we present a holistic picture of the effect of incorporated protons. Protonation of lattice oxygens stimulates transition metal migration to the alkaline layer and accelerates layered&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition, which leads to bulk structure disintegration and anisotropic surface reconstruction layers formation. A cathode that undergoes severe protonation reactions attains a porous architecture corresponding to its multifold performance fade. This work reveals that interactions between electrolyte and cathode that result in protonation can dominate the structural reversibility/stability of bulk cathodes, and the insight sheds light for the development of future batteries.

         <title>Fast and Facile Liquid Metal Printing via Projection Lithography for Highly Stretchable Electronic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft electronic circuits are crucial for wearable electronics, biomedical technologies and soft robotics, requiring soft conductive materials with high conductivity, high strain limit and stable electrical performance under deformation. Liquid metals (LMs) have become an attractive candidate with high conductivity and fluidic compliance, while effective manufacturing methods are demanded. Digital light processing (DLP)&#8208;based projection lithography is a high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput printing technique for primarily polymers and some metals. If LMs can be printed with DLP as well, the entire soft devices can be fabricated by one printer in a streamlined and highly&#8208;efficient process. Herein, we achieved fast and facile DLP&#8208;based liquid metal printing. Simply with 5&#8211;10 seconds of patterned UV&#8208;light exposure, a highly conductive and stretchable pattern can be printed using a photo&#8208;crosslinkable LM particle ink. The printed eutectic gallium indium traces feature high resolution (&#8764;20 &#956;m), conductivity (3.0&#215;106 S m&#8722;1), stretchability (&#8764;2500%) and excellent stability (consistent performance at different deformation). Various patterns have been printed in diverse material systems for broad applications, including stretchable displays, epidermal strain sensors, heaters, humidity sensors, conformal electrodes for electrography, and multi&#8208;layer actuators. The facile and scalable process, the excellent performance, diverse applications ensure its broad impact on soft electronic manufacturing.

         <title>Observation of a Photonic Orbital Gauge Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gauge field is widely studied in natural and artificial materials. With an effective magnetic field for uncharged particles, many intriguing phenomena have been observed in several systems like photonic Floquet topological insulator. However, previous researches about the gauge field mostly focus on limited dimensions such as the Dirac spinor in graphene materials. Here, we firstly propose and experimentally observe an orbital gauge field based on photonic triangular lattices. Disclination defects with Frank angle &#937;${\bf \Omega}$ created on such lattices breaks the original lattice symmetry and generates purely geometric gauge field operating on orbital basis functions. Interestingly, it is found that bound states near zero energy with the orbital angular momentum l=2$l=2$ are intensively confined at the disclination as gradually expanding &#937;${\bf \Omega}$. Moreover, the introduction of a vector potential field breaks the time&#8208;reversal symmetry of the orbital gauge field, experimentally manifested by the chiral transmission of light on helical waveguides. The orbital gauge field further suggests fantastic applications of manipulating the vortex light in photonic integrated&#160;devices.

         <title>Silk Fibroin&#8208;Regulated Nanochannels for Flexible Hydrovoltaic Ion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect based on ion&#8208;selective nanochannels could theoretically be employed for high&#8208;performance ion sensing, yet the indeterminate ion&#8208;sensing properties and the acquisition of high sensing performance has rarely been explored. Herein, we present a controllable nanochannel regulation strategy for flexible hydrovoltaic devices with highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing abilities across a wide concentration range. By multiple dip&#8208;coating silk fibroin on an electrospinning nylon&#8208;66 nanofiber film, the surface polarity enhancement, the fibers size regulation with a precision of approximately about 25&#160;nm, and the nanostructure firm binding are achieved simultaneously. The resultant flexible freestanding hydrovoltaic device exhibits an open circuit voltage up to 4.82&#160;V in deionized water, a wide ion sensing range of 10&#8722;7 to 100&#160;M and ultrahigh sensitivity as high as 1.37&#160;V dec&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than the sensitivity of the traditional solid&#8208;contact ion&#8208;selective electrodes. The fabricated flexible ion&#8208;sensitive hydrovoltaic device is successfully applied for wearable human sweat electrolyte sensing and for environmental trace&#8208;ion monitoring, thereby confirming the potential application of the hydrovoltaic effect for ion sensing.

         <title>Pyroelectric Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric materials are of interest, for example, for energy harvesting applications, for the development of tactile sensors, as well as neuromorphic computing. This study reports the observation of pyro&#8208; and piezoelectricity in thin surface&#8208;attached polymer brushes containing zwitterionic and electrolytic side groups that are prepared via surface&#8208;initiated polymerization. The pyro&#8208; and piezoelectric properties of the surface&#8208;grafted polyelectrolyte brushes are found to sensitively depend on and can be tuned by variation of the counterion. The observed piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties reflect the structural complexity of polymer brushes, and are attributed to a complex interplay of the non&#8208;uniform segment density within these films, together with a non&#8208;uniform distribution of counterions and specific ion effects. The fabrication of thin pyroelectric films by surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is an important addition to the existing strategies towards such materials. Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization, in particular, allows for facile grafting of polar thin polymer films from a wide range of substrates via a straightforward two&#8208;step protocol that obviates the need for multistep laborious synthetic procedures or thin film deposition protocols. The ability to produce polymer brushes with piezo&#8208; and pyroelectric properties opens up new avenues of application of these materials, for example, in energy harvesting or biosensing.

         <title>Probing the Strain Direction&#8208;Dependent Nonmonotonic Optical Bandgap Modulation of Layered Violet Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent theoretical investigations have well predicted strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical band gap variations in low&#8208;dimensional materials. However, few 2D materials have been experimentally confirmed to exhibit nonmonotonic optical band gap variation under the varying strain. Here, we observe a strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical bandgap variation in violet phosphorus nanosheets, as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which has been reported in few other 2D materials in our knowledge. The optical bandgap variations are characterized to show the modulation rates of 41 meV/% and &#8208;24 meV/% with compression and tensile strains, respectively. Remarkably, first&#8208;principle calculations predict and clarify the nonmonotonic modulation accurately, highlighting its relationship with the strain direction&#8208;dependent asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions, demonstrating that this unique nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is determined by the distinctive crystal structure of VP. This work provides a deep insight into the design of 2D materials towards optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications via strain engineering.

Abstract
Nanotechnology profoundly affects the advancement of medicine. Limitations in diagnosing and treating cancer and chronic diseases promote the growth of nanomedicine. However, there are few analytical and descriptive studies regarding the trajectory of nanomedicine, key research powers, present research landscape, focal investigative points, and future outlooks. Herein, articles and reviews published in the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection from 1st January 2000 to 18th July 2023 are analyzed. Herein, a bibliometric visualization of publication trends, countries/regions, institutions, journals, research categories, themes, references, and keywords is produced and elaborated. Nanomedicine&#8208;related academic output is increasing in since the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, solidifying the uneven global distribution of research performance. While China leads in terms of publication quantity and has numerous highly productive institutions, the USA has advantages in academic impact, commercialization, and industrial value. Nanomedicine integrates with other disciplines, establishing interdisciplinary platforms, in which drug delivery and nanoparticles remain focal points. Current research focuses on integrating nanomedicine and cell ferroptosis induction in cancer immunotherapy. The keyword &#8220;burst testing&#8221; identifies promising research directions, including immunogenic cell death, chemodynamic therapy, tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, and extracellular vesicles. The prospects, major challenges, and barriers to addressing these directions are discussed.

         <title>Interfacial Rivet to Fill Structural Defects: A Spacer Engineering Gift for 3d Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The combination of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites to passivate surfaces or interfaces with a high concentration of defects shows great promise for improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) efficiency. Constructing high&#8208;quality perovskite film systems by precisely modulating 2D perovskites with good morphologies and growth sites on 3D perovskite films remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of spacer&#8208;engineered surface reactions. In this study, phase&#8208;pure 2D (HA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with a controlled number of layers (n) were separated on a large scale and exploited as interface rivets to optimize 3D perovskite films, resulting in tunable film structural defects and grain boundaries. The optimized PSC system benefits from a reduction in non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in improved optical performance, higher mobility, and lower trap density. The corresponding device achieved a championship power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25%, especially for voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The quality and uniformity of the perovskite films were further confirmed using large&#8208;area devices with an active area of 14 cm2, which exhibited a PCE of more than 21.24%. The high&#8208;quality thin&#8208;film system based on the 2D perovskites presented herein provides a new perspective for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.

         <title>Photo&#8208;annealing of Microtissues Creates High&#8208;Density Capillary Network Containing Living Matter in A Volumetric&#8208;Independent Manner.</title>

Abstract
The vascular tree is crucial for the survival and function of large living tissues. Despite breakthroughs in 3D bioprinting to endow engineered tissues with large blood vessels, there is currently no approach to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks into living tissues in a scalable manner. We here present photo&#8208;annealing of living microtissues (PALM) as a scalable strategy to engineer capillary&#8208;rich tissues. Specifically, in&#8208;air microfluidics was used to produce living microtissues composed of cell&#8208;laden microgels in ultra&#8208;high throughput, which could be photo&#8208;annealed into a monolithic living matter. Annealed microtissues inherently give rise to an open and interconnected pore network within the resulting living matter. Interestingly, utilizing soft microgels enables microgel deformation, which leads to the uniform formation of capillary&#8208;sized pores. Importantly, the ultra&#8208;high throughput nature underlying the microtissue formation uniquely facilitates scalable production of living tissues of clinically relevant sizes (&gt;1 cm3) with an integrated high&#8208;density capillary network. In short, PALM generates monolithic, microporous, modular tissues that meet the previously unsolved need for large engineered tissues containing high&#8208;density vascular networks, which is anticipated to advance the fields of engineered organs, regenerative medicine, and drug screening.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite into Subnanometer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Within the intersection of materials science and nanoscience/technology, extremely downsized (including quantum&#8208;sized and subnanometer&#8208;sized) materials have attracted increasing interest. However, the effective and controllable production of extremely downsized materials through physical strategies remains a great challenge. Herein, we report an all&#8208;physical top&#8208;down method for the production of sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene with completely broken lattice. The graphene subnanometer materials (GSNs) with monolayer structures and lateral sizes of approximately 0.5&#160;nm are obtained. Compared with their bulk, nanosheets, and quantum sheets, the intrinsic GSNs present extremely enhanced photoluminescence and nonlinear saturation absorption performances, as well as unique carrier behavior. The non&#8208;equilibrium states induced by the entirely exposed and broken, intrinsic lattices in sub&#8208;1&#160;nm graphene could be determinative to their extreme performances. Our work shows the great potential of broken lattice and provides new insights towards subnanometer materials.

         <title>Transient Mild Photothermia Improves Therapeutic Performance of Oral Nanomedicines with Enhanced Accumulation in The Colitis Mucosa</title>

Abstract
The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, we constructed high&#8208;performance pluronic F127 (P127)&#8208;modified gold shell (AuS)&#8208;polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR). Under near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the resultant P127&#8208;AuS@CURs generated transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8764;42&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitated their penetration through colonic mucus and favored multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieved intracellular oxidative stress, improved wound healing, and reduced immune responses by polarizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;type macrophages to the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel&#8208;encapsulating P127&#8208;AuS@CURs plus intestinal intra&#8208;lumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127&#8208;AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevated the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae), whose metabolites could also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with anti&#8208;oxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intra&#8208;lumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.

&lt;p&gt;The treatment outcomes of oral medications against ulcerative colitis (UC) have long been restricted by low drug accumulation in the colitis mucosa and subsequent unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Here, we constructed high-performance pluronic F127 (P127)-modified gold shell (AuS)-polymeric core nanotherapeutics loading with curcumin (CUR). Under near-infrared irradiation, the resultant P127-AuS@CURs generated transient mild photothermia (TMP; &#8764;42&#176;C, 10 min), which facilitated their penetration through colonic mucus and favored multiple cellular processes, including cell internalization, lysosomal escape, and controlled CUR release. This strategy relieved intracellular oxidative stress, improved wound healing, and reduced immune responses by polarizing the pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophages to the anti-inflammatory M2-type. Upon oral administration of hydrogel-encapsulating P127-AuS@CURs plus intestinal intra-lumen TMP, their therapeutic effects against acute and chronic UC are demonstrated to be superior to those of a widely used clinical drug, dexamethasone. The treatment of P127-AuS@CURs (+ TMP) elevated the proportions of beneficial bacteria (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/i&gt;), whose metabolites could also mitigate colitis symptoms by regulating genes associated with anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and wound healing. Overall, the intestinal intra-lumen TMP offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic outcomes of noninvasive medicines against UC.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites with Sulfur Defects Toward Superior Ethanol Electrosynthesis from CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from excess CO2 is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here we propose to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro&#8208;driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu&#8208;C and In&#8208;H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C&#8208;C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual&#8208;site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA/cm2 for over 120 hours. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up flow cell is assembled with an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 5.7 A for over 36 hours, in which the carbon loss is less than 2.5% and single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency is around 19%.

&lt;p&gt;The electrosynthesis of multi-carbon chemicals from excess CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here we propose to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro-driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu-C and In-H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate-limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C-C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual-site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for over 120 hours.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as powerful building blocks to develop various soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, superior bio&#8208;compatibility, the ability to conduct both electrons and ions, and multiple stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. However, hydrogels are vulnerable to mechanical damage, which limits their usage in developing durable hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics. Self&#8208;healing hydrogels aim to endow bioelectronics with the property of repairing specific functions after mechanical failure, thus improving their durability, reliability, and longevity. This review discusses recent advances in self&#8208;healing hydrogels, from the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, material chemistry, and strategies for multiple properties improvement of hydrogel materials, to the design, fabrication, and applications of various hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics, including wearable physical and biochemical sensors, supercapacitors, flexible display devices, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), implantable bioelectronics, etc. Furthermore, the persisting challenges hampering the development of self&#8208;healing hydrogel bioelectronics and their prospects are proposed. This review is expected to expedite the research and applications of self&#8208;healing hydrogels for various self&#8208;healing bioelectronics.
