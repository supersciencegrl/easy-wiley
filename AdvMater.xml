         <title>Facet Engineering to Regulate Surface States of Topological Crystalline Insulator Bismuth Rhombic Dodecahedrons for Highly Energy Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological surface states and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap of Bi rhombic dodecahedrons facilitate highly selective formate production in a wide current density range, leading to a high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (maximum value of 69.5%) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This electrocatalyst can potentially be used for intermittent energy storage.








Abstract
Bismuth (Bi) is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI), which has gapless topological surface states (TSSs) protected by a specific crystalline symmetry that strongly depends on the facet. Bi is also a promising electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) electrocatalyst for formate production. In this study, single&#8208;crystalline Bi rhombic dodecahedrons (RDs) exposed with (104) and (110) facets are developed. The Bi RDs demonstrate a very low overpotential and high selectivity for formate production (Faradic efficiency &gt;92.2%)&#160;in a wide partial current density range from 9.8 to 290.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, leading to a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (69.5%) for ECO2RR. The significantly reduced overpotential is caused by the enhanced *OCHO adsorption on the Bi RDs. The high selectivity of formate can be ascribed to the TSSs and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap on Bi RDs, which strengthens and stabilizes the preferentially adsorbed *OCHO and mitigates the competing adsorption of *H during ECO2RR. This study describes a promising application of Bi RDs for high&#8208;rate formate production and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage of intermittent renewable electricity. Optimizing the geometry of TCIs is also proposed as an effective strategy to tune the TSSs of topological catalysts.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds as Versatile Reagents for Extremely Efficient and Reversible Patterning of Graphene with Nanoscale Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene are demonstrated by using hypervalent iodine compounds in combination with laser writing, realizing the first patterned hydroxylation as well as unprecedented degrees of patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation of graphene. The graphene patterning is completely reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over 2D chemical information on graphene.








Abstract
Rational patterning and tailoring of graphene relies on the disclosure of suitable reagents for structuring the target functionalities on the 2D&#8208;carbon network. Here, a series of hypervalent iodine compounds, namely, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxol&#8208;3(1H)&#8208;one, 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole, and 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole is reported to be extremely efficient for a diversified graphene patterning. The decomposition of these compounds generates highly reactive Cl, OH, and CF3 radicals exclusively in the irradiated areas, which subsequently attach onto the graphene leading to locally controlled chlorination, hydroxylation, and trifluoromethylation, respectively. This is the first realization of a patterned hydroxylation of graphene, and the degrees of functionalization of the patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation are both unprecedented. The usage of these mild reagents here is reasonably facile compared to the reported methods using hazardous Cl2 or ICl and allows for sophisticated pattern designs with nanoscale precision, promising for arbitrary nanomanipulation of graphene's properties like hydrophilicity and conductivity by the three distinct functionalities (Cl, OH, and CF3). Moreover, the attachment of functional entities to these highly functionalized graphene nanoarchitectures is fully reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling a full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over the chemical information stored within graphene. This work provides an exciting clue for target 2D functionalization and modulation of graphene by using suitable hypervalent iodine compounds.

         <title>2D High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide alloys containing 4 or 5 transition metals are synthesized based on first&#8208;principles stability predictions. The 5&#8208;component alloy (MoWVNbTa)S2 is shown to be an excellent electrocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 into CO. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that a small concentration of highly active sites is responsible for the high activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys combine multiple principal elements at a near equal fraction to form vast compositional spaces to achieve outstanding functionalities that are absent in alloys with one or two principal elements. Here, the prediction, synthesis, and multiscale characterization of 2D high&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) alloys with four/five transition metals is reported. Of these, the electrochemical performance of a five&#8208;component alloy with the highest configurational entropy, (MoWVNbTa)S2, is investigated for CO2 conversion to CO, revealing an excellent current density of 0.51 A cm&#8722;2 and a turnover frequency of 58.3 s&#8722;1 at &#8776; &#8722;0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the superior CO2 electroreduction is due to a multi&#8208;site catalysis wherein the atomic&#8208;scale disorder optimizes the rate&#8208;limiting step of CO desorption by facilitating isolated transition metal edge sites with weak CO binding. 2D high&#8208;entropy TMDC alloys provide a materials platform to design superior catalysts for many electrochemical systems.

         <title>Manipulating Ferromagnetism in Few&#8208;Layered Cr2Ge2Te6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ionic conductors as the gate dielectric, the easy&#8208;axis of the ferromagnetism of Cr2Ge2Te6 thin flakes can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to the in&#8208;plane direction by an electric field, coinciding with a significant increase of the Curie temperature. The surface of the sample is fully exposed in this type of devices, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible.








Abstract
The discovery of magnetism in 2D materials offers new opportunities for exploring novel quantum states and developing spintronic devices. In this work, using field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ion conductors as the gate dielectric (SIC&#8208;FETs), we&#160;have observed a significant enhancement of ferromagnetism associated with magnetic easy&#8208;axis switching in few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. The easy axis of the magnetization, inferred from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to an in&#8208;plane direction by electric field in the few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. Additionally, the Curie temperature, obtained from both the Hall resistance and magnetoresistance measurements, increases from 65 to 180 K in the few&#8208;layered sample by electric gating. Moreover, the surface of the sample is fully exposed in the SIC&#8208;FET device configuration, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible. This work offers an excellent platform for realizing electrically controlled quantum phenomena in a single device.

Electroadhesion&#8208;based haptics technology has received substantial attention in recent years and has seen a rapidly expanding inclusion in current ubiquitous interactive touch surfaces. This work studies the underlying multiphysics mechanism at the nanoasperity level and provides a novel insight for the design and optimization of future electroadhesive finger&#8211;device interfaces for higher efficiency and reduced variability.








Abstract
With the ubiquity of touch screens and the commercialization of electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices, modeling tools that capture the multiphysical phenomena within the finger&#8211;device interface and their interaction are critical to design devices that achieve higher performance and reliability at lower cost. While electroadhesion has successfully demonstrated the capability to change tactile perception through friction modulation, the mechanism of electroadhesion in the finger&#8211;device interface is still unclear, partly due to the complex interfacial physics including contact deformation, capillary formation, electric field, and their complicated coupling effects that have not been addressed comprehensively. A multiphysics model is presented here to predict the friction force for finger&#8211;surface tactile interactions at the nanoscale. The nanoscopic multiphysical phenomena are coupled to study the impacts of nanotexture and surface energy in the touch interface. With macroscopic friction force measurements as verification, the model is further used to propose textures that have maximum electroadhesion effect and minimum sensitivity to relative humidity and user perspiration rate. This model can guide the performance improvement of future electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices and other touch&#8208;based human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Emulsion&#8208;Guided Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Particles: Droplet Size Determines Particle Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of a series of novel anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) using an emulsion&#8208;templating method is described. The geometry of the APPs is determined by the average size of the oil droplets, based on a new mechanism. The APPs can be converted to anisotropic carbon particles with their architectures, which can be used as electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
Anisotropic particles have attracted significant attention due to their alluring features that distinguish them from isotropic particles. One of the most appealing strategies for the synthesis of anisotropic particles is the emulsion&#8208;guided method. However, morphological control and the understanding of formation mechanisms have remained a major challenge. Based on a novel mechanism, here, a facile one&#8208;pot emulsion&#8208;templating method for the tunable construction of anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) with different defined structures is reported. Three types of monocomponent APPs with new morphologies and sizes in the range of 240&#8211;650&#160;nm, including Janus mushroom&#8208;like mesoporous poly(m&#8208;phenylenediamine) (PmPD) particles, wheel&#8208;shaped particles, and acorn&#8208;like PmPD particles, are obtained by controlling the average size of the oil droplets in the emulsion. Furthermore, the APPs demonstrate the ability for conversion to nitrogen&#8208;doped anisotropic carbon particles (ACPs) by pyrolysis at 800&#160;&#176;C under a N2 atmosphere, thereby inheriting their structures. These novel ACPs show appreciable potential as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for use in oxygen reduction reactions. Compared to their isotropic counterpart, these ACPs exhibit remarkable advantages such as enhanced specific surface area and pore volume, reduced stacking density, and easy fabrication of continuous and uniform membrane electrodes.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Activatable Dynamic Nanoparticles Boosting Ferroptotic Cell Death for Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable nanoparticles integrating dynamic covalent bonds are developed for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor RSL&#8208;3 and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Nanoparticle&#8208;based GPX4 inhibition and PDT significantly promote the ferroptotic death of tumor cells and activate the T&#8208;cell immune response for inhibiting tumor growth and suppressing distant metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy shows promising therapeutic potential for long&#8208;term tumor regression. However, current cancer immunotherapy displays a low response rate due to insufficient immunogenicity of the tumor cells. To address these challenges, herein, intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable dynamic nanoparticles for eliciting immunogenicity by inducing ferroptosis of the tumor cells are engineered. The nanoparticles are engineered by integrating an ionizable block copolymer and acid&#8208;liable phenylboronate ester (PBE) dynamic covalent bonds for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of the ferroptosis inducer, a glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor RSL&#8208;3. The nanoparticles can stably encapsulate RSL&#8208;3 inside the hydrophobic core via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction with the PBE groups at neutral pH (pH = 7.4), while releasing the payload in the endocytic vesicles (pH = 5.8&#8211;6.2) by acidity&#8208;triggered cleavage of the PBE dynamic covalent bonds. Furthermore, the nanoparticles can perform acid&#8208;activatable photodynamic therapy&#160;by protonation of the ionizable core, and significantly recruit tumor&#8208;infiltrating T lymphocytes for interferon gamma secretion, and thus sensitize the tumor cells to RSL&#8208;3&#8208;inducible ferroptosis. The combination of nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis and blockade of programmed death ligand 1&#160;efficiently inhibits growth of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma tumor and lung metastasis of 4T1 breast tumors, suggesting the promising potential of ferroptosis induction for promoting cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Progress of Nonprecious&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water oxidation also known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for hydrogen generation and carbon dioxide reduction. This review comprehensively summarizes the thermodynamics, Pourbaix diagram, theoretical screening and prediction, catalytic performance, as well as reaction kinetics and mechanisms of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER.








Abstract
Water oxidation, or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which combines two oxygen atoms from two water molecules and releases one oxygen molecule, plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for the hydrogen generation, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen fixation. The multielectron transfer OER process involves multiple reaction intermediates, and a high overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics. Among the different water splitting devices, proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer offers greater advantages. However, current anode OER electrocatalysts in PEM electrolyzers are limited to precious iridium and ruthenium oxides. Developing highly active, stable, and precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic media is attractive for the large&#8208;scale application of PEM electrolyzers. In recent years, various types of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts such as carbon&#8208;based materials, earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides, and multiple metal oxide mixtures have been investigated and some of them show promising activity and stability for acidic OER. In this review, the thermodynamics of water oxidation, Pourbaix diagram of metal elements in aqueous solution, and theoretical screening and prediction of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER are first elaborated. The catalytic performance, reaction kinetics, and mechanisms together with future research directions regarding acidic OER are summarized and discussed.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Self&#8208;Healing Polymers and Devices for Extreme and Hostile Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural systems, a self&#8208;healing function provides exceptional advantages to enhance the robustness and stability of engineering materials, components, and devices. Self&#8208;healing in extreme or harsh environments, such as those in space, the deep ocean, and nuclear applications, are considered. The self&#8208;healing functions, operation mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities are discussed.








Abstract
Engineering materials and devices can be damaged during their service life as a result of mechanical fatigue, punctures, electrical breakdown, and electrochemical corrosion. This damage can lead to unexpected failure during operation, which requires regular inspection, repair, and replacement of the products, resulting in additional energy consumption and cost. During operation in challenging, extreme, or harsh environments, such as those encountered in high or low temperature, nuclear, offshore, space, and deep mining environments, the robustness and stability of materials and devices are extremely important. Over recent decades, significant effort has been invested into improving the robustness and stability of materials through either structural design, the introduction of new chemistry, or improved manufacturing processes. Inspired by natural systems, the creation of self&#8208;healing materials has the potential to overcome these challenges and provide a route to achieve dynamic repair during service. Current research on self&#8208;healing polymers remains in its infancy, and self&#8208;healing behavior under harsh and extreme conditions is a particularly untapped area of research. Here, the self&#8208;healing mechanisms and performance of materials under a variety of harsh environments are discussed. An overview of polymer&#8208;based devices developed for a range of challenging environments is provided, along with areas for future research.

The most powerful electric fish, the Atlantic torpedo ray, uses sheet&#8208;like electrically active cells within its electric organs to produce external electrical discharges of up to 1&#160;kW. A paper&#8208;based artificial electric organ is presented, which mimics the torpedo strategies for optimal power generation, resulting in a small and potentially biocompatible energy&#8208;storage device capable of operating real&#8208;world electronics.








Abstract
Strongly electric fish use gradients of ions within their bodies to generate stunning external electrical discharges; the most powerful of these organisms, the Atlantic torpedo ray, can produce pulses of over 1&#160;kW from its electric organs. Despite extensive study of this phenomenon in nature, the development of artificial power generation schemes based on ion gradients for portable, wearable, or implantable human use has remained out of reach. Previously, an artificial electric organ inspired by the electric eel demonstrated that electricity generated from ion gradients within stacked hydrogels can exceed 100&#160;V. The current of this power source, however, was&#160;too low to power standard electronics. Here, an artificial electric organ inspired by the unique morphologies of torpedo rays for maximal current output is introduced. This power source uses a hybrid material of hydrogel&#8208;infused paper to create, organize, and reconfigure stacks of thin, arbitrarily large gel films in series and in parallel. The resulting increase in electrical power by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the original eel&#8208;inspired design makes it possible to power electronic devices and establishes that biology's mechanism of generating significant electrical power can now be realized from benign and soft materials in a portable size.

         <title>Orthorhombic Cobalt Ditelluride with Te Vacancy Defects Anchoring on Elastic MXene Enables Efficient Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) are successfully fabricated to enhance performance in potassium storage. The o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode displays extraordinary structural stability, superior reversible capacity, exceptional rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability, as well as reliable operation in flexible advanced potassium&#8208;ion full batteries.








Abstract
The fast and reversible potassiation/depotassiation of anode materials remains an elusive yet intriguing goal. Herein, a class of the P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires with Te vacancy defects supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) is designed and prepared, taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the conductive o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2 arrays with rich Te vacancy defects and the elastic MXene sheets with self&#8208;autoadjustable function. Consequently, the o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene superstructure exhibits boosted potassium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of high reversible capacity (373.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles), remarkable rate capability (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cyclability (0.011% capacity decay per cycle over 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1), representing the best performance in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenides&#8208;based anodes to date. Impressively, the flexible full battery with o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode achieves a satisfying energy density of 275&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high bending stability. The kinetics analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal superior pseudocapacitive property, high electronic conductivity, and favorable K+ ion adsorption and diffusion capability, corroborating fast K+ ion storage. Especially, ex situ characterizations confirm o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene undergoes reversible evolutions of initially proceeding with the K+ ion insertion, followed by the conversion reaction mechanism.

         <title>Construction of Supercapacitor&#8208;Based Ionic Diodes with Adjustable Bias Directions by Using Poly(ionic liquid) Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;regulation strategy to design bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable supercapacitor&#8208;diodes is demonstrated. Such multifunctional devices show excellent charge&#8208;storage performance and rectification performance, which fills a gap in the current capacitive ionic diodes.








Abstract
The newly emerging supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode), integrating the characteristics of a diode into an electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor, can be employed to extend conventional supercapacitors to new technological applications and may play a crucial role in grid stabilization, signal propagation, and logic operations. However, the reported CAPodes have only been able to realize charge storage in the positive&#8208;bias direction. Here, bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable CAPodes realized by using a polycation&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) or a polyanion&#8208;based IL as electrolyte in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;based supercapacitor architecture are proposed. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage function at only the positive&#8208; or negative&#8208;bias direction with a high rectification ratio (&#8776;80% for rectification ratio II, RRII) and an outstanding cycling life (4500 cycles), representing a crucial breakthrough for designing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>Photoluminescence of Fully Inorganic Colloidal Gold Nanocluster and Their Manipulation Using Surface Charge Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size&#8208;controlled generation of fully inorganic gold nanoclusters is demonstrated by a modern laser&#8208;based synthesis method. These colloidal species exhibit a bright blue photoluminescence, for which the intensity is a direct function of the surface charge density adjustable by the pH of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, these particles offer the opportunity to dedicate photoluminescence to core and surface state transitions.








Abstract
Fully inorganic, colloidal gold nanoclusters (NCs) constitute a new class of nanomaterials that are clearly distinguishable from their commonly studied metal&#8211;organic ligand&#8208;capped counterparts. As their synthesis by chemical methods is challenging, details about their optical properties remain widely unknown. In this work, laser fragmentation in liquids is performed to produce fully inorganic and size&#8208;controlled colloidal gold NCs with monomodal particle size distributions and an fcc&#8208;like structure. Results reveal that these NCs exhibit highly pronounced photoluminescence with quantum yields of 2%. The emission behavior of small (2&#8211;2.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall (&lt;1&#160;nm) NCs is significantly different and dominated by either core&#8208; or surface&#8208;based emission states. It is further verified that emission intensities are a function of the surface charge density, which is easily controllable by the pH of the surrounding medium. This experimentally observed correlation between surface charge and photoluminescence emission intensity is confirmed by density functional theoretical simulations, demonstrating that fully inorganic NCs provide an appropriate material to bridge the gap between experimental and computational studies of NCs. The presented study deepens the understanding of electronic structures in fully inorganic colloidal gold NCs and how to systematically tune their optical properties via surface charge density and particle size.

         <title>Significant Performance Improvement in n&#8208;Channel Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with C60:C70 Co&#8208;Crystals Induced by Poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) Nanodots</title>

18&#8208;fold enhanced electron mobility is achieved for n&#8208;channel organic field&#8208;effect transistors with co&#8208;crystalized C60:C70 blend films formed on the nanodot structured dipolar poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz) interlayers that also reduce the work function of the electrodes. The PEOz nanodot layers further deliver high spatial uniformity in electron mobility and enhance device stability for transistor array fabrication.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted great interest due to their potential as logic devices for bendable and flexible electronics. In relation to n&#8208;channel structures, soluble fullerene semiconductors have been widely studied. However, they have not yet met the essential requirements for commercialization, primarily because of low charge carrier mobility, immature large&#8208;scale fabrication processes, and insufficient long&#8208;term operational stability. Interfacial engineering of the carrier&#8208;injecting source/drain (S/D) electrodes has been proposed as an effective approach to improve charge injection, leading also to overall improved device characteristics. Here, it is demonstrated that a non&#8208;conjugated neutral dipolar polymer, poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz), formed as a nanodot structure on the S/D electrodes, enhances electron mobility in n&#8208;channel OFETs using a range of soluble fullerenes. Overall performance is especially notable for (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) and (C70&#8208;D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene (C70) blend films, with an increase from 0.1 to 2.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The high relative mobility and eighteen&#8208;fold improvement are attributed not only to the anticipated reduction in S/D electrode work function but also to the beneficial effects of PEOz on the formation of a face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic C60:C70 co&#8208;crystal structure within the blend films.

&lt;p&gt;18-fold enhanced electron mobility is achieved for n-channel organic field-effect transistors with co-crystalized C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;:C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; blend films formed on the nanodot structured dipolar poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOz) interlayers that also reduce the work function of the electrodes. The PEOz nanodot layers further deliver high spatial uniformity in electron mobility and enhance device stability for transistor array fabrication.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution-processed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted great interest due to their potential as logic devices for bendable and flexible electronics. In relation to n-channel structures, soluble fullerene semiconductors have been widely studied. However, they have not yet met the essential requirements for commercialization, primarily because of low charge carrier mobility, immature large-scale fabrication processes, and insufficient long-term operational stability. Interfacial engineering of the carrier-injecting source/drain (S/D) electrodes has been proposed as an effective approach to improve charge injection, leading also to overall improved device characteristics. Here, it is demonstrated that a non-conjugated neutral dipolar polymer, poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOz), formed as a nanodot structure on the S/D electrodes, enhances electron mobility in n-channel OFETs using a range of soluble fullerenes. Overall performance is especially notable for (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;)[5,6]fullerene (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) and (C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;-D&lt;sub&gt;5h(6)&lt;/sub&gt;)[5,6]fullerene (C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;) blend films, with an increase from 0.1 to 2.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The high relative mobility and eighteen-fold improvement are attributed not only to the anticipated reduction in S/D electrode work function but also to the beneficial effects of PEOz on the formation of a face-centered-cubic C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;:C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; co-crystal structure within the blend films.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Expanding Biomaterial Surface Topographical Design Space through Natural Surface Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topographical design space is immense, with many geometries existing. To explore this design space on cell behavior, the TopoChip is utilized with 2176 unique microtopographies. Nevertheless, phenotypical readouts are potentially lost due to an incomplete design space coverage. This coverage is expanded effectively in this work by including natural surfaces such as the red rose, leading to novel phenotypical discoveries.








Abstract
Surface topography is a tool to endow biomaterials with bioactive properties. However, the large number of possible designs makes it challenging to find the optimal surface structure to induce a specific cell response. The TopoChip platform is currently the largest collection of topographies with 2176 in silico designed microtopographies. Still, it is exploring only a small part of the design space due to design algorithm limitations and the surface engineering strategy. Inspired by the diversity of natural surfaces, it is assessed as to what extent the topographical design space and consequently the resulting cellular responses can be expanded using natural surfaces. To this end, 26 plant and insect surfaces are replicated in polystyrene and their surface properties are quantified using white light interferometry. Through machine&#8208;learning algorithms, it is demonstrated that natural surfaces extend the design space of the TopoChip, which coincides with distinct morphological and focal adhesion profiles in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Furthermore, differentiation experiments reveal the strong potential of the holy lotus to improve osteogenesis in MSCs. In the future, the design algorithms will be trained with the results obtained by natural surface imprint experiments to explore the bioactive properties of novel surface topographies.

         <title>Modulation of Negative Differential Resistance in Black Phosphorus Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of room&#8208;temperature negative differential resistance (NDR) is demonstrated in 2D ambipolar semiconductor transistors. The NDR device, which is activated by specific electrical field dependence of lateral carrier distribution and occurs in the transistor saturation regime, exhibits a high current peak and superior gate and light tunability, opening new avenues for designing future electronics devices.








Abstract
Negative differential resistance (NDR), which describes the current decrease as the applied bias increases, holds great potential for varieties of electronic applications including radio&#8208;frequency oscillators, multipliers, and multivalue logics. Here, the modulation of a unique NDR effect in ambipolar black phosphorus (BP) transistors is reported, which is activated by specific electrical field dependence of lateral carrier distribution and is distinct from conventional NDR devices that rely on quantum tunneling. The NDR device exhibits a high peak current density (34 &#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1) and a high operating temperature. More importantly, due to the strong coupling between the channel and the gate electrode, both the NDR peak current and peak/valley voltages can be effectively modulated by the electrostatic gate. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that light can serve as an additional terminal for NDR modulation. The findings could provide an important insight into the transport behavior of BP transistors and contribute to the design of ambipolar&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based electrical circuits.

         <title>Correlated Magnetic Weyl Semimetal State in Strained Pr2Ir2O7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel correlated magnetic Weyl semimetal state with logarithmic renormalization is experimentally realized in the high&#8208;quality strained film of Pr2Ir2O7. Strain&#8208;induced all&#8208;in&#8211;all&#8208;out antiferromagnetic ordering breaks time&#8208;reversal symmetry and leads to the magnetic Weyl semimetal state. Combing the experimental results and renormalization group calculations, an interacting Weyl semimetal state with logarithmic Fermi velocity renormalization is reported, dressed by long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions.








Abstract
Correlated topological phases (CTPs) with interplay between topology and electronic correlations have attracted tremendous interest in condensed matter physics. Therein, correlated Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are rare in nature and, thus, have so far been less investigated experimentally. In particular, the experimental realization of the interacting WSM state with logarithmic Fermi velocity renormalization has not been achieved yet. Here, experimental evidence of a correlated magnetic WSM state with logarithmic renormalization in strained pyrochlore iridate Pr2Ir2O7 (PIO) which is a paramagnetic Luttinger semimetal in bulk, is reported. Benefitting from epitaxial strain, &#8220;bulk&#8208;absent&#8221; all&#8208;in&#8211;all&#8208;out antiferromagnetic ordering can be stabilized in PIO film, which breaks time&#8208;reversal symmetry and leads to a magnetic WSM state. With further analysis of the experimental data and renormalization group calculations, an interacting Weyl liquid state with logarithmically renormalized Fermi velocity, similar to that in graphene, is found, dressed by long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions. This work highlights the interplay of strain, magnetism, and topology with electronic correlations, and paves the way for strain&#8208;engineering of CTPs in pyrochlore iridates.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Elastomer&#8208;Actuated Reconfigurable Microscale Kirigami Metastructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable and reconfigurable metasurfaces at the microscale are achieved by using uniaxially aligned liquid crystal elastomer film as artificial muscle to thermally actuate kirigami microstructures 3D&#8208;printed via the two&#8208;photon polymerization technique. This strategy paves the way to a host of potential applications, such as tunable phononic/photonic crystals, optoelectronics, biomedical devices, camouflage, microelectromechanical systems, and soft microrobots.








Abstract
Programmable actuation of metastructures with predesigned geometrical configurations has recently drawn significant attention in many applications, such as smart structures, medical devices, soft robotics, prosthetics, and wearable devices. Despite remarkable progress in this field, achieving wireless miniaturized reconfigurable metastructures remains a challenge due to the difficult nature of the fabrication and actuation processes at the micrometer scale. Herein, microscale thermo&#8208;responsive reconfigurable metasurfaces using stimuli&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) is fabricated as an artificial muscle for reconfiguring the 2D microscale kirigami structures. Such structures are fabricated via two&#8208;photon polymerization with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Through rationally designed experiments guided by simulations, the optimal formulation of the LCE artificial muscle is explored and the relationship between shape transformation behaviors and geometrical parameters of the kirigami structures is build. As a proof of concept demonstration, the constructs for temperature&#8208;dependent switching and information encryption is applied. Such reconfigurable kirigami metastructures have significant potential for boosting the fundamental small&#8208;scale metastructure research and the design and fabrication of wireless functional devices, wearables, and soft robots at the microscale as well.

         <title>Expansion Microscopy with Multifunctional Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of engineered multifunctional polymer dots enabling biomolecular targeting, gel anchoring, and high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence is reported for expansion microcopy. The average brightness values of the polymer dots range from 3 to 6 times higher than those of commercial dyes. By combining sample expansion with super&#8208;resolution imaging, subcellular structures of &#8776;30&#160;nm can be resolved using conventional microscopes.








Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) provides nanoscale resolution on conventional microscopes via physically enlarging specimens with swellable polyelectrolyte gels. However, challenges involving fluorophore degradation and dilution during sample expansion have yet to be overcome. Herein, sequential cellular targeting, gel anchoring, and high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence reported using multifunctional polymer dots (Pdots) designed for ExM applications are demonstrated. The impressive brightness of the Pdots facilitates multicolor ExM, thereby enabling visualization of a variety of subcellular structures and neuron synapses. The average fluorescence intensities of Pdots in ExM range from &#8776;3 to 6 times higher than those achieved using commercially available Alexa dyes. Moreover, the fluorescence brightness and optical fluctuation are significantly improved by a surfactant&#8208;containing expansion buffer, which enables further resolution enhancement via super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). The combination of ExM and SOFI allows subcellular structures of &#8776;30&#160;nm to be resolved by conventional microscopes. These results highlight the immense potential of multifunctional Pdots for ExM&#8208;enhanced super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Golden Vaterite as a Mesoscopic Metamaterial for Biophotonic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoscopic biofrendly metamaterial, which includes a sub&#8208;micrometer vaterite spherulite infiltrated with gold nanoseeds, is presented. Highly controllable gold loading leads to a variety of electric and magnetic Mie resonances, covering first and second biological transparency windows 700&#8211;1300 nm. The great potential for biophotonic applications is exemplified by demonstration of efficient spherulites laser heating at red and near&#8208;infrared wavelengths.








Abstract
Mesoscopic photonic systems with tailored optical responses have great potential to open new frontiers in implantable biomedical devices. However, biocompatibility is typically a problem, as engineering of optical properties often calls for using toxic compounds and chemicals, unsuitable for in vivo applications. Here, a unique approach to biofriendly delivery of optical resonances is demonstrated. It is shown that the controllable infusion of gold nanoseeds into polycrystalline sub&#8208;micrometer vaterite spherulites gives rise to a variety of electric and magnetic Mie resonances, producing a tuneable mesoscopic optical metamaterial. The 3D reconstruction of the spherulites demonstrates the capability of controllable gold loading with volumetric filling factors exceeding 28%. Owing to the biocompatibility of the constitutive elements, &#8220;golden vaterite&#8221; paves the way to introduce designer&#8208;made Mie resonances to cutting&#8208;edge biophotonic applications. This concept is exemplified by showing efficient laser heating of gold&#8208;filled vaterite spherulites at red and near&#8208;infrared wavelengths, highly desirable in photothermal therapy, and photoacoustic tomography.

         <title>Surface Wettability of Nanoparticle Modulated Sonothrombolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;wettability&#8208;modulated nanoparticles are designed to investigate the mechanism of sonodynamic therapy. The wettability of nanoparticles is related to the desorption energy between nanoparticles and nanobubbles. The higher desorption energy of the system contributes to higher stability of nanobubbles, more cavitation nuclei sites, higher reactive oxygen species yield, and higher sonothrombolysis efficiency.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non&#8208;invasive and highly penetrating treatment strategy under ultrasound irradiation. However, uncertainty in the mechanism of SDT has seriously hindered its future clinical application. Here, the mechanism of SDT enhanced by the wettability of nanoparticles is investigated. Nanoparticles can adsorb and stabilize nanobubbles in liquid, thus enhancing SDT efficiency. The stability of the nanobubbles is positively correlated with the desorption energy of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the wettability of the nanoparticles. This conclusion is verified for mesoporous silica and polystyrene nanoparticles and it is found that nanoparticles with a water contact angle of about 90&#176; possess the largest desorption energy. To further apply this conclusion, thrombus models are constructed on rats and the experimental results demonstrate that nanoparticles with the largest desorption energy have the highest thrombolytic efficiency. It is believed that these findings will help to better understand the SDT mechanism and guide new strategies for rational design of nanoparticles adopted in SDT.

         <title>Boosting Selective Nitrogen Reduction via Geometric Coordination Engineering on Single&#8208;Tungsten&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of W single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with N and O dual&#8208;coordination (W&#8208;oxygen and nitrogen coordination NO/NC) is prepared to achieve excellent electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. The unique electronic structures optimize the binding energy of NRR intermediate, resulting in facilitating the selectivity and activity of NRR. This opens an avenue toward exploring the correlation between coordination structure and properties.








Abstract
Atomic interface regulation that can efficiently optimize the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is a worthwhile research topic. The challenge lies in deeply understanding the structure&#8211;properties correlation based on control of the coordination chemistry of individual atoms. Herein, a new kind of W SACs with oxygen and nitrogen coordination (W&#8208;NO/NC) and a high metal loading over 10 wt% is facilely prepared by introducing an oxygen&#8208;bridged [WO4] tetrahedron. The local structure and coordination environment of the W SACs are confirmed by high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The catalyst shows excellent selectivity and activity for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Density functional theory calculation reveals that unique electronic structures of the N and O dual&#8208;coordinated W sites optimize the binding energy of the NRR intermediate, resulting in facilitating the electrocatalytic NRR. This work opens an avenue toward exploring the correlation between coordination structure and properties.

         <title>An Oligonucleotide&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Responsive Organic Transistor for Platinum&#8208;Drug&#8208;Induced DNA&#8208;Damage Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With specific responsiveness to oligonucleotide distortion on the surface of organic semiconductors, a double&#8208;stranded&#8208;DNA&#8208;functionalized organic thin&#8208;film transistor can  detect platinum&#8208;drug&#8208;induced DNA damage at single&#8208;site level. The organic&#8208;transistor&#8208;based ultrasensitive DNA&#8208;damage sensor can be further integrated into arrayed biochips for high&#8208;throughput DNA&#8208;damage analysis under different environmental conditions.








Abstract
Organic transistor with DNA&#8208;damage evaluation ability can open up novel opportunities for bioelectronic devices. Even though trace amounts of drugs can cause cumulative gene damage in vivo, the extremely low occurrence proportion makes them hardly transduced into detectable electric signals. Here, an ultrasensitive DNA&#8208;damage sensor based on an oligonucleotide&#8208;distortion&#8208;responsive organic transistor (DROT) is reported by creating controllable conformation change of double&#8208;stranded DNA on the surface of organic semiconductors. In combination with interfacial charge redistribution and efficient signal amplification, the DROT provides an ultrasensitive single&#8208;site DNA&#8208;damage response with 20.5 s even upon 1 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m cisplatin. The high generalizability of this DROT to three generations of classical platinum drugs and gene&#8208;relevant DNA damage is demonstrated. A biochip is further designed for intelligent damage analysis in complex environments, which holds the potential for high&#8208;throughput biotoxicity evaluation and drug screening in the future.

         <title>10 &#956;m&#8208;Thick High&#8208;Strength Solid Polymer Electrolytes with Excellent Interface Compatibility for Flexible All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

10 &#956;m&#8208;thick high&#8208;strength solid polymer electrolytes with an ultrahigh room&#8208;temperature ionic conductance of 34.84&#160;mS are presented. They possess excellent interfacial stability with the lithium anode. The derived flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries, employing LiFePO4 or LiCoO2 as cathode materials, exhibit excellent cycling stability as well as high rate capability.








Abstract
An ultrathin solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) consisting of modified polyethylene (PE) as the host and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate and lithium salts as fillers is presented. The porous poly(methyl methacrylate)&#8211;polystyrene interface layers closely attached on both sides of the PE effectively improve the interface compatibility among electrolytes and electrodes. The resultant 10 &#956;m&#8208;thick SPEs possess an ultrahigh ionic conductance of 34.84&#160;mS at room temperature and excellent mechanical properties of 103.0&#160;MPa with elongation up to 142.3%. The Li//Li symmetric cell employing an optimized solid electrolyte can stably cycle more than 1500&#160;h at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the LiFePO4//Li pouch cell can stably cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#160;C rate and with a capacity retention of 76.4% from 148.9 to 113.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C. The LiCoO2//Li pouch cell can stably operate at 0.1 and 0.2&#160;C rate for each 100 cycles. Furthermore, the LiFePO4//Li pouch cell can work stably after curling and folding, which proves its excellent flexibility and safety simultaneously. This work offers a promising strategy to realize ultrathinness, excellent compatibility, high strength, as well as safe solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Solvent Li&#8208;Ion Solvation Enables High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to optimize the electrolyte formulations for Li&#8208;metal batteries. Li&#8208;ion solvating fluorinated molecules with increasing chain lengths are used as main&#8208;solvents to promote electrolyte stability. 1,2&#8208;Dimethoxyethane (DME) is used as the co&#8208;solvent to enhance the ionic conductivity. The resulting 1&#160;m LiFSI/6FDMH&#8208;DME electrolyte enables dual&#8208;solvent Li&#8208;ion solvation environments, inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and long cycling of Li&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Novel electrolyte designs to further enhance the lithium (Li) metal battery cyclability are highly desirable. Here, fluorinated 1,6&#8208;dimethoxyhexane (FDMH) is designed and synthesized as the solvent molecule to promote electrolyte stability with its prolonged &#8211;CF2&#8211; backbone. Meanwhile, 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is used as a co&#8208;solvent to enable higher ionic conductivity and much reduced interfacial resistance. Combining the dual&#8208;solvent system with 1 m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), high Li&#8208;metal Coulombic efficiency (99.5%) and oxidative stability (6&#160;V) are achieved. Using this electrolyte, 20&#160;&#181;m&#160;Li||NMC batteries are able to retain &#8776;80% capacity after 250 cycles and Cu||NMC anode&#8208;free pouch cells last 120 cycles with 75% capacity retention under &#8776;2.1&#160;&#181;L&#160;mAh&#8722;1 lean electrolyte conditions. Such high performances are attributed to the anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, originating from the coordination of Li&#8208;ions to the highly stable FDMH and multiple anions in their solvation environments. This work demonstrates a new electrolyte design strategy that enables high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries with multisolvent Li&#8208;ion solvation with rationally optimized molecular structure and ratio.

         <title>3D Printing of Monolithic Capillarity&#8208;Driven Microfluidic Devices for Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel powder&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing method enables monolithic capillarity&#8208;driven microfluidic devices. Precise spatial control over the internal surface chemistry of porous bodies enables fabrication of microfluidic devices capable of multistep laboratory assays in a self&#8208;contained format.








Abstract
Rapid diagnostic testing at the site of the patient is essential when a fully equipped laboratory is not accessible. To maximize the impact of this approach, low&#8208;cost, disposable tests that require minimal user&#8208;interference and external equipment are desired. Fluid transport by capillary wicking removes the need for bulky ancillary equipment to actuate and control fluid flow. Nevertheless, current microfluidic paper&#8208;based analytical devices based on this principle struggle with the implementation of multistep diagnostic protocols because of fabrication&#8208;related issues. Here, 3D&#8208;printed microfluidic devices are demonstrated in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay in which a multistep assay timeline is completed by precisely engineering capillary wetting within printed porous bodies. 3D printing provides a scalable route to low&#8208;cost microfluidic devices and obviates the assembly of discrete components. The resulting rapid and seamless transition between digital data and physical objects allows for rapid design iterations, and opens up perspectives on distributed manufacturing.

         <title>Surpassing 13% Efficiency for Polythiophene Organic Solar Cells Processed from Nonhalogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient polythiophene&#8208;based organic solar cell (OSC) is demonstrated based on a fluorinated polythiophene donor with deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and appropriate miscibility with the acceptor. With further interfacial modification by a fullerene self&#8208;assembled monolayer, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.65% for polythiophene&#8208;based OSCs is achieved with the device processed from nonhalogenated solvent.








Abstract
Benefiting from low cost and simple synthesis, polythiophene (PT) derivatives are one of the most popular donor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, polythiophene&#8208;based OSCs still suffer from inferior power conversion efficiency (PCE) than those based on donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type conjugated polymers. Herein, a fluorinated polythiophene derivative, namely P4T2F&#8208;HD, is introduced to modulate the miscibility and morphology of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)&#8208;active layer, leading to a significant improvement of the OSC performance. The Flory&#8211;Huggins interaction parameters calculated from the surface energy and differential scanning calorimetry results suggest that P4T2F&#8208;HD shows moderate miscibility with the popular nonfullerene acceptor Y6&#8208;BO (2,2&#8242;&#8208;((2Z,2&#8242;Z)&#8208;((12,13&#8208;bis(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;3,9&#8208;diundecyl&#8208;12,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;e]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4&#8242;,5&#8242;]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;g]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;2,10&#8208;diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diylidene))dimalononitrile), while poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is very miscible with Y6&#8208;BO. As a result, the P4T2F&#8208;HD case forms desired nanoscale phase separation in the BHJ film while the P3HT case forms a completely mixed BHJ film, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS). By optimizing the cathode interface and the morphology of the P4T2F&#8208;HD:Y6&#8208;BO films processed from nonhalogenated solvents, a new record PCE of 13.65% for polythiophene&#8208;based OSCs is demonstrated. This work highlights the importance of controlling D/A interactions for achieving desired morphology and also demonstrates a promising OSC system for potential cost&#8208;effective organic photovoltaics.

The Flory&#8211;Huggins interaction parameters calculated from the surface energy and differential scanning calorimetry results suggest that P4T2F-HD shows moderate miscibility with the popular nonfullerene acceptor Y6-BO (2,2&#8242;-((2&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,2&#8242;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-((12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4&#8242;,5&#8242;]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile), while poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is very miscible with Y6-BO. As a result, the P4T2F-HD case forms desired nanoscale phase separation in the BHJ film while the P3HT case forms a completely mixed BHJ film, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). By optimizing the cathode interface and the morphology of the P4T2F-HD:Y6-BO films processed from nonhalogenated solvents, a new record PCE of 13.65% for polythiophene-based OSCs is demonstrated. This work highlights the importance of controlling D/A interactions for achieving desired morphology and also demonstrates a promising OSC system for potential cost-effective organic photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Divergent Paths, Same Goal: A Pair&#8208;Electrosynthesis Tactic for Cost&#8208;Efficient and Exclusive Formate Production by Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived 2D Electrocatalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A pair&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic for concurrent formate production is pioneeringly developed by coupling electrocatalytic methanol oxidation and CO2 reduction reactions, which can achieve highly efficient and selective value&#8208;added synthesis in both electrodes with lower energy consumption, using in situ metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived high&#8208;performance 2D electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of formic acid/formate is a promising alternative protocol to industrial processes. Herein, a pioneering pair&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic is reported for exclusively producing formate via coupling selectively electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which the electrode derived from Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF) nanosheet arrays (Ni&#8208;NF&#8208;Af), as well as the Bi&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived ultrathin bismuthenes (Bi&#8208;enes), both obtained through an in situ electrochemical conversion process, are used as efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, achieving concurrent yielding of the same high&#8208;value product at both electrodes with greatly reduced energy input. The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8208;NF&#8208;Af only needs quite low potentials to reach large current densities (e.g., 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2@1.345&#160;V)&#160;with &#8776;100% selectivity for anodic methanol&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Meanwhile, for CO2RR in the cathode, the as&#8208;prepared Bi&#8208;enes can simultaneously exhibit near&#8208;unity selectivity, large current densities, and good stability in a wide potential window toward formate production. Consequently, the coupled MOR//CO2RR system based on the distinctive MOF&#8208;derived catalysts displays excellent performance for pair&#8208;electrosynthesis of formate, delivering high current densities and nearly 100% selectivity for formate production in both the anode and the cathode. This work provides a novel way to design advanced MOF&#8208;derived electrocatalysts and innovative electrolytic systems for electrochemical production of value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Hydroplastic Micromolding of 2D Sheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to mold 2D sheet microstructured materials based on hydroplasticity is described. An innovative interlayer&#8208;spacing&#8208;induced brittle&#8211;plastic transition in 2D materials is revealed. The approach enables direct forming with high design freedom and accuracy from 2D layered solids. The molded assemblies possess tunable electrical, optical, and other functional properties.








Abstract
Processing 2D sheets into desired structures with high precision is of great importance for fabrication and application of their assemblies. Solution processing of 2D sheets from dilute dispersions is a commonly used method but offers limited control over feature size precision owing to the extreme volume shrinkage. Plastic processing from the solid state is therefore a&#160;preferable approach to achieve high precision. However, plastic processing is intrinsically hampered by strong interlayer interactions of the 2D sheet solids. Here, a hydroplastic molding method to shape layered solids of 2D sheets with micrometer&#8208;scale precision under ambient conditions is reported. The dried 2D layered solids are plasticized by intercalated solvents, affording plastic near&#8208;solid compounds that enable local plastic deformation. Such an intercalated solvent&#8208;induced hydroplasticity is found in a broad family of 2D materials, for example graphene, MoS2, and MXene. The hydroplastic molding enables fabrication of complex spatial structures (knurling, origami) and microimprinted tubular structures down to diameters of 390&#160;nm with good fidelity. The method enhances the structural accuracy and enriches the structural diversity of 2D macroassemblies, thus providing a feasible strategy to tune their electrical, optical, and other functional properties.

         <title>Reconfigurable Magnetic Origami Actuators with On&#8208;Board Sensing for Guided Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic origami actuators equipped with highly compliant magnetic field sensors can monitor their shape and detect their magnetization state, making feedback control and guided assembly possible. These actuators are based on composite films of ferromagnetic microparticles embedded in shape&#8208;memory polymer films. Photothermal heating from light and applied magnetic fields enable on&#8208;demand reconfigurability.








Abstract
Origami utilizes orchestrated transformation of soft 2D structures into complex 3D architectures, mimicking shapes and functions found in nature. In contrast to origami in nature, synthetic origami lacks the ability to monitor the environment and correspondingly adjust its behavior. Here, magnetic origami actuators with capabilities to sense their orientation and displacement as well as detect their own magnetization state and readiness for supervised folding are designed, fabricated, and demonstrated. These origami actuators integrate photothermal heating and magnetic actuation by using composite thin films (&#8776;60&#160;&#181;m thick) of shape&#8208;memory polymers with embedded magnetic NdFeB microparticles. Mechanically compliant magnetic field sensors, known as magnetosensitive electronic skins, are laminated on the surface of the soft actuators. These ultrathin actuators accomplish sequential folding and recovery, with hinge locations programmed on the fly. Endowing mechanically active smart materials with cognition is an important step toward realizing intelligent, stimuli&#8208;responsive structures.

         <title>Imaging and Controlling Photonic Modes in Perovskite Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under a resonant femtosecond pulsed laser (fs&#8208;laser) excitation, the spatial pattern of the photonic modes in a CsPbBr3 microcavity is revealed by photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), which is the strong coupling of excitons and photons in the perovskite microcavity. Mode control through light field and structure is also mapped by the PEEM technique in real space and real time.








Abstract
Perovskite microcavities have excellent photophysical properties for integrated optoelectronic devices, such as nanolasers. Imaging and controlling the photonic modes within the cavity are fundamentally important to understand and develop applications. Here, photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is used to image the photonic modes within optical microcavities with a nanometer&#8208;scale spatial resolution. From a CsPbBr3 microcavity, hybrid mode patterns are observed. Spatial frequency spectrum analysis on the patterns uncovers the characteristic cavity modes, which are modeled with transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) waves, and assigned to exciton&#8211;polariton modes. Based on this understanding, the light focus in a designed microcavity is imaged in real space and controlled by the light field polarization. The study confirms that the cavity modes in perovskites can be effectively observed by the PEEM technique under resonant excitation, which, in turn, promotes the design of optoelectronic devices based on perovskite microcavities.

         <title>Dose&#8208;Independent Transfection of Hydrophobized Polyplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike viral vectors that are capable of individual transfection, dynamically complexed cationic polymers/DNA nanoparticles (i.e., polyplexes) dissociate and thus lose transfection ability at reduced concentrations, causing in vivo transfection inefficiency once systemically administered. Optimizing the polymer hydrophobicity is shown to integrate the polyplexes upon dilution and enter cells via macropinocytosis, leading to virus&#8208;mimicking dose&#8208;independent DNA transfection.








Abstract
Cationic polymers dynamically complex DNA into complexes (polyplexes). So, upon dilution, polyplexes easily dissociate and lose transfection ability, limiting their in vivo systemic gene delivery. Herein, it is found that polyplex's stability and endocytosis pathway determine its transfection dose&#8208;dependence. The polyplexes of hydrophilic polycations have dose&#8208;dependent integrity and lysosome&#8208;trafficking endocytosis; at low doses, most of these polyplexes dissociate, and the remaining few are internalized and trapped in lysosomes, abolishing their transfection ability. In contrast, the polyplexes of the polycations with optimal hydrophobicity remain integrated even at low concentrations and enter cells via macropinocytosis directly into the cytosol evading lysosomes, so each polyplex can accomplish its infection process, leading to dose&#8208;independent DNA transfection like viral vectors. Furthermore, the tuned hydrophobicity balancing the affinity of anionic poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) to the polyplex surface enables &#947;&#8208;PGA to stick on the polyplex surface as a shielding layer but peel off on the cell membrane to release the naked polyplexes for dose&#8208;independent transfection. These findings may provide guidelines for developing polyplexes that mimick a viral vector's dose&#8208;independent transfection for effective in vivo gene delivery.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Kinetics with Highly Dispersed Conductive and Electrocatalytic Mediators for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical Mo2C nanocluster/carbon nanosheets hybrid material is prepared to improve the performance of practical Li&#8211;S batteries. The ultrasmall and highly conductive Mo2C nanocrystals can effectively promote anchoring and conversion of lithium polysulfides and increase the number of the nuclei for Li2S2/Li2S precipitation. Benefitting from the synergistic effects, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S batteries is greatly improved.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage devices because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries is still impeded by the poor cycling performance and rate capability at practical conditions. In order to improve the performance of practical Li&#8211;S batteries, a hierarchical Mo2C nanocluster/carbon nanosheets hybrid based hollow spherical material (Mo2C/CHS) is designed and prepared. The hollow spheres composed of stacked carbon nanosheets can facilitate the infiltration of electrolyte. The ultrasmall and highly conductive Mo2C nanocrystals are confined in the carbon nanosheets and expose more active sites for anchoring and conversion of lithium polysulfides and increase the number of the nuclei for Li2S2/Li2S precipitation. Benefitting from the synergistic effects, Mo2C/CHS greatly promotes electrochemical kinetics in Li&#8211;S batteries with high sulfur loading (5 mg cm&#8722;2). Even under lean electrolyte conditions (E/S = 7 &#956;L mgsulfur&#8722;1), the Li&#8211;S batteries with Mo2C/CHS added exhibit a discharge capacity of 904 mAh g&#8722;1 at the high current rate of 0.5 C, and with 894 mAh g&#8722;1 maintained after 200 cycles. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical processes and guides the rational design of host and additive materials for practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>2D Electrolytes: Theory, Modeling, Synthesis, and Characterization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D electrolytes are stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that possess the chemical and physical properties of 2D materials and electrolytes. These materials can undergo reversible morphological transformations according to the environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, electric permittivity of the medium, and ionic concentration, and exhibit flexible functionalities, being promising for highly dynamic systems, such as drug&#8208;delivery applications, artificial muscles, and energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
A class of compounds sharing the properties of 2D materials and electrolytes, namely 2D electrolytes is described theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. 2D electrolytes dissociate in different solvents, such as water, and become electrically charged. The chemical and physical properties of these compounds can be controlled by external factors, such as pH, temperature, electric permittivity of the medium, and ionic concentration. 2D electrolytes, in analogy with polyelectrolytes, present reversible morphological transitions from 2D to 1D, as a function of pH, due to the interplay of the elastic and Coulomb energies. Since these materials show stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior to the environmental conditions, 2D electrolytes can be considered as a novel class of smart materials that expand the functionalities of 2D materials and are promising for applications that require stimuli&#8208;responsive demeanor, such as drug delivery, artificial muscles, and energy storage.

         <title>Transparent, Compliant 3D Mesostructures for Precise Evaluation of Mechanical Characteristics of Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D mesostructures are designed to mechanically and reversibly constrain organoids for measurements of their viscoelastic properties. Finite element analysis guides the selection of 3D layouts to grasp organoids with minimal force, without damage to the tissues. Nanoindentation applied directly to organoids gently held within these 3D structures allows for accurate and repeated measurements of force/displacement data. Changes in mechanical characteristics induced by drugs highlight responses to the chemical environment, as an application example.








Abstract
Recently developed methods for transforming 2D patterns of thin&#8208;film materials into 3D mesostructures create many interesting opportunities in microsystems design. A growing area of interest is in multifunctional thermal, electrical, chemical, and optical interfaces to biological tissues, particularly 3D multicellular, millimeter&#8208;scale constructs, such as spheroids, assembloids, and organoids. Herein, examples of 3D mechanical interfaces are presented, in which thin ribbons of parylene&#8208;C form the basis of transparent, highly compliant frameworks that can be reversibly opened and closed to capture, envelop, and mechanically restrain fragile 3D tissues in a gentle, nondestructive manner, for precise measurements of viscoelastic properties using techniques in nanoindentation. Finite element analysis serves as a design tool to guide selection of geometries and material parameters for shape&#8208;matching 3D architectures tailored to organoids of interest. These computational approaches also quantitate all aspects of deformations during the processes of opening and closing the structures and of forces imparted by them onto the surfaces of enclosed soft tissues. Studies of cerebral organoids by nanoindentation show effective Young's moduli in the range from 1.5 to 2.5 kPa depending on the age of the organoid. This collection of results suggests broad utility of compliant 3D mesostructures in noninvasive mechanical measurements of millimeter&#8208;scale, soft biological tissues.

         <title>Broadband Detection of X&#8208;ray, Ultraviolet, and Near&#8208;Infrared Photons using Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite&#8211;Lanthanide Nanotransducers</title>

         <dc:description>
A strategy for broadband photodetection of X&#8208;ray, ultraviolet, and near&#8208;infrared photons is proposed. A class of lanthanide&#8211;perovskite nanocrystals is developed by in situ crystallization of perovskite nanocrystals on the surface of mSiO2&#8208;coated lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanocrystals.

Solution&#8208;processed metal&#8208;halide perovskites hold great promise in developing next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance photodetectors. However, the weak absorption of perovskites beyond the near&#8208;infrared spectral region posts a stringent limitation on their use for broadband photodetectors. Here, the rational design and synthesis of an upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8211;perovskite nanotransducer are presented, namely UCNPs@mSiO2@MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I), for broadband photon detection spanning from X&#8208;rays, UV, to NIR. It is demonstrated that, by in situ crystallization and deliberately tuning the material composition in the lanthanide core and perovskites, the nanotransducers allow for a high stability and show a wide linear response to X&#8208;rays of various dose rates, as well as UV/NIR photons of various power densities. The findings provide an opportunity to explore the next&#8208;generation broadband photodetectors in the field of high&#8208;quality imaging and optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy for broadband photodetection of X-ray, ultraviolet, and near-infrared photons is proposed. A class of lanthanide&#8211;perovskite nanocrystals is developed by in situ crystallization of perovskite nanocrystals on the surface of mSiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-coated lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals. Such nanotransducers are further used to implement flexible X-ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 20 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Immune Checkpoint&#8208;Bioengineered Beta Cell Vaccine Reverses Early&#8208;Onset Type 1 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous injectable immune checkpoint ligand functionalized &#946; cell vaccine is bioengineered to induce islet antigen&#8208;specific immunotolerance and reverse early&#8208;onset type 1 diabetes mellitus.








Abstract
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease that results from autoreactive T cells destroying insulin&#8208;producing pancreatic beta (&#946;) cells. The development of T1DM is associated with the deficiency of co&#8208;inhibitory immune checkpoint ligands (e.g., PD&#8208;L1, CD86, and Gal&#8208;9) in &#946; cells. Here, a new translational approach based on metabolic glycoengineering and bioorthogonal click chemistry, which bioengineers &#946; cells with co&#8208;inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules that induce antigen&#8208;specific immunotolerance and reverse early&#8208;onset hyperglycemia is reported. To achieve this goal, a subcutaneous injectable acellular pancreatic extracellular matrix platform for localizing the bioengineered &#946; cells while creating a pancreas&#8208;like immunogenic microenvironment, in which the autoreactive T cells can interface with the &#946; cells, is devised.

         <title>Superamphiphilic TiO2 Composite Surface for Protein Antifouling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that a TiO2&#8208;composite nanostructured superamphiphilic coating can resist protein adsorption at a water/solid interface. This work combines interface science and the practical application of the nonfouling property in capillary electrophoresis and multifunctional microfluidics. This work offers significant insights into the design of advanced superwetting materials to control biomolecule adhesion.








Abstract
Unwanted protein adsorption deteriorates fouling processes and reduces analytical device performance. Wettability plays an important role in protein adsorption by affecting interactions between proteins and surfaces. However, the principles of protein adsorption are not completely understood, and surface coatings that exhibit resistance to protein adsorption and long&#8208;term stability still need to be developed. Here, a nanostructured superamphiphilic TiO2 composite (TiO2/SiO2) coating that can effectively prevent nonspecific protein adsorption on water/solid interfaces is reported. The confined water on the superamphiphilic surface enables a low adhesion force and the formation of an energy barrier that plays a key role in preventing protein adsorption. This adaptive design protects the capillary wall from fouling in a harsh environment during the bioanalysis of capillary electrophoresis and is further extended to applications in multifunctional microfluidics for liquid transportation. This facile approach is not only perfectly applied in channels with complicated configurations but may also offer significant insights into the design of advanced superwetting materials to control biomolecule adhesion in biomedical devices, microfluidics, and biological assays.

         <title>Super Stretchable and Durable Electroluminescent Devices Based on Double&#8208;Network Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super stretchable electroluminescent device is successfully fabricated with double&#8208;network ionogel as a soft electrode owing to its excellent mechanical robustness and electrical conductivity. The fabricated device exhibits extremely stable light&#8208;emitting operation even at high elongation as well as demonstrating mechanical, electrical, and thermal stability, which can be applied to new types of stretchable light display and sensors.








Abstract
Ionogels are good candidates for flexible electronics owing to their excellent mechanical and electrical properties, including stretchability, high conductivity, and stability. In this study, conducting ionogels comprising a double network (DN) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diethylacrylamide)/chitosan which are further reinforced by the ionic and covalent crosslinking of the chitosan network by tripolyphosphate and glutaraldehyde, respectively, are prepared. Based on their excellent mechanical properties and high conductivity, the developed DN ionogels are envisioned as stretchable ionic conductors for extremely stretchable alternating&#8208;current electroluminescent (ACEL) devices. The ACEL device fabricated with the developed ionogel exhibits stable working operation under an ultrahigh elongation of over 1200% as well as severe mechanical deformations such as bending, rolling, and twisting. Furthermore, the developed ACEL devices also display stable luminescence over 1000 stretch/release cycles or at temperatures as harsh as 200 &#176;C.

Finan, John A. Rogers, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate soft, transparent 3D structures designed to gently constrain organoids for studies of their mechanical properties. Measurements reveal that the effective moduli of these systems depend on age and exposure to drugs.

         <dc:description>
Achieving wireless miniaturized reconfigurable metastructures remains a challenge due to the difficult nature of the fabrication and actuation processes at the micrometer scale. In article number 2008605, Metin Sitti and co&#8208;workers develop an actuation platform for thermally reconfiguring micro&#8208;metasurfaces by using uniaxially aligned liquid crystal elastomers, which serve as efficient artificial muscles to provide energy for actuation of the microscale kirigami metastructures.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Metal&#8211;Organic Gels for Oxygen Electrocatalysis: Structural and Compositional Considerations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active&#8208;site density through rational design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal&#8211;organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach of improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. Several key compositional and structural considerations for the MOF/MOG design and new perspectives between synthesis, characterization, and performance are comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
Increasing demand for sustainable and clean energy is calling for the next&#8208;generation energy conversion and storage technologies such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, CO2/N2 reduction electrolyzers, metal&#8211;air batteries, etc. All these electrochemical processes involve oxygen electrocatalysis. Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active&#8208;site density through rational design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal&#8211;organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach toward improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. MOFs/MOGs afford a broad selection of combinations between metal nodes and organic linkers and are known to produce electrocatalysts with high surface areas, variable porosity, and excellent activity after pyrolysis. Some recent studies on MOFs/MOGs for oxygen electrocatalysis and their new perspectives in synthesis, characterization, and performance are discussed. New insights on the structural and compositional design in MOF/MOG&#8208;derived oxygen electrocatalysts are summarized. Critical challenges and future research directions are also outlined.

         <title>Covalently Crosslinked Hydrogels via Step&#8208;Growth Reactions: Crosslinking Chemistries, Polymers, and Clinical Impact</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various polymers and crosslinking chemistries are utilized for fabricating hydrogels for translational research. However, selecting appropriate crosslinking chemistries and polymers for the intended clinical application is challenging and time&#8208;consuming. The key features of crosslinking chemistries and polymers commonly used for preparing hydrogels are outlined and their performance in the context of the regulatory process and clinical translation barriers summarized.








Abstract
Hydrogels are an important class of biomaterials with the unique property of high&#8208;water content in a crosslinked polymer network. In particular, chemically crosslinked hydrogels have made a great clinical impact in past years because of their desirable mechanical properties and tunability of structural and chemical properties. Various polymers and step&#8208;growth crosslinking chemistries are harnessed for fabricating such covalently crosslinked hydrogels for translational research. However, selecting appropriate crosslinking chemistries and polymers for the intended clinical application is time&#8208;consuming and challenging. It requires the integration of polymer chemistry knowledge with thoughtful crosslinking reaction design. This task becomes even more challenging when other factors such as the biological mechanisms of the pathology, practical administration routes, and regulatory requirements add additional constraints. In this review, key features of crosslinking chemistries and polymers commonly used for preparing translatable hydrogels are outlined and their performance in biological systems is summarized. The examples of effective polymer/crosslinking chemistry combinations that have yielded clinically approved hydrogel products are specifically highlighted. These hydrogel design parameters in the context of the regulatory process and clinical translation barriers, providing a guideline for the rational selection of polymer/crosslinking chemistry combinations to construct hydrogels with high translational potential are further considered.

         <title>Layered Intercalation Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercalation of layered materials produces a rich class of materials with tunable structural and electronic properties for both fundamental studies and practical technologies. The key intercalation methods for preparing layered intercalation materials are summarized, the associated modulation of multiple properties is reviewed, and further prospects regarding the future challenges and opportunities in layered intercalation materials are considered.








Abstract
2D layered materials typically feature strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonding within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, in which various foreign species may be inserted without breaking the in&#8208;plane covalent bonds. By tailoring the composition, size, structure, and electronic properties of the intercalated guest species and the hosting layered materials, an expansive family of layered intercalation materials may be produced with highly variable compositional and structural features as well as widely tunable physical/chemical properties, invoking unprecedented opportunities in fundamental studies of property modulation and potential applications in diverse technologies, including electronics, optics, superconductors, thermoelectrics, catalysis, and energy storage. Here, the principles and protocols for various intercalation methods, including wet chemical intercalation, gas&#8208;phase intercalation, electrochemical intercalation, and ion&#8208;exchange intercalation, are comprehensively reviewed and how the intercalated species alter the crystal structure and the interlayer coupling of the host 2D layered materials, introducing unusual physical and chemical properties and enabling devices with superior performance or unique functions, is discussed. To conclude, a brief summary on future research opportunities and emerging challenges in the layered intercalation materials is given.

         <title>Beyond Photo: Xdynamic Therapies in Fighting Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 25, June 24, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xdynamic therapies (X = sono, radio, microwave, chemo, thermo, and electro), which are non&#8208;photo&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species generation strategies, show great promise in fighting cancer. Recent advances in the development of Xdynamic therapies are summarized. The approaches to enhance treatment efficiency of Xdynamic therapy are highlighted.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related therapeutic approaches are developed as a promising modality for cancer treatment because the aberrant increase of intracellular ROS level can cause cell death due to nonspecific oxidation damage to key cellular biomolecules. However, the most widely considered strategy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), suffers from critical limitations such as limited tissue&#8208;penetration depth, high oxygen dependence, and phototoxicity. Non&#8208;photo&#8208;induced ROS generation strategies, which are defined as Xdynamic therapies (X = sono, radio, microwave, chemo, thermo, and electro), show good potential to overcome the drawbacks of PDT. Herein, recent advances in the development of Xdynamic therapies, including the design of systems, the working mechanisms, and examples of cancer therapy application, are introduced. Furthermore, the approaches to enhance treatment efficiency of Xdynamic therapy are highlighted. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of these strategies are also discussed.

         <title>Transparent Omni&#8208;Directional Stretchable Circuit Lines Made by a Junction&#8208;Free Grid of Expandable Au Lines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to fabricate omni&#8208;directional stretchable gold (Au) circuit lines with high transparency, high electrical conductivity, and negligible resistance change is presented. Metals are deposited directly over the crack&#8208;controlled poly(dimethylsiloxane) surface forming grid inside the cracks. This study demonstrates a highly transparent, stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode with a patterned Au line circuit board.








Abstract
Although various stretchable optoelectronic devices have been reported, omni&#8208;directionally stretchable transparent circuit lines have been a great challenge. Cracks are engineered and fabricated to be highly conductive patterned metal circuit lines in which gold (Au) grids are embedded. Au is deposited selectively in the cracks to form a grid without any junction between the grid lines. Since each grid line is expandable under stretching, the circuit lines are stretchable in all the directions. This study shows that a thin coating of aluminum on the oxide surface enables precise control of the cracks (crack density, crack depth) in the oxide layer. High optical transparency and high stretchability can be achieved simultaneously by controlling the grid density in the circuit line. Light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated directly on the circuit lines and stable operation is demonstrated under 100% stretching.

         <title>Dynamically Crosslinked Dry Ion&#8208;Conducting Elastomers for Soft Iontronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamically crosslinked dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomers with exceptional properties of high ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, stretchability, and transparency are reported. Two self&#8208;healing stretchable iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are then realized with excellent environmental stability.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors show great promise in multifunctional iontronic devices, but currently utilized gel materials suffer from liquid leakage or evaporation issues. Here, a dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer with dynamic crosslinking structures is reported. The dynamic crosslinking structures endow it with combined advantageous properties simultaneously, including high ionic conductivity (2.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), self&#8208;healing capability (96% healing efficiency), stretchability (563%), and transparency (78%). With this ionic conductor as the electrode, two soft iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are realized with entirely self&#8208;healing and stretchable capabilities. Due to the absence of liquid materials, the dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer shows wide operational temperature range, and the iontronic devices achieve excellent stability. These findings provide a promising strategy to achieve highly conductive and multifunctional soft dry ionic conductors, and demonstrate their great potential in soft iontronics or electronics.

         <title>Germanium Nanosheets with Dirac Characteristics as a Saturable Absorber for Ultrafast Pulse Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge nanosheets with &#8730;3 &#215;&#160;&#8730;3 germanene as the top layer are successfully grown on a Ag (111) substrate. Dirac characteristics, ultrafast carrier dynamics, and large nonlinear absorption coefficient are experimentally observed from the Ge nanosheets, which are further applied as new saturable absorbers to construct an ultrafast mode&#8208;locked laser, and sub&#8208;picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized.








Abstract
Bulk germanium as a group&#8208;IV photonic material has been widely studied due to its relatively large refractive index and broadband and low propagation loss from near&#8208;infrared to mid&#8208;infrared. Inspired by the research of graphene, the 2D counterpart of bulk germanium, germanene, has been discovered and the characteristics of Dirac electrons have been observed. However, the optical properties of germanene still remain elusive. In this work, several layers of germanene are prepared with Dirac electronic characteristics and its morphology, band structure, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties are systematically investigated. It is surprisingly found that germanene has a fast carrier&#8208;relaxation time comparable to that of graphene and a relatively large nonlinear absorption coefficient, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these findings, germanene is applied as a new saturable absorber to construct an ultrafast mode&#8208;locked laser, and sub&#8208;picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized. The results suggest that germanene can be used as a new type of group&#8208;IV material for various nonlinear optics and photonic applications.

After pressure processing, the quenched products possess unexpected intense emission exceeding ten times compared to the initial state, accompanied by efficient color temperature tuning from weak sky blue to very bright cool daylight. The irreversible electronic transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules, is highly responsible for the eventual retention of pressure&#8208;induced emission.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is extensively studied in halide perovskites or derivative hybrid halides. However, owing to the soft inorganic lattice of these materials, the intense emission is barely retained under ambient conditions, thus largely limiting their practical applications in optoelectronics at atmospheric pressure. Here, remarkably enhanced emission in microtubules of the 0D hybrid halide (C5H7N2)2ZnBr4 ((4AMP)2ZnBr4) is successfully achieved by means of pressure treatment at room temperature. Notably, the emission, which is over ten times more intense than the emission in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon the complete release of pressure. Furthermore, the pressure processing enables the tuning of &#8220;sky blue light&#8221; before compression to &#8220;cool daylight&#8221; with a remarkable quantum yield of 88.52% after decompression, which is of considerable interest for applications in next&#8208;generation lighting and displays. The irreversible electronic structural transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules [4AMP], is highly responsible for the eventual retention of PIE and tuning of the color temperature. The findings represent a significant step toward the capture of PIE under ambient conditions, thus facilitating its potential solid&#8208;state lighting applications.

         <title>Crowning Metal Ions by Supramolecularization as a General Remedy toward a Dendrite&#8208;Free Alkali&#8208;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general supramolecularization strategy with size&#8208;matching crown ethers is proposed to protect alkali&#8208;metal anodes (Li, Na, and K). The unique electrostatic shielding layer and organic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) induced by the crown ether&#8211;Li+/Na+/K+ assembly effectively inhibit the growth of alkali&#8208;metal dendrites and largely improve the lifespan of alkali&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Alkali metals have low potentials and high capacities, making them ideal anodes for next&#8208;generation batteries, but they suffer major problems, including dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency (CE). Achieving uniform metal deposition and having a reliable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are the basic requirements for overcoming these problems. Here, a general remedy is reported for various alkali&#8208;metal anodes by the supramolecularization of alkali&#8208;metal cations with crown ethers that follows a size&#8208;matching rule. The positively charged supramolecular complex provides electrostatic shielding layers to regulate metal deposition and suppress dendrite formation. More promisingly, it reforms electric double layers and drives the production of organic&#8208;dominated SEIs with improved flexibility that can accommodate large volume changes. The high flexibility of SEIs during metal deposition and dissolution reduces the amount of dead metal and improves CE and cycling stability. Specifically, a 200% excess Li&#8208;based full cell has a capacity retention of &#8776;100% after 100 cycles. This crown&#8208;like supramolecularization strategy is a new chemistry that may be used for the production of dendrite&#8208;free metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries not limited to the cases with alkali metal. It is also expected as a practical technology to improve the uniformity of coatings produced in the electrodeposition industry.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atomic Iron&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Integrated 3D&#8208;Printed Bioscaffolds for Osteosarcoma Destruction with Antibacterial and Bone Defect Regeneration Bioactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atomic&#8208;catalyst&#8208;engineered 3D scaffolds for osteosarcoma therapy and bone regeneration are reported. A single&#8208;atomic iron catalyst with highly effective hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced catalytic radical generating activities is engineered into a 3D&#8208;printed bioglass scaffold to achieve comprehensive osteosarcoma elimination, antibacterial properties, and bone defect regeneration with biocompatibility.








Abstract
Effective antitumor therapeutics with distinctive bactericidal and osteogenic properties are in high demand for comprehensive osteosarcoma treatment. Here, a &#8220;scaffold engineering&#8221; strategy that integrates highly active single&#8208;atomic iron catalysts (FeSAC) into a 3D printed bioactive glass (BG) scaffold is reported. Based on the atomically dispersed iron species within the catalysts, the engineered FeSAC displays prominent Fenton catalytic activity to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) in response to the microenvironment specific to osteosarcoma. In addition, the constructed FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold can serve as a sophisticated biomaterial platform for efficient osteosarcoma ablation, with concomitant bacterial sterilization via localized hyperthermia&#8208;reinforced nanocatalytic therapeutics. The destruction of the osteosarcoma, as well as the bacterial foci, can be achieved, further preventing susceptible chronic osteomyelitis during osteogenesis. In particular, the engineered FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold is identified with advances in accelerated osteoconduction and osteoinduction, ultimately contributing to the sophisticated therapeutics and management of osteosarcoma. This work broadens the biomedical potential of single&#8208;atom catalysts and offers a comprehensive clinically feasible strategy for overall osteosarcoma therapeutics, bacterial inhibition, and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Magnetic Dynamic Polymers for Modular Assembling and Reconfigurable Morphing Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic dynamic polymer composites composed of hard&#8208;magnetic microparticles in thermally reversible dynamic polymer networks for multifunctional assemblies and reconfigurable architectures are reported. These composites integrate the functionalities of targeted welding of modular assembling with complex actuation, magnetization reprogramming with altered shape&#8208;morphing mode, and remote&#8208;controlled permanent structural reconfiguration, opening a new avenue for manufacturing multifunctional and reconfigurable morphing architectures and devices.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing magnetic soft materials, composed of magnetic particles in a soft polymer matrix, can transform shape reversibly, remotely, and rapidly, finding diverse applications in actuators, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. To achieve on&#8208;demand and sophisticated shape morphing, the manufacture of structures with complex geometry and magnetization distribution is highly desired. Here, a magnetic dynamic polymer (MDP) composite composed of hard&#8208;magnetic microparticles in a dynamic polymer network with thermally responsive reversible linkages, which permits functionalities including targeted welding for magnetic&#8208;assisted assembly, magnetization reprogramming, and permanent structural reconfiguration, is reported. These functions not only provide highly desirable structural and material programmability and reprogrammability but also enable the manufacturing of functional soft architected materials such as 3D kirigami with complex magnetization distribution. The welding of magnetic&#8208;assisted modular assembly can be further combined with magnetization reprogramming and permanent reshaping capabilities for programmable and reconfigurable architectures and morphing structures. The reported MDP are anticipated to provide a new paradigm for the design and manufacture of future multifunctional assemblies and reconfigurable morphing architectures and devices.

         <title>A Gas&#8208;Steamed MOF Route to P&#8208;Doped Open Carbon Cages with Enhanced Zn&#8208;Ion Energy Storage Capability and Ultrastability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just like steaming Chinese buns, a gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) approach is employed to prepare open&#8208;wall carbon cages while simultaneously offering N, P dopants functionalized into a carbon matrix within a one&#8208;step process. Taking advantages of the fabricated carbon cages with controlled openings and N, P dopants, extraordinary Zn&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage performance is displayed.








Abstract
Carbon micro/nanocages have received great attention, especially in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a solid&#8208;state gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework approach is designed to fabricate carbon cages with controlled openings on walls, and N, P&#160;dopants. Taking advantage of the fabricated carbon cages with large openings on their walls for enhanced kinetics of mass transport and N, P dopants within the carbon matrix for favoring chemical adsorption of Zn ions, when used as carbon cathodes for advanced aqueous Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), such open carbon cages (OCCs) display a wide operation voltage of 2.0&#160;V and an enhanced capacity of 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. Also, they exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of up to 300&#160;000 cycles with 96.5% capacity retention. Particularly, such OCCs as electrode materials lead to a soft&#8208;pack ZHSC device, delivering a high energy density of 97&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a superb power density of 6.5&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Further, the device can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;25 to + 40&#160;&#176;C, covering the temperatures for practical applications in daily life.

         <title>Engineering Fe&#8211;N Coordination Structures for Fast Redox Conversion in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated catalyst comprising single&#8208;atom Fe and Fe2N composite sites, with dual&#8208;tailed Fe&#8211;N coordination structures, co&#8208;decorated on N&#8208;doped graphene is successfully constructed and demonstrated. The catalyst optimizes the polysulfide absorption&#8211;catalysis behavior, thereby facilitating fast redox conversion and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, the Li&#8211;S batteries exhibit high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling stability.








Abstract
Critical drawbacks, including sluggish redox kinetics and undesirable shuttling of polysulfides (Li2Sn, n&#160;= 4&#8211;8), seriously deteriorate the electrochemical performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, these challenges are addressed by constructing an integrated catalyst with dual active sites, where single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;Fe and polar Fe2N are co&#8208;embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG). The SA&#8208;Fe, with plane&#8208;symmetric Fe&#8208;4N coordination, and Fe2N, with triangular pyramidal Fe&#8208;3N coordination, in this well&#8208;designed configuration exhibit synergistic adsorption of polysulfides and catalytic selectivity for Li2Sn lithiation and Li2S delithiation, respectively. These characteristics endow the SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG&#8208;modified separator with an optimal polysulfides confinement&#8211;catalysis ability, thus accelerating the bidirectional liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2Sn&#8596;Li2S) and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, a Li&#8211;S battery based on the SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG separator achieves a high capacity retention of 84.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C (pure S cathode, S content: 70&#160;wt%) and a high areal capacity of 5.02 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C (SA&#8208;Fe/Fe2N@NG&#8208;supported S cathode, S loading = 5 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). It is expected that the outcomes of the present study will facilitate the design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts for long&#8208;lasting Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Modulation of Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque from SrRuO3 by Epitaxial&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Octahedral Rotation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal oxide perovskite oxides can have pronounced Berry phase curvatures and moderate electric conductivity, making them good sources of spin&#8211;orbit torque. The spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency of SrRuO3 of three different crystal phases is investigated. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest that the spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency is strongly correlated to the in&#8208;plane octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT), which arises from the spin&#8211;orbit coupling of conduction electrons, is believed to be the key route for developing low&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed, and nonvolatile memory devices. Despite the theoretical prediction of pronounced Berry phase curvatures in certain transition&#8208;metal perovskite oxides, which lead to considerable intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, SOT from this class of materials has rarely been reported until recently. Here, the SOT generated by epitaxial SrRuO3 of three different crystal structures is systematically studied. The results of both spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance and in&#8208;plane harmonic Hall voltage measurements concurrently reveal that the intrinsic SOT efficiency of SrRuO3 decreases when the epitaxial strain changes from tensile to compressive. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data demonstrate a strong correlation between the magnitude of SOT and octahedral rotation around the in&#8208;plane axes of SrRuO3, consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work offers new possibilities of tuning SOT with crystal structures and novel opportunities of integrating the unique properties of perovskite oxides with spintronic functionalities.

         <title>Multimodal Tuning of Synaptic Plasticity Using Persistent Luminescent Memitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of memristive materials based on persistent luminescent memitters emulates synaptic plasticity and memory without requiring sophisticated devices. Experimental and theoretical data suggest that electron&#8208;coupled trap nucleation and propagation through clustering in persistent luminescent memitters can explain experience&#8208;dependent plasticity. Multichannel image memorization involving persistent luminescent memitters allows direct visualization of short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory.








Abstract
Mimicking memory processes, including encoding, storing, and retrieving information, is critical for neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence. Synaptic behavior simulations through electronic, magnetic, or photonic devices based on metal oxides, 2D materials, molecular complex and phase change materials, represent important strategies for performing computational tasks with enhanced power efficiency. Here, a special class of memristive materials based on persistent luminescent memitters (termed as a portmanteau of &#8220;memory&#8221; and &#8220;emitter&#8221;) with optical characteristics closely resembling those of biological synapses is reported. The memory process and synaptic plasticity can be successfully emulated using such memitters under precisely controlled excitation frequency, wavelength, pulse number, and power density. The experimental and theoretical data suggest that electron&#8208;coupled trap nucleation and propagation through clustering in persistent luminescent memitters can explain experience&#8208;dependent plasticity. The use of persistent luminescent memitters for multichannel image memorization that allows direct visualization of subtle changes in luminescence intensity and realization of short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory is also demonstrated. These findings may promote the discovery of new functional materials as artificial synapses and enhance the understanding of memory mechanisms.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Acrylate Liquid Single Crystal Elastomers Reinforced by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chemical approach to fabricating monodomain LCE based on aza&#8208;Michael addition is developed, compatible with both liquid and gel alignment techniques, to manufacture actuators with versatile shapes. The facile process involving simply mixing two components is enabled by the two&#8208;stage differentiated kinetics of primary amines toward acrylates, generating hydrogen bonding, enhancing the mechanical properties of the elastomer.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been considered one of the most promising material concepts for artificial muscles. However, accomplishing actuation of LCEs requires macroscopic alignment of the liquid&#8208;crystalline orientation in the rubbery network, which imposes challenges in the materials chemistry and processing. A two&#8208;stage curing strategy has been the dominating approach during last three decades. Despite its many successes, the method is difficult in practice and requires delicate experiential skills, dealing with intrinsic fragility of intermediate gels after the first crosslinking stage. Here, a robust fabrication method for monodomain LCE based on the amine&#8208;acrylate aza&#8208;Michael addition is developed, involving two readily commercially available components with no catalyst. The method is based on the large kinetic difference of hydrogen addition in primary amines to acrylates, which offers a sufficient gap separating two stages of curing and enabling versatile mechanical alignment techniques for manufacturing monodomain LCE in both liquid and gel states. Importantly, the mechanically robust network, helping processability at a partial&#8208;crosslinking stage, is facilitated by the chemically generated hydrogen bonding all through the process, as a by&#8208;product of hydrogen addition. Such a facile two&#8208;component kit&#8208;like fabrication should aid researchers from various fields in the search for a practical and reliable process of making soft actuators.

Abstract
The Martini model, a coarse&#8208;grained force field initially developed with biomolecular simulations in mind, has found an increasing number of applications in the field of soft materials science. The model's underlying building block principle does not pose restrictions on its application beyond biomolecular systems.

         <title>Multifunctional and Ultrathin Electronic Tattoo for On&#8208;Skin Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional electronic skin tattoo system is achieved through the functionalization of carbon nanotubes to electrospun silk nanofiber mats. The tattoo system offers ultrathin, ultralight, biocompatible, deformable, and skin adhesion. Heat&#8208;stimulated drug delivery with controlled temperature and electrophysiological signal monitoring are possible using this electronic tattoo system in a noninvasive manner.








Abstract
Epidermal electronic systems for detecting electrophysiological signals, sensing, therapy, and drug delivery are at the frontier in man&#8211;machine interfacing for healthcare. However, it is still a challenge to develop multifunctional bioapplications with minimal invasiveness, biocompatibility, and stable electrical performance under various mechanical deformations of biological tissues. In this study, a natural silk protein with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is utilized to realize an epidermal electronic tattoo (E&#8208;tattoo) system for multifunctional applications that address these challenging issues through dispersing highly conductive CNTs onto the biocompatible silk nanofibrous networks with porous nature to construct skin&#8208;adhesive ultrathin electronic patches. Individual components that incorporate electrically and optically active heaters, a temperature sensor (temperature coefficient of resistance of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1), a stimulator for drug delivery (&gt;500&#160;&#181;m penetration depth in skin), and real&#8208;time electrophysiological signal detectors are described. This strategy of E&#8208;tattoos integrated onto human skin can open a new route to a next&#8208;generation electronic platform for wearable and epidermal bioapplications.

         <title>Lotus&#8208;Root&#8208;Like Carbon Fibers Embedded with Ni&#8211;Co Nanoparticles for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like carbon fibers embedded with Ni&#8211;Co nanoparticles (NCH@CFs) are designed as a lithium (Li) host via facile electrospinning and the subsequent thermal annealing. Benefitting from the 3D conductive framework and the internal hollow structure with highly dispersed lithiophilic sites, the NCH@CF host can spatially regulate the electric field to effectively suppress the Li&#8208;dendrite growth and withstand severe volume expansion for long&#8208;term cycling performance in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The growth of lithium (Li) dendrites and the huge volume change are the critical issues for the practical applications of Li&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, a spatial control strategy is proposed to address the above challenges using lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like Ni&#8211;Co hollow prisms@carbon fibers (NCH@CFs) as the host. The homogeneously distributed bimetallic Ni&#8211;Co particles on the N&#8208;doped carbon fibers serve as nucleation sites to effectively reduce the overpotential for Li nucleation. Furthermore, the 3D conductive network can alter the electric field. More importantly, the hierarchical lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like hollow fibers provide sufficient void space to withstand the volume expansion during Li deposition. These structural features guide the uniform Li nucleation and non&#8208;dendritic growth. As a result, the NCH@CFs host enables a very stable Li metal anode with a low voltage hysteresis during repeated Li plating/stripping for 1200 h at a current density of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Safe and Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion&#8211;Oxygen Battery based on a Low&#8208;Cost Dual&#8208;Carbon Electrodes Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;ion&#8211;O2 battery system with a dual&#8208;carbon electrodes architecture is constructed to address the concerns of safety and costs. Li&#8208;ions undergo a (de)intercalation process into the graphite anode and an O2/Li2O2 redox conversion on the carbon nanotube cathode. Benefitting from superior electrode compatibilities, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell (302.52 W h kg&#8722;1) with cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly carbon components is fabricated.








Abstract
People anticipate high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technology with better security, stability, and sustainability. By tuning the advantage of specific capacity, the lithium&#8208;metal anode is replaced with a graphite intercalation compound and a conceptual prototype lithium&#8208;ion&#8211;oxygen battery based on a low&#8208;cost dual&#8208;carbon electrodes architecture is proposed. The lithium&#8208;ion involves a (de)intercalation process into the graphite anode and an O2/Li2O2 redox conversion on the carbon&#8208;nanotube cathode. After a thorough examination as to the electrode compatibility with current electrolytes, a nonflammable fluorinated ether electrolyte is proposed to render a highly coordinated solvation sheath and low lithium salt concentration (1&#160;mol). Herein, the compatibility with graphite anode is investigated, which maintains high capacity retention (88.1%) after long&#8208;term lifespan (over 1 year). In view of the ultrahigh reversibility (average Coulombic efficiency over 99.93%) of the graphite anode, a lithium&#8208;ion&#8211;oxygen coin cell with high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 80% and 60% deliver a satisfactory life over 150 and 300 cycles, respectively. Moreover, systematic spectroscopy characterizations demonstrate a reversible and efficient 2e&#8211; O2/Li2O2 redox reaction without relying on noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Lastly, in the engineering aspect, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell (302.52 W h kg&#8722;1 based on the weight of the entire pouch) with cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly carbon&#8208;composed cell components is successfully fabricated.

         <title>Novel Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque Generation at Room Temperature in an All&#8208;Oxide Epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrIrO3 System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;oxide, SrTiO3//La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure with lattice&#8208;matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled metal SIO. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency, &#958;||&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) that arise from materials with large spin&#8211;orbit coupling offer a new pathway for energy&#8208;efficient and fast magnetic information storage. SOTs in conventional heavy metals and topological insulators are explored extensively, while 5d transition metal oxides, which also host ions with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, are a relatively new territory in the field of spintronics. An all&#8208;oxide, SrTiO3 (STO)//La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure with lattice&#8208;matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled metal SIO. Spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST&#8208;FMR) is used to probe the effective magnetization and the SOT efficiency in LSMO/SIO heterostructures grown on STO substrates. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large SOT efficiency, &#958;||&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%. The findings highlight the significance of epitaxy as a powerful tool to achieve a high SOT efficiency, explore the rich physics at the epitaxial interface, and open up a new pathway for designing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices.

An all-oxide, SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO)//La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LSMO)/SrIrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SIO) heterostructure with lattice-matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit-coupled metal SIO. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) is used to probe the effective magnetization and the SOT efficiency in LSMO/SIO heterostructures grown on STO substrates. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large SOT efficiency, &#958;&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%. The findings highlight the significance of epitaxy as a powerful tool to achieve a high SOT efficiency, explore the rich physics at the epitaxial interface, and open up a new pathway for designing next-generation energy-efficient spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unravelling Magnetic Nanochain Formation in Dispersion for In Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles in dispersion can be controlled to form flexible and reversible chains in the presence of a magnetic field, which is useful for biomedical applications. The role of control parameters is determined and these novel assemblies formed in dispersions are visualized using advanced scattering methods and reverse Monte Carlo simulations.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) into 1D chains is appealing, because of their biocompatibility and higher mobility compared to 2D/3D assemblies while traversing the circulatory passages and blood vessels for in vivo biomedical applications. In this work, parameters such as size, concentration, composition, and magnetic field, responsible for chain formation of IONPs in a dispersion as opposed to spatially confining substrates, are examined. In particular, the monodisperse 27&#160;nm IONPs synthesized by an extended LaMer mechanism are shown to form chains at 4 mT, which are lengthened with applied field reaching 270&#160;nm at 2.2 T. The chain lengths are completely reversible in field. Using a combination of scattering methods and reverse Monte Carlo simulations the formation of chains is directly visualized. The visualization of real&#8208;space IONPs assemblies formed in dispersions presents a novel tool for biomedical researchers. This allows for rapid exploration of the behavior of IONPs in solution in a broad parameter space and unambiguous extraction of &#8203;the parameters of the equilibrium structures. Additionally, it can be extended to study novel assemblies formed by more complex geometries of IONPs.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Scanning&#8208;Guided Assembly of Quasi&#8208;3D Patterned Arrays of Plasmonic Dimers for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile laser writing strategy is developed to fabricate plasmonic dimer arrays with arbitrary patterns. This approach allows for precisely controlling the z&#8208;axis orientation, interparticle spacing, and nanoparticle size and shape of plasmonic dimers. The plasmonic color of the patterned dimers can be reversibly displayed and erased, enabling their use in information encryption and beyond.








Abstract
The application of plasmonic dimeric nanostructures in color displays, data storage, and especially metamaterials necessitates the patterning of dimers into ordered arrays, but controllable assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles into patterned dimer arrays on substrates still remains a challenge. Here, a facile laser&#8208;scanning&#8208;based strategy to fabricate quasi&#8208;3D patterned arrays of plasmonic nanoparticle dimers with controlled orientation for plasmonic information encryption is reported. Laser scanning of polymer&#8208;covered plasmonic nanoparticle (e.g., gold) arrays selectively exposes the surface of irradiated nanoparticle via localized photothermal heating, guiding the assembly of another type of nanoparticles onto the exposure nanoparticle surface to form dimers on substrates. This combined top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up approach is highly flexible in forming high&#8208;resolution patterns of plasmonic dimers from nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes. The z&#8208;axis orientation, interparticle spacing, and nanoparticle size and shape of plasmonic dimers can be precisely tuned, enabling the modulation of the coupled resonances of the dimer arrays. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the patterned dimer arrays can be used in information encryption where their plasmonic color can be repeatedly displayed and erased. This work provides an important addition to tools for the fabrication of patterned complex plasmonic nanostructures from as&#8208;synthesized nanoparticles with broad applications.

         <title>Stimulation of Local Cytosolic Calcium Release by Photothermal Heating for Studying Intra&#8208; and Intercellular Calcium Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology is reported to trigger intra&#8208; and intercellular calcium waves by photoexcitation. Polymeric capsules with integrated plasmonic nanoparticles inside lysosomes are individually excited by near&#8208;infrared light to transiently release small amounts of Ca2+, which can evoke abundant Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to further propagating intra&#8208; and intercellular calcium waves.








Abstract
A methodology is described that allows for localized Ca2+ release by photoexcitation. For this, cells are loaded with polymer capsules with integrated plasmonic nanoparticles, which reside in endo&#8208;lysosomes. The micrometer&#8208;sized capsules can be individually excited by near&#8208;infrared light from a light pointer, causing photothermal heating, upon which there is a rise in the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The [Ca2+]i can be analyzed with a Ca2+ indicator fluorophore. In this way, it is possible to excite local lysosomal Ca2+ release in a desired target cell.

         <title>Localized Delivery of Theranostic Nanoparticles and High&#8208;Energy Photons using Microneedles&#8208;on&#8208;Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microneedle&#8208;based local delivery of light&#8208;responsive theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) and high&#8208;energy photons to treat brain tumors is proposed. The multifunctional theranostic NPs are delivered locally using bioresorbable microneedles. Then, high&#8208;energy photons generated from integrated bioelectronics are delivered by the light&#8208;guiding/spreading microneedles to the NPs to activate photodynamic therapy/chemotherapy. The efficacy of the proposed treatment is demonstrated with two types of brain tumor model in vivo.








Abstract
The low delivery efficiency of light&#8208;responsive theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) to target tumor sites, particularly to brain tumors due to the blood&#8211;brain barrier, has been a critical issue in NP&#8208;based cancer treatments. Furthermore, high&#8208;energy photons that can effectively activate theranostic NPs are hardly delivered to the target region due to the strong scattering of such photons while penetrating surrounding tissues. Here, a localized delivery method of theranostic NPs and high&#8208;energy photons to the target tumor using microneedles&#8208;on&#8208;bioelectronics is presented. Two types of microneedles and flexible bioelectronics are integrated and mounted on the edge of surgical forceps. Bioresorbable microneedles containing theranostic NPs deliver the NPs into target tumors (e.g., glioblastoma, pituitary adenoma). Magnetic resonance imaging can locate the NPs. Then, light&#8208;guiding/spreading microneedles deliver high&#8208;energy photons from bioelectronics to the NPs. The high&#8208;energy photons activate the NPs to treat tumor tissues by photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The controlled thermal actuation by the bioelectronics accelerates the diffusion of chemo&#8208;drugs. The proposed method is demonstrated with mouse tumor models in vivo.

         <title>Electrically Induced Mixed Valence Increases the Conductivity of Copper Helical Metallopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation in the conductivity of 1D materials is of importance for nanoscale control of electrical currents. Self&#8208;assembled molecular wires containing Cu ions in the +1 oxidation state are shown to increase their conductivity by 4 orders of magnitude upon applying an electrical stimulus. The mechanism of this resistance change is attributed to the system adopting a mixed&#8208;valence CuI/CuII state.








Abstract
Controlling the flow of electrical current at the nanoscale typically requires complex top&#8208;down approaches. Here, a bottom&#8208;up approach is employed to demonstrate resistive switching within molecular wires that consist of double&#8208;helical metallopolymers and are constructed by self&#8208;assembly. When the material is exposed to an electric field, it is determined that &#8776;25% of the copper atoms oxidize from CuI to CuII, without rupture of the polymer chain. The ability to sustain such a high level of oxidation is unprecedented in a copper&#8208;based molecule: it is made possible here by the double helix compressing in order to satisfy the new coordination geometry required by CuII. This mixed&#8208;valence structure exhibits a 104&#8208;fold increase in conductivity, which is projected to last on the order of years. The increase in conductivity is explained as being promoted by the creation, upon oxidation, of partly filled dz2 orbitals aligned along the mixed&#8208;valence copper array; the long&#8208;lasting nature of the change in conductivity is due to the structural rearrangement of the double&#8208;helix, which poses an energetic barrier to re&#8208;reduction. This work establishes helical metallopolymers as a new platform for controlling currents at the nanoscale.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Free, One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Hollow Nanospheres for Trace CO Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly pure lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are synthesized in large quantities using a surfactant&#8208;free one&#8208;step method. These ultrapure nanospheres exhibit superiority in detection of CO with a lower limit of 50 ppb, which is the lowest among all reported CO chemresistive materials.








Abstract
Owing to their special photoelectric properties, halide perovskites have always attracted research attention. Hollow&#8208;structured halide perovskites have many practical applications but are challenging to prepare as most template methods violate their poor chemical and thermal stability. In this study, novel halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are prepared using a template&#8208;free method; specifically, large quantities of highly pure lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are produced at 30&#160;&#176;C without a surfactant. These ultrapure nanospheres exhibit superiority in chemresistive detection of CO with a detection limit of 50 ppb, which is the lowest among all the reported CO sensing materials. Moreover, in situ sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation spectra and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high sensitivity is attributable to the large specific surface area and surfactant&#8208;free surface of rich Br&#8722; vacancies that favor CO binding. Overall, this work provides insight on regulation of the halide perovskite structure and the use of hollow spheres in gas&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Dual&#8208;Mode Temporal Communication via Digitally Programmable Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A digitally programmable phase&#8208;change material is reported, for which the crystallization kinetics can be controlled in a pixelated manner. It enables secured temporal communications in both optical and infrared modes, and the stored information can self&#8208;evolve with time, standing in sharp contrast to stimuli&#8208;responsive color/infrared change of other systems.








Abstract
Switchable optical properties are essential for numerous technologies including communication, anticounterfeiting, camouflage, and imaging/sensing. Typically, the switching is enabled by applying external stimulation such as UV light for fluorescence detection. In contrast, ground squirrels utilize spontaneous live infrared emission for fencing off predators as a unique way of communication. Inspired by this, live evolution of both optical and thermal images for temporal communication in which time is the encoded information is demonstrated. This system is based on a digitally light&#8208;cured polymeric phase&#8208;change material for which the crystallization kinetics can be controlled in a pixelated manner. Consequently, live evolution in optical transparency during the crystallization process enables temporal optical communication. Additionally, by harnessing the dynamic evolution of the thermal enthalpy, multiple sets of time&#8208;specific information can be reversibly retrieved as self&#8208;evolving infrared thermal images. The versatility of this dual&#8208;mode temporal system expands the scope for secured communication, with potential implications for various other areas including optics, thermal regulation, and 3D/4D printing.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bridged Graphene&#8211;Protein Supraparticles for Analog and Digital Nitric Oxide Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can assemble into self&#8208;limited supraparticles when van der Waals forces are supplemented by coordination bonds with Tb3+ ions. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is incorporated into supraparticles, which enables a selective assay for nitric oxide (NO) with ultrahigh sensitivity. Practical for NO detection in exhaled breath, a rapid non&#8208;invasive test is approached for pulmonary inflammation, such as coronavirus pneumonia.








Abstract
Self&#8208;limited nanoassemblies, such as supraparticles (SPs), can be made from virtually any nanoscale components, but SPs from nanocarbons including graphene quantum dots (GQDs), are hardly known because of the weak van der Waals attraction between them. Here it is shown that highly uniform SPs from GQDs can be successfully assembled when the components are bridged by Tb3+ ions supplementing van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, they can be coassembled with superoxide dismutase, which also has weak attraction to GQDs. Tight structural integration of multilevel components into SPs enables efficient transfer of excitonic energy from GQDs and protein to Tb3+. This mechanism is activated when Cu2+ is reduced to Cu1+ by nitric oxide (NO)&#8212;an important biomarker for viral pulmonary infections and Alzheimer's disease. Due to multipronged fluorescence enhancement, the limit of NO detection improves 200 times reaching 10 &#215; 10&#8211;12 m. Furthermore, the uniform size of SPs enables digitization of the NO detection using the single particle detection format resulting in confident registration of as few as 600 molecules mL&#8722;1. The practicality of the SP&#8208;based assay is demonstrated by the successful monitoring of NO in human breath. The biocompatible SPs combining proteins, carbonaceous nanostructures, and ionic components provide a general path for engineering uniquely sensitive assays for noninvasive tracking of infections and other diseases.

         <title>Underwater Communication and Optical Camouflage Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transparent, underwater adhesive, underwater self&#8208;healable, stretchable, and 3D&#8208;printable ionogel with high ionic conductivity is developed to create a submersible soft sensor. Optical camouflage, human&#8208;body&#8208;motion detection, and barrier&#8208;free communication can be achieved by the ionogel sensor in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism, which can avoid fatigue and physical damage, is also proposed.








Abstract
Marine animals, such as leptocephalus and jellyfish, can sense external stimuli and achieve optical camouflage in the aquatic environment. Fabricating an intelligent soft sensor that can mimic the capabilities of transparent marine animals and function underwater can enable transformative applications in various novel fields. However, previously reported soft sensors struggle to meet the requirements of adhesion, self&#8208;healing ability, optical transparency, and stable conductivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, high&#8208;performance ionogels by virtue of ion&#8211;dipole and ion&#8211;ion interactions between fluorine&#8208;rich poly(ionic liquid) and ionic liquid are designed. The hydrophobic dynamic viscoelastic networks provide excellent properties for ionogels, including optical transparency, adjustable mechanical properties, underwater self&#8208;healing ability, underwater adhesiveness, conductivity, and 3D printability. A mechanically compliant and visually invisible underwater soft sensor based on ionogel is developed. This sensor can achieve optical camouflage, human&#8208;body&#8208;motion detection, and barrier&#8208;free communication in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism based on changing the electron transfer pathway is proposed. Several interesting functions, such as detection of water environment changes, recognition of objects, delivery of information, and even identification of human standing posture can be realized. Importantly, the ionogel sensor can avoid fatigue and physical damage in the sensing process.

Optical camouflage, human-body-motion detection, and barrier-free communication can be achieved by the ionogel sensor in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism, which can avoid fatigue and physical damage, is also proposed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine animals, such as leptocephalus and jellyfish, can sense external stimuli and achieve optical camouflage in the aquatic environment. Fabricating an intelligent soft sensor that can mimic the capabilities of transparent marine animals and function underwater can enable transformative applications in various novel fields. However, previously reported soft sensors struggle to meet the requirements of adhesion, self-healing ability, optical transparency, and stable conductivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, high-performance ionogels by virtue of ion&#8211;dipole and ion&#8211;ion interactions between fluorine-rich poly(ionic liquid) and ionic liquid are designed. The hydrophobic dynamic viscoelastic networks provide excellent properties for ionogels, including optical transparency, adjustable mechanical properties, underwater self-healing ability, underwater adhesiveness, conductivity, and 3D printability. A mechanically compliant and visually invisible underwater soft sensor based on ionogel is developed. This sensor can achieve optical camouflage, human-body-motion detection, and barrier-free communication in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism based on changing the electron transfer pathway is proposed. Several interesting functions, such as detection of water environment changes, recognition of objects, delivery of information, and even identification of human standing posture can be realized. Importantly, the ionogel sensor can avoid fatigue and physical damage in the sensing process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multifunctional Graphdiyne&#8211;Cerium Oxide Nanozymes Facilitate MicroRNA Delivery and Attenuate Tumor Hypoxia for Highly Efficient Radiotherapy of Esophageal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiotherapy sensitization system that integrates graphdiyne&#8211;CeO2&#8208;based nanozymes and miR181a&#8208;2&#8208;3p (miR181a) delivery with excellent catalase&#8208;mimic activity and radiosensitization is developed for the efficient radiotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Since miR181a is secreted and predicts response to preoperative radiotherapy in human locally advanced ESCC, this strategy may offer opportunities for the clinical translation of therapies and facilitate patient&#8208;personalized treatment.








Abstract
Radioresistance is an important challenge for clinical treatments. The main causes of radioresistance include hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment, the antioxidant system within cancer cells, and the upregulation of DNA repair proteins. Here, a multiple radiosensitization strategy of high&#8208;Z&#8208;element&#8208;based radiation enhancement is designed, attenuating hypoxia and microRNA therapy. The novel 2D graphdiyne (GDY) can firmly anchor and disperse CeO2 nanoparticles to form GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanocomposites, which exhibit superior catalase&#8208;mimic activity in decomposing H2O2 to O2 to significantly alleviate tumor hypoxia, promote radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage, and ultimately inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The miR181a&#8208;2&#8208;3p (miR181a) serum levels in patients are predictive of the response to preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and facilitate personalized treatment. Moreover, miR181a can act as a radiosensitizer by directly targeting RAD17 and regulating the Chk2 pathway. Subsequently, the GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanocomposites with miR181a are conjugated with the iRGD&#8208;grafted polyoxyethylene glycol (short for nano&#8208;miR181a), which can increase the stability, efficiently deliver miR181a to tumor, and exhibit low toxicity. Notably, nano&#8208;miR181a can overcome radioresistance and enhance therapeutic efficacy both in a subcutaneous tumor model and human&#8208;patient&#8208;derived xenograft models. Overall, this GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanozyme and miR181a&#8208;based multisensitized radiotherapy strategy provides a promising therapeutic approach for ESCC.

         <title>K&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Design Utilizing Trigonal Prismatic Ligand Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemistry of a trigonal&#8208;prismatic (TP) TMO6 unit is revealed in a K&#8208;ion battery cathode. The activity, reversibility, and stability of TP FeO6 based on comprehensive synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analyses demonstrate it is a feasible structural gene for electrode design and exploration. Further materials lattice and electronic structure manipulation are expected.








Abstract
The intrinsic physical and chemical properties of materials are largely governed by the bonding and electronic structures of their fundamental building units. The majority of cathode materials contain octahedral TMO6 (TM = transition metal), which dominates the redox chemistry during electrochemical operation. As a less symmetric form of TMO6, the trigonal prismatic geometry is not a traditionally favored coordination configuration as it tends to lose the crystal&#8208;field stabilization energy and thus generate large ligand repulsion. Herein, a K&#8208;ion battery cathode design, K2Fe(C2O4)2, is shown&#8203;, where the TMO6 trigonal prism (TP) is not only electrochemically active but stable enough to allow for excellent cycling stability. Detailed synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal the evolution of localized fine structure, evidencing the electrochemical activity, reversibility, and stability of the TP motif. The findings are expected to expand the toolbox for the rational design of electrode materials by taking advantage of TP as a structural gene.

         <title>Exceptional Cocatalyst&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Enhanced Piezocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of Carbon Nitride Nanosheets from Strong In&#8208;Plane Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptional photo&#8208;enhanced piezocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 12.16 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without any cocatalysts is realized by g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, outperforming most previously reported piezocatalysts and g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts, which originates from the large anomalous piezoelectricity induced by in&#8208;plane polarization, coupled with the photo&#8208;improved surface charge transfer and strain&#8208;enriched surface reactive sites.








Abstract
Utilizing mechanical energy to produce hydrogen is emerging as a promising way to generate renewable energy, but is challenged by low efficiency and scanty cognition. In this work, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) with an atomically thin sheet&#8208;like structure is applied for prominent piezocatalytic and photo&#8208;enhanced piezocatalytic H2 production. It is revealed that the anomalous piezoelectricity in g&#8208;C3N4 originates from the strong in&#8208;plane polarization along the a&#8208;axis, contributed by the superimposed polar tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units and flexoelectric effect derived from the structured triangular cavities, which provides powerful electrochemical driving force for the water reduction reaction. Furthermore, the photo&#8208;enhanced charge transfer enables g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to reserve more energized polarization charges to fully participate in the reaction at the surface reactive sites enriched by strain&#8208;induced carbon vacancies. Without any cocatalysts, an exceptional photo&#8208;piezocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 12.16 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is delivered by the g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, far exceeding that of previously reported piezocatalysts and g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts. Further, high pure&#8208;water&#8208;splitting performance with production of the value&#8208;added oxidation product H2O2 via photo&#8208;piezocatalysis is also disclosed. This work not only exposes the potential of g&#8208;C3N4 as a piezo&#8208;semiconductor for catalytic H2 evolution, but also breaks a new ground for the conversion of solar and mechanical energy by photomediated piezocatalytic reaction.

         <title>Characterization and Quantification of Depletion and Accumulation Layers in Solid&#8208;State Li+&#8208;Conducting Electrolytes Using In Situ Spectroscopic Ellipsometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are one of the few battery technologies for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the high interface resistance in contact with electrode materials is still largely unexplained. Spectroscopic ellipsometry combined with in situ electrochemistry reveals highly asymmetric space charge layer occurrence. It opens a new study field to investigate and quantify the charge layer formation in solid&#8208;state electrolytes by optical means.








Abstract
The future of mobility depends on the development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies, such as all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. As the ionic conductivity of solid Li+&#8208;conductors can, in some cases, approach that of liquid electrolytes, a significant remaining barrier faced by solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) is the interface formed at the anode and cathode materials, with chemical instability and physical resistances arising. The physical properties of space charge layers (SCLs), a widely discussed phenomenon in SSEs, are still unclear. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to characterize the accumulation and depletion layers. An optical model is developed to quantify their thicknesses and corresponding concentration changes. It is shown that the Li+&#8208;depleted layer (&#8776;190&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) is thinner than the accumulation layer (&#8776;320&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) in a glassy lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting glass ceramic electrolyte (a trademark of Ohara Corporation). The in situ approach combining electrochemistry and optics resolves the ambiguities around SCL formation. It opens up a wide field of optical measurements on SSEs, allowing various experimental studies in the future.

     alt="Characterization and Quantification of Depletion and Accumulation Layers in Solid-State Li+-Conducting Electrolytes Using In Situ Spectroscopic Ellipsometry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state electrolytes are one of the few battery technologies for next-generation batteries. However, the high interface resistance in contact with electrode materials is still largely unexplained. Spectroscopic ellipsometry combined with in situ electrochemistry reveals highly asymmetric space charge layer occurrence. It opens a new study field to investigate and quantify the charge layer formation in solid-state electrolytes by optical means.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of mobility depends on the development of next-generation battery technologies, such as all-solid-state batteries. As the ionic conductivity of solid Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductors can, in some cases, approach that of liquid electrolytes, a significant remaining barrier faced by solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) is the interface formed at the anode and cathode materials, with chemical instability and physical resistances arising. The physical properties of space charge layers (SCLs), a widely discussed phenomenon in SSEs, are still unclear. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to characterize the accumulation and depletion layers. An optical model is developed to quantify their thicknesses and corresponding concentration changes. It is shown that the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-depleted layer (&#8776;190&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) is thinner than the accumulation layer (&#8776;320&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) in a glassy lithium-ion-conducting glass ceramic electrolyte (a trademark of Ohara Corporation). The in situ approach combining electrochemistry and optics resolves the ambiguities around SCL formation. It opens up a wide field of optical measurements on SSEs, allowing various experimental studies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Silicon Frameworks: A New Platform for Transparent Flexible Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supported, flexible, and highly transparent single&#8208;crystalline silicon frameworks (sc&#8208;SiFs) are fabricated from commonly used Si wafers by combining wet&#8208;etching and microfabrication technologies. They provide a new platform for transparent flexible optoelectronics, enabling the construction of high&#8208;performance transparent flexible Si&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline silicon (sc&#8208;Si) is the dominant semiconductor material for the modern electronics industry. Despite their excellent photoelectric and electronic properties, the rigidity, brittleness, and nontransparency of commonly used silicon wafers limit their application in transparent flexible optoelectronics. In this study, a new type of Si microstructure, named single&#8208;crystalline Si frameworks (sc&#8208;SiFs), is developed, through a combination of wet&#8208;etching and microfabrication technologies. The sc&#8208;SiFs are self&#8208;supported, flexible, lightweight, tailorable, and highly transparent. They can withstand a small bending radius of less than 0.5&#160;mm and have a transparency of up to 96% in all wavelength ranges, owing to the hollowed&#8208;out framework structures. Thus, the sc&#8208;SiFs provide a new platform for high&#8208;performance transparent flexible optoelectronics. Taking transparent flexible photodetectors (TFPDs) as an example, substrate&#8208;free and self&#8208;driven TFPDs are achieved based on the sc&#8208;SiFs. The devices exhibit superior performance compared to other reported TFPDs and reveal the great potential for integrated optoelectronic applications. The development of sc&#8208;SiFs paves the way toward the fabrication of high&#8208;performance transparent flexible devices for a host of applications, including e&#8208;skins, the Internet of Things, transparent flexible displays, and artificial&#160;visual&#160;cortexes.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Gradient Hydrogels Enable Direct Zero Liquid Discharge for Hypersaline Wastewater Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero liquid discharge (ZLD), as the ultimate goal of wastewater treatment, is hampered by the lack of robust membrane&#8208;based desalination technologies. A hydrophilic nonporous charge&#8208;gradient hydrogel (CGH) membrane shows high water flux and excellent fouling/scaling&#8208;free properties in membrane distillation, enabling direct and ultrastable desalination of hypersaline wastewater (130&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1) containing broad&#8208;spectrum foulants (500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1) for 200&#160;h.








Abstract
Zero liquid discharge (ZLD), which maximizes water recovery and eliminates environmental impact, is an urgent wastewater management strategy for alleviating freshwater shortage. However, because of the high concentration of salts and broad&#8208;spectrum foulants in wastewater, a huge challenge for ZLD is lack of a robust membrane&#8208;based desalination technology that enables direct wastewater recovery without costly pretreatment processes. Here, a paradigm&#8208;shift membrane distillation (MD) strategy is presented, wherein the traditional hydrophobic porous membrane is replaced with a hydrophilic nonporous charge&#8208;gradient hydrogel (CGH) membrane that possesses hypersaline tolerance, fouling/scaling&#8208;free properties, and negligible vapor transfer resistance inside the membrane, simultaneously. Therefore, the CGH&#8208;based MD with high water flux enables direct desalination of hypersaline wastewater (130&#160;g&#160;L&#8208;1) containing broad&#8208;spectrum foulants (500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8208;1) during continuous long&#8208;term operation (200 h), and this technology paves a promising way to direct ZLD for wastewater management.

         <title>A Floating Mold Technique for the Programmed Assembly of Protocells into Protocellular Materials Capable of Non&#8208;Equilibrium Biochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protocellular materials are constructed using a bottom&#8208;up strategy enabled by simple floating molds. The technique allows the fabrication of free&#8208;standing, macroscopic, and robust materials from protocell building blocks that are stable in water media, are capable of communicating both internally and with the external environment, and display rudimentary forms of emergent behaviors that are generated from the synergistic interaction of their constituent parts.








Abstract
Despite important breakthroughs in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology, a major challenge still remains the construction of free&#8208;standing, macroscopic, and robust materials from protocell building blocks that are stable in water and capable of emergent behaviors. Herein, a new floating mold technique for the fabrication of millimeter&#8208; to centimeter&#8208;sized protocellular materials (PCMs) of any shape that overcomes most of the current challenges in prototissue engineering is reported. Significantly, this technique also allows for the generation of 2D periodic arrays of PCMs that display an emergent non&#8208;equilibrium spatiotemporal sensing behavior. These arrays are capable of collectively translating the information provided by the external environment and are encoded in the form of propagating reaction&#8211;diffusion fronts into a readable dynamic signal output. Overall, the methodology opens up a route to the fabrication of macroscopic and robust tissue&#8208;like materials with emergent behaviors, providing a new paradigm of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and biomimetic materials science.

         <title>Biomimetic Hairy Whiskers for Robotic Skin Tactility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered biomimetic whisker mechanoreceptor based on the bionics design of animal whiskers and a robotic tactile sensing system is constructed for robots to realize environmental exploration, robotic navigation, prey&#8208;tracking, and danger avoidance with effectively improved device lifetime, sensitivity, stability, and anti&#8208;interference performance compared to traditional electronic skin.








Abstract
Touch sensing is among the most important sensing capabilities of a human, and the same is true for smart robotics. Current research on tactile sensors is mainly concentrated on electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), but e&#8208;skin is prone to be easily dirtied, damaged, and disturbed after repeated usage, which greatly limits its practical applications in robotics. Here, by mimicking the way that animals explore the environment using hair&#8208;based sensors, a bendable biomimetic whisker mechanoreceptor (BWMR) is designed for robotic tactile sensing. Owing to the advantages of triboelectric nanogenerator technology, the BWMR can convert external mechanical stimuli into electrical signals without a power supply, which is conducive to its widespread applications in robots. Because of the leverage effect of the whisker, the BWMR can distinguish an exciting force of 1.129&#160;&#956;N by amplifying external weak signals, which can be further improved by increasing the whisker length. Real&#8208;time sensing is demonstrated using a BWMR, exhibiting its potential for robotic tactile systems.

         <title>Graphene Energy Transfer for Single&#8208;Molecule Biophysics, Biosensing, and Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>

Graphene is a broadband and unbleachable energy&#8208;transfer acceptor with no need for labeling. To demonstrate the capabilities of graphene&#8208;on&#8208;glass coverslips, a variety of demonstration assays are placed on graphene using DNA origami nanopositioners. The results highlight the potential for single&#8208;molecule biophysics, biosensing, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.








Abstract
Graphene is considered a game&#8208;changing material, especially for its mechanical and electrical properties. This work exploits that graphene is almost transparent but quenches fluorescence in a range up to &#8776;40 nm. Graphene as a broadband and unbleachable energy&#8208;transfer acceptor without labeling, is used to precisely determine the height of molecules with respect to graphene, to visualize the dynamics of DNA nanostructures, and to determine the orientation of F&#246;rster&#8208;type resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs. Using DNA origami nanopositioners, biosensing, single&#8208;molecule tracking, and DNA PAINT super&#8208;resolution with &lt;3 nm z&#8208;resolution are demonstrated. The range of examples shows the potential of graphene&#8208;on&#8208;glass coverslips as a versatile platform for single&#8208;molecule biophysics, biosensing, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

         <title>Observing and Modeling the Sequential Pairwise Reactions that Drive Solid&#8208;State Ceramic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent ceramics are often synthesized in a &#8220;black&#8208;box&#8221; reactor, with little understanding of how multiple precursors evolve into a target material. Ab initio modeling and in situ observations are used to interrogate the phase evolution of YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), highlighting the critical role of precursor selection in designing kinetically favorable synthesis pathways.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state synthesis from powder precursors is the primary processing route to advanced multicomponent ceramic materials. Designing reaction conditions and precursors for ceramic synthesis can be a laborious, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process, as heterogeneous mixtures of precursors often evolve through a complicated series of reaction intermediates. Here, ab initio thermodynamics is used to model which pair of precursors has the most reactive interface, enabling the understanding and anticipation of which non&#8208;equilibrium intermediates form in the early stages of a solid&#8208;state reaction. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and in situ electron microscopy are then used to observe how these initial intermediates influence phase evolution in the synthesis of the classic high&#8208;temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+x&#160;(YBCO). The model developed herein rationalizes how the replacement of the traditional BaCO3 precursor with BaO2 redirects phase evolution through a low&#8208;temperature eutectic melt, facilitating the formation of YBCO in 30 min instead of 12+ h. Precursor selection plays an important role in tuning the thermodynamics of interfacial reactions and emerges as an important design parameter in planning kinetically favorable synthesis pathways to complex ceramic materials.

Near&#8208;infrared light excitation of individual polymeric capsules with integrated plasmonic nanoparticles enables release of Ca2+. The small amount of released Ca2+ from lysosomes rapidly triggers robust Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to a propagating intra&#8208; and intercellular calcium waves, as described by Wolfgang J. Parak and co&#8208;workers in article number 2008261.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical iron oxide nanoparticles in dispersion are controlled by external magnetic fields to form flexible and reversible chains for biomedical applications. In article number 2008683, Mikhail Feygenson and co&#8208;workers combine the advanced scattering methods and reverse Monte Carlo simulations to directly visualize the chain formation in real space. This methodology paves the way for exploring novel assemblies of particles with a complex morphology in various liquid carriers.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional electronic skin tattoo system is developed by drawing carbon nanotube patterns on electrospun silk nanofiber mats, as described by Sunghwan Kim and co-workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202008308"&gt;2008308&lt;/a&gt;. The tattoo system offers ultrathin, ultralight, biocompatible, deformable, and skin adhesion. Heat-stimulated drug delivery with controlled temperature and electrophysiological signal monitoring are possible using this electronic tattoo system in a noninvasive manner.

         <dc:description>
The fabrication of tissue&#8208;like materials capable of emergent bioinspired behaviors represents an emerging challenge of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and biomimetic materials science. In article number 2100340, Pierangelo Gobbo and co&#8208;workers report a new technique for the assembly of tissue&#8208;like materials from protocell building blocks. The resulting &#8220;protocellular materials&#8221; are free&#8208;standing, robust, and can be chemically programmed to display an emergent non&#8208;equilibrium spatiotemporal sensing behavior.

         <title>Polarons and Charge Localization in Metal&#8208;Halide Semiconductors for Photovoltaic and Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of charge&#8211;lattice interactions in metal&#8208;halide semiconductors of different crystal structures and chemical compositions is examined. Large polaron formation in metal&#8208;halide perovskites enables excellent optoelectronic properties, underpinning applications in solar cells. In other metal&#8208;halide materials, including double perovskites, nanostructured and corner&#8208;sharing materials, the strength of polaronic effects is less certain, with further scope for investigations being identified.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide semiconductors have shown excellent performance in optoelectronic applications such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and detectors. In this review the role of charge&#8211;lattice interactions and polaron formation in a wide range of these promising materials, including perovskites, double perovskites, Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper layered perovskites, nanocrystals, vacancy&#8208;ordered, and other novel structures, is summarized. The formation of Fr&#246;hlich&#8208;type &#8220;large&#8221; polarons in archetypal bulk metal&#8208;halide ABX3 perovskites and its dependence on A&#8208;cation, B&#8208;metal, and X&#8208;halide composition, which is now relatively well understood, are discussed. It is found that, for nanostructured and novel metal&#8208;halide materials, a larger variation in the strengths of polaronic effects is reported across the literature, potentially deriving from variations in potential barriers and the presence of interfaces at which lattice relaxation may be enhanced. Such findings are further discussed in the context of different experimental approaches used to explore polaronic effects, cautioning that firm conclusions are often hampered by the presence of alternate processes and interactions giving rise to similar experimental signatures. Overall, a complete understanding of polaronic effects will prove essential given their direct influence on optoelectronic properties such as charge&#8208;carrier mobilities and emission spectra, which are critical to the performance of energy and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Molecules on Surfaces: From Isolated Molecules to Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover molecules (SCMs) are one of the most promising candidates for molecular spintronics applications due to their ability to exist in two spin states that can be reversibly switched by light and voltage, among others. Investigations of SCMs on surfaces are summarized, highlighting the achievements and challenges, as well as laying out the future prospects.








Abstract
Molecular spintronics seeks to use single or few molecules as functional building blocks for spintronic applications, directly relying on molecular properties or properties of interfaces between molecules and inorganic electrodes. Spin&#8208;crossover molecules (SCMs) are one of the most promising classes of candidates for molecular spintronics due to their bistability deriving from the existence of two spin states that can be reversibly switched by temperature, light, electric fields, etc. Building devices based on single or few molecules would entail connecting the molecule(s) with solid surfaces and understanding the fundamental behavior of the resulting assemblies. Herein, the investigations of SCMs on solid surfaces, ranging from isolated single molecules (submonolayers) to ultrathin films (mainly in the sub&#8208;10 nm range) are summarized. The achievements, challenges and prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Multifaceted Design and Emerging Applications of Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 24, June 17, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformative advances are made in the field of tissue adhesives, fueled by the synergy between disciplines ranging from mechanics and chemistry to biology. A multifaceted design of tissue adhesives is presented with examples in emerging applications. Immediate opportunities and future directions are highlighted for next&#8208;generation tissue adhesives, which would make broad impact in engineering and medicine.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives can form appreciable adhesion with tissues and have found clinical use in a variety of medical settings such as wound closure, surgical sealants, regenerative medicine, and device attachment. The advantages of tissue adhesives include ease of implementation, rapid application, mitigation of tissue damage, and compatibility with minimally invasive procedures. The field of tissue adhesives is rapidly evolving, leading to tissue adhesives with superior mechanical properties and advanced functionality. Such adhesives enable new applications ranging from mobile health to cancer treatment. To provide guidelines for the rational design of tissue adhesives, here, existing strategies for tissue adhesives are synthesized into a multifaceted design, which comprises three design elements: the tissue, the adhesive surface, and the adhesive matrix. The mechanical, chemical, and biological considerations associated with each design element are reviewed. Throughout the report, the limitations of existing tissue adhesives and immediate opportunities for improvement are discussed. The recent progress of tissue adhesives in topical and implantable applications is highlighted, and then future directions toward next&#8208;generation tissue adhesives are outlined. The development of tissue adhesives will fuse disciplines and make broad impacts in engineering and medicine.

         <title>Molecular Imprinting: Green Perspectives and Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to increasing concerns about the detrimental impacts of unsustainable molecular imprinting technology (MIT), MIT has veered toward greener pathways. Fourteen green principles specifically for MIT are codified using a nomenclature of &#8220;GREENIFICATION.&#8221; All aspects of greenificated MITs, including fundamentals, strategies, and future perspectives, are comprehensively reviewed. Moreover, a roadmap of greenificated MIT from 2012 to 2030 is proposed.








Abstract
Advances in revolutionary technologies pose new challenges for human life; in response to them, global responsibility is pushing modern technologies toward greener pathways. Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) is a multidisciplinary mimic technology simulating the specific binding principle of enzymes to substrates or antigens to antibodies; along with its rapid progress and wide applications, MIT faces the challenge of complying with green sustainable development requirements. With the identification of environmental risks associated with unsustainable MIT, a new aspect of MIT, termed green MIT, has emerged and developed. However, so far, no clear definition has been provided to appraise green MIT. Herein, the implementation process of green chemistry in MIT is demonstrated and a mnemonic device in the form of an acronym, GREENIFICATION, is proposed to present the green MIT principles. The entire greenificated imprinting process is surveyed, including element choice, polymerization implementation, energy input, imprinting strategies, waste treatment, and recovery, as well as the impacts of these processes on operator health and the environment. Moreover, assistance of upgraded instrumentation in deploying greener goals is considered. Finally, future perspectives are presented to provide a more complete picture of the greenificated MIT road map and to pave the way for further development.

         <title>Innovations in Disease State Responsive Soft Materials for Targeting Extracellular Stimuli Associated with Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decade, the field of programmable soft materials for biomedical applications has rapidly expanded. Herein, recent advances that show promising results in preclinical animal models are described for the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Efforts have focused on materials capable of sensing disease&#8208;associated endogenous stimuli and responding via a range of dynamic processes.








Abstract
Recent advances in polymer chemistry, materials sciences, and biotechnology have allowed the preclinical development of sophisticated programmable nanomedicines and materials that are able to precisely respond to specific disease&#8208;associated triggers and microenvironments. These stimuli, endogenous to the targeted diseases, include pH, redox&#8208;state, small molecules, and protein upregulation. Herein, recent advances and innovative approaches in programmable soft materials capable of sensing the aforementioned disease&#8208;associated stimuli and responding via a range of dynamic processes including morphological and size transitions, changes in mobility and retention, as well as disassembly are described. In this field generally, the majority of ongoing and past research effort has focused on oncology. Given this interest, examples of the latest innovative approaches to chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy treatment strategies for cancer are presented. Moreover, as the field broadens its attention, applications of programmable materials in other diseases are highlighted, with a special focus on cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, where limited attention is paid by the field, but where many promising avenues exist with high potential impact.

         <title>Multimodal Digital X&#8208;ray Scanners with Synchronous Mapping of Tactile Pressure Distributions using Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multimodal integration of perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors and pressure&#8208;sensitive air&#8208;dielectric transistors, synchronous mapping of internal structures and morphologies of the object is realized. This work provides the simultaneous imaging of anatomical structures and the pressure distribution using the multiplexed platform, thereby indicating the substantial potential of the system for next&#8208;generation, non&#8208;destructive inspection and medical diagnosis.








Abstract
Visual and tactile information are the key intuitive perceptions in sensory systems, and the synchronized detection of these two sensory modalities can enhance accuracy of object recognition by providing complementary information between them. Herein, multimodal integration of flexible, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detectors with a synchronous mapping of tactile pressure distributions for visualizing internal structures and morphologies of an object simultaneously is reported. As a visual&#8208;inspection method, perovskite materials that convert X&#8208;rays into charge carriers directly are synthesized. By incorporating pressure&#8208;sensitive air&#8208;dielectric transistors in the perovskite components, X&#8208;ray detectors with dual modalities (i.e., vision and touch) are attained as an active&#8208;matrix platform for digital visuotactile examinations. Also, in vivo X&#8208;ray imaging and pressure sensing are demonstrated using a live rat. This multiplexed platform has high spatial resolution and good flexibility, thereby providing highly accurate inspection and diagnoses even for the distorted images of nonplanar objects.

         <title>Recent Progress on Perovskite Surfaces and Interfaces in Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports recent progress on perovskite surface and interface science of perovskite optoelectronic devices. The impact of various surface and interface defects on heterojunction energy barriers and carrier dynamics in devices is reviewed and discussed. Practical engineering methods to mitigate these defects at various interfaces in devices are summarized as well.








Abstract
Surfaces and heterojunction interfaces, where defects and energy levels dictate charge&#8208;carrier dynamics in optoelectronic devices, are critical for unlocking the full potential of perovskite semiconductors. In this progress report, chemical structures of perovskite surfaces are discussed and basic physical rules for the band alignment are summarized at various perovskite interfaces. Common perovskite surfaces are typically decorated by various compositional and structural defects such as residual surface reactants, discrete nanoclusters, reactions by products, vacancies, interstitials, antisites, etc. Some of these surface species induce deep&#8208;level defect states in the forbidden band forming very harmful charge&#8208;carrier traps and affect negatively the interface band alignments for achieving optimal device performance. Herein, an overview of research progresses on surface and interface engineering is provided to minimize deep&#8208;level defect states. The reviewed subjects include selection of interface and substrate buffer layers for growing better crystals, materials and processing methods for surface passivation, the surface catalyst for microstructure transformations, organic semiconductors for charge extraction or injection, heterojunctions with wide bandgap perovskites or nanocrystals for mitigating defects, and electrode interlayer for preventing interdiffusion and reactions. These surface and interface engineering strategies are shown to be critical in boosting device performance for both solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>A Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite for Hydrogen Sulfide Gas and Trimodal&#8208;Enhanced Enzyme Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designed nanocomposite based on tetra&#8208;sulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;incorporated dendritic mesoporous organosilica as an effective cornerstone to load with chloroperoxidase (CPO) and sodium hyaluronate modified calcium peroxide nanoparticles (CaO2&#8208;HA NPs) can release Ca2+, hydrogen peroxide, and CPO rapidly in tumor microenvironment and generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Therefore, H2S gas, tri&#8208;enhanced enzyme dynamic therapy, and Ca2+&#8208;interference combined tumor therapy strategy has been established.








Abstract
Recently, enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) has drawn much attention as a new type of dynamic therapy. However, the selection of suitable nanocarriers to deliver chloroperoxidase (CPO) and enhancement of the level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are critical factors for improving the efficiency of EDT. In this study, a rapidly decomposing nanocomposite is designed using tetra&#8208;sulfide&#8208;bond&#8208;incorporating dendritic mesoporous organosilica (DMOS) as a nanocarrier, followed by loading CPO and sodium&#8208;hyaluronate&#8208;modified calcium peroxide nanoparticles (CaO2&#8208;HA NPs). The nanocomposite can effectively generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for tumor therapy without any exogenous stimulus via trimodal&#8208;enhanced EDT, including DMOS&#8208;induced depletion of glutathione (GSH), H2O2 compensation from CaO2&#8208;HA NPs in mildly acidic TME, and oxidative stress caused by overloading of Ca2+. As tetra&#8208;sulfide bonds are sensitive to GSH, DMOS can generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas as a new kind of H2S gas nanoreactor. Additionally, the overloading of Ca2+ can cause tumor calcification to accelerate in vivo tumor necrosis and promote computed tomography imaging efficacy. Therefore, a novel H2S gas, EDT, and Ca2+&#8208;interference combined therapy strategy is developed.

         <title>Organic Non&#8208;Wettable Superhydrophobic Fullerite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solubility and wettability of solids signify their interaction with liquids. The findings on fullerites&#8212;the only soluble form of pure carbon&#8212;are presented. It is demonstrated that solution&#8208;cast fullerite films developed from colloidal gels generate a non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic surface. They can be used directly in a plethora of practical applications requiring ultra&#8208;hydrophobicity and underwater photochemical applications.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing quest in material science has been the development of non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic films based on a single organic material, without the requirement of fluorination or silane treatment. Here, such films and coatings, which are developed using colloidal gels of fullerite C60 and C70 nanocrystals, are described. It is illustrated that despite the high surface energy of these van der Waals molecular crystals their gelation can create films having self&#8208;affine fractal surfaces with multiscale roughness. Water droplets on resulting surfaces of fullerite films bead like a pearl resting in a Fakir state with contact angle exceeding 150&#176;. The films are extremely water repellent and non&#8208;wettable; when submerged in water they stay dry up to 3 h even at a water depth of two feet and exhibit the plastron effect. A series of experiments are presented to provide comprehensive inspection of water droplet dynamics on these films. These include rolling, bouncing, squeezing, freezing, melting, evaporating; along with acidic and alkaline tests. Non&#8208;wettable films of such materials are unique as fullerites get photosensitized instantaneously generating extremely high yields (&#8776;100%) of singlet oxygen (1O2) that can destroy viruses and bacteria; thereby enabling their use in rheology, water purification, and medicinal devices.

         <title>3D Heterogeneous Device Arrays for Multiplexed Sensing Platforms Using Transfer of Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using a removable polymer film, transfer of perovskite arrays to planar or nonplanar surfaces is realized. The total thickness of the fabricated perovskite device is thin enough to form conformal contact on various surfaces with 3D geometries. This work provides the integration of perovskites on contact lenses and pressure sensors, achieving multiplexed sensing platforms for future electronics.








Abstract
Despite recent substantial advances in perovskite materials, their 3D integration capability for next&#8208;generation electronic devices is limited owing to their inherent vulnerability to heat and moisture with degradation of their remarkable optoelectronic properties during fabrication processing. Herein, a facile method to transfer the patterns of perovskites to planar or nonplanar surfaces using a removable polymer is reported. After fabricating perovskite devices on this removable polymer film, the conformal attachment of this film on target surfaces can place the entire devices on various substrates by removing this sacrificial film. This transfer method enables the formation of a perovskite image sensor array on a soft contact lens, and in vivo tests using rabbits demonstrate its wearability. Furthermore, 3D heterogeneous integration of a perovskite photodetector array with an active&#8208;matrix array of pressure&#8208;sensitive silicon transistors using this transfer method demonstrates the formation of a multiplexed sensing platform detecting distributions of light and tactile pressure simultaneously.

         <title>Band Engineering of Dirac Semimetals Using Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge density wave (CDW) is proposed as a tool to engineer an idealized Dirac semimetal. The CDW gaps all bands at the Fermi level except the Dirac cone, which is protected by non&#8208;symmorphic symmetry. Antiferromagnetic compounds of GdSbxTe2&#8722;x&#8722;&#948; are designed and synthesized to test this proposed mechanism. Unusual transport behavior is discovered and points to a new regime.








Abstract
New developments in the field of topological matter are often driven by materials discovery, including novel topological insulators, Dirac semimetals, and Weyl semimetals. In the last few years, large efforts have been made to classify all known inorganic materials with respect to their topology. Unfortunately, a large number of topological materials suffer from non&#8208;ideal band structures. For example, topological bands are frequently convoluted with trivial ones, and band structure features of interest can appear far below the Fermi level. This leaves just a handful of materials that are intensively studied. Finding strategies to design new topological materials is a solution. Here, a new mechanism is introduced, which is based on charge density waves and non&#8208;symmorphic symmetry, to design an idealized Dirac semimetal. It is&#160;then shown experimentally that the antiferromagnetic compound GdSb0.46Te1.48 is a nearly ideal Dirac semimetal based on the proposed mechanism, meaning that most interfering bands at the Fermi level are suppressed. Its highly unusual transport behavior points to a thus far unknown regime, in which Dirac carriers with Fermi energy very close to the node seem to gradually localize in the presence of lattice and magnetic&#160;disorder.

         <title>Design and Mechanism of a Self&#8208;Powered and Disintegration&#8211;Reorganization&#8211;Regeneration Power Supply with Cold Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imitating the regeneration of the planarian, a self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperature and variable temperature (0&#8211;25 &#176;C).








Abstract
Up to now, power supplies designed based on the electrochemical reaction principle have had&#160;unavoidable defects, in that a complete redox reaction must be formed inside the power supply to operate normally, which makes it unable to be reconstructed and regenerated. Hence, the design and interpretation of this self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply are generally considered to be almost insurmountable obstacles to haunt both experimenters and theorists. Herein, a self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration power supply with relatively stable discharge for 8.3 h is realized by the principle of ion&#8208;selective diffusion, which regenerates by radical polymerization. Additionally, the mechanism is investigated systematically by molecular dynamics simulation, and this power supply with a variety of self&#8208;powered and disintegration&#8211;reorganization&#8211;regeneration units can discharge continuously at freezing temperatures and variable temperature (0&#8211;25 &#176;C). As a hypothetical model, a self&#8208;powered and deformable arch bridge with disintegration and reorganization is fabricated. In the future, this power supply is expected to be applied in prosthetic limbs, bionic skins, implantable power supplies, mobile phones, portable computers, wearable devices, etc. Moreover, with the improvement of the stability and discharge life, it could promote major revolutionary breakthroughs in the fields of intelligent industrial automation, smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, intelligent power systems, etc.

         <title>Functional Micro&#8208;/Nanomaterials for Multiplexed Biodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexed detection has gradually occupied the main development trend in the field of biodetection due to its rich information, accurate results, and high efficiency. The challenges of multiplexed detection in three aspects of coding library, detection performance, and workflow are analyzed, and the strategies are provided from the perspective of functional micro&#8208;/nanomaterials.








Abstract
When analyzing biological phenomena and processes, multiplexed biodetection has many advantages over single&#8208;factor biodetection and is highly relevant to both human health issues and advancements in the life sciences. However, many key problems with current multiplexed biodetection strategies remain unresolved. Herein, the main issues are analyzed and summarized: 1)&#160;generating sufficient signal to label targets, 2) improving the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio to ensure total detection sensitivity, and 3) simplifying the detection process to reduce the time and labor costs of multiple target detection. Then, available solutions made possible by designing and controlling the properties of micro&#8208; and nanomaterials are introduced. The aim is to emphasize the role that micro&#8208;/nanomaterials can play in the improvement of multiplexed biodetection strategies. Through analyzing existing problems, introducing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments regarding relevant materials, and discussing future directions of the field, it is hopeful to help promote necessary developments in multiplexed biodetection and associated scientific research.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Dendrimer&#8208;Based Lipid Nanoparticles Enable Precise HDR&#8208;Mediated Gene Editing In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;viral, lipid nanoparticle (dLNP) delivery platform capable of co&#8208;encapsulating and delivering Cas9 mRNA, sgRNA, and an ssDNA template is developed for homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR)&#8208;mediated gene correction of DNA mutations in vivo. Relative ratios of lipids and nucleic acids are systematically optimized to induce high HDR efficiency, thereby guiding potential treatment opportunities for correction of mutations that cause disease.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) protein gene editing is poised to transform the treatment of genetic diseases. However, limited progress has been made toward precise editing of DNA via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR) that requires careful orchestration of complex steps. Herein, dendrimer&#8208;based lipid nanoparticles (dLNPs) are engineered to co&#8208;encapsulate and deliver multiple components for in vivo HDR correction. BFP/GFP switchable HEK293 cells with a single Y66H amino acid mutation are employed to assess HDR&#8208;mediated gene editing following simultaneous, one&#8208;pot delivery of Cas9 mRNA, single&#8208;guide RNA, and donor DNA. Molar ratios of individual LNP components and weight ratios of the three nucleic acids are systematically optimized to increase HDR efficiency. Using flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and DNA sequencing to quantify editing, optimized 4A3&#8208;SC8 dLNPs edit &gt;91%&#160;of all cells with 56% HDR efficiency in vitro and &gt;20%&#160;HDR efficiency in xenograft tumors in vivo. Due to the all&#8208;in&#8208;one simplicity and high efficacy, the developed dLNPs offer a promising route toward the gene correction of disease&#8208;causing mutations.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive AIEgens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AIE luminogens are one of the optimal choices for smart luminescent materials to be applied in real life and they have sparked much of the current interest in the smart materials area. Therefore, a myriad of AIE materials with diverse stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been developed in recent years, and they exhibit broad application prospects.








Abstract
The unique advantages and the exciting application prospects of AIEgens have triggered booming developments in this area in recent years. Among them, stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens have received particular attention and impressive progress, and they have been demonstrated to show tremendous potential in many fields from physical chemistry to materials science and to biology and medicine. Here, the recent achievements of stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens in terms of seven most representative types of stimuli including force, light, polarity, temperature, electricity, ion, and pH, are summarized. Based on typical examples, it is illustrated how each type of systems realize the desired stimuli&#8208;responsive performance for various applications. The key work principles behind them are ultimately deciphered and figured out to offer new insights and guidelines for the design and engineering of the next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for more broad applications.

         <title>Customized Photothermal Therapy of Subcutaneous Orthotopic Cancer by Multichannel Luminescent Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to establish customized therapeutic prescriptions for photothermal ablation to orthotopic breast tumors. By utilizing a multichannel lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoprobe, the parameters indicating individual intratumoral differences are analyzed through fluorescence imaging for constructing a 2D diagram of model prescriptions as the reference of actual treatments.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a potentially advanced strategy for highly precise cancer treatment. Tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;activatable agents provide useful tools for PTT, but their photothermal conversion capacities vary and cannot be evaluated in vivo; thus, a general PTT prescription does not work with individual activatable agents. Here, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable nanocomposites, silicomolybdate&#8208;functionalized NaLuF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4@NaLuF4:Nd are prepared, for customized PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer. By simultaneously determining intratumoral GSH concentration and the amount of accumulated agent using multiple orthogonal luminescent emissions of nanocomposites, near&#8208;infrared absorbance of photothermal conversion agents is evaluated in vivo, based on the optimized irradiating prescriptions (irradiating power density and time) established. This allows customized PTT of each individual case with high efficacy and viability. This work also includes a method for investigating individual intratumoral variation, and the development of the next generation of customized nanomedicine for efficacious PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer.

         <title>Curvature Induced by Deflection in Thick Meta&#8208;Plates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of advanced functional devices often requires intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of non&#8208;Euclidean geometry. Here, thick meta&#8208;plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures are used to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures. A scaling relationship is presented to predict the deformation&#8208;induced curvature of thick plates and their micro&#8208;architectural design variables.








Abstract
The design of advanced functional devices often requires the use of intrinsically curved geometries that belong to the realm of non&#8208;Euclidean geometry and remain a challenge for traditional engineering approaches. Here, it is shown how the simple deflection of thick meta&#8208;plates based on hexagonal cellular mesostructures can be used to achieve a wide range of intrinsic (i.e., Gaussian) curvatures, including dome&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like shapes. Depending on the unit cell structure, non&#8208;auxetic (i.e., positive Poisson ratio) or auxetic (i.e., negative Poisson ratio) plates can be obtained, leading to a negative or positive value of the Gaussian curvature upon bending, respectively. It is found that bending such meta&#8208;plates along their longitudinal direction induces a curvature along their transverse direction. Experimentally and numerically, it is shown how the amplitude of this induced curvature is related to the longitudinal bending and the geometry of the meta&#8208;plate. The approach proposed here constitutes a general route for the rational design of advanced functional devices with intrinsically curved geometries. To demonstrate the merits of this approach, a scaling relationship is presented, and its validity is demonstrated by applying it to 3D&#8208;printed microscale meta&#8208;plates. Several applications for adaptive optical devices with adjustable focal length and soft wearable robotics are presented.

         <title>Cell/Bacteria&#8208;Based Bioactive Materials for Cancer Immune Modulation and Precision Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell/bacteria&#8208;based bioactive materials are summarized in terms of their structural components, engineered strategies, bioproperties, and functions. An overview of the biomedical applications of bioactive materials in tumor targeting delivery, immune modulation, and precise therapy is given, along with a series of successful case studies on tiny robots derived from cell/bacteria materials.








Abstract
Numerous clinical trials for cancer precision medicine research are limited due to the drug resistance, side effects, and low efficacy. Unsatisfactory outcomes are often caused by complex physiologic barriers and abnormal immune events in tumors, such as tumor target alterations and immunosuppression. Cell/bacteria&#8208;derived materials with unique bioactive properties have emerged as attractive tools for personalized therapy in cancer. Naturally derived bioactive materials, such as cell and bacterial therapeutic agents with native tropism or good biocompatibility, can precisely target tumors and effectively modulate immune microenvironments to inhibit tumors. Here, the recent advances in the development of cell/bacteria&#8208;based bioactive materials for immune modulation and&#160;precision therapy in cancer are summarized. Cell/bacterial constituents, including cell membranes, bacterial vesicles, and other active substances have inherited their unique targeting properties and antitumor capabilities. Strategies for engineering living cell/bacteria to overcome complex biological barriers and immunosuppression to promote antitumor efficacy are also summarized. Moreover, past and ongoing trials involving personalized bioactive materials and promising agents such as cell/bacteria&#8208;based micro/nano&#8208;biorobotics are further discussed, which may become another powerful tool for treatment in the near future.

Major challenges and future perspectives with respect to the synthesis and bioapplications of NIR Ag2S QDs are discussed.








Abstract
Quantum dots (QDs) with near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR) are an emerging class of QDs with unique capabilities owing to the deeper tissue penetrability of NIR light compared with visible light. NIR light also effectively overcomes organism autofluorescence, making NIR QDs particularly attractive in biological imaging applications for disease diagnosis. Considering latest developments, Ag2S QDs are a rising star among NIR QDs due to their excellent NIR fluorescence properties and biocompatibility. This review presents the various methods to synthesize NIR Ag2S QDs, and systematically discusses their applications in biosensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. Major challenges and future perspectives concerning the synthesis and bioapplications of NIR Ag2S QDs are discussed.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Water&#8208;Splitting Using CuO&#8208;Based Electrodes for Hydrogen Production: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoelectrochemical water&#8208;splitting method using CuO&#8208;based materials as high&#8208;efficiency photoelectrodes has potential to solve the global energy and environmental problems simultaneously. The usage of appropriate synthesis methods, modifying the CuO crystal structure and creating suitable conditions to increase the specific surface area can dramatically separate the electron&#8211;hole pairs and improve the photocurrent density of photoelectrodes.








Abstract
The cost&#8208;effective, robust, and efficient electrocatalysts for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water&#8208;splitting has been extensively studied over the past decade to address a solution for the energy crisis. The interesting physicochemical properties of CuO have introduced this promising photocathodic material among the few photocatalysts with a narrow bandgap. This photocatalyst has a high activity for the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under simulated sunlight irradiation. Here, the recent advancements of CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes, including undoped CuO, doped CuO, and CuO composites, in the PEC water&#8208;splitting field, are comprehensively studied. Moreover, the synthesis methods, characterization, and fundamental factors of each classification are discussed in detail. Apart from the exclusive characteristics of CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes, the PEC properties of CuO/2D materials, as groups of the growing nanocomposites in photocurrent&#8208;generating devices, are discussed in separate sections. Regarding the particular attention paid to the CuO heterostructure photocathodes, the PEC water splitting application is reviewed and the properties of each group such as electronic structures, defects, bandgap, and hierarchical structures are critically assessed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based photocatalytic valorization of lignocellulose are reviewed. Structures, roles, and functioning mechanisms of metal sulfides in biomass conversions are carefully analyzed. The unique properties of metal sulfides in catalyzing C&#63743;O&#8208;bond cleavage, selective oxidation, C&#63743;C coupling, and C&#63743;H activation under light irradiation are highlighted and discussed to inspire future breakthroughs.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfides are an extraordinarily vital class of semiconductors with a wide range of applications in the photocatalytic field. A great number of recent advances in photocatalytic transformations of lignocellulosic biomass, the largest renewable carbon resource, into high&#8208;quality fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals has been achieved over metal sulfide semiconductors. Herein, the progress and breakthroughs in metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based photocatalytic systems for lignocellulose valorization with an emphasis on selective depolymerization of lignin and oxidative coupling of some important bioplatforms are highligted. The key issues that control reaction pathways and mechanisms are carefully examined. The functions of metal sulfides in the elementary reactions, including C&#63743;O&#8208;bond cleavage, selective oxidations, C&#63743;C coupling, and C&#63743;H activation, are discussed to offer insights to guide the rational design of active and selective photocatalysts for sustainable chemistry. The prospects of sulfide photocatalysts in biomass valorization are also analyzed and briefly discussed.

         <title>Electroactive Biomaterials and Systems for Cell Fate Determination and Tissue Regeneration: Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity, as well as recent progress in the study of electroactive biomaterials and systems, and their mediated electrostimulation in tissue regeneration.








Abstract
During natural tissue regeneration, tissue microenvironment and stem cell niche including cell&#8211;cell interaction, soluble factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) provide a train of biochemical and biophysical cues for modulation of cell behaviors and tissue functions. Design of functional biomaterials to mimic the tissue/cell microenvironment have great potentials for tissue regeneration applications. Recently, electroactive biomaterials have drawn increasing attentions not only as scaffolds for cell adhesion and structural support, but also as modulators to regulate cell/tissue behaviors and function, especially for electrically excitable cells and tissues. More importantly, electrostimulation can further modulate a myriad of biological processes, from cell cycle, migration, proliferation and differentiation to neural conduction, muscle contraction, embryogenesis, and tissue regeneration. In this review, endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity are introduced. Then, design rationale of electroactive biomaterials is discussed for imitating dynamic cell microenvironment, as well as their mediated electrostimulation and the applying pathways. Recent advances in electroactive biomaterials are systematically overviewed for modulation of stem cell fate and tissue regeneration, mainly including nerve regeneration, bone tissue engineering, and cardiac tissue engineering. Finally, the significance for simulating the native tissue microenvironment is emphasized and the open challenges and future perspectives of electroactive biomaterials are concluded.

         <title>In Situ Tumor Vaccination with Nanoparticle Co&#8208;Delivering CpG and STAT3 siRNA to Effectively Induce Whole&#8208;Body Antitumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors (AIRISE&#8208;02) is a nano&#8208;immunotherapeutic candidate that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA to a local tumor, generating anti&#8208;tumor immune response against cancer everywhere in the body (both treated and untreated tumors). Combination of AIRISE&#8208;02 and standard immune checkpoint inhibitors cures 63% of mice with melanoma tumors, while the inhibitors alone cure none.








Abstract
The success of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a subset of individuals has been very exciting. However, in many cancers, responses to current ICIs are modest and are seen only in a small subsets of patients. Herein, a widely applicable approach that increases the benefit of ICIs is reported. Intratumoral administration of augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors&#8212;AIRISE&#8208;02 nanotherapeutic that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA&#8212;results in not only regression of the injected tumor, but also tumors at distant sites in multiple tumor model systems. In particular, three doses of AIRISE&#8208;02 in combination with systemic ICIs completely cure both treated and untreated aggressive melanoma tumors in 63% of mice, while ICIs alone do not cure any mice. A long&#8208;term memory immune effect is also reported. AIRISE&#8208;02 is effective in breast and colon tumor models as well. Lastly, AIRISE&#8208;02 is well tolerated in mice and nonhuman primates. This approach combines multiple therapeutic agents into a single nanoconstruct to create whole&#8208;body immune responses across multiple cancer types. Being a local therapeutic, AIRISE&#8208;02 circumvents regulatory challenges of systemic nanoparticle delivery, facilitating rapid translation to the clinic. AIRISE&#8208;02 is under investigational new drug (IND)&#8208;enabling studies, and clinical trials will soon follow.

Hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of clean hydrogen fuel. The production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is an essential prerequisite of the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emission. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water splitting has been commercialized for more than 100 years, representing the most mature and economic technology. Here, the historic development of water electrolysis is overviewed, and several critical electrochemical parameters are discussed. After that, advanced nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that emerged recently for negotiating the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are discussed, including transition metal oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides for the OER, as well as transition metal alloys, chalcogenides, phosphides, and carbides for the HER. In this section, particular attention is paid to the catalyst synthesis, activity and stability challenges, performance improvement, and industry&#8208;relevant developments. Some recent works about scaled&#8208;up catalyst synthesis, novel electrode designs, and alkaline seawater electrolysis are also spotlighted. Finally, an outlook on future challenges and opportunities for alkaline water splitting is offered, and potential future directions are speculated.

         <title>Phase Coexistence and Structural Dynamics of Redox Metal Catalysts Revealed by Operando TEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical dynamics (characterized by phase co&#8208;existence and oscillatory phase transition) of redox metal catalysts and their relevance to catalytic activity are revealed by operando transmission electron microscopy. This work underlines the importance of chemical dynamics and provides a convenient mechanism for the formation and constant regeneration of transient active sites during catalysis.








Abstract
Metal catalysts play an important role in industrial redox reactions. Although extensively studied, the state of these catalysts under operating conditions is largely unknown, and assignments of active sites remain speculative. Herein, an operando transmission electron microscopy study is presented, which interrelates the structural dynamics of redox metal catalysts to their activity. Using hydrogen oxidation on copper as an elementary redox reaction, it is revealed how the interaction between metal and the surrounding gas phase induces complex structural transformations and drives the system from a thermodynamic equilibrium toward a state controlled by the chemical dynamics. Direct imaging combined with the simultaneous detection of catalytic activity provides unparalleled structure&#8211;activity insights that identify distinct mechanisms for water formation and reveal the means by which the system self&#8208;adjusts to changes of the gas&#8208;phase chemical potential. Density functional theory calculations show that surface phase transitions are driven by chemical dynamics even when the system is far from a thermodynamic phase boundary. In a bottom&#8208;up approach, the dynamic behavior observed here for an elementary reaction is finally extended to more relevant redox reactions and other metal catalysts, which underlines the importance of chemical dynamics for the formation and constant re&#8208;generation of transient active sites during catalysis.

         <title>Nanographene&#8211;Osmapentalyne Complexes as a Cathode Interlayer in Organic Solar Cells Enhance Efficiency over 18%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Newly synthesized hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8211;osmapentalyne complexes that combine fragments of graphene and metalla&#8208;aromatics are emerging as cathode interlayer materials. Further extending the d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated systems of osmapentalynes, the most successful complex, in this work, HBC&#8208;S is found to boost the efficiency of non&#8208;fullerene solar cells to over 18%.








Abstract
Interface engineering is a critical method by which to efficiently enhance the photovoltaic performance of nonfullerene solar cells (NFSC). Herein, a series of metal&#8211;nanographene&#8208;containing large transition metal involving d&#960;&#8211;p&#960; conjugated systems by way of the addition reactions of osmapentalynes and p&#8208;diethynyl&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes is reported. Conjugated extensions are engineered to optimize the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of these metal&#8211;nanographene molecules, which serve as alcohol&#8208;soluble cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. Upon extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based NFSCs increases from 16% to over 18%, giving the highest recorded PCE. It is deduced by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, interfacial contact methods, morphology characterization, and carrier dynamics that modification of hexabenzocoronenes&#8208;styryl can effectively improve the short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to the strong and ordered charge transfer, more matching energy level alignments, better interfacial contacts between the active layer and the electrodes, and regulated morphology. Consequently, the carrier transport is largely facilitated, and the carrier recombination is simultaneously impeded. These new CIL materials are broadly able to enhance the photovoltaic properties of OSCs in other systems, which provides a promising potential to serve as CILs for higher&#8208;quality OSCs.

         <title>Poly(ionic liquid)s Containing Alkoxy Chains and Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide Anions as Highly Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel, non&#8208;catechol, and efficient poly(ionic liquid)s adhesives are obtained by appending alkoxy chains onto the cationic backbone. These poly(ionic liquid)s exhibit tough and long&#8208;term adhesion toward various substrates and can be further designed as photosensitive or electronically conductive materials when combined with carbon nanotubes or silver nanofibers. Particularly, the adhesive strength can be improved by 35% when applying an electric field.








Abstract
Adhesive materials have wide applications in diverse fields, but the development of a novel and multipurpose adhesive is a great challenge. This study demonstrates that conventional poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) can be designed as highly efficient adhesives by simply introducing alkoxy moieties into the cationic backbone of PILs containing bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (TFSI&#8722;) anions. The incorporated flexible alkoxy chain not only reduces the glass transition temperature of PILs but also endows these materials with strong hydrogen bonding interactions, which, together with the unique electrostatic interaction of the PILs, simultaneously contributes to a high cohesive energy and interfacial adhesive energy. Consequently, these alkoxy PILs are highly adhesive on various substrates such as glass, ceramic, stainless steel, aluminum, and polymers, in contrast to the nonadhesive behavior of conventional PILs. Photosensitive or electronically conductive composite adhesives are fabricated by virtue of the compatibility between ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes or silver nanofibers. Interestingly, the PIL&#8208;2&#8208;TFSI adhesive possesses a unique and reversible response to electric fields and achieves up to 35% improvement in adhesive strength.

         <title>Infrared&#8208;Emitting Multimodal Nanostructures for Controlled In Vivo Magnetic Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron oxide and silver sulfide nanoparticles are combined in optomagnetic nanocapsules, which can act as multimodal contrast agents for several imaging modalities (fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, optical tomography, and photoacoustic imaging). More importantly, these nanocapsules enable real&#8208;time subcutaneous thermal monitoring of magnetic hyperthermia processes, paving the way to fully controlled magnetic therapies.








Abstract
Deliberate and local increase of the temperature within solid tumors represents an effective therapeutic approach. Thermal therapies embrace this concept leveraging the capability of some species to convert the absorbed energy into heat. To that end, magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) uses magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) that can effectively dissipate the energy absorbed under alternating magnetic fields. However, MNPs fail to provide real&#8208;time thermal feedback with the risk of unwanted overheating and impeding on&#8208;the&#8208;fly adjustment of the therapeutic parameters. Localization of MNPs within a tissue in an accurate, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective way represents another challenge for increasing the efficacy of MHT. In this work, MNPs are combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art infrared luminescent nanothermometers (LNTh; Ag2S nanoparticles) in a nanocapsule that simultaneously overcomes these limitations. The novel optomagnetic nanocapsule acts as multimodal contrast agents for different imaging techniques (magnetic resonance, photoacoustic and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, optical and X&#8208;ray computed tomography). Most crucially, these nanocapsules provide accurate (0.2&#160;&#176;C resolution) and real&#8208;time subcutaneous thermal feedback during in vivo MHT, also enabling the attainment of thermal maps of the area of interest. These findings are a milestone on the road toward controlled magnetothermal therapies with minimal side effects.

         <title>3D Anisotropic Au@Pt&#8211;Pd Hemispherical Nanostructures as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Methanol, Ethanol, and Formic Acid Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic 3D nanocatalyst with both morphological and elemental anisotropy shows excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability due to its special uneven distribution and asymmetric nanostructure characteristics. The 3D anisotropic hemispherical nanostructures prepared in this work exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability, which provides an inspiration for the creative synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts with 3D anisotropic nanostructures.








Abstract
Anisotropic 3D nanostructures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability due to their heterogeneous elemental distribution and unsymmetrical configuration. However, it is still a huge challenge to combine anisotropically distributed elements and anisotropic morphologies within one 3D nanostructure. Herein, 3D Au@Pt&#8211;Pd hemispherical nanostructures (Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss) are fabricated as highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxidation reaction, which present heterogenous element distribution and anisotropic morphology. It is demonstrated that the non&#8208;uniform adsorption of BO2&#8722; on Au&#8208;CTA+ surface, as well as the simulated lower formation energy of Pt&#8211;Pd atoms for Au&#8208;CTA+&#8208;BO2&#8208;, basically contribute to the eventual formation of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss. Impressively, the unique anisotropic Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol, ethanol, and formic acid oxidation reaction compared with commercial Pt/C and previously reported noble&#8208;metal based electrocatalysts. Especially, the mass activity of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd H&#8208;Ss for MOR is 4.38 A mgPt+Pd&#8208;1, which is about 2.0 and 4.7 times that of Au@Pt&#8211;Pd spherical nanostructures (Au@Pt&#8211;Pd Ss) and commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. This work provides an important reference for the design and preparation of 3D anisotropic and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Field Effect on Excitonic Photoluminescence in Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature intrinsic magnetic field effect is realized in perovskite nanocrystals. The circular polarization of exciton photoluminescence in CsPbCl3 is enhanced by sp&#8211;d interactions with Mn doping, and is further stabilized by exciton orbital ordering with partial Br substitution, which induces 4.6% circular polarization ratio at room temperature in a 35 T magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced spin&#8208;polarized electronic/optical properties in semiconductors are crucial for fabricating various spintronic devices. However, this spin polarization is governed by weak spin exchange interactions and easily randomized by thermal fluctuations; therefore, it is only produced at cryogenic temperatures, which severely limits the applications. Herein, a room&#8208;temperature intrinsic magnetic field effect (MFE) on excitonic photoluminescence is achieved in CsPbX3:Mn (X = Cl, Br) perovskite nanocrystals. Through moderate Mn doping, the MFE is enhanced by exciton&#8211;Mn interactions, and through partial Br substitution, the MFE is stabilized at room temperature by exciton orbital ordering. The orbital ordering significantly enhances the g&#8208;factor difference between electrons and holes, which is evidenced by a parallel orbit&#8211;orbit interaction among excitons generated by circular polarized laser excitation. This study provides a clear avenue for engineering spintronic materials based on orbital interactions in perovskites.

         <title>Anisotropically Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels are fabricated through synergistically engineering the preferentially aligned microstructures and nanocrystalline domains, enabling application as load&#8208;bearing components in underwater robots.








Abstract
Nature builds biological materials from limited ingredients, however, with unparalleled mechanical performances compared to artificial materials, by harnessing inherent structures across multi&#8208;length&#8208;scales. In contrast, synthetic material design overwhelmingly focuses on developing new compounds, and fails to reproduce the mechanical properties of natural counterparts, such as fatigue resistance. Here, a simple yet general strategy to engineer conventional hydrogels with a more than 100&#8208;fold increase in fatigue thresholds is reported. This strategy is proven to be universally applicable to various species of hydrogel materials, including polysaccharides (i.e., alginate, cellulose), proteins (i.e., gelatin), synthetic polymers (i.e., poly(vinyl alcohol)s), as well as corresponding polymer composites. These fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels exhibit a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold over most synthetic soft materials, making them low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and durable alternatives to soft materials used in those circumstances including robotics, artificial muscles,&#160;etc.

         <title>Direct Integration of Strained&#8208;Pt Catalysts into Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells with Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designer electrocatalysts can be deposited via atomic layer deposition onto support structures for performance evaluation under various platforms. In this example, strained platinum catalysts are formed by dissolving cobalt oxide from the Pt/CoOx core&#8211;shell structure. Performance enhancement seen on the rotating disk electrode is validated in the membrane electrode assembly.








Abstract
The design and fabrication of lattice&#8208;strained platinum catalysts achieved by removing a soluble core from a platinum shell synthesized via atomic layer deposition, is reported. The remarkable catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), measured in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations, is attributed to the observed lattice strain. By further optimizing the nanoparticle geometry and ionomer/carbon interactions, mass activity close to 0.8&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 @0.9&#160;V iR&#8208;free is achievable in the membrane electrode assembly. Nevertheless, active catalysts with high ORR activity do not necessarily lead to high performance in the high&#8208;current&#8208;density (HCD) region. More attention shall be directed toward HCD performance for enabling high&#8208;power&#8208;density hydrogen fuel cells.

         <title>Sphingosine 1&#8208;Phosphate Liposomes for Targeted Nitric Oxide Delivery to Mediate Anticancer Effects against Brain Glioma Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phospholipid&#8208;signaling sphingolipid hybrid and glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GST)&#8208;responsive liposome is successfully developed, which is able to specifically and safely deliver the therapeutic prodrug JS&#8208;K into glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. Nitric oxide (NO) production in the tumor microenvironment is quantified by ultrasound imaging visualization. This study validates S1P liposomes as an effective drug delivery system for carcinomas.








Abstract
Specifically targeting glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) blood vessels and actively enhancing the permeability of the brain&#8211;blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BBTB) are two extremely difficult challenges currently hindering the development of effective therapies against GBM. Herein, a liposome drug delivery system (S1P/JS&#8208;K/Lipo) is described, which delivers the nitric oxide (NO) prodrug JS&#8208;K, O2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dinitrophenyl) 1&#8208;[(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonyl) piperazin&#8208;1&#8208;yl] diazen&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1,2&#8208;diolate, to GBM tumors using sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (S1P)&#8208;signaling molecules as active targeting lipid ligands. It is revealed that S1P/JS&#8208;K/Lipo actively penetrates the BBTB, aided by caveolin&#8208;1&#8208;mediated transcytosis, and it is demonstrated that the system specifically interacts with S1P receptors (S1PRs), which are highly expressed on GBM cells. Nondestructive ultrasound imaging in GBM mouse models is also utilized to observe microsized NO bubble production from JS&#8208;K, as catalyzed by the glutathione S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) resident in GBM cells. Given that these NO bubbles strongly promote GBM cell death in vivo, the S1PR&#8208;targeted liposome delivery system&#8212;which successfully achieves BBTB penetration and tumor targeted delivery of a complex multicomponent drug regimen&#8212;represents a promising approach for targeted therapies against GBM and other carcinomas characterized by elevated S1PR expression.

Given that these NO bubbles strongly promote GBM cell death in vivo, the S1PR-targeted liposome delivery system&#8212;which successfully achieves BBTB penetration and tumor targeted delivery of a complex multicomponent drug regimen&#8212;represents a promising approach for targeted therapies against GBM and other carcinomas characterized by elevated S1PR expression.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Quantum Memories Based on Molecular Electron Spin Ensembles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ensembles of weakly exchange coupled organic radicals form strongly coupled systems with 3D microwave resonators. Time&#8208;domain pulsed microwave investigations reveal long, largely temperature&#8208;independent quantum coherence times. The room&#8208;temperature storage and retrieval of microwave pulses is demonstrated.








Abstract
Whilst quantum computing has recently taken great leaps ahead, the development of quantum memories has decidedly lagged behind. Quantum memories are essential devices in the quantum technology palette and are needed for intermediate storage of quantum bit states and as quantum repeaters in long&#8208;distance quantum communication. Current quantum memories operate at cryogenic, mostly sub&#8208;Kelvin temperatures and require extensive and costly peripheral hardware. It is demonstrated that ensembles of weakly coupled molecular spins show long coherence times and can be used to store microwave pulses of arbitrary phase. These studies exploit strong coupling of the spin ensemble to special 3D microwave resonators. Most importantly, these systems operate at room temperature.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Induced Cell Membrane Disruptions Enable Direct Cytosolic Delivery of Membrane&#8208;Impermeable Cargo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked cationic dextran nanogels are identified as unique polycationic nanomaterials capable of mediating direct cytosolic delivery of membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo. The efficient delivery of various macromolecules in HeLa cells and primary cells is demonstrated. Moreover, this approach outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electroporation for the delivery of neutral macromolecules and the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery of membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo offers unique opportunities for biological research and the development of cell&#8208;based therapies. Despite the breadth of available intracellular delivery tools, existing protocols are often suboptimal and alternative approaches that merge delivery efficiency with both biocompatibility, as well as applicability, remain highly sought after. Here, a comprehensive platform is presented that exploits the unique property of cationic hydrogel nanoparticles to transiently disrupt the plasma membrane of cells, allowing direct cytosolic delivery of uncomplexed membrane&#8208;impermeable cargo. Using this platform, which is termed Hydrogel&#8208;enabled nanoPoration or HyPore, the delivery of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)&#8211;dextran macromolecules in various cancer cell lines and primary bovine corneal epithelial cells is convincingly demonstrated. Of note, HyPore demonstrates efficient FITC&#8208;dextran delivery in primary human T cells, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electroporation&#8208;mediated delivery. Moreover, the HyPore platform enables cytosolic delivery of functional proteins, including a histone&#8208;binding nanobody as well as the enzymes granzyme A and Cre&#8208;recombinase. Finally, HyPore&#8208;mediated delivery of the MRI contrast agent gadobutrol in primary human T cells significantly improves their T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal intensities compared to electroporation. Taken together, HyPore is proposed as a straightforward, highly versatile, and cost&#8208;effective technique for high&#8208;throughput, ex vivo manipulation of primary cells and cell lines.

         <title>In Situ TEM Imaging of Solution&#8208;Phase Chemical Reactions Using 2D&#8208;Heterostructure Mixing Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D&#8208;heterostructure mixing cell allows sub&#8208;nanometer resolution characterization of calcium carbonate precipitation via nonclassical nucleation using scanning transmission electron microscopy. A trigger&#8208;based mixing mechanism using controlled damage to the MoS2 membrane enables visualization of the entire reaction timeline with high spatial resolution, including liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation, formation of amorphous calcium carbonate, and crystallization.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy is used to study a wide range of chemical processes, where its unique combination of spatial and temporal resolution provides countless insights into nanoscale reaction dynamics. However, achieving sub&#8208;nanometer resolution has proved difficult due to limitations in the current liquid cell designs. Here, a novel experimental platform for in situ mixing using a specially developed 2D heterostructure&#8208;based liquid cell is presented. The technique facilitates in situ atomic resolution imaging and elemental analysis, with mixing achieved within the immediate viewing area via controllable nanofracture of an atomically thin separation membrane. This novel technique is used to investigate the time evolution of calcium carbonate synthesis, from the earliest stages of nanodroplet precursors to crystalline calcite in a single experiment. The observations provide the first direct visual confirmation of the recently developed liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation theory, while the technological advancements open an avenue for many other studies of early stage solution&#8208;phase reactions of great interest for both the exploration of fundamental science and developing applications.

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from an Exciplex&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an ordinal exciplex&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), injected holes and electrons immediately recombine to emit light. Meanwhile, an organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent (OLPL) system can store holes and electrons for a long time and exhibit luminescence by recombination. By optimizing the light&#8208;emitting layer of the exciplex&#8208;based OLED, OLPL from an OLED is achieved.








Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent systems (OLPLs) exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission after photoexcitation consist of organic electron donors and acceptors, that are widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although OLPLs and OLEDs include very similar excitonic processes, long&#8208;lasting emission has never been observed in OLEDs. This study confirms the presence of long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) under electrical excitation.

         <title>Heterochromatic Nonlinear Optical Responses in Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;Resolution Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse photoresponses from different energy levels in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles are proposed to simultaneously generate multiple point spread functions for improving the super&#8208;resolution imaging quality. The method requires only one doughnut&#8208;shaped scanning excitation beam that extends the capabilities of the engineered point spread functions to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information for optimizing the averaged resolution.








Abstract
Point spread function (PSF) engineering by an emitter's response can code higher&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency information of an image for microscopy to achieve super&#8208;resolution. However, complexed excitation optics or repetitive scans are needed, which explains the issues of low speed, poor stability, and operational complexity associated with the current laser scanning microscopy approaches. Here, the diverse emission responses of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are reported for super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy to improve the imaging quality and speed. The method only needs a doughnut&#8208;shaped scanning excitation beam at an appropriate power density. By collecting the four&#8208;photon emission of single UCNPs, the high&#8208;frequency information of a super&#8208;resolution image can be resolved through the doughnut&#8208;emission PSF. Meanwhile, the two&#8208;photon state of the same nanoparticle is oversaturated, so that the complementary lower&#8208;frequency information of the super&#8208;resolution image can be simultaneously collected by the Gaussian&#8208;like emission PSF. This leads to a method of Fourier&#8208;domain heterochromatic fusion, which allows the extended capability of the engineered PSFs to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information to yield optimized image quality. This approach achieves a spatial resolution of 40&#160;nm, 1/24th of the excitation wavelength. This work suggests a new scope for developing nonlinear multi&#8208;color emitting probes in super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy.

         <title>Design of Chemically Stable Organic Perovskite Quantum Dots for Micropatterned Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Kinetic Control of a Cross&#8208;Linkable Ligand System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast degradation of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) prevents the development of multicolor patterning technologies using these materials. Therefore, novel ligand systems for microsized EL device fabrication, which protect perovskite QDs from degradation through the binding kinetic control of surface ligands, are developed. The present system remains stable in various chemical environments, without critical deterioration of optical and electrical properties.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are ideal for next&#8208;generation display applications because of their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. However, developing a technology for high&#8208;resolution multicolor patterning of perovskite QDs remains challenging, owing to the chemical instability of these materials. To overcome these issues, in this work, the generation of surface defects is prevented by controlling the ligand&#8208;binding kinetics using a stable ligand system (Stable LS). The crystalline reconstruction of perovskite QDs after addition of the Stable LS results in an &#8776;18% increase in their photoluminescence quantum yield in solution and it also improves the ambient stability of the perovskite QD solution. Moreover, the perovskite QDs with Stable LS can undergo cross&#8208;linking under UV irradiation. The tightly bridged perovskite QDs effectively prevent moisture&#8208;assisted ligand dissociation in film state due to the increased hydrophobicity and restricted movement of the cross&#8208;linked surface ligands. Thus, the cross&#8208;linked perovskite QD film shows improved chemical/environmental stability without substantial deterioration in optoelectrical properties. As a result, a white electroluminescent device with high resolution (&#8776;1 &#956;m) is successfully fabricated by inkjet printing using green and red perovskite QDs.

         <title>Simultaneously Toughening and Stiffening Elastomers with Octuple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired multifunctional elastomer with both high fracture toughness and high Young's modulus is designed, breaking through the current trade&#8208;off present in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The octuple hydrogen bonding promotes the formation of ultrastrong nanodomains, which, together with a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase, form a bicontinuous network structure. Such hierarchical networks with ultrastrong nanodomains enhance the mechanical properties.








Abstract
Current synthetic elastomers suffer from the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. By a combination of multiscale experiments and atomistic simulations, a transparent unfilled elastomer with simultaneously enhanced toughness and stiffness is demonstrated. The designed elastomer comprises homogeneous networks with ultrastrong, reversible, and sacrificial octuple hydrogen bonding (HB), which evenly distribute the stress to each polymer chain during loading, thus enhancing stretchability and delaying fracture. Strong HBs and corresponding nanodomains enhance the stiffness by restricting the network mobility, and at the same time improve the toughness by dissipating energy during the transformation between different configurations. In addition, the stiffness mismatch between the hard HB domain and the soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase promotes crack deflection and branching, which can further dissipate energy and alleviate local stress. These cooperative mechanisms endow the elastomer with both high fracture toughness (17016 J m&#8722;2) and high Young's modulus (14.7&#160;MPa), circumventing the trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. This work is expected to impact many fields of engineering requiring elastomers with unprecedented mechanical performance.

         <title>Microchannel and Nanofiber Array Morphology Enhanced Rapid Superspreading on Animals&#8217; Corneas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The respective roles of nanoscale and microscale structures in the rapid superspreading effect are explicitly clarified: the superspreading is induced by in&#8208;/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process.








Abstract
The dynamic spreading phenomenon of liquids is vital for both understanding wetting mechanisms and visual reaction time&#8208;related applications. However, how to control and accelerate the spreading process is still an enormous challenge. Here, a unique microchannel and nanofiber array morphology enhanced rapid superspreading (RSS) effect on animals&#8217; corneas with a superspreading time (ST) of 830 ms is found, and the respective roles of the nanofiber array and the microchannel in the RSS effect are explicitly demonstrated. Specifically, the superspreading is induced by in&#8208;/out&#8208;of&#8208;plane nanocapillary forces among the nanofiber array; the microchannel is responsible for tremendously speeding up the superspreading process. Inspired by the RSS strategy, not only is an RSS surface fabricated with an ST of only 450 ms, which is, respectively, more than 26 and 1.8 times faster than conventional superamphiphilic surfaces and animal's corneas and can be applied as RSS surfaces on video monitors to record clear videos, but also it is demonstrated that the RSS effect has tremendous potential as advanced ophthalmic material surfaces to enhance its biocompatibility for clear vision.

         <title>Amorphous Domains in Black Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the diffusion of oxygen vacancies from the surface to inside, the regional dual structure with anisotropic oxygen vacancies at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 is obtained by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared sample exhibits superior catalytic activity, which can immediately degrade rhodamine B solution to colorless with a shake.








Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) play a critical role for many applications of metal oxides, a controllable synthetic strategy for anisotropic Ovs remains a great challenge. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to achieve the regional dual structure with anisotropic Ovs at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared black TiO2 with amorphous domains exhibits superior activity in degrading rhodamine B (RhB) solutions, which can instantly decompose RhB with just a shake. First&#8208;principle simulations reveal that subsurface Ovs in TiO2 are energetically favored, resulting in the formation of amorphous domains in the interior region via diffusion of surface&#8208;formed Ovs into the subsurface. The stable Ov&#8208;induced amorphous domains in TiO2 with enhanced catalytic performances provide a scalable strategy to practical Ov engineering in functional metal oxides.

         <title>General Synthesis of Ultrafine Monodispersed Hybrid Nanoparticles from Highly Stable Monomicelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with great uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable shell thickness is successfully synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. This monomicelle with a solidified polystyrene core has ultrahigh thermodynamic stability. Combined with a unique core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure, this monomicelle is a very general template to synthesize various ultrasmall, monodispersed hybrid nanoparticles with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
Ultrafine nanoparticles with organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization have essential roles in myriad applications. Over the past three decades, although various efforts on the formation of organic or inorganic ultrasmall nanoparticles have been made, ultrafine organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles have scarcely been achieved. Herein, a family of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a monodisperse, uniform size is synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. These thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated monomicelles with amphiphilic ABC triblock copolymers are structurally robust due to their solidified polystyrene core, endowing them with ultrahigh thermodynamic stability, which is difficult to achieve using Pluronic surfactant&#8208;based micelles (e.g., F127). This great stability combined with a core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure makes the monodispersed monomicelles a robust template for the precise synthesis of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a highly uniform size. As a demonstration, the obtained micelles/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles display ultrafine sizes, excellent uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable structural parameters (diameters: 24&#8211;47 nm and thin shell thickness: 2.0&#8211;4.0 nm).

     alt="General Synthesis of Ultrafine Monodispersed Hybrid Nanoparticles from Highly Stable Monomicelles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A library of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with great uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable shell thickness is successfully synthesized by a facile thermo-kinetics-mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. This monomicelle with a solidified polystyrene core has ultrahigh thermodynamic stability. Combined with a unique core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure, this monomicelle is a very general template to synthesize various ultrasmall, monodispersed hybrid nanoparticles with excellent uniformity.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafine nanoparticles with organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization have essential roles in myriad applications. Over the past three decades, although various efforts on the formation of organic or inorganic ultrasmall nanoparticles have been made, ultrafine organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles have scarcely been achieved. Herein, a family of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a monodisperse, uniform size is synthesized by a facile thermo-kinetics-mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. These thermo-kinetics-mediated monomicelles with amphiphilic ABC triblock copolymers are structurally robust due to their solidified polystyrene core, endowing them with ultrahigh thermodynamic stability, which is difficult to achieve using Pluronic surfactant-based micelles (e.g., F127). This great stability combined with a core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure makes the monodispersed monomicelles a robust template for the precise synthesis of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a highly uniform size. As a demonstration, the obtained micelles/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid nanoparticles display ultrafine sizes, excellent uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable structural parameters (diameters: 24&#8211;47 nm and thin shell thickness: 2.0&#8211;4.0 nm). Notably, this approach is universal for creating a variety of multifunctional ultrasmall hybrid nanostructures, involving organic/organic micelle/polymers (polydopamine) nanoparticles, organic/inorganic micelle/metal oxides (ZnO, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), micelle/hydroxides (Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), micelle/noble metals (Ag), and micelle/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid composites. As a proof of concept, the ultrasmall micelle/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid nanoparticles demonstrate superior toughness as biomimetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered In Situ Gelation of Hydrogels using 2D Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2) Nanoassemblies as Crosslink Epicenter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels using 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies is demonstrated. The in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels has strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including phototherapy, 3D printing, and therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive biomaterials are an emerging class of materials used for developing noninvasive, noncontact, precise, and controllable biomedical devices. Long&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation is an attractive light source for in situ gelation due to its higher penetration depth and minimum side effects. The conventional approach to obtain crosslinked biomaterials relies heavily on the use of a photoinitiator by generating reactive species when exposed to short&#8208;wavelength radiation, which is detrimental to surrounding cells and tissue. Here, a new class of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation system based on defect&#8208;rich 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies and thiol&#8208;functionalized thermoresponsive polymer in the absence of a photoinitiator is introduced. Exposure to NIR radiation activates the dynamic polymer&#8211;nanomaterials interactions by leveraging the photothermal characteristics of MoS2 and intrinsic phase transition ability of the thermoresponsive polymer. Specifically, upon NIR exposure, MoS2 acts as a crosslink epicenter by connecting with multiple polymeric chains via defect&#8208;driven click chemistry. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the utility of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the crosslinked gel exhibits the potential for NIR light&#8208;responsive release of encapsulated therapeutics. These light&#8208;responsive biomaterials have strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including artificial muscle, smart actuators, 3D/4D printing, regenerative medicine, and therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Stereoisomerization during Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new isomerization phenomenon occurring during molecular packing is reported. Such a new type of isomerization tends to offer tight molecular packing with fewer voids in stacking, resulting in unique packing with abundant CH&#8230;&#960; interactions. The unique packing in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.








Abstract
Isomerization is an essential chemical process that often evokes dramatic change of chemical, physical, or biological properties. For a long time, isomerization has been known as a transformation that is induced by certain external energy such as light, heat, or mechanical force. Herein, a new isomerization phenomenon is described, which does not require external energy but simply occurs during molecular packing. The proposed isomerization is demonstrated by a series of symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) molecules, the donor of which may adopt two different stereoisomeric forms. Based on the evidence of the asymmetric isomers in crystals, the occurrence of isomerization during molecular packing is proved. Moreover, the unique asymmetric geometry in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.

         <title>Mechanism and Timescales of Reversible p&#8208;Doping of Methylammonium Lead Triiodide by Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead triiodide thin films exhibit intrinsic semiconductor electronic properties in the absence of oxygen. Exposure to oxygen or air leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping throughout the films, predominantly due to molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies. This mechanism is reversible, and oxygen&#8208;doped films return to intrinsic upon storage in ultrahigh vacuum.








Abstract
Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces with metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is essential for realizing the full potential of these materials for use in optoelectronic devices. To date, however, the basic electronic properties of MHPs are still under debate. Particularly, reported Fermi level positions in the energy gap vary from indicating strong n&#8208; to strong p&#8208;type character for nominally identical materials, raising serious questions about intrinsic and extrinsic defects as dopants. &#8203;In this work, photoemission experiments demonstrate that thin films of the prototypical methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) behave like an intrinsic semiconductor in the absence of oxygen. Oxygen is then shown to be able to reversibly diffuse into and out of the MAPbI3 bulk, requiring rather long saturation timescales of &#8776;1 h (in: ambient air) and over 10 h (out: ultrahigh vacuum), for few 100&#160;nm thick films. Oxygen in the bulk leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping, positioning the Fermi level universally &#8776;0.55&#160;eV above the valence band maximum. The key doping mechanism is suggested to be molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies, supported by density functional theory calculations. This insight rationalizes previous and future electronic property studies of MHPs and calls for meticulous oxygen exposure protocols.

         <title>A Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymer Donor Achieving 17.62% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) units with different side chains. The organic solar cell (OSC) based on PBQ6 as donor and Y6 as acceptor achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 17.62%, which is one of the highest efficiencies for binary OSCs with a polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.








Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering has been an effective strategy in tuning electronic energy levels, intermolecular interaction, and aggregation morphology of organic photovoltaic materials, which is very important for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on bithienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the donor (D) unit, difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) with different side chains as the acceptor (A) unit, and thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridges. PBQ6 with two alkyl&#8208;substituted fluorothiophene side chains on the DFQ units possesses redshifted absorption, stronger intermolecular interaction, and higher hole mobility than PBQ5 with two alkyl side chains on the DFQ units. The blend film of the PBQ6 donor with the Y6 acceptor shows higher and balanced hole/electron mobilities, less charge carrier recombination, and more favorable aggregation morphology. Therefore, the OSC based on PBQ6:Y6 achieves a PCE as high as 17.62% with a high fill factor of 77.91%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (15.55%) of the PBQ5:Y6&#8208;based OSC. The PCE of 17.62% is by far one of the highest efficiencies for the binary OSCs with polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.

The PCE of 17.62% is by far one of the highest efficiencies for the binary OSCs with polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Nanobelts Based on Titanium Dioxide/Zirconium Dioxide&#8211;Polyoxometalate Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) sub&#8208;nanobelts (SNBs) and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs are constructed through a nanoclusters gathering&#8211;transforming process, composed of ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, showing high catalytic activity and stability in the oxidative desulfurization reaction at room temperature. The POM nanoclusters not only facilitate the formation of SNBs, but also perform as catalytic centers.








Abstract
In addition to offering conformational flexibility, sub&#8208;nanometer nanobelts (SNBs) also outperform many larger nanobelts with large size owing to their ultrathin morphologies. However, to date, only a few monocomponent SNBs have been synthesized. This study presents a facile method for synthesizing ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) SNBs and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs with heterostructures. The SNBs comprise ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, which are formed via the aggregation and subsequent transformation of nanoclusters. Significantly, these SNBs demonstrate high catalytic activity and stability in oxidative desulfurization reactions at room temperature. The impressive catalytic performance of the SNBs is aided by the POM nanoclusters, which not only coassemble with ZrO2/TiO2 nuclei to form building blocks of PMZ SNBs/PMT SNBs but also serve as catalytic centers. The catalytic performance is further enhanced by the ZrO2/TiO2 in the SNBs. Moreover, the proposed synthesis method can be utilized to produce other SNBs. Thus, this method provides valuable insights into the strong performance properties of SNBs created by combining metal oxides and POM nanoclusters into SNBs, which have great potential as redox catalysts.

         <title>Switching of a Magnet by Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque from a Topological Dirac Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature switching of magnetization in a CoFeB thin film by a spin&#8208;orbit torque from a neighboring topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn thin film is reported. The &#945;&#8208;Sn film is grown by sputtering on a silicon substrate. The switching is driven mainly by the topological surface states in the &#945;&#8208;Sn. The switching efficiency is comparable to that in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;based structures.








Abstract
Recent experiments show that topological surface states (TSS) in topological insulators (TI) can be exploited to manipulate magnetic ordering in ferromagnets. In principle, TSS should also exist for other topological materials, but it remains unexplored as to whether such states can also be utilized to manipulate ferromagnets. Herein, current&#8208;induced magnetization switching enabled by TSS in a non&#8208;TI topological material, namely, a topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn, is reported. The experiments use an &#945;&#8208;Sn/Ag/CoFeB trilayer structure. The magnetization in the CoFeB layer can be switched by a charge current at room temperature, without an external magnetic field. The data show that the switching is driven by the TSS of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer, rather than spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the bulk of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer or current&#8208;produced heating. The switching efficiency is as high as in TI systems. This shows that the topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn is as promising as TI materials in terms of spintronic applications.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Magnetic Actuators with Optimal Six Degrees&#8208;of&#8208;Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small, untethered actuators that can be controlled by magnetic fields. This work introduces optimal MMRs that can display unprecedented dexterity, manipulation capabilities, and soft&#8208;bodied mechanical functionalities. It is envisioned that this work can inspire future MMRs to be significantly more competent across a vast range of applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine.








Abstract
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small&#8208;scale, untethered actuators which can be controlled by magnetic fields. As these actuators can non&#8208;invasively access highly confined and enclosed spaces; they have great potential to revolutionize numerous applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine. While the creation of MMRs with six&#8208;degrees&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (six&#8208;DOF) represents a major advancement for this class of actuators, these robots are not widely adopted due to two critical limitations: i) under precise orientation control, these MMRs have slow sixth&#8208;DOF angular velocities (4&#160;degree s&#8722;1) and it is difficult to apply desired magnetic forces on them; ii) such MMRs cannot perform soft&#8208;bodied functionalities. Here a fabrication method that can magnetize optimal MMRs to produce 51&#8211;297&#8208;fold larger sixth&#8208;DOF torque than existing small&#8208;scale, magnetic actuators is introduced. A universal actuation method that is applicable for rigid and soft MMRs with six&#8208;DOF is also proposed. Under precise orientation control, the optimal MMRs can execute full six&#8208;DOF motions reliably and achieve sixth&#8208;DOF angular velocities of 173&#160;degree s&#8722;1. The soft MMRs can display unprecedented functionalities; the six&#8208;DOF jellyfish&#8208;like robot can swim across barriers impassable by existing similar devices and the six&#8208;DOF gripper is 20&#8208;folds quicker than its five&#8208;DOF predecessor in completing a complicated, small&#8208;scale assembly.

         <title>Enhancing Light&#8211;Matter Interactions in MoS2 by Copper Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation of uniformly distributed copper into the van der Waals gap of vertically aligned MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition improves photodiode device performance. The intercalated MoS2 remains semiconducting and possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1&#160;eV. Remarkably enhanced photoresponse from the ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regime is presented.








Abstract
The intercalation of layered compounds opens up a vast space of new host&#8211;guest hybrids, providing new routes for tuning the properties of materials. Here, it is shown that uniform and continuous layers of copper can be intercalated within the van der Waals gap of bulk MoS2 resulting in a unique Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrid. The new Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrid, which remains semiconducting, possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1eV, giving rise to enhanced optoelectronic activity. Compared with high&#8208;performance MoS2 photodetectors, copper&#8208;enhanced devices are superior in their spectral response, which extends into the infrared, and also in their total responsivity, which exceeds 104 A W&#8722;1. The Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrids hold promise for supplanting current night&#8208;vision technology with compact, advanced multicolor night vision.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Elastic Softening of Few&#8208;Layer Free&#8208;Standing MoSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;plane elastic constants of a few&#8208;layer suspended 2H&#8208;MoSe2 soften about 30% while decreasing the thickness from bulk to three&#8208;layers. The results obtained employing the contactless technique indicate the so&#8208;called negative elastic size&#8208;effect.








Abstract
Few&#8208;layer van der Waals (vdW) materials have been extensively investigated in terms of their exceptional electronic, optoelectronic, optical, and thermal properties. Simultaneously, a complete evaluation of their mechanical properties remains an undeniable challenge due to the small lateral sizes of samples and the limitations of experimental tools. In particular, there is no systematic experimental study providing unambiguous evidence on whether the reduction of vdW thickness down to few layers results in elastic softening or stiffening with respect to the bulk. In this work, micro&#8208;Brillouin light scattering is employed to investigate the anisotropic elastic properties of single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing 2H&#8208;MoSe2 as a function of thickness, down to three molecular layers. The so&#8208;called elastic size effect, that is, significant and systematic elastic softening of the material with decreasing numbers of layers is reported. In addition, this approach allows for a complete mechanical examination of few&#8208;layer membranes, that is, their elasticity, residual stress, and thickness, which can be easily extended to other vdW materials. The presented results shed new light on the ongoing debate on the elastic size&#8208;effect and are relevant for performance and durability of implementation of vdW materials as resonators, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric&#160;devices.

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Characterization of Epitaxial CrBr3 Monolayers on a Superconducting Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic and magnetic properties of a 2D monolayer ferromagnet on a layered superconducting substrate are studied using different experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. It is confirmed that the chromium tribromide monolayer retains its ferromagnetic order and induces proximitized magnetism on the underlying superconductor niobium diselenide. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D heterostructures.








Abstract
The ability to imprint a given material property to another through a proximity effect in layered 2D materials has opened the way to the creation of designer materials. Here, molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy is used for direct synthesis of a superconductor&#8211;ferromagnet heterostructure by combining superconducting niobium diselenide (NbSe2) with the monolayer ferromagnetic chromium tribromide (CrBr3). Using different characterization techniques and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, it is confirmed that the CrBr3 monolayer retains its ferromagnetic ordering with a magnetocrystalline anisotropy favoring an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin orientation. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements show a slight reduction of the superconducting gap of NbSe2 and the formation of a vortex lattice on the CrBr3 layer in experiments under an external magnetic field. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>mRNA Delivery of a Bispecific Single&#8208;Domain Antibody to Polarize Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages and Synergize Immunotherapy against Liver Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) is evolved using yeast surface display. mRNAs encoding BisCCL2/5i or a PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) are encapsulated and delivered via clinically amenable lipid nanoparticles. Combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;Li achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers.








Abstract
Liver malignancies are among the tumor types that are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly enriched and play a major role in inducing immunosuppression in liver malignancies. Herein, CCL2 and CCL5 are screened as two major chemokines responsible for attracting TAM infiltration and inducing their polarization toward cancer&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;phenotype. To reverse this immunosuppressive process, an innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) with high potency and specificity is directly evolved. mRNA encoding BisCCL2/5i is encapsulated in a clinically approved lipid nanoparticle platform, resulting in a liver&#8208;homing biomaterial that allows transient yet efficient expression of BisCCL2/5i in the diseased organ in a multiple dosage manner. This BisCCL2/5i mRNA nanoplatform significantly induces the polarization of TAMs toward the antitumoral M1 phenotype and reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The work provides an effective bispecific targeting strategy that could broaden the PD&#8208;Li therapy to multiple types of malignancies in the human liver.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Induced Material&#8208;Insensitive Optical Response in Plasmonic Nanostructures: Vibrant Structural Colors from Noble Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical response of materials, either at the macroscale or the nanoscale, is determined by their unique dielectric functions. Assisted by intrinsic disorder in fabrication, material&#8208;insensitive reflection is achieved from plasmonic nanostructures composed of different noble metals. The disorder&#8208;induced disentanglement between the optical response and the material properties may inspire novel applications ranging from photocatalysis to Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Materials show various responses to incident light, owing to their unique dielectric functions. A well&#8208;known example is the distinct colors displayed by metals, providing probably the simplest method to identify gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times. With the advancement of nanotechnology, optical structures with feature sizes smaller than the optical wavelength have been routinely achieved. In this regime, the optical response is also determined by the geometry of the nanostructures, inspiring flourishing progress in plasmonics, photonic crystals, and metamaterials. Nevertheless, the nature of the materials still plays a decisive role in light&#8211;matter interactions, and this material&#8208;dependent optical response is widely accepted as a norm in nanophotonics. Here, a counterintuitive system&#8212;plasmonic nanostructures composed of different materials but exhibiting almost identical reflection&#8212;is proposed and realized. The geometric disorder embedded in the system overwhelms the contribution of the material properties to the electrodynamics. Both numerical simulations and experimental results provide concrete evidence of the insensitivity of the optical response to different plasmonic materials. The same optical response is preserved with various materials, providing great flexibility of freedom in material selection. As a result, the proposed configuration may shed light on novel applications ranging from Raman spectroscopy, photocatalysis, to nonlinear&#160;optics.

         <title>Atomically Thin Sheets of Lead&#8208;Free 1D Hybrid Perovskites Feature Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystals of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl featuring covalent bonds only in one direction are exfoliated down to single layers. The unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables self&#8208;trapped excitons with white&#8208;light emission and an extremely strong shift of the emission energy as a result of the thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites synergize the virtues of two unique classes of materials featuring intriguing possibilities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics: they offer tailorable building blocks for atomically thin, layered materials while providing the enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and emitting capabilities of hybrid perovskites. This work goes beyond the paradigm that atomically thin materials require in&#8208;plane covalent bonding and reports single layers of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl. Its unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables single layers and the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons, which show white&#8208;light emission. The thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping causes an extremely strong shift of the emission energy. Thus, such 2D perovskites demonstrate that already 1D covalent interactions suffice to realize atomically thin materials and provide access to unique exciton physics. These findings enable a much more general construction principle for tailoring and identifying 2D materials that are no longer limited to covalently bonded 2D sheets.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin crystals of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[BiCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl featuring covalent bonds only in one direction are exfoliated down to single layers. The unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables self-trapped excitons with white-light emission and an extremely strong shift of the emission energy as a result of the thickness dependence of the exciton self-trapping.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites synergize the virtues of two unique classes of materials featuring intriguing possibilities for next-generation optoelectronics: they offer tailorable building blocks for atomically thin, layered materials while providing the enhanced light-harvesting and emitting capabilities of hybrid perovskites. This work goes beyond the paradigm that atomically thin materials require in-plane covalent bonding and reports single layers of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[BiCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl. Its unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables single layers and the formation of self-trapped excitons, which show white-light emission. The thickness dependence of the exciton self-trapping causes an extremely strong shift of the emission energy. Thus, such 2D perovskites demonstrate that already 1D covalent interactions suffice to realize atomically thin materials and provide access to unique exciton physics. These findings enable a much more general construction principle for tailoring and identifying 2D materials that are no longer limited to covalently bonded 2D sheets.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of a Durable and Liquid&#8208;Repellent Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;stick coating with autophobicity is fabricated by a one&#8208;step grafting&#8208;from approach for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes on surfaces. Independent of surface tension, liquid droplets can easily slide on such surfaces.








Abstract
Coatings with low sliding angles for liquid drops have a broad range of applications. However, it remains a challenge to have a fast, easy, and universal preparation method for coatings that are long&#8208;term stable, robust, and environmentally friendly. Here, a one&#8208;step grafting&#8208;from approach is reported for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes on surfaces through spontaneous polymerization of dichlorodimethylsilane fulfilling all these requirements. Drops of a variety of liquids slide off at tilt angles below 5&#176;. This non&#8208;stick coating with autophobicity can reduce the waste of water and solvents in cleaning. The strong covalent attachment of the PDMS brush to the substrate makes them mechanically robust and UV&#8208;tolerant. Their resistance to high temperatures and to droplet sliding erosion, combined with the low film thickness (&#8776;8 nm) makes them ideal candidates to solve the long&#8208;term degradation issues of coatings for heat&#8208;transfer surfaces.

         <title>Liquid Wells as Self&#8208;Healing, Functional Analogues to Solid Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water can act as a solid&#8208;like wall to contain organic liquids. The resulting liquid wells possess a range of unique and interesting properties, such as being dynamic, self&#8208;healing, and functional. Because the liquid&#8208;water wall can be removed and re&#8208;formed at will, these liquid wells can serve as sacrificial templates for polymer synthesis.








Abstract
Liquids are traditionally handled and stored in solid vessels. Solid walls are not functional, adaptive, or self&#8208;repairing, and are difficult to remove and re&#8208;form. Liquid walls can overcome these limitations, but cannot form free&#8208;standing 3D walls. Herein, a liquid analogue of a well, termed a &#8220;liquid well&#8221; is introduced. Water tethered to a surface with hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic core&#8211;shell patterns forms stable liquid walls capable of containing another immiscible fluid, similar to fluid confinement by solid walls. Liquid wells with different liquids, volumes, and shapes are prepared and investigated by confocal and Raman microscopy. The confinement of various low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (LSTLs) on surfaces by liquid wells can compete with or be complementary to existing confinement strategies using perfluorinated surfaces, for example, in terms of the shape and height of the confined LSTLs. Liquid wells show unique properties arising from their liquid aggregate state: they are self&#8208;healing, dynamic, and functional, that is, not restricted to a passive confining role. Water walls can be easily removed and re&#8208;formed, making them interesting as sacrificial templates. This is demonstrated in a process termed water&#8208;templated polymerization (WTP). Numerical phase&#8208;field model simulations are performed to scrutinize the conditions required for the formation of stable liquid wells.

         <title>MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Derived Mesoporous Carbon Supporting Highly Exposed Fe Single&#8208;Atom Sites as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) are successfully synthesized using NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon as supports. The abundant mesopores in the supports promote mass transport during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ensure a high proportion of FeNx sites are accessible. Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 demonstrates outstanding activity for ORR and excellent performance in both aqueous and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SACs) with atomic FeNx active sites are very promising alternatives to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The pyrolysis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a common approach for preparing Fe SACs, though most MOF&#8208;derived catalysts reported to date are microporous and thus suffer from poor mass transfer and a high proportion of catalytically inaccessible FeNx active sites. Herein, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al), a MOF possessing a mesoporous cage architecture, is used as the precursor to prepare a series of N&#8208;doped carbon supports (denoted herein as NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) with a well&#8208;defined mesoporous structure at different pyrolysis temperatures. The NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T supports are then impregnated with a Fe(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complex, and heated again to yield Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T catalysts rich in accessible FeNx single atom sites. The best performing Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 catalyst offers outstanding ORR activity in alkaline media, evidenced by an ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.94&#160;V (vs RHE) in 0.1 m KOH, as well as excellent performance in both aqueous primary zinc&#8211;air batteries (a near maximum theoretical energy density of 984.2&#160;Wh kgZn&#8722;1) and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries (a peak power density of 50.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a specific capacity of 724.0 mAh kgZn&#8722;1).

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Stretchable Ag2S Semiconductor Thin Films for Wearable Self&#8208;Powered Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed synthesis of intrinsically stretchable Ag2S thin films for fabrication of self&#8208;powered stretchable resistive memory devices is presented. The device exhibits excellent switching characteristics and mechanical stretchability (52%), and extremely high thermal and environmental durability (168 h in 85 &#176;C/85% relative humidity). A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated.








Abstract
Compared with the large plastic deformation observed in ductile metals and organic materials, inorganic semiconductors have limited plasticity (&lt;0.2%) due to their intrinsic bonding characters, restricting their widespread applications in stretchable electronics. Herein, the solution&#8208;processed synthesis of ductile &#945;&#8208;Ag2S thin films and fabrication of all&#8208;inorganic, self&#8208;powered, and stretchable memory devices, is reported. Molecular Ag2S complex solution is synthesized by chemical reduction of Ag2S powder, fabricating wafer&#8208;scale highly crystalline Ag2S thin films. The thin films show stretchability due to the intrinsic ductility, sustaining the structural integrity at a tensile strain of 14.9%. Moreover, the fabricated Ag2S&#8208;based resistive random access memory presents outstanding bipolar switching characteristics (Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;105, operational endurance of 100 cycles, and retention time &gt;106 s) as well as excellent mechanical stretchability (no degradation of properties up to stretchability of 52%). Meanwhile, the device is highly durable under diverse chemical environments and temperatures from &#8722;196 to 300 &#176;C, especially maintaining the properties for 168 h in 85% relative humidity and 85 &#176;C. A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated, offering the potential for designing high&#8208;performance wearable electronics that are usable in daily life in a real&#8208;world setting.

Molecular Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S complex solution is synthesized by chemical reduction of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S powder, fabricating wafer-scale highly crystalline Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S thin films. The thin films show stretchability due to the intrinsic ductility, sustaining the structural integrity at a tensile strain of 14.9%. Moreover, the fabricated Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-based resistive random access memory presents outstanding bipolar switching characteristics (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, operational endurance of 100 cycles, and retention time &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s) as well as excellent mechanical stretchability (no degradation of properties up to stretchability of 52%). Meanwhile, the device is highly durable under diverse chemical environments and temperatures from &#8722;196 to 300 &#176;C, especially maintaining the properties for 168 h in 85% relative humidity and 85 &#176;C. A self-powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated, offering the potential for designing high-performance wearable electronics that are usable in daily life in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D Materials: Thickness&#8208;Dependent Elastic Softening of Few&#8208;Layer Free&#8208;Standing MoSe2 (Adv. Mater. 23/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer graphene is stronger than bulk graphite: the elastic properties of graphene are such that it could hypothetically withstand an elephant balancing on a pencil. A contactless optical technique, reported by Bartlomiej Graczykowski and co&#8208;workers in article number 2008614 now shows that this is not the case for MoSe2, an attractive semiconducting 2D material. This material becomes significantly softer by reducing its thickness from bulk to a few layers.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2100518, Johanna Heine and co&#8208;workers report tunable white&#8208;light emission from atomically thin sheets of the 1D hybrid perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl. The unique structure enables self&#8208;trapped&#8208;exciton formation with white&#8208;light emission, and reveals the thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping. This enables facile control of the emission color in next&#8208;generation lighting and display technologies.

The diverse photoresponses from different energy levels in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles enables simultaneous generation of multiple point&#8208;spread functions with one doughnut&#8208;shaped excitation beam. In article number 2008847, Fan Wang, Dayong Jin, and co&#8208;workers explore a new imaging modality to extend the capabilities of the engineered point&#8208;spread functions to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information for optimizing the averaged resolution.

         <title>Engineering Hydrogel&#8208;Based Biomedical Photonics: Design, Fabrication, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current panorama of hydrogel&#8208;based photonics and advances in fabrication techniques toward functional optical architectures are reviewed, evaluating their capabilities in the biomedical field. Further, the future potential for hydrogel photonic constructs to integrate into live tissues, advanced biosensing platforms, microrobotics, photomedicine, and lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip technologies are discussed.








Abstract
Light guiding and manipulation in photonics have become ubiquitous in events ranging from everyday communications to complex robotics and nanomedicine. The speed and sensitivity of light&#8211;matter interactions offer unprecedented advantages in biomedical optics, data transmission, photomedicine, and detection of multi&#8208;scale phenomena. Recently, hydrogels have emerged as a promising candidate for interfacing photonics and bioengineering by combining their light&#8208;guiding properties with live tissue compatibility in optical, chemical, physiological, and mechanical dimensions. Herein, the latest progress over hydrogel photonics and its applications in guidance and manipulation of light is reviewed. Physics of guiding light through hydrogels and living tissues, and existing technical challenges in translating these tools into biomedical settings are discussed. A&#160;comprehensive and thorough overview of materials, fabrication protocols, and design architectures used in hydrogel photonics is provided. Finally, recent examples of applying structures such as hydrogel optical fibers, living photonic constructs, and their use as light&#8208;driven hydrogel robots, photomedicine tools, and organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models are described. By providing a critical and selective evaluation of the field's status, this work sets a foundation for the next generation of hydrogel photonic research.

         <title>Halide Perovskites: A New Era of Solution&#8208;Processed Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites show high promise for electronic devices owing to exceptional electrical, optical, and structural properties. The latest breakthroughs in structural, interface, defect engineering, and pattering techniques as applied to halide perovskite transistors, memories and to improve stability issues in perovskites are reviewed. Lastly, the existing challenges and outline for future research directions are provided.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskites have emerged as an excellent class of materials with a unique combination of optoelectronic properties, suitable for a plethora of applications ranging from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes and photoelectrochemical devices. Recent works have showcased hybrid perovskites for electronic applications through improvements in materials design, processing, and device stability. Herein, a comprehensive up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is presented on hybrid perovskite electronics with a focus on transistors and memories. These applications are supported by the fundamental material properties of hybrid perovskite semiconductors such as tunable bandgap, ambipolar charge transport, reasonable mobility, defect characteristics, and solution processability, which are highlighted first. Then, recent progresses on perovskite&#8208;based transistors are reviewed, covering aspects of fabrication process, patterning techniques, contact engineering, 2D versus 3D material selection, and device performance. Furthermore, applications of perovskites in nonvolatile memories and artificial synaptic devices are presented. The ambient instability of hybrid perovskites and the strategies to tackle this bottleneck are also discussed. Finally, an outlook and opportunities to develop perovskite&#8208;based electronics as a competitive and feasible technology are highlighted.

         <title>Engineering Biomolecular Self&#8208;Assembly at Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent achievements in the self&#8208;assembly of diverse 2D biomolecular architectures at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces achieved by programming interactions acting over multiple scales are summarized. Recent advances in the physical understanding of the assembly dynamics obtained via in situ atomic force microscopy are also discussed. Finally, potential applications and critical unresolved obstacles in achieving them are highlighted.








Abstract
Biomolecular self&#8208;assembly is a key process used by life to build functional materials from the &#8220;bottom up.&#8221; In the last few decades, bioengineering and bionanotechnology have borrowed this strategy to design and synthesize numerous biomolecular and hybrid materials with diverse architectures and properties. However, engineering biomolecular self&#8208;assembly at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces into predesigned architectures lags the progress made in bulk solution both in practice and theory. Here, recent achievements in programming self&#8208;assembly of peptides, proteins, and peptoids at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces are summarized and corresponding applications are described. Recent advances in the physical understandings of self&#8208;assembly pathways obtained using in situ atomic force microscopy are also discussed. These advances will lead to novel strategies for designing biomaterials organized at and interfaced with inorganic surfaces.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the magnetism dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles and its relevance to optimizing and further developing biomedical applications is presented, with a specific focus on the applications of magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia. A summary of historical and current theoretical and computational models of nanoparticle dynamics is given.








Abstract
Magnetic nanoparticles are currently the focus of investigation for a wide range of biomedical applications that fall into the categories of imaging, sensing, and therapeutics. A deep understanding of nanoparticle magnetization dynamics is fundamental to optimization and further development of these applications. Here, a summary of theoretical models of nanoparticle dynamics is presented, and computational nonequilibrium models are outlined, which currently represent the most sophisticated methods for modeling nanoparticle dynamics. Nanoparticle magnetization response is explored in depth; the effect of applied field amplitude, as well as nanoparticle size, on the resulting rotation mechanism and timescale is investigated. Two applications in biomedicine, magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia, are highlighted.

         <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as T1 Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Fundamentals, Challenges, Applications, and Prospectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as T1 contrast agents, the past advances, and current challenges in developing IONPs are reviewed. The key material properties and environmental variables influencing T1 and T2 contrast, and their relationships are discussed. Strategies for improving T1 contrast enhancement and directions for future research are provided.








Abstract
Gadolinium&#8208;based chelates are a mainstay of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the clinic. However, their toxicity elicits severe side effects and the Food and Drug Administration has issued many warnings about their potential retention in patients&#8217; bodies, which causes safety concerns. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are a potentially attractive alternative, because of their nontoxic and biodegradable nature. Studies in developing IONPs as T1 contrast agents have generated promising results, but the complex, interrelated parameters influencing contrast enhancement make the development difficult, and IONPs suitable for T1 contrast enhancement have yet to make their way to clinical use. Here, the fundamental principles of MRI contrast agents are discussed, and the current status of MRI contrast agents is reviewed with a focus on the advantages and limitations of current T1 contrast agents and the potential of IONPs to serve as safe and improved alternative to gadolinium&#8208;based chelates. The past advances and current challenges in developing IONPs as a T1 contrast agent from a materials science perspective are presented, and how each of the key material properties and environment variables affects the performance of IONPs is assessed. Finally, some potential approaches to develop high&#8208;performance and clinically relevant T1 contrast agents are discussed.

         <title>Quantum Point Defects for Solid&#8208;State Laser Refrigeration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 23, June 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of point defects in realizing solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is discussed with an emphasis on the fundamental physical phenomena and quantized electronic transitions. Lanthanide&#8208;doping&#8208;based point defects, which have advanced solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration, along with potential color centers based on fluoride vacancies and color centers in diamonds, are also addressed.








Abstract
Herein, the role that point defects have played over the last two decades in realizing solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is discussed. A brief introduction to the field of solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration is given with an emphasis on the fundamental physical phenomena and quantized electronic transitions that have made solid&#8208;state laser&#8208;cooling possible. Lanthanide&#8208;based point defects, such as trivalent ytterbium ions (Yb3+), have played a central role in the first demonstrations and subsequent development of advanced materials for solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration. Significant discussion is devoted to the quantum mechanical description of optical transitions in lanthanide ions, and their influence on laser cooling. Transition&#8208;metal point defects have been shown to generate substantial background absorption in ceramic materials, decreasing the overall efficiency of a particular laser refrigeration material. Other potential color centers based on fluoride vacancies with multiple potential charge states are also considered. In conclusion, novel materials for solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration, including color centers in diamond that have recently been proposed to realize the solid&#8208;state laser refrigeration of semiconducting materials, are discussed.

         <title>Upregulating Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Blood&#8211;Tumor&#8208;Barrier Permeability for Precise Photothermal Eradication of Brain Tumors and Induction of Local Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional biocompatible nanoplatform based on bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) can specifically target brain tumors, penetrate through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier, perform photothermal therapy (PTT), and simultaneously activate the local immune system for very effective synergetic brain cancer therapy. Moreover, BK@AIE NPs&#8208;mediated PTT can eliminate cancer stem cells&#8217; recurrence associated with conventional therapy, for cancer treatment with highly improved efficacy.








Abstract
Compared to other tumors, glioblastoma (GBM) is extremely difficult to treat. Recently, photothermal therapy (PTT) has demonstrated advanced therapeutic efficacy; however, because of the relatively low tissue&#8208;penetration efficiency of laser light, its application in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains challenging. Herein, bradykinin (BK) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission nanoparticles (BK@AIE NPs) are synthesized; these offer selective penetration through the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) and strong absorbance in the near&#8208;infrared region (NIR). The BK ligand can prompt BTB adenosine receptor activation, which enhances transportation and accumulation inside tumors, as confirmed by T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging. The BK@AIE NPs exhibit high photothermal conversion efficiency under 980&#160;nm NIR laser irradiation, facilitating the treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors. Tumor progression can be effectively inhibited to extend the survival span of mice after spatiotemporal PTT. NIR irradiation can eradicate tumor tissues and release tumor&#8208;associated antigens. It is observed that the PTT treatment of GBM&#8208;bearing mice activates natural killer cells, CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and M1 macrophages in the GBM area, increasing the therapeutic efficacy. This study demonstrates that NIR&#8208;assisted BK@AIE NPs represent a promising strategy for the improved systematic elimination of GBMs and the activation of local brain immune privilege.

         <title>A Bottom&#8208;Up Approach to Red&#8208;Emitting Molecular&#8208;Based Nanoparticles with Natural Stealth Properties and their Use for Single&#8208;Particle Tracking Deep in Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles displaying intrinsic stealth properties toward biological membranes are prepared by nanoprecipitation of a hydrophobic, conjugated, red&#8208;emitting quadrupolar dye. The excellent brightness, stability, and size control down to &#8776;10&#160;nm of these nanoparticles allow for single&#8208;particle tracking deep in brain tissue. These findings point to a novel route for the bottom&#8208;up molecular design of the nano&#8211;bio interface.








Abstract
Fluorescent nanoparticles dedicated to bioimaging applications should possess specific properties that have to be maintained in the aqueous, reactive, and crowded biological environment. These include chemical and photostability, small size (on the scale of subcellular structures), biocompatibility, high brightness, and good solubility. The latter is a major challenge for inorganic nanoparticles, which require surface coating to be made water soluble. Molecular&#8208;based fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) may prove a promising, spontaneously water&#8208;soluble alternative, whose bottom&#8208;up design allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of individual properties. Here, the critical challenge of controlling the interaction of nanoparticles with cellular membranes is addressed. This is a report on bright, size&#8208;tunable, red&#8208;emitting, naturally stealthy FONs that do not require the use of antifouling agents to impede interactions with cellular membranes. As a proof of concept, single FONs diffusing up to 150&#160;&#181;m deep in brain tissue are imaged and tracked.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Quasi&#8208;Epitaxial Growth of Hybrid Perovskite from Solution Process&#8212;Achieving High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells via Template&#8203;&#8208;Guided Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite film is achieved through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and a large&#8208;organic cation. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth gives the highest&#8208;quality crystalline semiconductor thin films for optoelectronic devices. Here, a universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite film via a two&#8208;step method is reported, in which the crystal orientation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film is precisely controlled through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and the large&#8208;organic cation butylammonium bromide. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom of film, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process. The template&#8208;guided epitaxially grown BAFAMA perovskite film exhibits increased crystallinity, preferred crystallographic orientation, and reduced defects. Moreover, the BAFAMA perovskite solar cells demonstrate decent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 2600&#160;h ambient storage, and 4&#8208;time operation condition lifetime enhancement.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Substitution Promoted Ultrawide Bandgap up to 4.5&#160;eV in a 2D Semiconductor: Gallium Thiophosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;substitution process is used to design 2D ultrawide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor GaPS4 by employing GeS2 as a similar structural model. Monolayer GaPS4 exhibits an ultrawide optical bandgap of 4.50&#160;eV. The polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the GaPS4 material display high selectivity and linear dichroic ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region.








Abstract
Exploring 2D ultrawide bandgap semiconductors (UWBSs) will be conductive to the development of next&#8208;generation nanodevices, such as deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors, single&#8208;photon emitters, and high&#8208;power flexible electronic devices. However, a gap still remains between the theoretical prediction of novel 2D UWBSs and the experimental realization of the corresponding materials. The cross&#8208;substitution process is an effective way to construct novel semiconductors with the favorable parent characteristics (e.g., structure) and the better physicochemical properties (e.g., bandgap). Herein, a simple case is offered for rational design and syntheses of 2D UWBS GaPS4 by employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeS2 as a similar structural model. Benefiting from the cosubstitution of Ge with lighter Ga and P, the GaPS4 crystals exhibit sharply enlarged optical bandgaps (few&#8208;layer: 3.94&#160;eV and monolayer: 4.50&#160;eV) and superior detection performances with high responsivity (4.89 A W&#8722;1), high detectivity (1.98&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones), and high quantum efficiency (2.39&#160;&#215;&#160;103%) in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region. Moreover, the GaPS4&#8208;based photodetector exhibits polarization&#8208;sensitive photoresponse with a linear dichroic ratio of 1.85 at 254&#160;nm, benefitting from its in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy. These results provide a pathway for the discovery and fabrication of 2D UWBS anisotropic materials, which become promising candidates for future solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet and polarization&#8208;sensitive sensors.

         <title>Engineering a Hydrogen&#8208;Sulfide&#8208;Based Nanomodulator to Normalize Hyperactive Photothermal Immunogenicity for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, suffers from hyperactive immunity&#8208;related permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. In this scenario, a hydrogen sulfide donor to PTT via an amphiphilic conjugated polymer (CP) (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)) is integrated, for advanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided inflammatory modulation. The regulated inflammation preserves photothermal immunogenicity and promotes hyperthermia&#8208;induced wound healing concurrently.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, is highlighted with excessive inflammatory response, while ablating cancer with immunogenic death. This hyperactive immune response may override PTT&#8208;triggered immunogenicity, exacerbate skin empyrosis, and incur permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. Therefore, an anticancer balance between pathological and protective immune response is urgently needed for an advanced photothermal therapeutic tactic. Herein, a gas&#8208;modulated photothermal immunogenicity strategy is proposed by integrating an amphiphilic&#8208;conjugated polymer with a polysulfide&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;PEG) (where CP = conjugated polymer and PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)). The CP is endowed with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence capacity and favorable photothermal effect, tracing the tumor for precise therapeutics. The polysulfide donor can release H2S triggered by intracellular glutathione, which elicits mitochondrial dysfunction and robust anti&#8208;inflammation effect. Ultimately, this gas&#8208;modulated PTT strategy inhibits tumor growth remarkably and limits the magnitude of PTT&#8208;induced proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6), and interleukin&#8208;1beta (IL&#8208;1&#946;) cytokines. Moreover, the regulated inflammation accelerates PTT&#8208;induced wound healing. A H2S&#8208;modulated PTT with adaptive immune response is thus recommended as an advanced strategy to cancer therapeutics.

A top&#8208;level design strategy assisted by density functional theory is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts and their enhanced catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is successfully predicted. A new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method is developed to fabricate the as&#8208;predicted high&#8208;entropy catalysts.

Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are new&#8208;generation electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their excellent reactivity and highly tailorable electrochemical properties. Herein, a powerful top&#8208;level design strategy is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts by establishing reaction models (e.g., reaction energy barrier, conductivity, adsorption geometries for intermediates, and rate&#8208;determining step) to predict performance with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Accordingly, novel high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method and their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are thoroughly characterized. These as&#8208;prepared quaternary metallic (oxy)hydroxides present much better OER performance than ternary Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, and other counterparts, and are demonstrated with a low overpotential of 199&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 48.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope in 1 m KOH and excellent stability without decay over 72 h. The performance enhancement mechanism is also unraveled by synchrotron radiation. The work verifies the usefulness of high&#8208;entropy design and the great synergistic effect on OER performance by the incorporation of four elements, and also provides a new method for the construction of advanced high&#8208;entropy materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Polymeric Microparticles Generated via Confinement&#8208;Free Fluid Instability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexplored facile and scalable polymeric microparticle fabrication strategy via confinement&#8208;free fluid instability induced by an ultralow&#8208;surface&#8208;energy layer is reported. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers with a wide range of sizes. This research introduces an intriguing phenomenon in fluid dynamics on superamphiphobic surfaces, which should lead to more exciting discoveries in the future.








Abstract
In&#8208;fiber fluid instability can be harnessed to realize scalable microparticles fabrication with tunable sizes and multifunctional characteristics making it competitive in comparison to conventional microparticles fabrication methods. However, since in&#8208;fiber fluid instability has to be induced via thermal annealing and the resulting microparticles can only be collected after dissolving the fiber cladding, obtaining contamination&#8208;free particles for high&#8208;temperature incompatible materials remains great challenge. Herein, confinement&#8208;free fluid instability is demonstrated to fabricate polymeric microparticles in a facile manner induced by the ultralow surface energy of the superamphiphobic surface. The polymer solution columns break up into uniform droplets then form spherical particles spontaneously in seconds at ambient temperature. This method can be applied to a variety of polymers spanning an exceptionally wide range of sizes: from 1&#160;mm down to 1&#160;&#181;m. With the aid of microfluidic spinning instrument, a large quantity of microparticles can be obtained, making this method promising for scaling up production. Notably, through simple modification of the feed solution configuration, composite/structured micromaterials can also be produced, including quantum&#8208;dots&#8208;labeled fluorescent particles, magnetic particles, core&#8211;shell particles, microcapsules, and necklace&#8208;like microfibers. This method, with general applicability and facile control, is envisioned to have great prospects in the field of polymer microprocessing.

         <title>Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Integrated Sensing System with 3D Periodic Ordered Black Phosphorus@MXene Thin&#8208;Films</title>

An MXene/BP&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be created by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. The smart sensor system exhibits a detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. The MXene materials design and system integration developed in this work offers a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous detection of physiological signals without the need for an external power supply is a key technology for realizing wearable electronics as next&#8208;generation biomedical devices. Herein, it is shown that a MXene/black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be designed by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. Using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly process to form a periodic interleaving MXene/BP lamellar structure results in a high energy&#8208;storage capacity in a direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitor to drive the operation of sensors and compensate the intermittency of light illumination. Meanwhile, with MXene/BP as the sensitive layer in a flexible pressure sensor, the pressure sensitivity of the device can be improved to 77.61 kPa&#8211;1 at an optimized elastic modulus of 0.45&#160;MPa. Furthermore, the smart sensor system with fast response time (10.9&#160;ms) shows a real&#8208;time detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. It is believed that the proposed study based on the design and integration of MXene materials will provide a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Force&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of 4D&#8208;Printed Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures is realized by two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting for reversible pattern/encapsulation, switchable wetting, and the dynamic actuation of microrobots/micromachines. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can exhibit three reversible geometries: (I) curved state, (II) distance&#8208;dependent coalesced clusters via traditional self&#8208;assembly, and (III) distance&#8208;independent arbitrary self&#8208;assemblies (4D self&#8208;assemblies) toward the curving directions.








Abstract
Capillary&#8208;force&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is emerging as a significant approach for the massive manufacture of advanced materials with novel wetting, adhesion, optical, mechanical, or electrical properties. However, academic value and practical applications of the self&#8208;assembly are greatly restricted because traditional micropillar self&#8208;assembly is always unidirectional. In this work, two&#8208;photon&#8208;lithography&#8208;based 4D microprinting is introduced to realize the reversible and bidirectional self&#8208;assembly of microstructures. With asymmetric crosslinking densities, the printed vertical microstructures can switch to a curved state with controlled thickness, curvature, and smooth morphology that are impossible to replicate by traditional 3D&#8208;printing technology. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D&#8208;printed microstructures can experience three states: (I) coalesce into clusters from original vertical states via traditional self&#8208;assembly, (II) remain curved, or (III) arbitrarily self&#8208;assemble (4D self&#8208;assembly) toward the curving directions. Compared to conventional approaches, this 4D self&#8208;assembly is distance&#8208;independent, which can generate varieties of assemblies with a yield as high as 100%. More importantly, the three states can be reversibly switched, allowing the development of many promising applications such as reversible micropatterns, switchable wetting, and dynamic actuation of microrobots, origami, and encapsulation.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Melamine&#8211;Cyanuric Acid Supramolecular Nanosheets as Pseudo&#8208;Porous Catalyst Support</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network consisting of melamine and cyanuric acid is fabricated as ultrathin nanosheets with extraordinary stability at pH = 0, serving as a pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support to simultaneously give remarkable enhancement in the catalytic stability and activity of metal phosphides for the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic conditions.








Abstract
Behaving as structural protectors and electronic modulators, catalyst supports such as graphene derivatives are generally constructed by covalent bonds. Here, hydrogen&#8208;bonded ultrathin nanosheets are reported as a new type of catalyst support. Melamine (M) and cyanuric acid (CA) molecules self&#8208;assemble to form the graphite&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal M&#8208;CA, which can be easily exfoliated by ultrasonic treatment to yield ultrathin nanosheets with thickness of &#8776;1.6 nm and high stability at pH = 0. The dynamic nanosheets form adaptive defects/pores in the synthetic process of CoP nanoparticles, giving embedded composite with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and stability. Computational calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy unveil the electron modulation effects of the nanosheets. This pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support also can be applied to other metal phosphides.

         <title>Polymer Dielectrics with Simultaneous Ultrahigh Energy Density and Low Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized polymers are synthsized with a record&#8208;high breakdown strength of 1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1, energy density above 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%, taking advantage of the covalent&#8208;bonding&#8208;restricted ion polarization and the charge trapping of the ion cluster phase.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are highly desirable in capacitor applications due to their low cost, high breakdown strength, and unique self&#8208;healing capability. However, existing polymer dielectrics suffer from either a low energy density or a high dielectric loss, thereby hindering the development of compact, efficient, and reliable power electronics. Here, a novel type of polymer dielectrics simultaneously exhibiting an extraordinarily high recoverable energy density of 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a low dielectric loss is reported. It is synthesized by grafting zwitterions onto the short side chains of a poly(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;pentene) (PMP)&#8208;based copolymer, which increases its dielectric constant from &#8776;2.2 to &#8776;5.2 and significantly enhances its breakdown strength from &#8776;700 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 to &#8776;1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 while maintaining its low dielectric loss of &lt;0.002 and high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%. Based on a combination of the phase&#8208;field method description of mesoscale structures, Maxwell equations, and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the outstanding combination of high energy density and low dielectric loss of zwitterions&#8208;grafted copolymers is attributed to the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the strong charge trapping by the zwitterions.

&lt;p&gt;Zwitterion-functionalized polymers are synthsized with a record-high breakdown strength of 1300 MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, energy density above 35 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &amp;gt;90%, taking advantage of the covalent-bonding-restricted ion polarization and the charge trapping of the ion cluster phase.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer dielectrics are highly desirable in capacitor applications due to their low cost, high breakdown strength, and unique self-healing capability. However, existing polymer dielectrics suffer from either a low energy density or a high dielectric loss, thereby hindering the development of compact, efficient, and reliable power electronics. Here, a novel type of polymer dielectrics simultaneously exhibiting an extraordinarily high recoverable energy density of 35 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a low dielectric loss is reported. It is synthesized by grafting zwitterions onto the short side chains of a poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) (PMP)-based copolymer, which increases its dielectric constant from &#8776;2.2 to &#8776;5.2 and significantly enhances its breakdown strength from &#8776;700 MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to &#8776;1300 MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while maintaining its low dielectric loss of &amp;lt;0.002 and high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &amp;gt;90%. Based on a combination of the phase-field method description of mesoscale structures, Maxwell equations, and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the outstanding combination of high energy density and low dielectric loss of zwitterions-grafted copolymers is attributed to the covalent-bonding restricted ion polarization and the strong charge trapping by the zwitterions. This work represents a new strategy in polymer dielectrics for achieving simultaneous high energy density and low dielectric loss.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Inorganic/Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction H2&#8208;Production Photocatalyst and its Charge Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a CdS/PT inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only leads to efficient charge separation and transfer, but also increased redox ability and enhanced stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing inorganic/organic heterojunctions is regarded as an effective strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts. Herein, a step (S)&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is prepared by in situ growth of an inorganic semiconductor firmly on an organic semiconductor. A new pyrene&#8208;based conjugated polymer, pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;triphenylamine (PT), is synthesized via the typical Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions, and then employed as a substrate to anchor CdS nanocrystals. The optimized CdS/PT composite, coupling 2 wt% PT with CdS, exhibits a robust H2 evolution rate of 9.28 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with continuous release of H2 bubbles, as well as a high apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3%, which is &#8776;8 times that of pure CdS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism between PT and CdS, is systematically demonstrated by photoirradiated Kelvin probe measurement and in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. This work provides a protocol for preparing specific S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts on the basis of inorganic/organic coupling.

         <title>Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov (YSR) states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is shown. Graphene is made superconducting by the proximity effect with Pb islands. These scanning tunneling microscopy experiments reveal the very special nature of these YSR states and constitute an unequivocal demonstration of carbon magnetism at graphene grain boundaries.








Abstract
When magnetic atoms are inserted inside a superconductor, the superconducting order is locally depleted as a result of the antagonistic nature of magnetism and superconductivity. Thereby, distinctive spectral features, known as Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, appear inside the superconducting gap. The search for Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in different materials is intense, as they can be used as building blocks to promote Majorana modes suitable for topological quantum computing. Here, the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in graphene, a non&#8208;superconducting 2D material, and without the participation of magnetic atoms, is reported. Superconductivity in graphene is induced by proximity effect brought by adsorbing nanometer&#8208;scale superconducting Pb islands. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy the superconducting proximity gap is measured in graphene, and Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states are visualized in graphene grain boundaries. The results reveal the very special nature of those Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states, which extends more than 20&#160;nm away from the grain boundaries. These observations provide the long&#8208;sought experimental confirmation that graphene grain boundaries host local magnetic moments and constitute the first observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states in a chemically pure system.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Immunoblotting based on a Photoclick Hydrogel Enables High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Accurate Profiling of Exogenous Gene Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is developed for expression screening, precise positioning of transfected cells, and immunoblotting analysis of multi&#8208;target proteins. scTAC allows for true single&#8208;cell up&#8208;sampling and enables the acquisition of continuous single&#8208;cell protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. scTAC provides a powerful tool for the analysis of biological pathways after transfection of rare cells.








Abstract
Fast and accurate profiling of exogenous gene expression in host cells is crucial for studying gene function in cellular and molecular biology, but still faces the challenge of incomplete co&#8208;expression of reporter genes and target genes. Here, a single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is presented, which is based on the in situ microchip immunoblotting method, for rapid and accurate analysis of exogenous gene expression in thousands of individual host cells. scTAC not only can assign information of exogenous gene activity to specific transfected cells, but enables the acquisition of continuous protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. It is demonstrated that scTAC can reveal the relationship of expression level between reporter genes and target genes, which is helpful for evaluating transient transfection strategy efficiency. The advantages of this method for the study of fusion protein expression and downstream protein expression in signaling pathway in rare cells are shown. Empirically, an EGFP&#8208;TSPAN8 fusion plasmid is transfected into MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells and the expressions of two cancer stemness biomarkers (ALDHA1 and SOX2) are analyzed. The scTAC method clearly reveals an interesting phenomenon that transfected adherent MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit some stem cell characteristics, but they do not have stem cell appearance.

         <title>Multivalent Nanosheet Antibody Mimics for Selective Microbial Recognition and Inactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanosheet artificial antibodies with high selectivity and strong binding affinity to pathogenic bacteria are created by spontaneous assembly of various tripeptide recognition phases on transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets. The luminescent antibody mimics can detect pathogenic bacteria at a single&#8208;cell level from human serum and urine and effectively inactivate them on wounds of infected mice for healing.








Abstract
Antibodies are widely used as recognition elements in sensing and therapy, but they suffer from poor stability, long discovery time, and high cost. Herein, a facile approach to create antibody mimics with flexible recognition phases and luminescent rigid scaffolds for the selective recognition, detection, and inactivation of pathogenic bacteria is reported. Tripeptides with a nitriloacetate&#8208;Cu group are spontaneously assembled on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanosheets via coordination bonding, providing a diversity of TMD&#8208;tripeptide assembly (TPA) antibody mimics. TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics can selectively recognize various pathogenic bacteria with nanomolar affinities. The bacterial binding sites for TMD&#8208;TPA are identified by experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that the dynamic and multivalent interactions of artificial antibodies play a crucial role for their recognition selectivity and affinity. The artificial antibodies allow the rapid and selective detection of pathogenic bacteria at single copy in human serum and urine, and their effective inactivation for therapy of infected mice. This work demonstrates the potential of TMD&#8208;TPA antibody mimics as an alternative to natural antibodies for sensing and therapy.

         <title>Improving Image&#8208;Guided Surgical and Immunological Tumor Treatment Efficacy by Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies Based on a Multifunctional NIR AIEgen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated surgery and phototheranostics employing nanoparticles based on a near&#8208;infrared aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) for image&#8208;guided synergistic tumor therapy are explored to overcome respective limitations and realize maximized therapeutic outcomes and minimized recurrences. Moreover, the combined treatment of AIEgen&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;mediated phototheranostics and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induces tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Multimodal therapy is attracting increasing attention to improve tumor treatment efficacy, but generally requires various complicated ingredients combined within one theranostic system to achieve multiple functions. Herein, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on a single aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen), DDTB, is designed to integrate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence, photothermal, photodynamic, and immunological effects. Intravenously injected AIEgen&#8208;based nanoparticles can efficiently accumulate in tumors with NIR fluorescence to provide preoperative diagnosis. Most of the tumors are excised under intraoperative fluorescence navigation, whereafter, some microscopic residual tumors are completely ablated by photodynamic and photothermal therapies for maximally killing the tumor cells and tissues. Up to 90% of the survival rate can be achieved by this synergistic image&#8208;guided surgery and photodynamic and photothermal therapies. Importantly, the nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic therapy plus programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induce tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy. This theranostic strategy on the basis of a single AIEgen significantly improves the survival of cancer mice with maximized therapeutic outcomes, and holds great promise for clinical cancer treatment.

A new wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer, PBQx&#8208;TCl, exhibits 18% efficiency for outdoor application and 28.5% efficiency for indoor application. Simultaneously, the PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based device also shows light&#8208;emitting function with broad emission ranges from 630 to 1000 nm and moderate external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2%.








Abstract
Exploring the intriguing bifunctional nature of organic semiconductors and investigating the feasibility of fabricating bifunctional devices are of great significance in realizing various applications with one device. Here, the design of a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer named PBQx&#8208;TCl (optical bandgap of 2.05&#160;eV) is reported, and its applications in photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices are studied. By fabricating devices with nonfullerene acceptors BTA3 and BTP&#8208;eC9, it is shown that the devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% under air mass 1.5G illumination conditions and an outstanding PCE of 28.5% for a 1 cm2 device and 26.0% for a 10 cm2 device under illumination from a 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode. In addition, the PBQx&#8208;TCl:BTA3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a moderate organic light&#8208;emitting diode performance with an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2% and a broad emission range of 630&#8211;1000&#160;nm. These results suggest that the polymer PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based devices exhibit outstanding photovoltaic performance and potential light&#8208;emitting functions.

         <title>Resonant Spin Transmission Mediated by Magnons in a Magnetic Insulator Multilayer Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing an epitaxial magnetic insulator heterotructure, the magnon&#8208;mediated resonant spin transmission enhancement effect is achieved, where transmission of magnon spin current can be increased by more than 1000% at selected frequencies. This novel effect can provide useful mechanisms for building future magnonic devices similar to their photonic counterparts such as antireflection coatings and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities.








Abstract
While being electrically insulating, magnetic insulators can behave as good spin conductors by carrying spin current with excited spin waves. So far, magnetic insulators are utilized in multilayer heterostructures for optimizing spin transport or to form magnon spin valves for reaching controls over the spin flow. In these studies, it remains an intensively visited topic as to what the corresponding roles of coherent and incoherent magnons are in the spin transmission. Meanwhile, understanding the underlying mechanism associated with spin transmission in insulators can help to identify new mechanisms that can further improve the spin transport efficiency. Here, by studying spin transport in a magnetic&#8208;metal/magnetic&#8208;insulator/platinum multilayer, it is demonstrated that coherent magnons can transfer spins efficiently above the magnon bandgap of magnetic insulators. Particularly the standing spin&#8208;wave mode can greatly enhance the spin flow by inducing a resonant magnon transmission. Furthermore, within the magnon bandgap, a shutdown of spin transmission due to the blocking of coherent magnons is observed. The demonstrated magnon transmission enhancement and filtering effect provides an efficient method for modulating spin current in magnonic devices.

         <title>From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracks are normally classified as material failures to be prevented. A crack patterning strategy is described that allows freely programmable patterns of cracks guided by the alignment of liquid crystal polymer networks. This programmable cracking enables high&#8208;resolution patterning in a high&#8208;throughput manner without the use of expensive lithography procedures and may serve as an alternative fabrication strategy for various applications.








Abstract
Cracks are typically associated with the failure of materials. However, cracks can also be used to create periodic patterns on the surfaces of materials, as observed in the skin of crocodiles and elephants. In synthetic materials, surface patterns are critical to micro&#8208; and nanoscale fabrication processes. Here, a strategy is presented that enables freely programmable patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer and then uses these cracks to pattern other materials. Cracks form during deposition of a thin film metal on a liquid crystal polymer network (LCN) and follow the spatially patterned molecular order of the polymer. These patterned sub&#8208;micrometer scale cracks have an order parameter of 0.98&#160;&#177; 0.02 and form readily over centimeter&#8208;scale areas on the flexible substrates. The patterning of the LCN enables cracks that turn corners, spiral azimuthally, or radiate from a point. Conductive inks can be filled into these oriented cracks, resulting in flexible, anisotropic, and transparent conductors. This materials&#8208;based processing approach to patterning cracks enables unprecedented control of the orientation, length, width, and depth of the cracks without costly lithography methods. This approach promises new architectures of electronics, sensors, fluidics, optics, and other devices with micro&#8208; and nanoscale features.

         <title>Spontaneous Pillaring of Pentasil Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites in the absence of any template is demonstrated via heterogeneous nucleation of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. These hierarchical zeolites have a large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance. These findings highlight a facile method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in nanoporous zeolites.








Abstract
Conventional methods to prepare hierarchical zeolites depend upon the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents and often require multiple synthesis steps with limited product yield and Br&#248;nsted acid concentration. Here, it is shown that the use of MEL&#8208; or MFI&#8208;type zeolites as crystalline seeds induces the spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites, thus avoiding the use of any organic or branching template for the crystallization of these hierarchical structures. The mechanism of formation is evaluated by time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy to provide evidence for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. The resulting hierarchical zeolites have large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance in the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and methanol to hydrocarbons reactions. These findings highlight a facile, commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations and improve the performance of zeolite catalysts.

These findings highlight a facile method to reduce mass-transport limitations in nanoporous zeolites.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional methods to prepare hierarchical zeolites depend upon the use of organic structure-directing agents and often require multiple synthesis steps with limited product yield and Br&#248;nsted acid concentration. Here, it is shown that the use of MEL- or MFI-type zeolites as crystalline seeds induces the spontaneous formation of self-pillared pentasil zeolites, thus avoiding the use of any organic or branching template for the crystallization of these hierarchical structures. The mechanism of formation is evaluated by time-resolved electron microscopy to provide evidence for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. The resulting hierarchical zeolites have large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance in the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and methanol to hydrocarbons reactions. These findings highlight a facile, commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass-transport limitations and improve the performance of zeolite catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Poor Stability of Li2CO3 in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of a Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Revealed by Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium&#8208;metal batteries to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulates lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dictates the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, direct atomic imaging of the SEI's phase components and their spatial arrangement is achieved, using ultralow&#8208;dosage cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The results show that, surprisingly, a lot of the deposited Li metal has amorphous atomic structure, likely due to carbon and oxygen impurities, and that crystalline lithium carbonate is not stable and readily decomposes when contacting the lithium metal. Lithium carbonate distributed in the outer SEI also continuously reacts with the electrolyte to produce gas, resulting in a dynamically evolving and porous SEI. Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the SEI to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulate lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten. The spatial mapping of the SEI gradient amorphous (polymeric &#8594; inorganic &#8594; metallic) and crystalline phase components provides guidance for designing electrolyte additives.

         <title>Crack Programming: From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates (Adv. Mater. 22/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracking is typically an uncontrolled material failure process. In article number 2008434, Hyun Kim, Taylor H. Ware, and co&#8208;workers describe a process that enables unprecedented control of crack formation. By depositing thin&#8208;film chromium on photoaligned liquid&#8208;crystal polymer networks, patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer can be freely programmed in a high&#8208;resolution and high&#8208;throughput manner. This crack programming process provides new opportunities for unconventional microfabrication. The image depicts light transmitted through a polymer film coated with chromium with azimuthally patterned cracks.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2008761, Congxin Xia, Zhongming Wei, and co&#8208;workers describe substitution with lighter elements significantly increasing the bandgap of GaPS4, and simultaneously inheriting its in&#8208;plain anisotropy. GaPS4 thus becomes a promising candidate material for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet and polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. The balance demonstrates the main idea of the cross&#8208;substitution, with edge&#8208;sharing [GeS4]&#8211;[GeS4] atomic packing in the left pan and the tetrahedra centered by lighter elements (Ga and P) forming the [GaS4]&#8211;[PS4] motif in the right pan.

         <title>Superconductivity in Graphene: Observation of Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov States in Superconducting Graphene (Adv. Mater. 22/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene is made superconducting with Pb islands by Iv&#225;n Brihuega and co&#8208;workers, as detailed in article number 2008113. At the same time, magnetic moments are introduced using naturally existing graphene grain boundaries. They show that both superconductivity and magnetism can coexist in graphene, generating exotic Yu&#8211;Shiba&#8211;Rusinov states. Those states provide a starting point to ultimately create graphene topological qubits, putting forward graphene as a potential platform for topological quantum computing.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Properties, and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis, properties, and biomedical applications of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanomaterials are comprehensively reviewed. The problems in the current polyphenol&#8208;based nanosystems and the future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Polyphenols, the phenolic hydroxyl group&#8208;containing organic molecules, are widely found in natural plants and have shown beneficial effects on human health. Recently, polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles have attracted extensive research attention due to their antioxidation property, anticancer activity, and universal adherent affinity, and thus have shown great promise in the preparation, stabilization, and modification of multifunctional nanoassemblies for bioimaging, therapeutic delivery, and other biomedical applications. Additionally, the metal&#8722;polyphenol networks, formed by the coordination interactions between polyphenols and metal ions, have been used to prepare an important class of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles for surface modification, bioimaging, drug delivery, and disease treatments. By focusing on the interactions between polyphenols and different materials (e.g., metal ions, inorganic materials, polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids), a comprehensive review on the synthesis and properties of the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles is provided. Moreover, the remarkable versatility of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles in different biomedical applications, including biodetection, multimodal bioimaging, protein and gene delivery, bone repair, antibiosis, and cancer theranostics is also demonstrated. Finally, the challenges faced by future research regarding the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles are discussed.

         <title>Atomically Thin Quantum Spin Hall Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators&#8212;a class of 2D topological insulators&#8212;promises to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Advances in materials science and engineering are surveyed, alongside a theoretical description, and the future perspectives for electronic applications are discussed, including the quest to realizing Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing&#8212;the next frontier in QSH materials research.








Abstract
Atomically thin topological materials are attracting growing attention for their potential to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Among them is the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator&#8212;a 2D state of matter that arises from interplay of topological band inversion and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, with large tunable bulk bandgaps up to 800 meV and gapless, 1D edge states. Reviewing recent advances in materials science and engineering alongside theoretical description, the QSH materials library is surveyed with focus on the prospects for QSH&#8208;based device applications. In particular, theoretical predictions of nontrivial superconducting pairing in the QSH state toward Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing are discussed, which are the next frontier in QSH materials research.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Biomimetic Cascade Catalysis for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress on the design and construction of biomimetic cascade reaction systems that incorporate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), for signal amplification in biosensing, is summarized. Notably, the mechanisms for the improvement of catalytic activity and selectivity of the MOF&#8208;involving cascade systems are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges and opportunities in the way of the further design and applications of cascade systems with MOFs are briefly put forward.








Abstract
Multiple enzymes&#8208;induced biological cascade catalysis guides efficient and selective substrate transformations in vivo. The biomimetic cascade systems, as ingenious strategies for signal transduction and amplification, have a wide range of applications in biosensing. However, the fragile nature of enzymes greatly limits their wide applications. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures, unique nano/microenvironments, and good biocompatibility have been skillfully used as carriers to immobilize enzymes for shielding them against hash surroundings and improving the catalytic efficiency. For another, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like properties and brilliant stabilities (nanozymes), have been widely applied to ameliorate the low stability of the enzymes. Inheriting the abovementioned merits of MOFs, the performances of MOFs&#8208;immboilized nanozymes could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, in addition to carriers, some MOFs can also serve as nanozymes, expanding their applications in cascade systems. Herein, recent advances in the fabrication of efficient MOFs&#8208;involving enzymes/nanozymes cascade systems and biosensing applications are highlighted. Integrating diversified signal output modes, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, sensitive detection of various targets (including biological molecules, environmental pollutants, enzyme activities, and so on) are realized. Finally, challenges and opportunities about further constructions and applications of MOFs&#8208;involving cascade reaction systems are briefly put forward.

&lt;p&gt;The research progress on the design and construction of biomimetic cascade reaction systems that incorporate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), for signal amplification in biosensing, is summarized. Notably, the mechanisms for the improvement of catalytic activity and selectivity of the MOF-involving cascade systems are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges and opportunities in the way of the further design and applications of cascade systems with MOFs are briefly put forward.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple enzymes-induced biological cascade catalysis guides efficient and selective substrate transformations in vivo. The biomimetic cascade systems, as ingenious strategies for signal transduction and amplification, have a wide range of applications in biosensing. However, the fragile nature of enzymes greatly limits their wide applications. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures, unique nano/microenvironments, and good biocompatibility have been skillfully used as carriers to immobilize enzymes for shielding them against hash surroundings and improving the catalytic efficiency. For another, nanomaterials with enzyme-like properties and brilliant stabilities (nanozymes), have been widely applied to ameliorate the low stability of the enzymes. Inheriting the abovementioned merits of MOFs, the performances of MOFs-immboilized nanozymes could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, in addition to carriers, some MOFs can also serve as nanozymes, expanding their applications in cascade systems. Herein, recent advances in the fabrication of efficient MOFs-involving enzymes/nanozymes cascade systems and biosensing applications are highlighted. Integrating diversified signal output modes, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering, sensitive detection of various targets (including biological molecules, environmental pollutants, enzyme activities, and so on) are realized. Finally, challenges and opportunities about further constructions and applications of MOFs-involving cascade reaction systems are briefly put forward.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Micro&#8208;Bio&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;Systems: Micromotors, Microfluidics, and Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors, microfluidics, and nanozymes originated as independent disciplines&#8212;today, their convergence can help solve each discipline's challenges and lead to essential advantages in bioapplications. Nanozymes significantly expand the scope of chemical reactions and fuels of catalytic micromotors with integrated dynamic responses. Microfluidics is used to mass&#8208;produce micromotors with optimal size, compositions, and core&#8211;shell properties for biomedical imaging and theranostics.








Abstract
Wireless nano&#8208;/micromotors powered by chemical reactions and/or external fields generate motive forces, perform tasks, and significantly extend short&#8208;range dynamic responses of passive biomedical microcarriers. However, before micromotors can be translated into clinical use, several major problems, including the biocompatibility of materials, the toxicity of chemical fuels, and deep tissue imaging methods, must be solved. Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics (e.g., catalase, oxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), that is, nanozymes, can significantly expand the scope of micromotors&#8217; chemical fuels. A convergence of nanozymes, micromotors, and microfluidics can lead to a paradigm shift in the fabrication of multifunctional micromotors in reasonable quantities, encapsulation of desired subsystems, and engineering of FDA&#8208;approved core&#8211;shell structures with tuneable biological, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Microfluidic methods are used to prepare stable bubbles/microbubbles and capsules integrating ultrasound, optoacoustic, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The aim here is to discuss an interdisciplinary approach of three independent emerging topics: micromotors, nanozymes, and microfluidics to creatively: 1) embrace new ideas, 2) think across boundaries, and 3) solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline toward the development of micro&#8208;bio&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical&#8208;systems for diverse bioapplications.

         <title>Interphases, Interfaces, and Surfaces of Active Materials in Rechargeable Batteries and Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces provide reactive zones and interphases stabilize electronic device operation. Understanding and designing interfaces and interphases represents an effective and efficient way for developing high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries and perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for clean sustainable energy has driven tremendous worldwide investment in the design and exploration of new active materials for energy conversion and energy&#8208;storage devices. Tailoring the surfaces of and interfaces between different materials is one of the surest and best studied paths to enable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries and high&#8208;efficiency solar cells. Metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising photovoltaic materials due to their unprecedented development, with their record power conversion efficiency (PCE) rocketing beyond 25% in less than 10 years. Such progress is achieved largely through the control of crystallinity and surface/interface defects. Rechargeable batteries (RBs) reversibly convert electrical and chemical potential energy through redox reactions at the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte. The (electro)chemical and optoelectronic compatibility between active components are essential design considerations to optimize power conversion and energy storage performance. A focused discussion and critical analysis on the formation and functions of the interfaces and interphases of the active materials in these devices is provided, and prospective strategies used to overcome current challenges are described. These strategies revolve around manipulating the chemical compositions, defects, stability, and passivation of the various interfaces of RBs and PSCs.

Abstract
Recent studies of the optical properties of 2D materials have reported unique phenomena and features that are absent in conventional bulk semiconductors. Many of these interesting properties, such as enhanced light&#8208;matter coupling, gate&#8208;tunable photoluminescence, and unusual excitonic optical selection rules arise from the nature of the two&#8208; and multi&#8208;particle excited states such as strongly bound Wannier excitons and charged excitons. The theory, modeling, and ab initio calculations of these optically excited states in 2D materials are reviewed. Several analytical and ab initio approaches are introduced. These methods are compared with each other, revealing their relative strength and limitations. Recent works that apply these methods to a variety of 2D materials and material&#8208;defect systems are then highlighted. Understanding of the optically excited states in these systems is relevant not only for fundamental scientific research of electronic excitations and correlations, but also plays an important role in the future development of quantum information science and nano&#8208;photonics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 22, June 3, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since 2000, researchers at University of Washington have significantly contributed to the study of organic semiconductors, providing new scientific insights and breaking records. The ideas and experiences that have been gained along the way are summarized and reflected upon, and through this reflection insights are offered into future directions.








Abstract
Research at the University of Washington regarding organic semiconductors is reviewed, covering four major topics: electro&#8208;optics, organic light emitting diodes, organic field&#8208;effect transistors, and organic solar cells. Underlying principles of materials design are demonstrated along with efforts toward unlocking the full potential of organic semiconductors. Finally, opinions on future research directions are presented, with a focus on commercial competency, environmental sustainability, and scalability of organic&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based devices.

&lt;p&gt;Research at the University of Washington regarding organic semiconductors is reviewed, covering four major topics: electro-optics, organic light emitting diodes, organic field-effect transistors, and organic solar cells. Underlying principles of materials design are demonstrated along with efforts toward unlocking the full potential of organic semiconductors. Finally, opinions on future research directions are presented, with a focus on commercial competency, environmental sustainability, and scalability of organic-semiconductor-based devices.&lt;/p&gt;
