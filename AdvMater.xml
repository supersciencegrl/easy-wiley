      <title>A High&#8208;Performance Carbonate&#8208;Free Lithium|Garnet Interface Enabled by a Trace Amount of Sodium</title>
      <dc:description>
The lithium|garnet interface challenge is addressed by melt&#8208;casting 0.5 wt% sodium&#8208;doped lithium onto a garnet electrolyte surface. The doped lithium melt phase&#8208;transfers the Li2CO3 from the grain boundaries of the garnet electrolyte pellet surface to the top of the doped lithium melt and therefore facilitates the wetting process.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising for the realization of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries. However, a critical issue associated with the garnet electrolytes is the poor physical contact between the Li anode and the garnet SSE and the resultant high interfacial resistance. Here, it is reported that the Li|garnet interface challenge can be addressed by using Li metal doped with 0.5 wt% Na (denoted as Li*) and melt&#8208;casting the Li* onto the garnet SSE surface. A mechanistic study, using Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) as a model SSE, reveals that Li2CO3 resides within the grain boundaries of newly polished LLZTO pellet, which is difficult to remove and hinders the wetting process. The Li* melt can phase&#8208;transfer the Li2CO3 from the LLZTO grain boundary to the Li*&#8217;s top surface, and therefore facilitates the wetting process. The obtained Li*|LLZTO demonstrates a low interfacial resistance, high rate capability, and long cycle life, and can find applications in future all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (e.g., Li*|LLZTO|LiFePO4).

      <title>Giant Piezospintronic Effect in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Metal</title>
      <dc:description>
A giant piezospintronic effect is discovered in a hexagonal noncollinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Ga. Furthermore, it is found that its Fermi surface and density of states are very sensitive to the spin structure perturbation. Consequently, a nanoscale antiferromagnetic tunnel junction built on Mn3Ga and operated by piezoelectric strain exhibits a more than 10% tunneling resistance modulation at room temperature.








Abstract
One of the main bottleneck issues for room&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic spintronic devices is the small signal read&#8208;out owing to the limited anisotropic magnetoresistance in antiferromagnets. However, this could be overcome by either utilizing the Berry&#8208;curvature&#8208;induced anomalous Hall resistance in noncollinear antiferromagnets or establishing tunnel&#8208;junction devices based on effective manipulation of antiferromagnetic spins. In this work, the giant piezoelectric strain modulation of the spin structure and the anomalous Hall resistance in a noncollinear antiferromagnetic metal&#8212;D019 hexagonal Mn3Ga&#8212;is demonstrated. Furthermore, tunnel&#8208;junction devices are built with a diameter of 200 nm to amplify the maximum tunneling resistance ratio to more than 10% at room&#8208;temperature, which thus implies significant potential of noncollinear antiferromagnets for large signal&#8208;output and high&#8208;density antiferromagnetic spintronic device applications.

      <title>Efficient Nitrate Synthesis via Ambient Nitrogen Oxidation with Ru&#8208;Doped TiO2/RuO2 Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel Ru&#8208;doped TiO2/RuO2 composite catalyst is designed and applied to the electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction, which enables the efficient conversion of nitrogen gas to aqueous nitrate under ambient condition. The optimized Ru&#8208;doped TiO2/RuO2 catalyst shows a considerable nitrate yield rate of 161.9 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 and a highest nitrate Faradaic efficiency of 26.1%.








Abstract
A facile pathway of the electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitrate is proposed, and Ru&#8208;doped TiO2/RuO2 (abbreviated as Ru/TiO2) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst is employed accordingly. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that Ru&#948;+ can function as the main active center for the NOR process. Remarkably doping Ru into the TiO2 lattice can induce an upshift of the d&#8208;band center of the Ru site, resulting in enhanced activity for accelerating electrochemical conversion of inert N2 to active NO*. Overdoping of Ru ions will lead to the formation of additional RuO2 on the TiO2 surface, which provides oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active sites for promoting the redox transformation of the NO* intermediate to nitrate. However, too much RuO2 in the catalyst is detrimental to both the selectivity of the NOR and the Faradaic efficiency due to the dominant OER process. Experimentally, a considerable nitrate yield rate of 161.9 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 (besides, a total nitrate yield of 47.9 &#181;g during 50 h) and a highest nitrate Faradaic efficiency of 26.1% are achieved by the Ru/TiO2 catalyst (with the hybrid composition of RuxTiyO2 and extra RuO2 by 2.79 wt% Ru addition amount) in 0.1 m Na2SO4 electrolyte.

      <title>Graded 2D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure for Efficient and Operationally Stable MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
The efficiency and operational stability of MA&#8208;free FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 perovskite solar cells can be simultaneously enhanced by the incorporation of the &#946;&#8208;guanidinopropionic acid (&#946;&#8208;GUA) molecule. The introduction of &#946;&#8208;GUA forms a 2D/3D hybrid perovskite phase, which effectively passivates the surface defects, resulting in an impressive power conversion efficiency of 22.2% with a substantial increase in Voc (from 1.01 to 1.14 V).








Abstract
Almost all highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of greater than 22% currently contain the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. MA&#8208;free perovskites are an intrinsically more stable optoelectronic material for use in solar cells but compromise the performance of PVSCs with relatively large energy loss. Here, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) deficit is circumvented by the incorporation of &#946;&#8208;guanidinopropionic acid (&#946;&#8208;GUA) molecules into an MA&#8208;free bulk perovskite, which facilitates the formation of quasi&#8208;2D structure with face&#8208;on orientation. The 2D/3D hybrid perovskites embed at the grain boundaries of the 3D bulk perovskites and are distributed through half the thickness of the film, which effectively passivates defects and minimizes energy loss of the PVSCs through reduced charge recombination rates and enhanced charge extraction efficiencies. A PCE of 22.2% (certified efficiency of 21.5%) is achieved and the operational stability of the MA&#8208;free PVSCs is improved.

Platelets are genetically engineered to overexpress programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) to maintain immune tolerance in the pancreas and reverse the new&#8208;onset Type 1 diabetes in non&#8208;obese diabetic (NOD) mice. The PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing platelets may suppress the activity of pancreas autoreactive T cells and increase the percentage of the regulatory T cells in newly hyperglycemic NOD mice, protecting the insulin&#8208;producing &#946;&#8208;cells from destruction.








Abstract
The pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises from the destruction of insulin&#8208;producing &#946;&#8208;cells by islet&#8208;specific autoreactive T cells. Inhibition of islet&#8208;specific autoreactive T cells to rescue &#946;&#8208;cells is a promising approach to treat new&#8208;onset T1D. The immune checkpoint signal axis programmed death&#8208;1/programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) can effectively regulate the activity of T cells and prevent autoimmune attack. Here, megakaryocyte progenitor cells are genetically engineered to overexpress PD&#8208;L1 to produce immunosuppressive platelets. The PD&#8208;L1&#8208;overexpressing platelets (designated PD&#8208;L1 platelets) accumulate in the inflamed pancreas and may suppress the activity of pancreas autoreactive T cells in newly hyperglycemic non&#8208;obese diabetic (NOD) mice, protecting the insulin&#8208;producing &#946;&#8208;cells from destruction. Moreover, PD&#8208;L1 platelet treatment also increases the percentage of the regulatory T cells (Tregs) and maintains immune tolerance in the pancreas. It is demonstrated that the rescue of &#946;&#8208;cells by PD&#8208;L1 platelets can effectively maintain normoglycemia and reverse diabetes in newly hyperglycemic NOD mice.

      <title>Regulating the Interfacial Electronic Coupling of Fe2N via Orbital Steering for Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
The interfacial electronic coupling between Fe2N and H* can be effectively tuned by nitrogen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced orbital steering. Moreover, real&#8208;time X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure studies indicate that the O&#63743;H cleavage that originates from the ionic hydration effect can also affect the acidic hydrogen evolution kinetics. The capability of manipulating the interfacial electronic coupling provides new opportunities to achieve on&#8208;demand functionalities of catalysts.








Abstract
The capability of manipulating the interfacial electronic coupling is the key to achieving on&#8208;demand functionalities of catalysts. Herein, it is demonstrated that the electronic coupling of Fe2N can be effectively regulated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysis by vacancy&#8208;mediated orbital steering. Ex situ refined structural analysis reveals that the electronic and coordination states of Fe2N can be well manipulated by nitrogen vacancies, which impressively exhibit strong correlation with the catalytic activities. Theoretical studies further indicate that the nitrogen vacancy can uniquely steer the orbital orientation of the active sites to tailor the electronic coupling and thus benefit the surface adsorption capability. This work sheds light on the understanding of the catalytic mechanism in real systems and could contribute to revolutionizing the current catalyst design for HER and beyond.

      <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Conformal Hybrid Electrodes for Aquatic Endurable Electrocardiographic Monitoring</title>
      <dc:description>
Water&#8208;resistant stretchable electrodes are fabricated with a specially designed polymer. The polymer is adhesive underwater to bridge the electrode and skin, and ionic&#8208;conductive to transmit electrophysiological signals. The conformal electrodes realize reliable electrocardiography (ECG) detection when moving the body or being impacted with water flow, which enables stable wireless real&#8208;time ECG collection during swimming with a wearable device.








Abstract
Underwater vital signs monitoring of respiratory rate, blood pressure, and the heart's status is essential for healthcare and sports management. Real&#8208;time electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring underwater can be one solution for this. However, the current electrodes used for ECGs are not suitable for aquatic applications since they may lose their adhesiveness to skin, stable conductivity, or/and structural stability when immersed into water. Here, the design and fabrication of water&#8208;resistant electrodes to repurpose stretchable electrodes for applications in an aquatic environment are reported. The electrodes are composed of stretchable metal&#8211;polymer composite film as the substrate and dopamine&#8208;containing polymer as a coating. The polymer is designed to possess underwater adhesiveness from the dopamine motif, water stability from the main scaffold, and ionic conductivity from the carboxyl groups for signal transmission. Stable underwater conductivity and firm adhesion to skin allow the electrodes to collect reliable ECG signals under various conditions in water. It is shown that wearable devices incorporated with the water&#8208;resistant electrodes can acquire real&#8208;time ECG signals during swimming, which can be used for revealing the heart condition. These water&#8208;resistant electrodes realize underwater detection of ECG signals and can be used for health monitoring and sports management during aquatic activities.

      <title>Controlling Crystal Growth via an Autonomously Longitudinal Scaffold for Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
An autonomously longitudinal scaffold constructed by the interspersion of in situ polymerized methyl methacrylate in PbI2 is introduced to effectively eliminate the dependence of sequential deposition on mesoporous TiO2, and is applied in planar perovskite solar cells, with excellent performance. Moreover, this scaffold's cross&#8208;linking grains are capable of releasing mechanical stress, impeding ion migration, and water/oxygen permeation.








Abstract
Sequential deposition is certified as an effective technology to obtain high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), which can be derivatized into large&#8208;scale industrial production. However, dense lead iodide (PbI2) causes incomplete reaction and unsatisfactory solution utilization of perovskite in planar PVSCs without mesoporous titanium dioxide as a support. Here, a novel autonomously longitudinal scaffold constructed by the interspersion of in situ self&#8208;polymerized methyl methacrylate (sMMA) in PbI2 is introduced to fabricate efficient PVSCs with excellent flexural endurance and environmental adaptability. By this strategy perovskite solution can be confined within an organic scaffold with vertical crystal growth promoted, effectively inhibiting exciton accumulation and recombination at grain boundaries. Additionally, sMMA cross&#8208;linked perovskite network can release mechanical stress and occupy the main channels for ion migration and water/oxygen permeation to significantly improve operational stability, which opens up a new strategy for the commercial development of large&#8208;area PVSCs in flexible electronics.

Abstract
Rechargeable lithium metal batteries are next generation energy storage devices with high energy density, but face challenges in achieving high energy density, high safety, and long cycle life. Here, lithium metal batteries in a novel nonflammable ionic&#8208;liquid (IL) electrolyte composed of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (EMIm) cations and high&#8208;concentration bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI) anions, with sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) as a key additive are reported. The Na ion participates in the formation of hybrid passivation interphases and contributes to dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition and reversible cathode electrochemistry. The electrolyte of low viscosity allows practically useful cathode mass loading up to &#8776;16 mg cm&#8722;2. Li anodes paired with lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) and lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM 811) cathodes exhibit 99.6&#8211;99.9% Coulombic efficiencies, high discharge voltages up to 4.4 V, high specific capacity and energy density up to &#8776;199 mAh g&#8722;1 and &#8776;765 Wh kg&#8722;1 respectively, with impressive cycling performances over up to 1200 cycles. Highly stable passivation interphases formed on both electrodes in the novel IL electrolyte are the key to highly reversible lithium metal batteries, especially for Li&#8211;NMC 811 full batteries.

A lipid&#8208;nanopillar&#8208;array&#8208;based immunosorbent assay (LNAIA) is developed for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of viruses. 3D nanopillar array structures and fluid antibodies with fluorophores on the LNAIA platform facilitate efficient, fast target binding and fluorophore localization for detecting as low as 150 viruses with five&#8208;order dynamic range on a conventional fluorescence microscopy setup.








Abstract
Since infectious diseases, particularly viral infections, have threatened human health and caused huge economical losses globally, a rapid, sensitive, and selective virus detection platform is highly demanded. Enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with flat solid substrates has been dominantly used in detecting whole viruses for its straightforwardness and simplicity in assay protocols, but it often suffers from limited sensitivity, poor quantification range, and a time&#8208;consuming assay procedure. Here, a lipid&#8208;nanopillar&#8208;array&#8208;based immunosorbent assay (LNAIA) is developed with a nanopillar&#8208;supported lipid bilayer substrate with fluorophore&#8208;modified antibodies for rapid, sensitive, and quantitative detection of viruses. 3D nanopillar array structures and fluid antibodies with fluorophores facilitate faster and efficient target binding and rapid fluorophore localization for quick, reliable analysis on binding events with a conventional fluorescence microscopy setup. LNAIA enables quantification of H1N1 virus that targets down to 150 virus particles with 5&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude dynamic range within 25 min, which cannot be achieved with conventional ELISA platforms.

      <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Assisted Surface Matrix Engineering for Highly Efficient Perovskite Quantum Dot Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;assisted matrix to regulate surface and packing states of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) is demonstrated, which involves a ligand exchange and a mild thermal annealing process that are triggered by guanidinium thiocyanate. Consequently, the CsPbI3 QD solar cells (QDSCs) deliver a champion power conversion efficiency of 15.21%, which is the highest report among all CsPbI3 QDSCs.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (Pe&#8208;QDs) are of great interest in new&#8208;generation photovoltaics (PVs). However, it remains challenging in the construction of conductive and intact Pe&#8208;QD films to maximize their functionality. Herein, a ligand&#8208;assisted surface matrix strategy to engineer the surface and packing states of Pe&#8208;QD solids is demonstrated by a mild thermal annealing treatment after ligand exchange processing (referred to as &#8220;LE&#8208;TA&#8221;) triggered by guanidinium thiocyanate. The &#8220;LE&#8208;TA&#8221; method induces the formation of surface matrix on CsPbI3 QDs, which is dominated by the cationic guanidinium (GA+) rather than the SCN&#8722;, maintaining the intact cubic structure and facilitating interparticle electrical interaction of QD solids. Consequently, the GA&#8208;matrix&#8208;confined CsPbI3 QDs exhibit remarkably enhanced charge mobility and carrier diffusion length compared to control ones, leading to a champion power conversion efficiency of 15.21% when assembled in PVs, which is one of the highest among all Pe&#8208;QD solar cells. Additionally, the &#8220;LE&#8208;TA&#8221; method shows similar effects when applied to other Pe&#8208;QD PV systems like CsPbBr3 and FAPbI3 (FA = formamidinium), indicating its versatility in regulating the surfaces of various Pe&#8208;QDs. This work may afford new guidelines to construct electrically conductive and structurally intact Pe&#8208;QD solids for efficient optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Quasi&#8208;Binary Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Alloys: Thermodynamic Stability Prediction, Scalable Synthesis, and Application</title>
      <dc:description>
A theory&#8208;guided synthesis approach is employed to achieve unexplored quasi&#8208;binary TMDC alloys through computationally predicted stability maps. The synthesized alloys can be exfoliated into 2D&#8208;structures, and some of them exhibit: i) outstanding thermal stability tested up to 1230 K, ii) exceptionally high electrochemical activity for CO2 reduction reaction, iii) excellent energy efficiency in a high&#8208;rate Li&#8211;air battery, and iv) high break&#8208;down current&#8208;density.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) alloys could have a wide range of physical and chemical properties, ranging from charge density waves to superconductivity and electrochemical activities. While many exciting behaviors of unary TMDCs have been demonstrated, the vast compositional space of TMDC alloys has remained largely unexplored due to the lack of understanding regarding their stability when accommodating different cations or chalcogens in a single&#8208;phase. Here, a theory&#8208;guided synthesis approach is reported to achieve unexplored quasi&#8208;binary TMDC alloys through computationally predicted stability maps. Equilibrium temperature&#8211;composition phase diagrams using first&#8208;principles calculations are generated to identify the stability of 25 quasi&#8208;binary TMDC alloys, including some involving non&#8208;isovalent cations and are verified experimentally through the synthesis of a subset of 12 predicted alloys using a scalable chemical vapor transport method. It is demonstrated that the synthesized alloys can be exfoliated into 2D structures, and some of them exhibit: i) outstanding thermal stability tested up to 1230 K, ii) exceptionally high electrochemical activity for the CO2 reduction reaction in a kinetically limited regime with near zero overpotential for CO formation, iii) excellent energy efficiency in a high rate Li&#8211;air battery, and iv) high break&#8208;down current density for interconnect applications. This framework can be extended to accelerate the discovery of other TMDC alloys for various applications.

      <title>Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Enhanced Light Absorption in AuCu/CsPbCl3 Core/Shell Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
A colloidal process is developed for synthesis of monodispersed AuCu/CsPbCl3 core/shell perovskite nanocrystals in which an all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbCl3 crystalline shell forms through heteroepitaxy on a AuCu crystalline core that exhibits strong localized surface plasmonic response. This core/shell structure enables a highly efficient plasmon&#8211;exciton coupling, resulting in enhancement of 5&#8211;7 times in photoluminescence and 33 times in photoresponse.








Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is shown to be effective in trapping light for enhanced light absorption and hence performance in photonic and optoelectronic devices. Implementation of LSPR in all&#8208;inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) is particularly important considering their unique advantages in optoelectronics. Motivated by this, the first success in colloidal synthesis of AuCu/CsPbCl3 core/shell PNCs and observation of enhanced light absorption by the perovskite CsPbCl3 shell of thickness in the range of 2&#8211;4 nm, enabled by the LSPR AuCu core of an average diameter of 7.1 nm, is reported. This enhanced light absorption leads to a remarkably enhanced photoresponse in PNCs/graphene nanohybrid photodetectors using the AuCu/CsPbCl3 core/shell PNCs, by more than 30 times as compared to the counterparts with CsPbCl3 PNCs only (8&#8211;12 nm in dimension). This result illustrates the feasibility in implementation of LSPR light trapping directly in core/shell PNCs for high&#8208;performance optoelectronics.

      <title>Bioinspired Soft Microrobots with Precise Magneto&#8208;Collective Control for Microvascular Thrombolysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A biomimetic magnetic microrobot inspired by the highly organized magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria shows speedy motion capacity and accurate positioning in a low&#8208;Reynolds&#8208;number biofluid. The microrobot enables delivery and release of drug molecules via a magneto&#8208;collective manner for microvascular thrombolysis, making ultra&#8208;minimal invasive surgery and drug delivery promising.








Abstract
New&#8208;era soft microrobots for biomedical applications need to mimic the essential structures and collective functions of creatures from nature. Biocompatible interfaces, intelligent functionalities, and precise locomotion control in a collective manner are the key parameters to design soft microrobots for the complex bio&#8208;environment. In this work, a biomimetic magnetic microrobot (BMM) inspired by magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) with speedy motion response and accurate positioning is developed for targeted thrombolysis. Similar to the magnetosome structure in MTB, the BMM is composed of aligned iron oxide nanoparticle (MNP) chains embedded in a non&#8208;swelling microgel shell. Linear chains in BMMs are achieved due to the interparticle dipolar interactions of MNPs under a static magnetic field. Simulation results show that, the degree and speed of assembly is proportional to the field strength. The BMM achieves the maximum speed of 161.7 &#181;m s&#8722;1 and accurate positioning control under a rotating magnetic field with less than 4% deviation. Importantly, the locomotion analyses of BMMs demonstrate the frequency&#8208;dependent synchronization under 8 Hz and asynchronization at higher frequencies due to the increased drag torque. The BMMs can deliver and release thrombolytic drugs via magneto&#8208;collective control, which is promising for ultra&#8208;minimal invasive thrombolysis.

Abstract
Boosted by the success of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) manufactured by conventional processes in various applications, the development of HEAs for 3D printing has been advancing rapidly in recent years. 3D printing of HEAs gives rise to a great potential for manufacturing geometrically complex HEA products with desirable performances, thereby inspiring their increased appearance in industrial applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of the recent achievements of 3D printing of HEAs is provided, in the aspects of their powder development, printing processes, microstructures, properties, and potential applications. It begins with the introduction of the fundamentals of 3D printing and HEAs, as well as the unique properties of 3D&#8208;printed HEA products. The processes for the development of HEA powders, including atomization and mechanical alloying, and the powder properties, are then presented. Thereafter, typical processes for printing HEA products from powders, namely, directed energy deposition, selective laser melting, and electron beam melting, are discussed with regard to the phases, crystal features, mechanical properties, functionalities, and potential applications of these products (particularly in the aerospace, energy, molding, and tooling industries). Finally, perspectives are outlined to provide guidance for future research.

      <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Full&#8208;Dimensional Manipulation of Optical Waves with Chiral Mirror</title>
      <dc:description>
A new design principle of chiral mirrors is proposed to realize full&#8208;dimensional independent manipulation of circular&#8208;polarized waves. By simply changing three structural variables of the chiral mirrors, the proposed design principle can arbitrarily and independently empower the spin&#8208;selective manipulation of amplitude, phase, and operation wavelength of circular&#8208;polarized waves with a large modulation depth.








Abstract
Realizing arbitrary manipulation of optical waves, which still remains a challenge, plays a key role in the implementation of optical devices with on&#8208;demand functionalities. However, it is hard to independently manipulate multiple dimensions of optical waves because the optical dimensions are basically associated with each other when adjusting the optical response of the devices. Here, the concise design principle of a chiral mirror is utilized to realize the full&#8208;dimensional independent manipulation of circular&#8208;polarized waves. By simply changing three structural variables of the chiral mirror, the proposed design principle can arbitrarily and independently empower the spin&#8208;selective manipulation of amplitude, phase, and operation wavelength of circular&#8208;polarized waves with a large modulation depth. This approach provides a simple solution for the realization of spin&#8208;selective full&#8208;dimensional manipulation of optical waves and shows ample application possibilities in the areas of optical encryption, imaging, and detection.

      <title>A Bottom&#8208;Up Strategy for the Synthesis of Highly Siliceous Faujasite&#8208;Type Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica zeolite Y with tunable SiO2/Al2O3 ratio up to 15.6 is synthesized through a cooperative strategy that involves the use of FAU nuclei, a bulky organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA), and a gel system with low alkalinity. The obtained materials show greatly improved (hydro)thermal stability, high concentration of strong acid sites, and superior catalytic cracking performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;silica zeolite Y is a desired catalytic material for oil refining and the petrochemical industry. However, its direct synthesis remains a symbolic challenge in the field of zeolite synthesis, with a limited improvement of the framework SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (SAR) from &#8776;5 to 9 over the past 60 years. Here, the synthesis of highly siliceous zeolite Y with tunable SAR up to 15.6 through a cooperative strategy is reported, which involves the use of FAU nuclei, a bulky organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA), and a gel system with low alkalinity (named NOA&#8208;co strategy). A series of quaternary alkylammonium ions is discovered as effective OSDAs based on the NOA&#8208;co strategy, and the relevant crystallization mechanism is elucidated. Moreover, the high&#8208;silica products are demonstrated to have greatly improved (hydro)thermal stability, high concentration of strong acid sites, and uniform acid distribution, which lead to superior catalytic performance in the cracking of bulky hydrocarbons. It is anticipated that this synthetic strategy will benefit the synthesis and development of zeolitic catalysts in a wide range of reaction processes.

      <title>Tuning the Kinetics of Zinc&#8208;Ion Insertion/Extraction in V2O5 by In Situ Polyaniline Intercalation Enables Improved Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
An in situ polyaniline (PANI) intercalation strategy is developed to facilitate the Zn2+ (de)intercalation kinetics in V2O5. PANI not only expands the diffusion channels for facilitating Zn2+ diffusion but also maintains the structural stability as interlayer pillars. Especially, its unique &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, serving as electron&#8208;reservoir, simultaneously shields the electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ and V2O5 host.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as a promising alternative for Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the developed cathodes suffer from sluggish Zn2+ diffusion kinetics, leading to poor rate capability and inadequate cycle life. Herein, an in situ polyaniline (PANI) intercalation strategy is developed to facilitate the Zn2+ (de)intercalation kinetics in V2O5. In this way, a remarkably enlarged interlayer distance (13.90 &#197;) can be constructed alternatively between the V&#63743;O layers, offering expediting channels for facile Zn2+ diffusion. Importantly, the electrostatic interactions between the Zn2+ and the host O2&#8722;, which is another key factor in hindering the Zn2+ diffusion kinetics, can be effectively blocked by the unique &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of PANI. As a result, the PANI&#8208;intercalated V2O5 exhibits a stable and highly reversible electrochemical reaction during repetitive Zn2+ insertion and extraction, as demonstrated by in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman studies. Further first&#8208;principles calculations clearly reveal a remarkably lowered binding energy between Zn2+ and host O2&#8722;, which explains the favorable kinetics in PANI&#8208;intercalated V2O5. Benefitting from the above, the overall electrochemical performance of PANI&#8208;intercalated V2O5 electrode is remarkable improved, exhibiting excellent high rate capability of 197.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at current density of 20 A g&#8722;1 with capacity retention of 97.6% over 2000 cycles.

The breakthrough provides new research opportunities to study multipiezo and piezo&#8208;photonic materials, and to explore their potential as novel ultrasensitive probes for deep&#8208;imaging of stress distributions in diverse materials and structures (on&#8208;site, in vivo, etc.).








Abstract
Ultrasensitive and sustainable near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting piezoluminescence is observed from noncentrosymmetric and ferroelectric&#8208;phase Sr3Sn2O7 doped with rare earth Nd3+ ions. Sr3Sn2O7:Nd3+ (SSN) with polar A21am structure is demonstrated to emit piezoluminescence of wavelength of 800&#8211;1500 nm at microstrain levels, which is enhanced by the ferroelectrically polarized charges in the multipiezo material. These discoveries provide new research opportunities to study luminescence properties of multipiezo and piezo&#8208;photonic materials, and to explore their potential as novel ultrasensitive probes for deep&#8208;imaging of stress distributions in diverse materials and structures including artificial bone and other implanted structures (in vivo, in situ, etc).

      <title>Continuous &#8220;Snowing&#8221; Thermotherapeutic Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
A continuous and scalable &#8220;snowing&#8221; process for preparation of graphene with high quality and high purity is demonstrated. Based on the intrinsic characteristics of this graphene, in particular the low&#8208;frequency microwave absorption property and good thermal transformation ability, a graphene&#8208;based combination therapeutic system for microwave thermal therapy is achieved.








Abstract
Finding the best applications of graphene, and the continuous and scalable preparation of graphene with high quality and high purity, are still two major challenges. Herein, a &#8220;pulse&#8208;etched&#8221; microwave&#8208;induced &#8220;snowing&#8221; (PEMIS) process is developed for continuous and scalable preparation of high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;purity graphene directly in the gas phase, which is found to have excellent thermotherapeutic effects. The obtained graphene exhibits small size (&#8776;180 nm), high quality, low oxygen content, and high purity, together with a high gas&#8211;solid conversion efficiency of &#8776;10.46%. Considering the intrinsic characteristics of this high&#8208;purity and small&#8208;sized biocompatible graphene, in particular the low&#8208;frequency microwave absorption property as well as the good thermal transformation ability, a graphene&#8208;based combination therapeutic system is demonstrated for microwave thermal therapy (MTT) for the first time, exhibiting a high tumor ablation rate of &#8776;86.7%. This is different from the principle of ions vibrating in a confined space used by current MTT sensitization materials. Not limited to this application, it is foreseen that this PEMIS&#8208;based high&#8208;quality graphene will allow the search for further suitable applications of graphene.

      <title>On the Mechanistic Understanding of Photovoltage Loss in Iron Pyrite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron pyrite (FeS2) is predicted to be the lowest&#8208;cost material for solar electricity production. However, its solar energy conversion efficiency is below 3% because of low photovoltage (&lt;0.2 V). The photovoltage loss mechanisms associated with FeS2 as absorber materials in solar cell applications are discussed, followed by recommendation for future research.








Abstract
Considering the natural abundance, the optoelectronic properties, and the electricity production cost, iron pyrite (FeS2) has a strong appeal as a solar cell material. The maximum conversion efficiency of FeS2 solar cells demonstrated to date, however, is below 3%, which is significantly below the theoretical efficiency limit of 25%. This poor conversion efficiency is mainly the result of the poor photovoltage, which has never exceeded 0.2 V with a device having appreciable photocurrent. Several studies have explored the origin of the low photovoltage in FeS2 solar cells, and have improved understanding of the photovoltage loss mechanisms. Fermi level pinning, surface inversion, ionization of bulk donor states, and photocarrier loss have been suggested as the underlying reasons for the photovoltage loss in FeS2. Given the past and more recent scientific data, together with contradictory results to some extent, it is timely to discuss these mechanisms to give an updated view of the present status and remaining challenges. Herein, the current understanding of the origin of low photovoltage in FeS2 solar cells is critically reviewed, preceded by a succinct discussion on the electronic structure and optoelectronic properties. Finally, suggestions of a few research directions are also presented.

      <title>Viewpoint: Homeostasis as Inspiration&#8212;Toward Interactive Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Homeostasis provides a framework for thinking about how to design synthetic materials that combine resilience with highly diverse interactive behaviors. Fundamental to both are building blocks of &#8220;mini&#8208;homeostasis&#8221;: feedback loops in which one component responds to a stimulus and another opposes the response.

Abstract
Homeostatic systems combine an ability to maintain integrity over time with an incredible capacity for interactive behavior. Fundamental to such systems are building blocks of &#8220;mini&#8208;homeostasis&#8221;: feedback loops in which one component responds to a stimulus and another opposes the response, pushing the module to restore its original configuration. Particularly when they cross time and length scales, perturbation of these loops by external changes can generate diverse and complex phenomena. Here, it is proposed that by recognizing and implementing mini&#8208;homeostatic modules&#8212;often composed of very different physical and chemical processes&#8212;into synthetic materials, numerous interactive behaviors can be obtained, opening avenues for designing multifunctional materials. How a variety of controlled, nontrivial material responses can be evoked from even simple versions of such synthetic feedback modules is illustrated. Moreover, random events causing seemingly random responses give insights into how one can further explore, understand and control the full interaction space. Ultimately, material fabrication and exploration of interactivity become inseparable in the rational design of such materials. Homeostasis provides a lens through which one can learn how to combine and perturb coupled processes across time and length scales to conjure up exciting behaviors for new materials that are both robust and interactive.

      <title>The Many Ways to Assemble Nanoparticles Using Light</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress in controlling the self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles using light is reviewed. The diverse examples reported so far are critically compared with one another and categorized into six distinct approaches.








Abstract
The ability to reversibly assemble nanoparticles using light is both fundamentally interesting and important for applications ranging from reversible data storage to controlled drug delivery. Here, the diverse approaches that have so far been developed to control the self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles using light are reviewed and compared. These approaches include functionalizing nanoparticles with monolayers of photoresponsive molecules, placing them in photoresponsive media capable of reversibly protonating the particles under light, and decorating plasmonic nanoparticles with thermoresponsive polymers, to name just a few. The applicability of these methods to larger, micrometer&#8208;sized particles is also discussed. Finally, several perspectives on further developments in the field are offered.

The main discussion is focused on the structures of these COMs and their structure&#8211;function relationships.

Abstract
Supramolecular macrocycles are well known as guest receptors in supramolecular chemistry, especially host&#8722;guest chemistry. In addition to their wide applications in host&#8722;guest chemistry and related areas, macrocycles have also been employed to construct crystalline organic materials (COMs) owing to their particular structures that combine both rigidity and adaptivity. There are two main types of supramolecular&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;based COMs: those constructed from macrocycles themselves and those prepared from macrocycles with other organic linkers. This review summarizes recent developments in supramolecular&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;based COMs, which are categorized by various types of macrocycles, including cyclodextrins, calixarenes, resorcinarenes, pyrogalloarenes, cucurbiturils, pillararenes, and others. Effort is made to focus on the structures of supramolecular&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;based COMs and their structure&#8211;function relationships. In addition, the application of supramolecular&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;based COMs in gas storage or separation, molecular separation, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, proton conduction, iodine capture, water or environmental treatment, etc., are also presented. Finally, perspectives and future challenges in the field of supramolecular&#8208;macrocycle&#8208;based COMs are discussed.

      <title>Photoactivated Artificial Molecular Machines that Can Perform Tasks</title>
      <dc:description>
Artificial molecular machines powered by light can nowadays be integrated in organized environments such that the molecular movements can be harnessed to execute a task. The resulting functional devices and materials can lead to radical innovation in catalysis, microfluidics soft robotics, medical diagnostics and therapy, and solar energy conversion.








Abstract
Research on artificial photoactivated molecular machines has moved in recent years from a basic scientific endeavor toward a more applicative effort. Nowadays, the prospect of reproducing the operation of natural nanomachines with artificial counterparts is no longer a dream but a concrete possibility. The progress toward the construction of molecular&#8208;machine&#8208;based devices and materials in which light irradiation results in the execution of a task as a result of nanoscale movements is illustrated here. After a brief description of a few basic types of photoactivated molecular machines, significant examples of their exploitation to perform predetermined functions are presented. These include switchable catalysts, nanoactuators that interact with cellular membranes, transporters of small molecular cargos, and active joints capable of mechanically coupling molecular&#8208;scale movements. Investigations aimed at harnessing the collective operation of a multitude of molecular machines organized in arrays to perform tasks at the microscale and macroscale in hard and soft materials are also reviewed. Surfaces, gels, liquid crystals, polymers, and self&#8208;assembled nanostructures are described wherein the nanoscale movement of embedded molecular machines is amplified, allowing the realization of muscle&#8208;like actuators, microfluidic devices, and polymeric materials for light energy transduction and storage.

     alt="Photoactivated Artificial Molecular Machines that Can Perform Tasks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial molecular machines powered by light can nowadays be integrated in organized environments such that the molecular movements can be harnessed to execute a task. The resulting functional devices and materials can lead to radical innovation in catalysis, microfluidics soft robotics, medical diagnostics and therapy, and solar energy conversion.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on artificial photoactivated molecular machines has moved in recent years from a basic scientific endeavor toward a more applicative effort. Nowadays, the prospect of reproducing the operation of natural nanomachines with artificial counterparts is no longer a dream but a concrete possibility. The progress toward the construction of molecular&#8208;machine&#8208;based devices and materials in which light irradiation results in the execution of a task as a result of nanoscale movements is illustrated here. After a brief description of a few basic types of photoactivated molecular machines, significant examples of their exploitation to perform predetermined functions are presented. These include switchable catalysts, nanoactuators that interact with cellular membranes, transporters of small molecular cargos, and active joints capable of mechanically coupling molecular&#8208;scale movements. Investigations aimed at harnessing the collective operation of a multitude of molecular machines organized in arrays to perform tasks at the microscale and macroscale in hard and soft materials are also reviewed. Surfaces, gels, liquid crystals, polymers, and self&#8208;assembled nanostructures are described wherein the nanoscale movement of embedded molecular machines is amplified, allowing the realization of muscle&#8208;like actuators, microfluidic devices, and polymeric materials for light energy transduction and storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Materials as Machines</title>
      <dc:description>
Advances in the development and integration of responsive materials are comprehensively surveyed with a particular emphasis on robotics, spanning shape&#8208;memory alloys, piezoelectrics, electroactive polymers, shape&#8208;memory polymers, hydrogels, and liquid crystalline polymer networks and elastomers.








Abstract
Machines are systems that harness input power to extend or advance function. Fundamentally, machines are based on the integration of materials with mechanisms to accomplish tasks&#8212;such as generating motion or lifting an object. An emerging research paradigm is the design, synthesis, and integration of responsive materials within or as machines. Herein, a particular focus is the integration of responsive materials to enable robotic (machine) functions such as gripping, lifting, or motility (walking, crawling, swimming, and flying). Key functional considerations of responsive materials in machine implementations are response time, cyclability (frequency and ruggedness), sizing, payload capacity, amenability to mechanical programming, performance in extreme environments, and autonomy. This review summarizes the material transformation mechanisms, mechanical design, and robotic integration of responsive materials including shape memory alloys (SMAs), piezoelectrics, dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), ionic electroactive polymers (IEAPs), pneumatics and hydraulics systems, shape memory polymers (SMPs), hydrogels, and liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) and networks (LCNs). Structural and geometrical fabrication of these materials as wires, coils, films, tubes, cones, unimorphs, bimorphs, and printed elements enables differentiated mechanical responses and consistently enables and extends functional use.

      <title>Toward Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Thermosets through Continuous Development and Improvements in Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs)</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent developments in covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are discussed with an emphasis on the most effective dynamic covalent chemistries (DCCs) that render these materials stimuli&#8208;responsive, enabling features that make CANs broadly applicable across diverse materials science disciplines. Recycling, self&#8208;healing, and 3D printing are discussed, amongst others.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), unlike typical thermosets or other covalently crosslinked networks, possess a unique, often dormant ability to activate one or more forms of stimuli&#8208;responsive, dynamic covalent chemistries as a means to transition their behavior from that of a viscoelastic solid to a material with fluid&#8208;like plastic flow. Upon application of a stimulus, such as light or other irradiation, temperature, or even a distinct chemical signal, the CAN responds by transforming to a state of temporal plasticity through activation of either reversible addition or reversible bond exchange, either of which allows the material to essentially re&#8208;equilibrate to an altered set of conditions that are distinct from those in which the original covalently crosslinked network is formed, often simultaneously enabling a new and distinct shape, function, and characteristics. As such, CANs span the divide between thermosets and thermoplastics, thus offering unprecedented possibilities for innovation in polymer and materials science. Without attempting to comprehensively review the literature, recent developments in CANs are discussed here with an emphasis on the most effective dynamic chemistries that render these materials to be stimuli responsive, enabling features that make CANs more broadly applicable.

      <title>Pros and Cons: Supramolecular or Macromolecular: What Is Best for Functional Hydrogels with Advanced Properties?</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogels are soft materials with a broad application area and a bright future as responsive materials. They contain a molecular network that can be made from crosslinked macromolecules, or small molecules that form a network through noncovalent interactions. These hydrogel classes outperform each other on properties such as reversibility, mechanical robustness, predictability, responsiveness, or adaptation.








Abstract
Hydrogels are fascinating soft materials with unique properties. Many biological systems are based on hydrogel&#8208;like structures, underlining their versatility and relevance. The properties of hydrogels strongly depend on the structure of the building blocks they are composed of, as well as the nature of interactions between them in the network structure. Herein, gel networks made by supramolecular interactions are compared to covalent macromolecular networks, drawing conclusions about their performance and application as responsive materials.

      <title>Vision Statement: Interactive Materials&#8212;Drivers of Future Robotic Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
A robot senses its environment, processes the sensory information, acts in response to these inputs, and possibly communicates with the outside world. Robots generally achieve these tasks with electronics&#8208;based hardware or by receiving inputs from some external hardware. In contrast, simple microorganisms can autonomously perceive, act, and communicate via purely physicochemical processes in soft material systems. A key property of biological systems is that they are built from energy&#8208;consuming &#8220;active&#8221; units. Exciting developments in material science show that even very simple artificial active building blocks can show surprisingly rich emergent behaviors. Active nonequilibrium systems are therefore predicted to play an essential role in realizing interactive materials. A major challenge is to find robust ways to couple and integrate the energy&#8208;consuming building blocks to the mechanical structure of the material. However, success in this endeavor will lead to a new generation of sophisticated micro and soft&#8208;robotic systems that can operate autonomously.

      <dc:description>
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with two types of stimuli&#8208;responsive crosslinks are illustrated by Christopher N. Bowman and co&#8208;workers in article number 1906876. Light&#8208;responsive crosslinks are exposed to blue light to initiate the dynamic response. Thermally responsive crosslinks are activated by an increase in temperature. Either of the types of dynamic units can be reversibly cleaved by application of the triggering stimulus.

      <title>From Molecular Machines to Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
New types of 2D and 3D stimuli&#8208;responsive materials can be constructed by integrating molecular machines as part of their building blocks. The transfer of mechanical actuations from the nanometric scale to the macroscopic one can be supported by several transmission processes and offers a potential pathway to active functional materials for applications in medicine, information technologies, and robotics.








Abstract
Artificial molecular machines are able to produce and exploit precise nanoscale actuations in response to chemical or physical triggers. Recent scientific efforts have been devoted to the integration, orientation, and interfacing of large assemblies of molecular machines in order to harness their collective actuations at larger length scale and up to the generation of macroscopic motions. Making use of such &#8220;hierarchical mechanics&#8221; represents a fundamentally new approach for the conception of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Furthermore, because some molecular machines can function as molecular motors&#8212;which are capable of cycling a unidirectional motion out of thermodynamic equilibrium and progressively increasing the work delivered to their environment&#8212;one can expect unique opportunities to design new kinds of mechanically active materials and devices capable of autonomous behavior when supplied by an external source of energy. Recently reported achievements are summarized, including the integration of molecular machines at surfaces and interfaces, in 3D self&#8208;assembled materials, as well as in liquid crystals and polymer materials. Their detailed functioning principles as well as their functional properties are discussed along with their potential applications in various domains such as sensing, drug delivery, electronics, optics, plasmonics, and mechanics.

      <title>Viewpoint: From Responsive to Adaptive and Interactive Materials and Materials Systems: A Roadmap</title>
      <dc:description>
This Viewpoint article describes the elementary concepts and principles to move from responsive materials to adaptive and interactive materials systems that are increasingly inspired from the behavior of living systems.








Abstract
Soft matter systems and materials are moving toward adaptive and interactive behavior, which holds outstanding promise to make the next generation of intelligent soft materials systems inspired from the dynamics and behavior of living systems. But what is an adaptive material? What is an interactive material? How should classical responsiveness or smart materials be delineated? At present, the literature lacks a comprehensive discussion on these topics, which is however of profound importance in order to identify landmark advances, keep a correct and noninflating terminology, and most importantly educate young scientists going into this direction. By comparing different levels of complex behavior in biological systems, this Viewpoint strives to give some definition of the various different materials systems characteristics. In particular, the importance of thinking in the direction of training and learning materials, and metabolic or behavioral materials is highlighted, as well as communication and information&#8208;processing systems. This Viewpoint aims to also serve as a switchboard to further connect the important fields of systems chemistry, synthetic biology, supramolecular chemistry and nano&#8208; and microfabrication/3D printing with advanced soft materials research.

     alt="Viewpoint: From Responsive to Adaptive and Interactive Materials and Materials Systems: A Roadmap"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Viewpoint article describes the elementary concepts and principles to move from responsive materials to adaptive and interactive materials systems that are increasingly inspired from the behavior of living systems.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft matter systems and materials are moving toward adaptive and interactive behavior, which holds outstanding promise to make the next generation of intelligent soft materials systems inspired from the dynamics and behavior of living systems. But what is an adaptive material? What is an interactive material? How should classical responsiveness or smart materials be delineated? At present, the literature lacks a comprehensive discussion on these topics, which is however of profound importance in order to identify landmark advances, keep a correct and noninflating terminology, and most importantly educate young scientists going into this direction. By comparing different levels of complex behavior in biological systems, this Viewpoint strives to give some definition of the various different materials systems characteristics. In particular, the importance of thinking in the direction of training and learning materials, and metabolic or behavioral materials is highlighted, as well as communication and information&#8208;processing systems. This Viewpoint aims to also serve as a switchboard to further connect the important fields of systems chemistry, synthetic biology, supramolecular chemistry and nano&#8208; and microfabrication/3D printing with advanced soft materials research. A convergence of these disciplines will be at the heart of empowering future adaptive and interactive materials systems with increasingly complex and emergent life&#8208;like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supercharged Proteins and Polypeptides</title>
      <dc:description>
Natural proteins with high net charges can be an inspiration for scientists to artificially supercharge other protein entities. Recent findings show that supercharging proteins allows for control of their properties such as temperature resistance and catalytic activity. Their synthesis, structures, and properties are highlighted, particularly in the context of functional assembly, fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation, and responsive soft materials.








Abstract
Electrostatic interactions play a vital role in nature. Biomacromolecules such as proteins are orchestrated by electrostatics, among other intermolecular forces, to assemble and organize biochemistry. Natural proteins with a high net charge exist in a folded state or are unstructured and can be an inspiration for scientists to artificially supercharge other protein entities. Recent findings show that supercharging proteins allows for control of their properties such as temperature resistance and catalytic activity. One elegant method to transfer the favorable properties of supercharged proteins to other proteins is the fabrication of fusions. Genetically engineered, supercharged unstructured polypeptides (SUPs) are just one promising fusion tool. SUPs can also be complexed with artificial entities to yield thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals and liquids. These architectures represent novel bulk materials that are sensitive to external stimuli. Interestingly, SUPs undergo fluid&#8211;fluid phase separation to form coacervates. These coacervates can even be directly generated in living cells or can be combined with dissipative fiber assemblies that induce life&#8208;like features. Supercharged proteins and SUPs are developed into exciting classes of materials. Their synthesis, structures, and properties are summarized. Moreover, potential applications are highlighted and challenges are discussed.

      <title>On Supramolecular Polymerization: Interview with Takuzo Aida</title>
      <dc:description>
Abstract
Prof. Takuzo Aida is one of the most visible materials chemists thanks to his many creative contributions to the broad field of supramolecular chemistry. Over the past two decades he has ingeniously utilized self&#8208;assembly across scales and between various components to access a breathtaking variety of complex materials with fascinating properties. For example, the Aida Lab has pioneered conducting &#8220;bucky gel&#8221; by dispersing carbon nanotubes in ionic liquids as well as &#8220;aqua materials&#8221;, in which a tiny amount of additive renders water mechanically robust. From his personal insight he shares in this Interview, we can learn how his research evolved since his undergraduate studies. Moreover, he shares his vision on the importance of supramolecular polymers (Supra&#8208;Plastics) to realize a sustainable society.

      <title>Design of Active Interfaces Using Responsive Molecular Components</title>
      <dc:description>
Responsive interfaces display a defined and reversible change in physical properties in response to external stimuli. The state of the art in &#8220;active&#8221; interfaces, which display responsive wettability, permeability, or adhesion is discussed, with a particular emphasis on microscale and nanoscale patterning.








Abstract
Responsive interfaces are interfaces that show a defined and reversible change in physical properties in response to external stimuli. Typically, responsive interfaces result from the immobilization of responsive molecular components at the interface that translate a nanoscale signal into a macroscopic effect. Responsive interfaces can also be obtained if the topology of the interface can be reversibly changed using an external stimulus. As the surface of any material is its connection to the environment, responsive interfaces provide opportunities for interactive materials which are not only able to change properties upon demand, but also sense their environment and act autonomously. The application of responsive molecular components at interfaces, however, requires chemical and physical compatibility with the material surface of interest, posing a challenge not least in the retention of the responsive functionality. The state of the art in &#8220;active&#8221; interfaces which display responsive wettability, permeability, or adhesion is discussed, with a particular emphasis on microscale and nanoscale patterning since patterned interfaces can give rise to unique material properties. Finally, perspectives in the development of responsive interfaces, as well as promising approaches for bypassing the most prominent challenges are discussed.

      <title>Pros and Cons: Magnetic versus Optical Microrobots</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic and optical actuation methods used in mobile microrobotics systems in different contexts are compared with regard to their pros and cons. They can both enable long&#8208;range, fast, and precise actuation of a single microrobot or a swarm of microrobots. Magnetic actuation has high potential for medical applications inside nontransparent deep tissues, while optical actuation is promising for transparent environments or close&#8208;to&#8208;surface tissues.








Abstract
Mobile microrobotics has emerged as a new robotics field within the last decade to create untethered tiny robots that can access and operate in unprecedented, dangerous, or hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach small spaces noninvasively toward disruptive medical, biotechnology, desktop manufacturing, environmental remediation, and other potential applications. Magnetic and optical actuation methods are the most widely used actuation methods in mobile microrobotics currently, in addition to acoustic and biological (cell&#8208;driven) actuation approaches. The pros and cons of these actuation methods are reported here, depending on the given context. They can both enable long&#8208;range, fast, and precise actuation of single or a large number of microrobots in diverse environments. Magnetic actuation has unique potential for medical applications of microrobots inside nontransparent tissues at high penetration depths, while optical actuation is suitable for more biotechnology, lab&#8208;/organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip, and desktop manufacturing types of applications with much less surface penetration depth requirements or with transparent environments. Combining both methods in new robot designs can have a strong potential of combining the pros of both methods. There is still much progress needed in both actuation methods to realize the potential disruptive applications of mobile microrobots in real&#8208;world conditions.

      <title>Global Performance Indices for Dynamic Crystals as Organic Thermal Actuators</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermosalient crystals are a newly researched class of dynamic crystalline solids that are considered as candidates for active actuating elements. Global performance indices are established, which show that the main advantages of thermosalient solids are their low weight, their ability to generate high actuator strains, and their significant work capacity, although they can only induce small actuator stresses.








Abstract
Crystal adaptronics is an emergent materials science discipline at the intersection of solid&#8208;state chemistry and mechanical engineering that explores the dynamic nature of mechanically reconfigurable, motile, and explosive crystals. Adaptive molecular crystals bring to materials science a qualitatively new set of properties that associate long&#8208;range structural order with softness and mechanical compliance. However, the full potential of this class of materials remains underexplored and they have not been considered as materials of choice in an engineer's toolbox. A set of general performance metrics that can be used for quantification of the performance of these prospective dynamic materials as micro&#8208; and macroactuators is presented. The indices are calculated on two selected representatives of thermosalient solids&#8212;materials that undergo rapid martensitic transitions accompanied with macroscopic locomotion. Benchmarking of their performance against extensive set of data for the existing actuator classes and visualization using materials property charts uncover the hidden potential and advantages of dynamic crystals, while they also reveal their drawbacks for actual application as actuators. Altogether the results indicate that, if the challenges with fabrication and implementation in devices are overcome, adaptive molecular crystals can have far&#8208;reaching implications for emerging fields such as smart microelectronics and soft microrobotics.

     alt="Global Performance Indices for Dynamic Crystals as Organic Thermal Actuators"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermosalient crystals are a newly researched class of dynamic crystalline solids that are considered as candidates for active actuating elements. Global performance indices are established, which show that the main advantages of thermosalient solids are their low weight, their ability to generate high actuator strains, and their significant work capacity, although they can only induce small actuator stresses.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal adaptronics is an emergent materials science discipline at the intersection of solid&#8208;state chemistry and mechanical engineering that explores the dynamic nature of mechanically reconfigurable, motile, and explosive crystals. Adaptive molecular crystals bring to materials science a qualitatively new set of properties that associate long&#8208;range structural order with softness and mechanical compliance. However, the full potential of this class of materials remains underexplored and they have not been considered as materials of choice in an engineer's toolbox. A set of general performance metrics that can be used for quantification of the performance of these prospective dynamic materials as micro&#8208; and macroactuators is presented. The indices are calculated on two selected representatives of thermosalient solids&#8212;materials that undergo rapid martensitic transitions accompanied with macroscopic locomotion. Benchmarking of their performance against extensive set of data for the existing actuator classes and visualization using materials property charts uncover the hidden potential and advantages of dynamic crystals, while they also reveal their drawbacks for actual application as actuators. Altogether the results indicate that, if the challenges with fabrication and implementation in devices are overcome, adaptive molecular crystals can have far&#8208;reaching implications for emerging fields such as smart microelectronics and soft microrobotics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Devising Synthetic Reaction Cycles for Dissipative Nonequilibrium Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
There is a need to make and break covalent bonds under the same reaction conditions to devise new chemical reaction cycles that can power dissipative self&#8208;assembly. The progress of the past ten years toward this goal is reviewed, and two new chemistries that could be used in future reaction cycles are proposed.








Abstract
Fuel&#8208;driven reaction cycles are found in biological systems to control the assembly and disassembly of supramolecular materials such as the cytoskeleton. Fuel molecules can bind noncovalently to a self&#8208;assembling building block or they can react with it, resulting in covalent modifications. Overall the fuel can either switch the self&#8208;assembly process on or off. Here, a closer look is taken at artificial systems that mimic biological systems by making and breaking covalent bonds in a self&#8208;assembling motif. The different chemistries used so far are highlighted in chronological order and the pros and cons of each system are discussed. Moreover, the desired traits of future reaction cycles, their fuels, and waste management are outlined, and two chemistries that have not been explored up to now in chemically fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly are suggested.

      <title>Enlightening Materials with Photoswitches</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlling material properties with light is key for the development of optical technologies. In this context, molecular photoswitches have become powerful tools to induce structural changes, which can be translated and amplified to the macroscopic materials and device level. The implementation of photoswitches into a variety of materials, ranging from amorphous to crystalline, and their multifaceted operating principles are reviewed.








Abstract
Incorporating molecular photoswitches into various materials provides unique opportunities for controlling their properties and functions with high spatiotemporal resolution using remote optical stimuli. The great and largely still untapped potential of these photoresponsive systems has not yet been fully exploited due to the fundamental challenges in harnessing geometrical and electronic changes on the molecular level to modulate macroscopic and bulk material properties. Herein, progress made during the past decade in the field of photoswitchable materials is highlighted. After pointing to some general design principles, materials with an increasing order of the integrated photoswitchable units are discussed, spanning the range from amorphous settings over surfaces/interfaces and supramolecular ensembles, to liquid crystalline and crystalline phases. Finally, some potential future directions are pointed out in the conclusion. In view of the exciting recent achievements in the field, the future emergence and further development of light&#8208;driven and optically programmable (inter)active materials and systems are eagerly anticipated.

      <title>Advanced Photoresponsive Materials Using the Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Approach</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoexcited organic chromophores often result in exciting physical and chemical responses. The metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) approach incorporates photoresponsive molecules in a crystalline solid in a controlled manner and enables exploration of their photoresponsive features. Photoresponsive MOFs, especially in the form of thin films, offer numerous advanced applications including solid&#8208;state lighting, photovoltaics, light sensing, and remote switching.








Abstract
When fabricating macroscopic devices exploiting the properties of organic chromophores, the corresponding molecules need to be condensed into a solid material. Since optical absorption properties are often strongly affected by interchromophore interactions, solids with a well&#8208;defined structure carry substantial advantages over amorphous materials. Here, the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based approach is presented. By appropriate functionalization, most organic chromophores can be converted to function as linkers, which can coordinate to metal or metal&#8208;oxo centers so as to yield stable, crystalline frameworks. Photoexcitations in such chromophore&#8208;based MOFs are surveyed, with a special emphasis on light&#8208;switchable MOFs from photochromic molecules. The conventional powder form of MOFs obtained using solvothermal approaches carries certain disadvantages for optical applications, such as limited efficiency resulting from absorption and light scattering caused by the (micrometer&#8208;sized) powder particles. How these problems can be avoided by using MOF thin films is demonstrated.

      <title>Viewpoint: Pavlovian Materials&#8212;Functional Biomimetics Inspired by Classical Conditioning</title>
      <dc:description>
Materials systems that become responsive to an originally neutral stimulus are discussed, as inspired by classical conditioning. The concept requires two stimuli and a triggerable memory, as illustrated by a hydrogel and liquid crystal network with heating and light irradiation as the stimuli. Such Pavlovian materials are distinct from classical stimuli&#8208;responsive or shape&#8208;memory materials, providing opportunities toward increasingly complex functions.








Abstract
Herein, it is discussed whether the complex biological concepts of (associative) learning can inspire responsive artificial materials. It is argued that classical conditioning, being one of the most elementary forms of learning, inspires algorithmic realizations in synthetic materials, to allow stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that learn to respond to a new stimulus, to which they are originally insensitive. Two synthetic model systems coined as &#8220;Pavlovian materials&#8221; are described, whose stimuli&#8208;responsiveness algorithmically mimics programmable associative learning, inspired by classical conditioning. The concepts minimally need a stimulus&#8208;triggerable memory, in addition to two stimuli, i.e., the unconditioned and the originally neutral stimuli. Importantly, the concept differs conceptually from the classic stimuli&#8208;responsive and shape&#8208;memory materials, as, upon association, Pavlovian materials obtain a given response using a new stimulus (the originally neutral one); i.e., the system evolves to a new state. This also enables the functionality to be described by a logic diagram. Ample room for generalization to different stimuli and memory combinations is foreseen, and opportunities to develop future adaptive materials with ever&#8208;more intelligent functions are expected.

      <title>Atomic Engineering Catalyzed MnO2 Electrolysis Kinetics for a Hybrid Aqueous Battery with High Power and Energy Density</title>
      <dc:description>
A paradigm high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;voltage affordable Zn&#8211;Mn hybrid aqueous battery (HAB) is constructed with an electrochemical stability window over 3.4 V. Imposing power of 19 kW kg&#8722;1 and energy of 650 Wh kg&#8722;1 are demonstrated. Spectra techniques and theoretical calculations reveal the origin of the concomitant power and energy densities, via catalyzed kinetics in an aqueous battery.








Abstract
Research interest and achievements in zinc aqueous batteries, such as alkaline Zn//Mn, Zn//Ni/Co, Zn&#8211;air batteries, and near&#8208;neutral Zn&#8208;ion and hybrid ion batteries, have surged throughout the world due to their features of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety. However, practical application of Zn&#8208;based secondary batteries is plagued by restrictive energy and power densities in which an inadequate output plateau voltage and sluggish kinetics are mutually accountable. Here, a novel paradigm high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8211;Mn hybrid aqueous battery (HAB) is constructed with an expanded electrochemical stability window over 3.4 V that is affordable. As a proof of concept, catalyzed MnO2/Mn2+ electrolysis kinetics is demonstrated in the HAB via facile introduction of Ni2+ into the electrolyte. Various techniques are employed, including in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and electron energy loss spectroscopy, to reveal the reversible charge&#8208;storage mechanism and the origin of the boosted rate&#8208;capability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal enhanced active electron states and charge delocalization after introducing strongly electronegative Ni. Simulations of the reaction pathways confirm the enhanced catalyzed electrolysis kinetics by the facilitated charge transfer at the active O sites around Ni dopants. These findings significantly advance aqueous batteries a step closer toward practical low&#8208;cost application.

      <title>Strategies for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Triplet&#8211;Triplet&#8208;Annihilation&#8208;Based Photon Upconversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state triplet&#8211;triplet&#8208;annihilation&#8208;based photon&#8208;upconversion systems are subject to losses from back transfer, molecular aggregation, and triplet&#8211;charge annihilation. Following strategies provided to mitigate these losses, a dry&#8208;processed solid&#8208;state device having comparable upconversion efficiency and threshold intensity to solution&#8208;processed solid&#8208;state systems is developed, offering a route for high&#8208;performance upconversion devices compatible with applications sensitive to solvent damage.








Abstract
Photon upconversion via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) has achieved high efficiencies in solution and within polymer matrices that support molecular migration systems. It has diverse potential applications including bioimaging, optical sensors, and photovoltaics. To date, however, the reported performance of TTA in rigid solid&#8208;state systems is substantially inferior, which may complicate the integration of TTA in other solid&#8208;state devices. Here, solid&#8208;state loss mechanisms in a green&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion system are investigated, and three specific losses are identified: energy back transfer, sensitizer aggregation, and triplet&#8211;charge annihilation. Strategies are demonstrated to mitigate energy back transfer and sensitizer aggregation, and a completely dry&#8208;processed solid&#8208;state TTA upconversion system having an upconversion efficiency of &#8776;2.5% (by the convention of maximum efficiency being 100%) at a relatively low excitation intensity of 238 mW cm&#8722;2 is reported. This device is the first demonstration of dry&#8208;processed solid&#8208;state TTA comparable to solution&#8208;processed solid&#8208;state systems. The strategies reported here can be generalized to other upconversion systems and offer a route to achieving higher&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state TTA upconversion devices that are compatible with applications sensitive to solvent damage.

      <title>Structured Perovskite Light Absorbers for Efficient and Stable Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
Perovskites with different dimensional structures attract wide attention in the field of photovoltaics. There are three main perovskite structures that can be obtained by tuning the A&#8208;site cations, i.e., 3D perovskite, reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskite, and 2D/3D hybrid perovskite, which exhibit different properties, characters, and intrinsic weaknesses. With the use of efficient and targeted tactics, such materials show great potential for perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid lead&#8208;halide perovskite materials (ABX3) have attracted widespread attention in the field of photovoltaics owing to their impressive optical and electrical properties. However, obstacles still exist in the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics, such as poor stability, hysteresis, and human toxicity. A&#8208;site cation engineering is considered to be a powerful tool to tune perovskite structures and the resulting optoelectronic properties. Based on the selection and combination of A&#8208;site cations, three types of perovskite structures, i.e., 3D perovskite, reduced&#8208;dimensional (2D/quasi&#8208;2D) perovskite, and 2D/3D hybrid perovskite can be formed. Herein, the remarkable breakthroughs resulting from these three perovskite structures are summarized, and their corresponding properties and characteristics, as well as their intrinsic disadvantages, are highlighted. By summarizing recent research progress, a new viewpoint for improving the performance and stability of perovskite photovoltaics is provided.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Polymers Mimic Noble Metal Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free polymers are presented that show a selective electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. The polymers are electrically conducting and functionalized with hydrogen&#8208;bonds that serve as catalytic sites and perform the hydrogen evolution on par with best&#8208;in&#8208;class noble metals.








Abstract
The most active and efficient catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rely on platinum, a fact that increases the cost of producing hydrogen and thereby limits the widespread adoption of this fuel. Here, a metal&#8208;free organic electrocatalyst that mimics the platinum surface by implementing a high work function and incorporating hydrogen&#8208;affine hydrogen bonds is introduced. These motifs, inspired from enzymology, are deployed here as selective reaction centres. It is shown that the keto&#8208;amine hydrogen&#8208;bond motif enhances the rate&#8208;determining step in proton reduction to molecular hydrogen. The keto&#8208;amine&#8208;functionalized polymers reported herein evolve hydrogen at an overpotential of 190 mV. They share certain key properties with platinum: a similar work function and excellent electrochemical stability and chemical robustness. These properties allow the demonstration of one week of continuous HER operation without notable degradation nor delamination from the carrier electrode. Scaled continuous&#8208;flow electrolysis is reported and 1 L net molecular hydrogen is produced within less than 9 h using 2.3 mg of polymer electrocatalyst.

      <title>3D Printing of Viscoelastic Suspensions via Digital Light Synthesis for Tough Nanoparticle&#8211;Elastomer Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
The pressure&#8208;driven flow in continuous Digital Light Synthesis is analyzed through the dimensionless Peclet number. This mechanism enables the 3D printing of resins with yield stress (&#8776;10 Pa) and high viscosity (&#8776;200 Pa s), which are the typical rheological features of suspensions with high nanoparticle content. This concept is applied to fabricate silicone&#8211;silica nanocomposites with enhanced toughness.








Abstract
The rheological parameters required to print viscoelastic nanoparticle suspensions toward tough elastomers via Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) (an inverted projection stereolithography system) are reported. With a model material of functionalized silica nanoparticles suspended in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) matrix, the rheological&#8208;parameters&#8208;guided DLS can print structures seven times tougher than those formed from the neat polymers. The large yield stress and high viscosity associated with these high concentration nanoparticle suspensions, however, may prevent pressure&#8208;driven flow, a mechanism essential to stereolithography&#8208;based printing. Thus, to better predict and evaluate the printability of high concentration nanoparticle suspensions, the boundary of rheological properties compatible with DLS is defined using a non&#8208;dimensional Peclet number (Pe). Based on the proposed analysis of rheological parameters, the border of printability at standard temperature and pressure (STP) is established by resin with a silica nanoparticle mass fraction (&#981;silica) of 0.15. Above this concentration, nanoparticle suspensions have Pe &gt; 1 and are not printable. Beyond STP, the printability can be further extended to &#981;silica = 0.20 via a heating module with lower shear rate to reduce the Pe &lt; 1. The printed rubber possesses even higher toughness (&#915; &#8776; 155 kJ m&#8722;3), which is 40% higher over that of &#981;silica = 0.15.

      <title>Honeycomb RhI3 Flakes with High Environmental Stability for Optoelectronics</title>
      <dc:description>
2D honeycomb RhI3 with superior air and thermal stability is introduced. The RhI3 flakes exhibit tunable bandgaps and high electron mobilities. Photodetectors based on the RhI3 flakes demonstrate competitive infrared detection ability with responsivity of 11.5 A W&#8722;1 and specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010 Jones.








Abstract
The emerging 2D layered transition metal trihalides (MX3) have attracted extremely high interest given their exceptional structural and physical properties. Continuing to extend the library of 2D MX3 is essential for exploring new physical phenomena and enabling new functionality. Herein, the optical and electrical properties and the photodetection behavior of atomically thin RhI3 flakes exfoliated from bulk crystals are reported. This compound exhibits superior air and thermal stability, as well as thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap from 1.1 (18L) to 1.4 eV (2L). Field&#8208;effect transistors based on the few&#8208;layer RhI3 flakes display n&#8208;type semiconducting behavior with competitive mobility of 2.5 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and ON/OFF current ratio of 4 &#215; 104. Importantly, the outstanding responsivity of 11.5 A W&#8722;1 and high specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010 Jones are recorded from the RhI3 photodetectors under 980 nm illumination at room temperature in air. These findings indicate a variety of potential applications of atomically thin RhI3 flakes in future 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based electronic and optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Embedded Metal Oxide Plasmonics Using Local Plasma Oxidation of AZO for Planar Metasurfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
A plasma patterning technique is demonstrated to form Al:ZnO metasurfaces by selectively and locally modulating the carrier density without any associated topographical surface profile. This technique offers a conceptual new approach for oxide&#8208;based photonics and nanoelectronics. Its applications are demonstrated through two novel optical devices, a planar metasurface optical solar reflector and a multi&#8208;band metasurface.








Abstract
New methods for achieving high&#8208;quality conducting oxide metasurfaces are of great importance for a range of emerging applications from infrared thermal control coatings to epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero nonlinear optics. This work demonstrates the viability of plasma patterning as a technique to selectively and locally modulate the carrier density in planar Al&#8208;doped ZnO (AZO) metasurfaces without any associated topographical surface profile. This technique stands in strong contrast to conventional physical patterning which results in nonplanar textured surfaces. The approach can open up a new route to form novel photonic devices with planar metasurfaces, for example, antireflective coatings and multi&#8208;layer devices. To demonstrate the performance of the carrier&#8208;modulated AZO metasurfaces, two types of devices are realized using the demonstrated plasma patterning. A metasurface optical solar reflector is shown to produce infrared emissivity equivalent to a conventional etched design. Second, a multiband metasurface is achieved by integrating a Au visible&#8208;range metasurface on top of the planar AZO infrared metasurface. Independent control of spectral bands without significant cross&#8208;talk between infrared and visible functionalities is achieved. Local carrier tuning of conducting oxide films offers a conceptually new approach for oxide&#8208;based photonics and nanoelectronics and opens up new routes for integrated planar metasurfaces in optical technology.

      <title>Stable Rhodium (IV) Oxide for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Water electrolysis in an alkaline electrolyte is an attractive way toward clean hydrogen energy via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A strawberry&#8208;like structure with RhO2 clusters embedded in the surface layer of the Rh nanoparticle presents an alkaline HER activity superior to commercial Pt/C; meanwhile, RhO2 clusters remain stable at a reduction potential up to &#8722;0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).








Abstract
Water electrolysis in alkaline electrolyte is an attractive way toward clean hydrogen energy via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas the sluggish water dissociation impedes the following hydrogen evolution. Noble metal oxides possess promising capability for catalyzing water dissociation and hydrogen evolution; however, they are never utilized for the HER due to the instability under the reductive potential. Here it is shown that compressive strain can stabilize RhO2 clusters and promote their catalytic activity. To this end, a strawberry&#8208;like structure with RhO2 clusters embedded in the surface layer of Rh nanoparticles is engineered, in which the incompatibility between the oxide cluster and the metal substrate causes intensive compressive strain. As such, RhO2 clusters remain stable at a reduction potential up to &#8722;0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and present an alkaline HER activity superior to commercial Pt/C.

      <title>General Decomposition Pathway of Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites through an Intermediate Superstructure and its Suppression Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
A general decomposition pathway from tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 and cubic CH3NH3PbBr3 to lead halides is revealed, through the formation of an intermediate superstructure CH3NH3PbX2.5 with ordered vacancies. Carbon coating is demonstrated to be effective in stabilizing perovskite framework, and thus slowing down the decomposition.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have generated considerable excitement due to their promising photovoltaic performance. However, the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still plagued by the structural degradation of the OIHPs. Here, the decomposition mechanism of OIHPs under electron beam irradiation is investigated via transmission electron microscopy, and a general decomposition pathway for both tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 and cubic CH3NH3PbBr3 is uncovered through an intermediate superstructure state of CH3NH3PbX2.5, X = I, Br, with ordered vacancies into final lead halides. Such decomposition can be suppressed via carbon coating by stabilization of the perovskite structure framework. These findings reveal the general degradation pathway of OIHPs and suggest an effective strategy to suppress it, and the atomistic insight learnt may be useful for improving the stability of PSCs.

Abstract
Innovations in liquid&#8208;phase electron microscopy (LP&#8208;EM) have made it possible to perform experiments at the optimized conditions needed to examine soft matter. The main obstacle is conducting experiments in such a way that electron beam radiation can be used to obtain answers for scientific questions without changing the structure and (bio)chemical processes in the sample due to the influence of the radiation. By overcoming these experimental difficulties at least partially, LP&#8208;EM has evolved into a new microscopy method with nanometer spatial resolution and sub&#8208;second temporal resolution for analysis of soft matter in materials science and biology.

      <title>Imprinting Ferromagnetism and Superconductivity in Single Atomic Layers of Molecular Superlattices</title>
      <dc:description>
Ferromagnetism is successfully introduced in superconducting TaS2 molecular superlattices with single Co atom doping, which is achieved by an interlayer&#8208;space&#8208;confined chemical design (ICCD). This ICCD approach can be applied to various metal ions, opening up new avenues for designing artificial 2D material superlattices with exotic phases and desired functionalities.








Abstract
Ferromagnetism and superconductivity are two antagonistic phenomena since ferromagnetic exchange fields tend to destroy singlet Cooper pairs. Reconciliation of these two competing phases has been achieved in vertically stacked heterostructures where these two orders are confined in different layers. However, controllable integration of these two phases in one atomic layer is a longstanding challenge. Here, an interlayer&#8208;space&#8208;confined chemical design (ICCD) is reported for the synthesis of dilute single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped TaS2 molecular superlattice, whereby ferromagnetism is observed in the superconducting TaS2 layers. The intercalation of 2H&#8208;TaS2 crystal with bulky organic ammonium molecule expands its van der Waals gap for single&#8208;atom doping via co&#8208;intercalated cobalt ions, resulting in the formation of quasi&#8208;monolayer Co&#8208;doped TaS2 superlattices. Isolated Co atoms are decorated in the basal plane of the TaS2 via substituting the Ta atom or anchoring at a hollow site, wherein the orbital&#8208;selected p&#8211;d hybridization between Co and neighboring Ta and S atoms induces local magnetic moments with strong ferromagnetic coupling. This ICCD approach can be applied to various metal ions, enabling the synthesis of a series of crystal&#8208;size TaS2 molecular superlattices.

     alt="Imprinting Ferromagnetism and Superconductivity in Single Atomic Layers of Molecular Superlattices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferromagnetism is successfully introduced in superconducting TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecular superlattices with single Co atom doping, which is achieved by an interlayer&#8208;space&#8208;confined chemical design (ICCD). This ICCD approach can be applied to various metal ions, opening up new avenues for designing artificial 2D material superlattices with exotic phases and desired functionalities.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferromagnetism and superconductivity are two antagonistic phenomena since ferromagnetic exchange fields tend to destroy singlet Cooper pairs. Reconciliation of these two competing phases has been achieved in vertically stacked heterostructures where these two orders are confined in different layers. However, controllable integration of these two phases in one atomic layer is a longstanding challenge. Here, an interlayer&#8208;space&#8208;confined chemical design (ICCD) is reported for the synthesis of dilute single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecular superlattice, whereby ferromagnetism is observed in the superconducting TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers. The intercalation of 2H&#8208;TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystal with bulky organic ammonium molecule expands its van der Waals gap for single&#8208;atom doping via co&#8208;intercalated cobalt ions, resulting in the formation of quasi&#8208;monolayer Co&#8208;doped TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; superlattices. Isolated Co atoms are decorated in the basal plane of the TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via substituting the Ta atom or anchoring at a hollow site, wherein the orbital&#8208;selected p&#8211;d hybridization between Co and neighboring Ta and S atoms induces local magnetic moments with strong ferromagnetic coupling. This ICCD approach can be applied to various metal ions, enabling the synthesis of a series of crystal&#8208;size TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecular superlattices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Robust Interface Ru Centers for High&#8208;Performance Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
The robust interface Ru centers between RuO2 and graphene are found to boost both activity and stability for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), exhibiting a much lower OER overpotential of only 227 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 compared with that of 290 mV for commercial RuO2 but a significantly higher durability than the commercial RuO2.








Abstract
RuO2 is considered as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media. However, its practical application is largely hindered by both the high reaction overpotential and severe electrochemical corrosion of the active centers. To overcome these limitations, innovative design strategies are necessary, which remains a great challenge. Herein, robust interface Ru centers between RuO2 and graphene, via a controllable oxidation of graphene encapsulating Ru nanoparticles, are presented to efficiently enhance both the activity and stability of the acidic OER. Through precisely controlling the reaction interface, a much lower OER overpotential of only 227 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte, compared with that of 290 mV for commercial RuO2, but a significantly higher durability than the commercial RuO2, are achieved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the interface Ru centers between the RuO2 and the graphene can break the classic scaling relationships between the free energies of HOO* and HO* to reduce the limiting potential, rendering an enhancement in the intrinsic OER activity and the resistance to over&#8208;oxidation and corrosion for RuO2.

      <title>Multicompartment Tubular Micromotors Toward Enhanced Localized Active Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>
Tubular micromotors with spatially resolved compartments are fabricated with a Zn engine and a cargo&#8208;loaded gelatin segment further protected by a pH&#8208;responsive cap. The multicompartment motors display powerful propulsion in gastric fluid while showing enhanced distribution and localized cargo delivery in the gastric mucosa. Such capabilities make these compartmentalized motors a promising platform for transport and active delivery of a variety of therapeutic payloads.








Abstract
A tubular micromotor with spatially resolved compartments is presented toward efficient site&#8208;specific cargo delivery, with a back&#8208;end zinc (Zn) propellant engine segment and an upfront cargo&#8208;loaded gelatin segment further protected by a pH&#8208;responsive cap. The multicompartment micromotors display strong gastric&#8208;powered propulsion with tunable lifetime depending on the Zn segment length. Such propulsion significantly enhances the motor distribution and retention in the gastric tissues, by pushing and impinging the front&#8208;end cargo segment onto the stomach wall. Once the micromotor penetrates the gastric mucosa (pH &#8805; 6.0), its pH&#8208;responsive cap dissolves, promoting the autonomous localized cargo release. The fabrication process, physicochemical properties, and propulsion behavior are systematically tested and discussed. Using a mouse model, the multicompartment motors, loaded with a model cargo, demonstrate a homogeneous cargo distribution along with approximately four&#8208;fold enhanced retention in the gastric lining compared to monocompartment motors, while showing no apparent toxicity. Therapeutic payloads can also be loaded into the pH&#8208;responsive cap, in addition to the gelatin&#8208;based compartment, leading to concurrent delivery and sequential release of dual cargos toward combinatorial therapy. Overall, this multicompartment micromotor system provides unique features and advantages that will further advance the development of synthetic micromotors for active transport and localized delivery of biomedical cargos.

      <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Reversible Electroadhesion of Ionoelastomer Junctions</title>
      <dc:description>
A new class of electroadhesives based on ionoelastomer junctions is developed, which can be reversibly operated with potentials of &#177;1 V. The voltage stored in the ionic double layer formed at the interface of polyanionic and polycationic ionoelastomer layers is used to reversibly modulate the adhesion between the two materials.








Abstract
Electroadhesion provides a simple route to rapidly and reversibly control adhesion using applied electric potentials, offering promise for a variety of applications including haptics and robotics. Current electroadhesives, however, suffer from key limitations associated with the use of high operating voltages (&gt;kV) and corresponding failure due to dielectric breakdown. Here, a new type of electroadhesion based on heterojunctions between iono&#8208;elastomer of opposite polarity is demonstrated, which can be operated at potentials as low as &#8776;1 V. The large electric field developed across the molecular&#8208;scale ionic double layer (IDL) when the junction is placed under reverse bias allows for strong adhesion at low voltages. In contrast, under forward bias, the electric field across the IDL is destroyed, substantially lowering the adhesion in a reversible fashion. These ionoelastomer electroadhesives are highly efficient with respect to the force capacity per electrostatic capacitive energy and are robust to defects or damage that typically lead to catastrophic failure of conventional dielectric electroadhesives. The findings provide new fundamental insight into low&#8208;voltage electroadhesion and broaden its possible applications.

      <title>Direct Pyrolysis of Supermolecules: An Ultrahigh Edge&#8208;Nitrogen Doping Strategy of Carbon Anodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping strategy is presented. 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon (3D&#8208;NTC) with an ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping level of 16.8 at% is prepared through a novel, general direct supermolecule pyrolysis strategy. Highly edge&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D&#8208;NTC shows remarkable performance toward potassium&#8208;ion storage. A high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion full battery is assembled using a 3D&#8208;NTC anode and perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride as the cathode.








Abstract
Most reported carbonaceous anodes of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have limited capacities. One approach to improve the performance of carbon anodes is edge&#8208;nitrogen doping, which effectively enhances the K&#8208;ion adsorption energy. It remains challenging to achieve high edge&#8208;nitrogen doping due to the difficulty in controlling the nitrogen dopant configuration. Herein, a new synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare carbon anodes with ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping for high&#8208;performance PIBs. Specifically, self&#8208;assembled supermolecule precursors derived from pyromellitic acid and melamine are directly pyrolyzed. During the pyrolysis process, the amidation and imidization reactions between pyromellitic acid and melamine before carbonization enable the successful carbonization of pyromellitic acid&#8211;melamine supermolecule. The obtained 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon (3D&#8208;NTC) possesses a 3D framework composed of carbon nanosheets, turbostratic crystalline structure, and an ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doping level up to 16.8 at% (73.7% of total 22.8 at% nitrogen doping). These features endow 3D&#8208;NTCs with remarkable performances as PIB anodes. The 3D&#8208;NTC anode displays a high capacity of 473 mAh g&#8722;1, robust rate capability, and a long cycle life of 500 cycles with a high capacity retention of 93.1%. This new strategy will boost the development of carbon anodes for rechargeable alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;ion batteries.

     alt="Direct Pyrolysis of Supermolecules: An Ultrahigh Edge&#8208;Nitrogen Doping Strategy of Carbon Anodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping strategy is presented. 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon (3D&#8208;NTC) with an ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping level of 16.8 at% is prepared through a novel, general direct supermolecule pyrolysis strategy. Highly edge&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D&#8208;NTC shows remarkable performance toward potassium&#8208;ion storage. A high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion full battery is assembled using a 3D&#8208;NTC anode and perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride as the cathode.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most reported carbonaceous anodes of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) have limited capacities. One approach to improve the performance of carbon anodes is edge&#8208;nitrogen doping, which effectively enhances the K&#8208;ion adsorption energy. It remains challenging to achieve high edge&#8208;nitrogen doping due to the difficulty in controlling the nitrogen dopant configuration. Herein, a new synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare carbon anodes with ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen doping for high&#8208;performance PIBs. Specifically, self&#8208;assembled supermolecule precursors derived from pyromellitic acid and melamine are directly pyrolyzed. During the pyrolysis process, the amidation and imidization reactions between pyromellitic acid and melamine before carbonization enable the successful carbonization of pyromellitic acid&#8211;melamine supermolecule. The obtained 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon (3D&#8208;NTC) possesses a 3D framework composed of carbon nanosheets, turbostratic crystalline structure, and an ultrahigh edge&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doping level up to 16.8 at% (73.7% of total 22.8 at% nitrogen doping). These features endow 3D&#8208;NTCs with remarkable performances as PIB anodes. The 3D&#8208;NTC anode displays a high capacity of 473 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, robust rate capability, and a long cycle life of 500 cycles with a high capacity retention of 93.1%. This new strategy will boost the development of carbon anodes for rechargeable alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contributions of Different Functional Groups to Contact Electrification of Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of polymer films with different functional groups on the side chain are employed for clarifying the contribution of functional groups to their contact electrification (CE) processes with both solids and liquids. The unsaturated groups of PTFE can enhance the electronegativity of the whole functional group.








Abstract
Polymers are commonly used to fabricate triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Here, several polymer films with similar main chains but different functional groups on the side chain are employed to clarify the contributions of each functional group to contact electrification (CE). The results show that the electron&#8208;withdrawing (EW) ability and density of these functional groups on the main chain can determine both the polarity and density of CE&#8208;induced surface charges. Similar results are obtained for CE in both the polymer&#8211;polymer and polymer&#8211;liquid modes. A theoretical mechanism involving electron cloud overlap is proposed to explain all of these results. More importantly, the unsaturated groups on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) molecular chain are proved to have a much stronger EW ability than the saturated groups. The density of these unsaturated groups can be increased using a sputtering technique, suggesting that this is a facile and effective method of enhancing the performance of TENGs. These results clarify the correlation between the molecular structure and macroscopic electrification behavior of polymers.

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne Ion Tunnels Directing Concentration Redistribution for Commercial&#8208;Grade Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries suffering from the dendrite issue show a short lifespan, especially at commercial&#8208;grade cathode loading mass. Hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne with ion tunnels is employed to eliminate dendrites, based on ion redistribution, achieving a long lifespan of 10 000 cycles at a cathode loading mass of 22.95 mg cm&#8722;2. This work sheds light on tackling the dendrite issue encountered by metal batteries.








Abstract
Current aqueous Zn batteries (ZBs) seriously suffer from dendrite issues caused by rough electrode surfaces. Despite significant efforts in prolonging lifespan of these batteries, little effort has been devoted to dendrite elimination in commercial&#8208;grade cathode loading mass. Instead, demonstrations have only been done at the laboratory level (&#8804;2 mg cm&#8722;2). Additionally, new dilemmas regarding change of the proton&#8208;storage behavior and interface pulverization have emerged in turn. Herein, hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), with sub&#8208;&#229;ngstr&#246;m level ion tunnels and robust chemical stability, is designed as an artificial interface layer to address these issues. This strategy prolongs the symmetric cell lifespan to &gt;2400 h (100 days), which is 37 times larger than without protection (63 h). The simulation of dual fields reveals that HsGDY can redistribute the Zn2+ concentration field by spatially forcing Zn2+ to deviate from the irregular electric field. During practical use, the as&#8208;assembled full batteries deliver a long lifespan 50 000 cycles and remain stable even at a commercial&#8208;grade cathode loading mass of up to 22.95 mg cm&#8722;2. This HsGDY&#8208;protection methodology represents great progress in Zn dendrite protection and demonstrates enormous potential in metal batteries.

      <title>Plasmonic Janus Microspheres Created from Pickering Emulsion Drops</title>
      <dc:description>
Plasmonic Janus microspheres are designed from Pickering emulsions. A regular array of dimples is prepared on the surface of the microspheres using an array of particles at the emulsion interface as templates, on which plasmonic nanostructures are created by directional deposition of metal. This class of plasmonic microgranules with a controlled plasmonic property will provide new opportunities for various optical applications.








Abstract
Metal nanostructures have been created in a film format to develop unique plasmonic properties. Here, well&#8208;defined metal nanostructures are designed on the surface of microspheres to provide plasmonic microgranules. As conventional techniques are inadequate for nanofabrication on spherical surfaces, photocurable emulsion drops with a regular array of silica particles are employed at the interface to create periodic nanostructures. The silica particles, originating from the dispersed phase, fully cover the interface by forming a non&#8208;close&#8208;packed hexagonal array after drop generation, and slowly protrude to the continuous phase during aging while their interparticle separation decreases. Therefore, hexagonal arrays of spherical dimples with controlled geometry and separation are created on the surface of microspheres by photocuring the drops and removing the particles. Directional deposition of either aluminum or gold results in a continuous film with a hexagonal array of holes on the outermost surface and isolated curved disks in dimples, which renders the hemisphere of microspheres plasmonically colored. The resonant wavelength is controlled by adjusting the aging time, metal thickness, and size of silica particles, providing various plasmonic colors. This granular format of the plasmonic Janus microspheres will open a new avenue of optical applications including active color pixels, optical barcodes, and microsensors.

      <title>Hybrid Magnetic Micropillar Arrays for Programmable Actuation</title>
      <dc:description>
A new experimental technique for hybrid magnetic micropillar arrays is developed to realize site&#8208;specific, on&#8208;demand, and programmed bending actuation. Several exciting applications for surface engineering and micromanipulations, including encryptable surface printing/stamping, direction&#8208; and track&#8208;programmable microtransport, and magnetic micro&#8208;tweezers that can smartly grip and release microscale objects, are demonstrated using the micropillar arrays.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive micro/nanostructures that can dynamically and reversibly adapt their configurations according to external stimuli have stimulated a wide scope of engineering applications, ranging from material surface engineering to micromanipulations. However, it remains a challenge to achieve a precise local control of the actuation to realize applications that require heterogeneous and on&#8208;demand responses. Here, a new experimental technique is developed for large arrays of hybrid magnetic micropillars and achieve precise local control of actuation using a simple magnetic field. By manipulating the spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles within individual elastomer micropillars, a wide range of the magnetomechanical responses from less than 5% to &#8776;50% for the ratio of the bending deflection to the original length of the pillars is realized. It is demonstrated that the micropillars with different degrees of bending deformation can be configured in any spatial pattern using a photomask&#8208;assisted template&#8208;casting technique to achieve heterogeneous, site&#8208;specific, and programmed bending actuations. This unprecedented local control of the micropillars offers exciting novel applications, as demonstrated here in encryptable surface printing and stamping, direction&#8208; and track&#8208;programmable microparticle/droplet transport, and smart magnetic micro&#8208;tweezers. The hybrid magnetic micropillars reported here provide a versatile prototype for heterogeneous and on&#8208;demand actuation using programmable stimuli&#8208;responsive micro/nanostructures.

      <title>Synergistic Cascade Carrier Extraction via Dual Interfacial Positioning of Ambipolar Black Phosphorene for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Ambipolar black phosphorene (BP) nanosheets with the tailored thicknesses concurrently enhance carrier extraction at both the electron&#8208;transport layer/perovskite and hole&#8208;transport layer/perovskite interfaces for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells, demonstrating the appealing implementation of BP as dual&#8208;functional carrier&#8208;transport material for a diversity of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, photodetectors, sensors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, etc.








Abstract
2D black phosphorene (BP) carries a stellar set of physical properties such as conveniently tunable bandgap and extremely high ambipolar carrier mobility for optoelectronic devices. Herein, the judicious design and positioning of BP with tailored thickness as dual&#8208;functional nanomaterials to concurrently enhance carrier extraction at both electron transport layer/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer interfaces for high&#8208;efficiency and stable perovskite solar cells is reported. The synergy of favorable band energy alignment and concerted cascade interfacial carrier extraction, rendered by concurrent positioning of BP, delivered a progressively enhanced power conversion efficiency of 19.83% from 16.95% (BP&#8208;free). Investigation into interfacial engineering further reveals enhanced light absorption and reduced trap density for improved photovoltaic performance with BP incorporation. This work demonstrates the appealing characteristic of rational implementation of BP as dual&#8208;functional transport material for a diversity of optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors, sensors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, etc.

&lt;p&gt;Ambipolar black phosphorene (BP) nanosheets with the tailored thicknesses concurrently enhance carrier extraction at both the electron&#8208;transport layer/perovskite and hole&#8208;transport layer/perovskite interfaces for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells, demonstrating the appealing implementation of BP as dual&#8208;functional carrier&#8208;transport material for a diversity of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, photodetectors, sensors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, etc.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D black phosphorene (BP) carries a stellar set of physical properties such as conveniently tunable bandgap and extremely high ambipolar carrier mobility for optoelectronic devices. Herein, the judicious design and positioning of BP with tailored thickness as dual&#8208;functional nanomaterials to concurrently enhance carrier extraction at both electron transport layer/perovskite and perovskite/hole transport layer interfaces for high&#8208;efficiency and stable perovskite solar cells is reported. The synergy of favorable band energy alignment and concerted cascade interfacial carrier extraction, rendered by concurrent positioning of BP, delivered a progressively enhanced power conversion efficiency of 19.83% from 16.95% (BP&#8208;free). Investigation into interfacial engineering further reveals enhanced light absorption and reduced trap density for improved photovoltaic performance with BP incorporation. This work demonstrates the appealing characteristic of rational implementation of BP as dual&#8208;functional transport material for a diversity of optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors, sensors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Situ Formation of Oxygen Vacancies Achieving Near&#8208;Complete Charge Separation in Planar BiVO4 Photoanodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A new sulfur oxidation process is developed to synthesize planar BiVO4 thin films with in situ formed oxygen vacancies in the whole film, achieving a record charge separation efficiency of 98.2%. By depositing an efficient NiFeOx oxygen evolution cocatalyst, a high and stable photocurrent density of 5.54 mA cm&#8722;2 for photoelectrochemical water splitting is achieved.








Abstract
Despite a suitable bandgap of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) for visible light absorption, most of the photogenerated holes in BiVO4 photoanodes are vanished before reaching the surfaces for oxygen evolution reaction due to the poor charge separation efficiency in the bulk. Herein, a new sulfur oxidation strategy is developed to prepare planar BiVO4 photoanodes with in situ formed oxygen vacancies, which increases the majority charge carrier density and photovoltage, leading to a record charge separation efficiency of 98.2% among the reported BiVO4 photoanodes. Upon loading NiFeOx as an oxygen evolution cocatalyst, a stable photocurrent density of 5.54 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5 G illumination. Remarkably, a dual&#8208;photoanode configuration further enhances the photocurrent density up to 6.24 mA cm&#8722;2, achieving an excellent applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 2.76%. This work demonstrates a simple thermal treatment approach to generate oxygen vacancies for the design of efficient planar photoanodes for solar hydrogen production.

      <title>Thermal Management Enables Bright and Stable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Several thermal management strategies are proposed and applied to perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), resulting in greatly reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off, record high radiance, and significantly improved operational lifetime. Furthermore, these thermal management strategies enable pulsed operation of perovskite LEDs in the kA cm&#8208;2 range with much improved device performance, an important step toward electrically driven perovskite lasers.








Abstract
The performance of lead&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) has increased rapidly in recent years. However, most reports feature devices operated at relatively small current densities (&lt;500 mA cm&#8722;2) with moderate radiance (&lt;400 W sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2). Here, Joule heating and inefficient thermal dissipation are shown to be major obstacles toward high radiance and long lifetime. Several thermal management strategies are proposed in this work, such as doping charge&#8208;transport layers, optimizing device geometry, and attaching heat spreaders and sinks. Combining these strategies, high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs are demonstrated with maximum radiance of 2555 W sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2, peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17%, considerably reduced EQE roll&#8208;off (EQE &gt; 10% to current densities as high as 2000 mA cm&#8722;2), and tenfold increase in operational lifetime (when driven at 100 mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, with proper thermal management, a maximum current density of 2.5 kA cm&#8722;2 and an EQE of &#8776;1% at 1 kA cm&#8722;2 are shown using electrical pulses, which represents an important milestone toward electrically driven perovskite lasers.

      <title>Weighted Mobility</title>
      <dc:description>
The weighted mobility, easily computed from measurements of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, is an accurate measure of the charge carrier mobility and effective mass. It is even more sensitive than measurements of the Hall effect for revealing electron transport mechanisms in complex materials ranging from metals, semiconductors, and conducting polymers.








Abstract
Engineering semiconductor devices requires an understanding of charge carrier mobility. Typically, mobilities are estimated using Hall effect and electrical resistivity meausrements, which are are routinely performed at room temperature and below, in materials with mobilities greater than 1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. With the availability of combined Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity measurement systems, it is now easy to measure the weighted mobility (electron mobility weighted by the density of electronic states). A simple method to calculate the weighted mobility from Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity measurements is introduced, which gives good results at room temperature and above, and for mobilities as low as 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1,

      <title>A Self&#8208;Cleaning Heterostructured Membrane for Efficient Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Separation with Stable Flux</title>
      <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven self&#8208;cleaning 2D heterojunction membrane for stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion separation with stable flux is introduced. The 2D heterostructure membranes are successfully fabricated via a self&#8208;assembly method. The prepared membranes have a high permeation flux for stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion separation and they exhibit a high&#8208;flux, stable flow rate after multiple cycles, and excellent self&#8208;cleaning properties for stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions.








Abstract
Lack of clean water is a major global challenge. Membrane separation technology is an ideal choice for the treatment of industrial, domestic sewage owing to its low energy consumption and cost. However, membranes are highly susceptible to contamination, particularly during wastewater treatment, which has limited their practical applications in this field. Similarly, the flux of the membrane decreases with prolonged use due to its reduced interlayer spacing. Preparation of membranes with anticontamination properties and stable flux is the key to addressing this problem. In this study, a 2D heterostructure membrane with visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven self&#8208;cleaning performance is prepared via a self&#8208;assembly process. Notably, the addition of palygorskite increases the interlayer spacing of the graphene and heterojunction structures, which increases the flux of the membrane and avoids a decrease of the interlayer spacing of the membrane under pressure. The presence of a heterojunction with visible light catalytic properties effectively avoids membrane fouling and avoids a sharp decrease of the permeation flux. Importantly, the prepared 2D membrane has excellent separation performance for oil&#8211;water emulsions with both high flux and efficiency. These features suggest great potential for the prepared 2D membrane in wastewater treatment applications.

      <title>Ultrabroadband Photodetectors up to 10.6 &#181;m Based on 2D Fe3O4 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel nonlayered 2D Fe3O4 nanosheets with cubic inverse&#8208;spinel structure perform an ultrabroadband photoresponse from ultraviolet to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR) range. The distinguished LWIR detection performance with ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 561.2 A W&#8722;1, external quantum efficiency of 6.6 &#215; 103%, and detectivity of 7.42 &#215; 108 Jones can be attributed to synergistic effect of photoconductive effect and bolometric effect.








Abstract
The ultrabroadband spectrum detection from ultraviolet (UV) to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR) is promising for diversified optoelectronic applications of imaging, sensing, and communication.

&lt;p&gt;Novel nonlayered 2D Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with cubic inverse&#8208;spinel structure perform an ultrabroadband photoresponse from ultraviolet to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR) range. The distinguished LWIR detection performance with ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 561.2 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, external quantum efficiency of 6.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;%, and detectivity of 7.42 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jones can be attributed to synergistic effect of photoconductive effect and bolometric effect.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultrabroadband spectrum detection from ultraviolet (UV) to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR) is promising for diversified optoelectronic applications of imaging, sensing, and communication. However, the current LWIR&#8208;detecting devices suffer from low photoresponsivity, high cost, and cryogenic environment. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ultrabroadband photodetector is demonstrated with detecting range from UV to LWIR based on air&#8208;stable nonlayered ultrathin Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets synthesized via a space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Ultrahigh photoresponsivity (&lt;i&gt;R &lt;/i&gt;) of 561.2 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;%, and detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D &lt;/i&gt;*) of 7.42 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Jones are achieved at the wavelength of 10.6 &#181;m. The multimechanism synergistic effect of photoconductive effect and bolometric effect demonstrates the high sensitivity for light with any light intensities.

      <title>Negatively Charged Nanosheets Significantly Enhance the Energy&#8208;Storage Capability of Polymer&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
A general strategy is developed to enhance energy storage of nanocomposites. Through inserting negatively charged Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets into a polymer matrix, a reversed local electric field is generated and further blocks the breakdown path. A record&#8208;high energy storage of 36.2 J cm&#8722;3 is achieved in poly(vinylidene fluoride). The strategy is also utilized in polystyrene&#8208;based nanocomposites and is verified by phase&#8208;field simulations.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based dielectric materials play a key role in advanced electronic devices and electric power systems. Although extensive research has been devoted to improve their energy&#8208;storage performances, it is a great challenge to increase the breakdown strength of polymer nanocomposites in terms of achieving high energy density and good reliability under high voltages. Here, a general strategy is proposed to significantly improve their breakdown strength and energy storage by adding negatively charged Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets. A dramatically enhanced breakdown strength (792 MV m&#8722;1) and the highest energy density (36.2 J cm&#8722;3) among all flexible polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are observed in poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;based nanocomposite capacitors. The strategy generalizability is verified by the similar substantial enhancements of breakdown strength and energy density in polystyrene&#8208;based nanocomposites. Phase&#8208;field simulations demonstrate that the further enhanced breakdown strength is ascribed to the local electric field, produced by the negatively charged Ca2Nb3O10 nanosheets sandwiched with the positively charged polyethyleneimine, which suppresses the secondary impact&#8208;ionized electrons and blocks the breakdown path in nanocomposites. The results demonstrate a new horizon of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible capacitors.

      <title>Defect Engineering for Fuel&#8208;Cell Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
The latest advances in the development of fuel&#8208;cell electrocatalysts by defect engineering are systematically introduced. Such defects modulate electronic structure and improve electrical conductivity, consequently enhancing the activities of electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The commercialization of fuel cells, such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells and direct methanol/formic acid fuel cells, is hampered by their poor stability, high cost, fuel crossover, and the sluggish kinetics of platinum (Pt) and Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for both the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) or small molecule oxidation reaction (SMOR). Thus far, the exploitation of active and stable electrocatalysts has been the most promising strategy to improve the performance of fuel cells. Accordingly, increasing attention is being devoted to modulating the surface/interface electronic structure of electrocatalysts and optimizing the adsorption energy of intermediate species by defect engineering to enhance their catalytic performance. Defect engineering is introduced in terms of defect definition, classification, characterization, construction, and understanding. Subsequently, the latest advances in defective electrocatalysts for ORR and HOR/SMOR in fuel cells are scientifically and systematically summarized. Furthermore, the structure&#8211;activity relationships between defect engineering and electrocatalytic ability are further illustrated by coupling experimental results and theoretical calculations. With a deeper understanding of these complex relationships, the integration of defective electrocatalysts into single fuel&#8208;cell systems is also discussed. Finally, the potential challenges and prospects of defective electrocatalysts are further proposed, covering controllable preparation, in situ characterization, and commercial applications.

      <title>Immunotherapy: Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles Induce Pyroptosis in Cells Controlled by the Extracellular pH (Adv. Mater. 19/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 1907267, Stefan Wuttke, Hanna Engelke, and co&#8208;workers describe how lipid&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles are taken up by cells via endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the MOF nanoparticles are degraded depending on the extracellular pH. The degradation product leads to pyroptosis&#8212;a programmed cell death involving the immune system, in which the cell membrane is perforated with pores leading to cell lysis. Ultimately, the nanoparticles may be used for immunotherapy.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Palladium Diselenide with Strong In&#8208;Plane Optical Anisotropy and High Mobility Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly anisotropic pentagonal 2D PdSe2 is synthesized by a chemical vapor deposition method, exhibiting a high electron mobility up to &#8776;294 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and strong in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) palladium diselenide (PdSe2) has strong interlayer coupling and a puckered pentagonal structure, leading to remarkable layer&#8208;dependent electronic structures and highly anisotropic in&#8208;plane optical and electronic properties.

&lt;p&gt;Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) palladium diselenide (PdSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has strong interlayer coupling and a puckered pentagonal structure, leading to remarkable layer&#8208;dependent electronic structures and highly anisotropic in&#8208;plane optical and electronic properties.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles Induce Pyroptosis in Cells Controlled by the Extracellular pH</title>
      <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles facilitate iron release in cells upon slight acidification of the extracellular pH. This process triggers pyroptosis, a cell death involving the immune system. These hybrid nanoparticles may allow the study of pyroptosis. Since extracellular acidification transforms nontoxic nanoparticles into cytotoxic drugs that induce cell death and stimulate an immune response, they may also be used for immunotherapy.








Abstract
Ion homeostasis is essential for cellular survival, and elevated concentrations of specific ions are used to start distinct forms of programmed cell death. However, investigating the influence of certain ions on cells in a controlled way has been hampered due to the tight regulation of ion import by cells. Here, it is shown that lipid&#8208;coated iron&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles are able to deliver and release high amounts of iron ions into cells. While high concentrations of iron often trigger ferroptosis, here, the released iron induces pyroptosis, a form of cell death involving the immune system. The iron release occurs only in slightly acidic extracellular environments restricting cell death to cells in acidic microenvironments and allowing for external control. The release mechanism is based on endocytosis facilitated by the lipid&#8208;coating followed by degradation of the nanoparticle in the lysosome via cysteine&#8208;mediated reduction, which is enhanced in slightly acidic extracellular environment. Thus, a new functionality of hybrid nanoparticles is demonstrated, which uses their nanoarchitecture to facilitate controlled ion delivery into cells. Based on the selectivity for acidic microenvironments, the described nanoparticles may also be used for immunotherapy: the nanoparticles may directly affect the primary tumor and the induced pyroptosis activates the immune system.

      <title>What Happens during Thermal Post&#8208;Treatment of Powder Aerosol Deposited Functional Ceramic Films? Explanations Based on an Experiment&#8208;Enhanced Literature Survey</title>
      <dc:description>
The thermal annealing behavior of various powder aerosol deposited (PAD) functional films with different dominating electrical charge carriers is surveyed. While PAD features the formation of dense ceramic films at room temperature, a moderate thermal treatment is found necessary to regain bulk&#8208;like conductivity values. A quantitative recommendation for the lowest possible film annealing temperatures is presented.








Abstract
Powder aerosol deposition (PAD) is a unique ceramic spray coating method that produces dense and well&#8208;adhering thick&#8208;films directly at room temperature, without requiring any heating or sintering. After the successful film formation, mechanical film properties like hardness or plasma resistance are remarkably good. However, when it comes to electrical properties like permittivity or electrical conductivity, the nanocrystalline structure of PAD films combined with high internal strains deteriorates partly the characteristic properties. The electrical conductivity may already be present within the as&#8208;deposited films. However, it is mostly lowered by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, a thermal post&#8208;deposition annealing is oftentimes required. In this work, electrically conducting films produced by powder aerosol deposition are surveyed based on published data. Their microstructural and electrical behavior during the post&#8208;deposition annealing treatment is summarized and reasons for the lowered electrical conductivity are identified. Additionally, the processes taking place during annealing, which eventually allow to regain bulk&#8208;like functional properties, are examined. A universal annealing behavior is found that leads to a quantitative recommendation for the suitable film annealing temperatures to regain the electrical conductivities.

      <title>Colossal Granular Lithium Deposits Enabled by the Grain&#8208;Coarsening Effect for High&#8208;Efficiency Lithium Metal Full Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A grain&#8208;coarsening behavior of lithium deposits with oriented columnar morphology can be realized in a solubilizer&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte. Nanowave&#8208;structured solid electrolyte interphases derived from the Sn2+&#8211;NO3&#8211; coordination&#8208;solvation structure promote a significant improvement in the lifespan (200 cycles) of Li/NMC811 full batteries (45 &#181;m thin Li anode and 16.7 mg cm&#8722;2 NMC811 cathode).








Abstract
The low Coulombic efficiency of the lithium metal anode is recognized as the real bottleneck to practical high&#8208;efficiency lithium metal batteries with limited Li excess. The grain size and microstructure of deposited lithium strongly influences the lithium plating/stripping efficiency. Here, a solubilizer&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte that can realize grain coarsening of lithium deposits (&gt;20 &#181;m in width) with oriented columnar morphology, which is in sharp contrast with conventional nanoscale dendrite&#8208;like lithium deposits in carbonate electrolytes, is reported. It exhibits improved Li Coulombic efficiency to 98.14% at a high capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 150 cycles, because the colossal lithium deposition with minimal tortuosity can maintain the bulk Li with continuous electron conducting pathway during the stripping process, thus enabling efficient Li utilization. Li/NMC811 full batteries, composed of thin Li anode (45 &#181;m) and a high&#8208;capacity NMC811 cathode (16.7 mg cm&#8722;2), can achieve at least 12 times longer lifespan (200 cycles).

      <title>A Chemically Stable Hofmann&#8208;Type Metal&#8722;Organic Framework with Sandwich&#8208;Like Binding Sites for Benchmark Acetylene Capture</title>
      <dc:description>
A chemically stable Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8722;organic framework is realized for benchmark acetylene capture capacity and separation, mainly attributed to the unique sandwich&#8208;like binding environments constructed by the oppositely adjacent open metal centers and cyanide groups from the two different [Ni(CN)4]2&#8722; building units, thus affording a record&#8208;high acetylene uptake at 0.01 bar and very high selectivities for acetylene&#8208;related separation applications.








Abstract
The realization of porous materials for highly selective separation of acetylene (C2H2) from various other gases (e.g., carbon dioxide and ethylene) by adsorption is of prime importance but challenging in the petrochemical industry. Herein, a chemically stable Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF), Co(pyz)[Ni(CN)4] (termed as ZJU&#8208;74a), that features sandwich&#8208;like binding sites for benchmark C2H2 capture and separation is reported. Gas sorption isotherms reveal that ZJU&#8208;74a exhibits by far the record C2H2 capture capacity (49 cm3 g&#8722;1 at 0.01 bar and 296 K) and thus ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 (36.5), C2H2/C2H4 (24.2), and C2H2/CH4 (1312.9) separation at ambient conditions, respectively, of which the C2H2/CO2 selectivity is the highest among all the robust MOFs reported so far. Theoretical calculations indicate that the oppositely adjacent nickel(II) centers together with cyanide groups from different layers in ZJU&#8208;74a can construct a sandwich&#8208;type adsorption site to offer dually strong and cooperative interactions for the C2H2 molecule, thus leading to its ultrahigh C2H2 capture capacity and selectivities. The exceptional separation performance of ZJU&#8208;74a is confirmed by both simulated and experimental breakthrough curves for 50/50 (v/v) C2H2/CO2, 1/99 C2H2/C2H4, and 50/50 C2H2/CH4 mixtures under ambient conditions.

      <title>Morphogenesis Guided by 3D Patterning of Growth Factors in Biological Matrices</title>
      <dc:description>
A two&#8208;photon patterning (2PP) method introduces enzymatic couplings, nonfouling hydrophilic photocages, and improved protein functionalization reagents, which together enable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) patterning of sensitive growth factors in complex mammalian matrices. One&#8208;step procedures are possible, as well time&#8208;controlled growth factor presentation in native matrices and low&#8208;background 2PP. These developments lead to the first demonstration of morphogenesis guided by 3D&#8208;patterned growth factors.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) control over the placement of bioactive cues is fundamental to understand cell guidance and develop engineered tissues. Two&#8208;photon patterning (2PP) provides such placement at micro&#8208; to millimeter scale, but nonspecific interactions between proteins and functionalized extracellular matrices (ECMs) restrict its use. Here, a 2PP system based on nonfouling hydrophilic photocages and Sortase A (SA)&#8208;based enzymatic coupling is presented, which offers unprecedented orthogonality and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in both inert hydrogels and complex mammalian matrices. Improved photocaged peptide synthesis and protein functionalization protocols with broad applicability are introduced. Importantly, the method enables 2PP in a single step in the presence of fragile biomolecules and cells, and is compatible with time&#8208;controlled growth factor presentation. As a corollary, the guidance of axons through 3D&#8208;patterned nerve growth factor (NGF) within brain&#8208;mimetic ECMs is demonstrated. The approach allows for the interrogation of the role of complex signaling molecules in 3D matrices, thus helping to better understand biological guidance in tissue development and regeneration.

      <title>A Nitric Oxide (NO) Nanoreporter for Noninvasive Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Macrophage Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A nitric oxide nanoreporter (NO&#8208;NR) is reported that enables non&#8208;invasive imaging of macrophage immunotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the NO&#8208;NR system, which co&#8208;delivers an inhibitor and an imaging agent, leads to enhanced efficacy and a better imaging signal. These studies demonstrate that the NO nanoreporter tool can be used as an activatable imaging agent to monitor macrophage immunotherapy response in real time.








Abstract
Macrophage&#8208;centered therapeutic approaches that rely on immune modulation of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) from a pro&#8208;tumorigenic phenotype (M2) to an anti&#8208;tumorigenic phenotype (M1) have facilitated a paradigm shift in macrophage immunotherapy. However, limited clinical success has been achieved due to the low response rates observed in different types of cancers. The ability to measure immune response in real time is critical in order to differentiate responders from non&#8208;responders; however, there are currently no platforms to monitor real&#8208;time macrophage immunotherapy response. Hence, there is an immediate need to develop imaging techniques that can longitudinally monitor macrophage immunotherapy response. Nitric oxide (NO) produced as a result of activation of macrophages to an anti&#8208;tumorigenic state is considered as a hallmark of M1 and can be a direct indication of response. In this study, a NO nanoreporter (NO&#8208;NR) is reported that enables real&#8208;time monitoring of macrophage immunotherapy drugs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it is observed that sustained inhibition of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) using a CSF1R inhibitor&#8211;NO&#8208;NR system leads to enhanced efficacy and better imaging signal. In conclusion, a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind NO nanoreporter tool is reported that can be used as an activatable imaging agent to monitor macrophage immunotherapy response in real time.

      <title>A Wearable Supercapacitor Based on Conductive PEDOT:PSS&#8208;Coated Cloth and a Sweat Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>
To power devices on smart textiles and wearable systems, a textile&#8208;based supercapacitor using sweat as an electrolyte is presented. In comparison with traditional toxic electrolytes, the sweat electrolyte is safe for wearables. The supercapacitor uses poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) as the active electrode and the observed energy and power densities with sweat are 0.095 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 3.81 W kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
A sweat&#8208;based flexible supercapacitor (SC) for self&#8208;powered smart textiles and wearable systems is presented. The developed SC uses sweat as the electrolyte and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the active electrode. With PEDOT:PSS coated onto cellulose/polyester cloth, the SC shows specific capacitance of 8.94 F g&#8722;1 (10 mF cm&#8722;2) at 1 mV s&#8722;1. With artificial sweat, the energy and power densities of the SC are 1.36 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 329.70 W kg&#8722;1, respectively for 1.31 V and its specific capacitance is 5.65 F g&#8722;1. With real human sweat the observed energy and power densities are 0.25 Wh kg&#8722;1, and 30.62 W kg&#8722;1, respectively. The SC performance is evaluated with different volumes of sweat (20, 50, and 100 &#181;L), bending radii (10, 15, 20 mm), charging/discharging stability (4000 cycles), and washability. With successful on&#8208;body testing, the first demonstration of the suitability of a sweat&#8208;based SC for self&#8208;powered cloth&#8208;based sensors to monitor sweat salinity is presented. With attractive performance and the use of body fluids, the presented approach is a safe and sustainable route to meet the power requirements in wearable systems.

     alt="A Wearable Supercapacitor Based on Conductive PEDOT:PSS&#8208;Coated Cloth and a Sweat Electrolyte"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To power devices on smart textiles and wearable systems, a textile&#8208;based supercapacitor using sweat as an electrolyte is presented. In comparison with traditional toxic electrolytes, the sweat electrolyte is safe for wearables. The supercapacitor uses poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) as the active electrode and the observed energy and power densities with sweat are 0.095 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 3.81 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sweat&#8208;based flexible supercapacitor (SC) for self&#8208;powered smart textiles and wearable systems is presented. The developed SC uses sweat as the electrolyte and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) as the active electrode. With PEDOT:PSS coated onto cellulose/polyester cloth, the SC shows specific capacitance of 8.94 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (10 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 1 mV s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With artificial sweat, the energy and power densities of the SC are 1.36 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 329.70 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively for 1.31 V and its specific capacitance is 5.65 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With real human sweat the observed energy and power densities are 0.25 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 30.62 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The SC performance is evaluated with different volumes of sweat (20, 50, and 100 &#181;L), bending radii (10, 15, 20 mm), charging/discharging stability (4000 cycles), and washability. With successful on&#8208;body testing, the first demonstration of the suitability of a sweat&#8208;based SC for self&#8208;powered cloth&#8208;based sensors to monitor sweat salinity is presented. With attractive performance and the use of body fluids, the presented approach is a safe and sustainable route to meet the power requirements in wearable systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asymmetric Electron Acceptors for High&#8208;Efficiency and Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
Asymmetric electron acceptors by combining halogenated indandione and 3&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;1&#8208;indanone as two different conjugated terminals are designed and synthesized. Such design enables reduced energy loss and boosted charge separation, thus leading to 16.37% binary organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and 17.43% ternary OPVs, which are among the best efficiencies for single&#8208;junction OPVs.








Abstract
Low energy loss and efficient charge separation under small driving forces are the prerequisites for realizing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here, a new molecular design of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) is proposed to address above two issues simultaneously by introducing asymmetric terminals. Two NFAs, BTP&#8208;S1 and BTP&#8208;S2, are constructed by introducing halogenated indandione (A1) and 3&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;1&#8208;indanone (A2) as two different conjugated terminals on the central fused core (D), wherein they share the same backbone as well&#8208;known NFA Y6, but at different terminals. Such asymmetric NFAs with A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2 structure exhibit superior photovoltaic properties when blended with polymer donor PM6. Energy loss analysis reveals that asymmetric molecule BTP&#8208;S2 with six chlorine atoms attached at the terminals enables the corresponding devices to give an outstanding electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;2%, one order of magnitude higher than devices based on symmetric Y6 (4.4 &#215; 10&#8722;3%), thus significantly lowering the nonradiative loss and energy loss of the corresponding devices. Besides, asymmetric BTP&#8208;S1 and BTP&#8208;S2 with multiple halogen atoms at the terminals exhibit fast hole transfer to the donor PM6. As a result, OPVs based on the PM6:BTP&#8208;S2 blend realize a PCE of 16.37%, higher than that (15.79%) of PM6:Y6&#8208;based OPVs. A further optimization of the ternary blend (PM6:Y6:BTP&#8208;S2) results in a best PCE of 17.43%, which is among the highest efficiencies for single&#8208;junction OPVs. This work provides an effective approach to simultaneously lower the energy loss and promote the charge separation of OPVs by molecular design strategy.

      <title>A Generalized Surface Chalcogenation Strategy for Boosting the Electrochemical N2 Fixation of Metal Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface chalcogenation is demonstrated as a highly universal and efficient strategy to improve the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance of various metal nanocrystals (NCs), where the optimized surface selenated Rh NCs (Rh&#8208;Se NCs) exhibit excellent NRR performance with NH3 production about 16.0 folds higher than that of Rh NCs, opening a versatile approach for future NH3 production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising process relative to energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. While conventional electrocatalysts underperform with sluggish paths, achieving dissociation of N2 brings the key challenge for enhancing NRR. This study proposes an effective surface chalcogenation strategy to improve the NRR performance of pristine metal nanocrystals (NCs). Surprisingly, the NH3 yield and Faraday efficiency (FE) (175.6 &#177; 23.6 mg h&#8211;1 g&#8211;1Rh and 13.3 &#177; 0.4%) of Rh&#8208;Se NCs is significantly enhanced by 16 and 15 times, respectively. Detailed investigations show that the superior activity and high FE are attributed to the effect of surface chalcogenation, which not only can decrease the apparent activation energy, but also inhibit the occurrence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interface strain effect within core@shell system induces a critical redox inversion, resulting in a rather low valence state of Rh and Se surface sites. Such strong correlation indicates an efficient electron&#8208;transfer minimizing NRR barrier. Significantly, the surface chalcogenation strategy is general, which can extend to create other NRR metal electrocatalysts with enhanced performance. This strategy open a new avenue for future NH3 production for breakthrough in the bottleneck of NRR.

      <title>Cobalt Plasmonic Superstructures Enable Almost 100% Broadband Photon Efficient CO2 Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A cobalt plasmonic superstructure is developed to enable almost 100% broadband photon efficient CO2 photocatalysis through enhanced plasmonic excitation by the hybridization of Co nanoparticles in close proximity, as well as inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;band transitions. This work will bridge the gap between plasmonic absorbers with photothermal catalysis, toward the complete utilization of the solar energy.








Abstract
The efficiency of heterogeneous photocatalysis for converting solar to chemical energy is low on a per photon basis mainly because of the difficulty of capturing and utilizing light across the entire solar spectral wavelength range. This challenge is addressed herein with a plasmonic superstructure, fashioned as an array of nanoscale needles comprising cobalt nanocrystals assembled within a sheath of porous silica grown on a fluorine tin oxide substrate. This plasmonic superstructure can strongly absorb sunlight through different mechanisms including enhanced plasmonic excitation by the hybridization of Co nanoparticles in close proximity, as well as inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;band transitions. With nearly 100% sunlight harvesting ability, it drives the photothermal hydrogenation of carbon dioxide with a 20&#8208;fold rate increase from the silica&#8208;supported cobalt catalyst. The present work bridges the gap between strong light&#8208;absorbing plasmonic superstructures with photothermal CO2 catalysis toward the complete utilization of the solar energy.

      <title>Enhancement of the Magnetic Coupling in Exfoliated CrCl3 Crystals Observed by Low&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Force Microscopy and X&#8208;ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism</title>
      <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism are used to investigate micromechanically cleaved flakes of chromium trichloride crystals, highlighting a ninefold increase of antiferromagnetic coupling between layers after exfoliation. Joint topographic and magnetic measurements by MFM on individual flakes show a common behavior in the 10&#8211;50 nm thickness range.








Abstract
Magnetic crystals formed by 2D layers interacting by weak van der Waals forces are currently a hot research topic. When these crystals are thinned to nanometric size, they can manifest strikingly different magnetic behavior compared to the bulk form. This can be the result of, for example, quantum electronic confinement effects, the presence of defects, or pinning of the crystallographic structure in metastable phases induced by the exfoliation process. In this work, an investigation of the magnetism of micromechanically cleaved CrCl3 flakes with thickness &gt;10 nm is performed. These flakes are characterized by superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism, and spatially resolved magnetic force microscopy. The results highlight an enhancement of the CrCl3 antiferromagnetic interlayer interaction that appears to be independent of the flake size when the thickness is tens of nanometers. The estimated exchange field is 9 kOe, representing an increase of &#8776;900% compared to the one of the bulk crystals. This effect can be attributed to the pinning of the high&#8208;temperature monoclinic structure, as recently suggested by polarized Raman spectroscopy investigations in thin (8&#8211;35 nm) CrCl3 flakes.

      <title>Unidirectional and Selective Proton Transport in Artificial Heterostructured Nanochannels with Nano&#8208;to&#8208;Subnano Confined Water Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/polymer nanochannels are constructed, where water molecules are confined to ordered chains with unique molecular configurations in the 1D sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm porous MOF regions and to disordered clusters in the nanometer&#8208;sized polymer regions, to realize unidirectional, fast, and selective proton transport properties, analogous to natural voltage&#8208;gated proton channels.








Abstract
The construction of biological proton channel analogues has attracted substantial interest owing to their wide potential in separation of ions, sensing, and energy conversion. Here, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/polymer heterogeneous nanochannels are presented, in which water molecules are confined to disordered clusters in the nanometer&#8208;sized polymer regions and to ordered chains with unique molecular configurations in the 1D sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm porous MOF regions, to realize unidirectional, fast, and selective proton transport properties, analogous to natural proton channels. Given the nano&#8208;to&#8208;subnano confined water junctions, experimental proton conductivities in the polymer&#8208;to&#8208;MOF direction of the channels are much higher than those in the opposite direction, showing a high rectification up to 500 and one to two orders of magnitude enhancement compared to the conductivity of proton transport in bulk water. The channels also show a good proton selectivity over other cations. Theoretical simulations further reveal that the preferential and fast proton conduction in the nano&#8208;to&#8208;subnano channel direction is attributed to extremely low energy barriers for proton transport from disordered to ordered water clusters. This study opens a novel approach to regulate ion permeability and selectivity of artificial ion channels.

      <title>Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Controlled Release and Related Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;change materials feature drastic increase in molecular mobility upon melting. Leveraging this attribute, they are actively explored as a novel class of thermo&#8208;responsive materials for the encapsulation and release of various types of payloads, including anticancer drugs, inorganic ions, reactive species, biomacromolecules, and even functional nanoparticles, in a controllable manner.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) have emerged as a novel class of thermo&#8208;responsive materials for controlled release, where the payloads encapsulated in a solid matrix are released only upon melting the PCM to trigger a solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition. Herein, the advances over the past 10 years in utilizing PCMs as a versatile platform for the encapsulation and release of various types of therapeutic agents and biological effectors are highlighted. A brief introduction to PCMs in the context of desired properties for controlled release and related applications is provided. Among the various types of PCMs, a specific focus is placed on fatty acids and fatty alcohols for their natural availability, low toxicity, biodegradability, diversity, high abundance, and low cost. Then, various methods capable of processing PCMs, and their mixtures with payloads, into stable suspensions of colloidal particles, and the different means for triggering the solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition are discussed. Finally, a range of applications enabled by the controlled release system based on PCMs are presented together with some perspectives on future directions.

      <dc:description>
In article number 1904551, Paul Mulvaney and co&#8208;workers review the development of single nanocrystal fabrication and assembly. Directed assembly methods rely on an external force to drive pre&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials onto a templated surface. These methods offer nanometer spatial resolution for a wide range of materials and they also offer scalability. A CdSe/CdS quantum dot array being nanofabricated by electrophoretic assembly is depicted. The background shows the scattered light (red) observed from real arrays.

      <title>Designing with Light: Advanced 2D, 3D, and 4D Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Light is a powerful stimulus, providing easy access to spatiotemporal control, and has been widely employed for material design. As such, photochemical methods empower the fabrication of sophisticated 2D, 3D, and 4D materials at lengths ranging from nano&#8208; to macroscale.








Abstract
Recent achievements and future opportunities for the design of 2D, 3D, and 4D materials using photochemical reactions are summarized. Light is an attractive stimulus for material design due to its outstanding spatiotemporal control, and its ability to mediate rapid polymerization under moderate reaction temperatures. These features have been significantly enhanced by major advances in light generation/manipulation with light&#8208;emitting diodes and optical fiber technologies which now allows for a broad range of cost&#8208;effective fabrication protocols. This combination is driving the preparation of sophisticated 2D, 3D, and 4D materials at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macrosize scales. Looking ahead, future challenges and opportunities that will significantly impact the field and help shape the future of light as a versatile and tunable design tool are highlighted.

      <dc:description>
An overview of the direct assembly methods used to fabricate single nanocrystal arrays is provided. The five principal methods used and the advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed. Potential future developments in the field are also presented.








Abstract
To realize the full potential of nanocrystals in nanotechnology, it is necessary to integrate single nanocrystals into addressable structures; for example, arrays and periodic lattices. The current methods for achieving this are reviewed. It is shown that a combination of top&#8208;down lithography techniques with directed assembly offers a platform for attaining this goal. The most promising of these directed assembly methods are reviewed: capillary force assembly, electrostatic assembly, optical printing, DNA&#8208;based assembly, and electrophoretic deposition. The last of these appears to offer a generic approach to fabrication of single&#8208;nanocrystal arrays.

      <dc:description>
Semiconductor surfaces can be modified by depositing metal clusters. Metal clusters have unique properties that change with the number of atoms forming the clusters. The procedures for depositing clusters onto semiconductor surfaces and the application of cluster&#8208;modified semiconductor surfaces in catalysis are addressed and experimental techniques for analyzing the surfaces are briefly reviewed.








Abstract
Metal clusters typically consist of two to a few hundred atoms and have unique properties that change with the type and number of atoms that form the cluster. Metal clusters can be generated with a precise number of atoms, and therefore have specific size, shape, and electronic structures. When metal clusters are deposited onto a substrate, their shape and electronic structure depend on the interaction with the substrate surface and thus depend on the properties of both the clusters and those of the substrate. Deposited metal clusters have discrete, individual electron energy levels that differ from the electron energy levels in the constituting individual atoms, isolated clusters, and the respective bulk material. The properties of clusters with a focus on Au and Ru, the methods to generate metal clusters, and the methods of deposition of clusters onto substrate surfaces are covered. The properties of cluster&#8208;modified surfaces are important for their application. The main application covered here is catalysis, and the methods for characterization of the cluster&#8208;modified surfaces are described.

      <title>Glycogen as a Building Block for Advanced Biological Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Glycogen is one of nature's unique biological polysaccharide nanoparticles, which holds promise as a material for biomedical, including therapeutic, applications. The recent literature on advancing glycogen as a building block for advanced biofunctional materials is reviewed.








Abstract
Biological nanoparticles found in living systems possess distinct molecular architectures and diverse functions. Glycogen is a unique biological polysaccharide nanoparticle fabricated by nature through a bottom&#8208;up approach. The biocatalytic synthesis of glycogen has evolved over time to form a nanometer&#8208;sized dendrimer&#8208;like structure (20&#8211;150 nm) with a highly branched surface and a dense core. This makes glycogen markedly different from other natural linear or branched polysaccharides and particularly attractive as a platform for biomedical applications. Glycogen is inherently biodegradable, nontoxic, and can be functionalized with diverse surface and internal motifs for enhanced biofunctional properties. Recently, there has been growing interest in glycogen as a natural alternative to synthetic polymers and nanoparticles in a range of applications. Herein, the recent literature on glycogen in the material&#8208;based sciences, including its use as a constituent in biodegradable hydrogels and fibers, drug delivery vectors, tumor targeting and penetrating nanoparticles, immunomodulators, vaccine adjuvants, and contrast agents, is reviewed. The various methods of chemical functionalization and physical assembly of glycogen nanoparticles into multicomponent nanodevices, which advance glycogen toward a functional therapeutic nanoparticle from nature and back again, are discussed in detail.

      <title>&#8220;Lattice Strain Matching&#8221;&#8208;Enabled Nanocomposite Design to Harness the Exceptional Mechanical Properties of Nanomaterials in Bulk Forms</title>
      <dc:description>
Lattice strain matching between the uniform elastic strains of nanowires and the uniform lattice&#8208;distortion strain of the martensitic transformation of the matrix in composites allows an effective load transfer from the matrix to the nanowires. This induces ultralarge elastic strains in nanowires, overcoming a long&#8208;standing challenge to harness the superior intrinsic properties of nanomaterials in bulk forms.








Abstract
Nanosized materials are known to have the ability to withstand ultralarge elastic strains (4&#8211;10%) and to have ultrahigh strengths approaching their theoretical limits. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to harnessing their exceptional intrinsic mechanical properties in bulk forms. This is commonly known as &#8220;the valley of death&#8221; in nanocomposite design. In 2013, a breakthrough was made to overcome this challenge by using a martensitic phase transforming matrix to create a composite in which ultralarge elastic lattice strains up to 6.7% are achieved in Nb nanoribbons embedded in it. This breakthrough was enabled by a novel concept of phase transformation assisted lattice strain matching between the uniform ultralarge elastic strains (4&#8211;10%) of nanomaterials and the uniform crystallographic lattice distortion strains (4&#8211;10%) of the martensitic phase transformation of the matrix. This novel concept has opened new opportunities for developing materials of exceptional mechanical properties or enhanced functional properties that are not possible before. The work in progress in this research over the past six years is reported.

      <title>Advanced Actuator Materials Powered by Biomimetic Helical Fiber Topologies</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanical actuation systems in plants and animals almost always involve helical structures and studies show that a helical arrangement of fibers in a compliant matrix generates a great diversity of movements and mechanical amplifications. Opportunities are identified to develop advanced artificial muscles since only a limited number of nature's mechanisms have been recreated in biomimetic systems to date.








Abstract
Helical constructs are ubiquitous in nature at all size domains, from molecular to macroscopic. The helical topology confers unique mechanical functions that activate certain phenomena, such as twining vines and vital cellular functions like the folding and packing of DNA into chromosomes. The understanding of active mechanical processes in plants, certain musculature in animals, and some biochemical processes in cells provides insight into the versatility of the helix. Most of these natural systems consist of helically oriented filaments embedded in a compliant matrix. In some cases, the matrix can change volume and in others the filaments can contract and the matrix is passive. In both cases, the helically arranged fibers determine the overall shape change with a great variety of responses involving length contraction/elongation, twisting, bending, and coiling. Synthetic actuator materials and systems that employ helical topologies have been described recently and demonstrate many fascinating and complex shape changes. However, significant new opportunities exist to mimic some of the most remarkable actions in nature, including the Vorticella's coiling stalk and DNA's supercoils, in the quest for superior artificial muscles.

      <title>Liquefied Sunshine: Transforming Renewables into Fertilizers and Energy Carriers with Electromaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Australia has an enormous potential to generate renewable energy from wind and solar, vastly more than is needed for domestic use. Most of this generation capacity is in remote regions such that means of transporting and storing this energy is required. Advances in the electrochemical production of chemical energy carriers including hydrogen, reduced carbon compounds, and ammonia are discussed.








Abstract
It has become apparent that renewable energy sources are plentiful in many, often remote, parts of the world, such that storing and transporting that energy has become the key challenge. For long&#8208;distance transportation by pipeline and bulk tanker, a liquid form of energy carrier is ideal, focusing attention on liquid hydrogen and ammonia. Development of high&#8208;activity and selectivity electrocatalyst materials to produce these energy carriers by reductive electrochemistry has therefore become an important area of research. Here, recent developments and challenges in the field of electrocatalytic materials for these processes are discussed, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Some of the mis&#8208;steps currently plaguing the nitrogen reduction to ammonia field are highlighted. The rapidly growing roles that in situ/operando and quantum chemical studies can play in new electromaterials discovery are also surveyed.

      <title>Shaping the Future of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes through Computational Modeling</title>
      <dc:description>
Developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for use in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is challenging due to their low rates of diffusion compared to liquids, and complexities at the SSE/electrode interfaces. The role of theoretical simulations in dealing with these challenges is reviewed and a brief outlook about the future of simulations in studying the ASSB technology is presented.








Abstract
Advances and progress in computational research that aims to understand and improve solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are outlined. One of the main challenges in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is the design of new SSEs with high ion diffusivity that maintain chemical and phase stability and thereby provide a wide electrochemical stability window. Solving this problem requires a deep understanding of the diffusion mechanism and properties of the SSEs. A second important challenge is the development of an understanding of the interface between the SSE and the electrode. The role of molecular simulations and modeling in dealing with these challenges is discussed, with reference to examples in the literature. The methods used and issues considered in recent years are highlighted. Finally, a brief outlook about the future of modeling in studying solid&#8208;state battery technology is presented.

      <title>Solvation&#8208;Involved Nanoionics: New Opportunities from 2D Nanomaterial Laminar Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
Solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics is the study of ion transport and storage in nanoporous structures immersed in liquids involving various short&#8208;range atomic interactions. The fundamentals are introduced and the progress and opportunities enabled by 2D nanomaterial laminar membranes are discussed, which is of great interest for energy storage, desalination, ionic devices, and others.








Abstract
Nanoporous laminar membranes composed of multilayered 2D nanomaterials (2D&#8208;NLMs) are increasingly being exploited as a unique material platform for understanding solvated ion transport under nanoconfinement and exploring novel nanoionics&#8208;related applications, such as ion sieving, energy storage and harvesting, and in other new ionic devices. Here, the fundamentals of solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics in terms of ionic interactions and their effect on ionic transport behaviors are discussed. This is followed by a summary of key requirements for materials that are being used for solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics research, culminating in a demonstration of unique features of 2D&#8208;NLMs. Selected examples of using 2D&#8208;NLMs to address the key scientific problems related to nanoconfined ion transport and storage are then presented to demonstrate their enormous potential and capabilities for nanoionics research and applications.

      <title>Nanostructured Carbon Nitrides for CO2 Capture and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured carbon nitride (CN) is studied as an advantageous platform for simultaneous CO2 capture and conversion to valuable feedstock using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, with remarkable catalytic activity, long durability, and high selectivity. The progressively discovered various novel CN materials and their hybrid nanostructures for the catalytic reduction of CO2 are highlighted, along with research challenges, opportunities, and future perspectives on this topic.








Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN), a 2D material composed of only carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), which are linked by strong covalent bonds, has been used as a metal&#8208;devoid and visible&#8208;light&#8208;active photocatalyst owing to its magnificent optoelectronic and physicochemical properties including suitable bandgap, adjustable energy&#8208;band positions, tailor&#8208;made surface functionalities, low cost, metal&#8208;free nature, and high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stabilities. CN&#8208;based materials possess a lot of advantages over conventional metal&#8208;based inorganic photocatalysts including ease of synthesis and processing, versatile functionalization or doping, flexibility for surface engineering, low cost, sustainability, and recyclability without any leaching of toxic metals from photocorrosion. Carbon nitrides and their hybrid materials have emerged as attractive candidates for CO2 capture and its reduction into clean and green low&#8208;carbon fuels and valuable chemical feedstock by using sustainable and intermittent renewable energy sources of sunlight and electricity through the heterogeneous photo(electro)catalysis. Here, the latest research results in this field are summarized, including implementation of novel functionalized nanostructured CNs and their hybrid heterostructures in meeting the stringent requirements to raise the efficiency of the CO2 reduction process by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and feedstock reactions. The research in this field is primarily focused on advancement in the synthesis of nanostructured and functionalized CN&#8208;based hybrid heterostructured materials. More importantly, the recent past has seen a surge in studies focusing significantly on exploring the mechanism of their application perspectives, which include the behavior of the materials for the absorption of light, charge separation, and pathways for the transport of CO2 during the reduction process.

      <title>Role of Biomaterials and Controlled Architecture on Tendon/Ligament Repair and Regeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
Engineering synthetic tendons and ligaments (T/L) capable of both supporting appropriate tissue growth and providing biomechanical support for physiological loading is a significant challenge. Recent developments in the understanding of both material and architectural parameters that influence the repair and regeneration of T/L and advances in fabrication techniques are reviewed.








Abstract
Engineering synthetic scaffolds to repair and regenerate ruptured native tendon and ligament (T/L) tissues is a significant engineering challenge due to the need to satisfy both the unique biological and biomechanical properties of these tissues. Long&#8208;term clinical outcomes of synthetic scaffolds relying solely on high uniaxial tensile strength are poor with high rates of implant rupture and synovitis. Ideal biomaterials for T/L repair and regeneration need to possess the appropriate biological and biomechanical properties necessary for the successful repair and regeneration of ruptured tendon and ligament tissues.

      <title>The Quest for Zero Loss: Unconventional Materials for Plasmonics</title>
      <dc:description>
The quest for superior plasmonic materials is discussed and the evolution of the field from the elements, through to alloys and intermetallic compounds, semiconductors, conducting oxides and, most recently, topological insulators, considered. Although both gold and silver remain very attractive choices for plasmonic devices, it is shown that there are instances where alternative materials may be a better choice.








Abstract
There has been an ongoing quest to optimize the materials used to build plasmonic devices: first the elements were investigated, then alloys and intermetallic compounds, later semiconductors were considered, and, most recently, there has been interest in using more exotic materials such as topological insulators and conducting oxides. The quality of the plasmon resonances in these materials is closely correlated with their structure and properties. In general gold and silver are the most commonly specified materials for these applications but they do have weaknesses. Here, it is shown how, in specific circumstances, the selection of certain other materials might be more useful. Candidate alternatives include TixN, VO2, Al, Cu, Al&#8208;doped ZnO, and Cu&#8211;Al alloys. The relative merits of these choices and the many pitfalls and subtle problems that arise are discussed, and a frank perspective on the field is provided.

&lt;p&gt;The quest for superior plasmonic materials is discussed and the evolution of the field from the elements, through to alloys and intermetallic compounds, semiconductors, conducting oxides and, most recently, topological insulators, considered. Although both gold and silver remain very attractive choices for plasmonic devices, it is shown that there are instances where alternative materials may be a better choice.

      <dc:description>
Antibiotic&#8208;free strategies are promising candidates to revolutionize approaches to control bacterial infection. Recent progress in antibiotic&#8208;free antibacterial approaches driven by innovations in advanced nanomaterials is highlighted. Their antibacterial mechanisms, structure&#8211;performance relationship, and current translation into practical antibacterial applications are summarized. Insights into a future without antibiotics are presented.








Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the top ten leading causes of death globally and the worst killer in low&#8208;income countries. The overuse of antibiotics leads to ever&#8208;increasing antibiotic resistance, posing a severe threat to human health. Recent advances in nanotechnology provide new opportunities to address the challenges in bacterial infection by killing germs without using antibiotics. Antibiotic&#8208;free antibacterial strategies enabled by advanced nanomaterials are presented. Nanomaterials are classified on the basis of their mode of action: nanomaterials with intrinsic or light&#8208;mediated bactericidal properties and others that serve as vehicles for the delivery of natural antibacterial compounds. Specific attention is given to antibacterial mechanisms and the structure&#8211;performance relationship. Practical antibacterial applications employing these antibiotic&#8208;free strategies are also introduced. Current challenges in this field and future perspectives are presented to stimulate new technologies and their translation to fight against bacterial infection.

      <title>Challenges in Fluorescence Detection of Chemical Warfare Agent Vapors Using Solid&#8208;State Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorescence&#8208;based detection is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting and identifying potential threats such as nerve agents. Due to the highly toxic nature of the agents themselves, studies to develop sensors have normally involved simulants. However, care is needed when interpreting the results of studies using common simulants.








Abstract
Organophosphorus (OP)&#8208;based nerve agents are extremely toxic and potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and recent attacks involving nerve agents highlight the need for fast detection and intervention. Fluorescence&#8208;based detection, where the sensing material undergoes a chemical reaction with the agent causing a measurable change in the luminescence, is one method for sensing and identifying nerve agents. Most studies use the simulants diethylchlorophosphate and di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylfluorophosphate to evaluate the performance of sensors due to their reduced toxicity relative to OP nerve agents. While detection of nerve agent simulants in solution is relatively widely reported, there are fewer reports on vapor detection using solid&#8208;state sensors. Herein, progress in organic semiconductor sensing materials developed for solid&#8208;state detection of OP&#8208;based nerve agent vapors is reviewed. The effect of acid impurities arising from the hydrolysis of simulants and nerve agents on the efficacy and selectivity of the reported sensing materials is also discussed. Indeed, in some cases it is unclear whether it is the simulant that is detected or the acid hydrolysis products. Finally, it is highlighted that while analyte diffusion into the sensing film is critical in the design of fast, responsive sensing systems, it is an area that is currently not well studied.

      <title>Polycrystalline Advanced Microporous Framework Membranes for Efficient Separation of Small Molecules and Ions</title>
      <dc:description>
Polycrystalline advanced microporous framework membranes (PMFMs) have great potential for use in industrial separation applications. Recent advances in PMFM&#8208;fabrication technologies are highlighted and their applications in gas separation, water desalination, chiral resolution, and ion separation are explored. Some perspectives on further developments and challenges in this field are also presented.








Abstract
Advanced porous framework membranes with excellent selectivity and high permeability of small molecules and ions are highly desirable for many important industrial separation applications. There has been significant progress in the fabrication of polycrystalline microporous framework membranes (PMFMs) in recent years, such as metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework membranes. These membranes possess small pore sizes, which are comparable to the kinetic diameter of small molecules and ions on the angstrom scale, very low thickness, down to tens to hundreds of nanometers, highly oriented crystalline structures, hybrid membrane structures, and specific functional groups for enhancing membrane selectivity and permeability. Recent advances in the fabrication methods of advanced PMFMs are summarized. Following this, four emerging separation applications of these advanced microporous framework membranes, including gas separation, water desalination, ion separation, and chiral separation, are highlighted and discussed in detail. Finally, a summary and some perspectives of future developments and challenges in this exciting research field are presented.

      <dc:description>
The emerging applications of nanoparticle&#8208;enabled single&#8208;molecule detection are introduced. The recent advances in the development of single&#8208;nanoparticle assays for quantitative analysis as well as multiplexed detection are summarized. The key challenges and the prospects in this exciting field of research are also highlighted.








Abstract
Single molecule measurements are revolutionizing the understanding of the stochastics of behavior of single molecules. There is a common theme referred to as a near&#8208;field approach, in how many single molecule measurements are being performed in assays. The term near field is used because the measurement volume is typically very small such that a single molecule, or a single molecule binding pair, within that volume is of an appreciable concentration. The next development in detection will be performing many single molecule measurements at one time such that single molecule measurements can be used as the basis for quantitative analysis. There have already been some notable developments in this direction. Again, all have a common theme in that nanoparticles are used to create many near&#8208;field volumes that can be measured simultaneously. Herein, the coupled developments in nanoparticles and measurement strategies that allow nanoparticles to be the backbone of the next generation of sensing technologies are discussed.

      <title>Understanding Rechargeable Battery Function Using In Operando Neutron Powder Diffraction</title>
      <dc:description>
In operando neutron powder diffraction measurements enable a unique understanding of the phase transformations and structural changes of active materials within functioning batteries to be gained. The development and use of neutron powder diffraction for in operando measurements of rechargeable batteries is summarized, including experimental methods and approaches that impact the insight into battery materials function obtained.








Abstract
The performance of rechargeable batteries is influenced by the structural and phase changes of components during cycling. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) provides unique and useful information concerning the structure&#8211;function relation of battery components and can be used to study the changes to component phase and structure during battery cycling, known as in operando measurement studies. The development and use of NPD for in operando measurements of batteries is summarized along with detailed experimental approaches that impact the insights gained by these. A summary of the information gained concerning battery function using in operando NPD measurements is provided, including the structural and phase evolution of electrode materials and charge&#8208;carrying ion diffusion pathways through these, which are critical to the development of battery technology.

      <title>Exosomes and Nanoengineering: A Match Made for Precision Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in research and development of aptamer&#8208;guided exosomes as a new nanoengineering strategy to achieve targeted drug delivery using bio&#8208;nanoparticles highlight a promising next generation of targeted drug delivery systems. Cross&#8208;fertilization between areas of exosomes and aptamers in both preclinical translational studies predicts a bright future for aptamer&#8208;guided exosomal delivery in precision nanomedicine.








Abstract
Targeted exosomal delivery systems for precision nanomedicine attract wide interest across areas of molecular cell biology, pharmaceutical sciences, and nanoengineering. Exosomes are naturally derived 50&#8211;150 nm nanovesicles that play important roles in cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell and/or cell&#8208;to&#8208;tissue communications and cross&#8208;species communication. Exosomes are also a promising class of novel drug delivery vehicles owing to their ability to shield their payload from chemical and enzymatic degradations as well as to evade recognition by and subsequent removal by the immune system. Combined with a new class of affinity ligands known as aptamers or chemical antibodies, molecularly targeted exosomes are poised to become the next generation of smartly engineered nanovesicles for precision medicine. Here, recent advances in targeted exosomal delivery systems engineered by aptamer for future strategies to promote human health using this class of human&#8208;derived nanovesicles are summarized.

Disruptive second&#8208;skin&#8208;like wearable biosensing technologies may enable a paradigm shift from current wearable 1.0 to future wearable 2.0 products. This may lead to ultimate biointegrated electronics transforming the healthcare industries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development in the key phases of future wearable technology is summarized in a progressive sequence, namely, wear &#8594; sense &#8594; communicate &#8594; analyze &#8594; interpret &#8594; decide.








Abstract
The wearable industry is on the rise, with a myriad of technical applications ranging from real&#8208;time health monitoring, the Internet of Things, and robotics, to name but a few. However, there is a saying &#8220;wearable is not wearable&#8221; because the current market&#8208;available wearable sensors are largely bulky and rigid, leading to uncomfortable wearing experience, motion artefacts, and poor data accuracy. This has aroused a world&#8208;wide intensive research quest for novel materials, with the aim of fabricating next&#8208;generation ultra&#8208;lightweight and soft wearable devices.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Polymeric Materials through Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking has recently emerged as a promising strategy for creating high&#8208;performance polymeric materials via self&#8208;association of multiple hydrogen bonds or the addition of external cross&#8208;linkers. These polymers exhibit a unique combination of high strength, large extensibility, thermostability, and even healable capability. Such a performance portfolio enables these polymeric materials to find many potential applications in the electronics and gas&#8208;separation fields.








Abstract
It has always been critical to develop high&#8208;performance polymeric materials with exceptional mechanical strength and toughness, thermal stability, and even healable properties for meeting performance requirements in industry. Conventional chemical cross&#8208;linking leads to enhanced mechanical strength and thermostability at the expense of extensibility due to mutually exclusive mechanisms. Such major challenges have recently been addressed by using noncovalent cross&#8208;linking of reversible multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonds (H&#8208;bonds) that widely exist in biological materials, such as silk and muscle. Recent decades have witnessed the development of many tailor&#8208;made high&#8208;performance H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials. Here, recent advances in H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking strategies are reviewed for creating high&#8208;performance polymeric materials. H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking of polymers can be realized via i) self&#8208;association of interchain multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions or specific H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking motifs, such as 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidone units with self&#8208;complementary quadruple H&#8208;bonds and ii) addition of external cross&#8208;linkers, including small molecules, nanoparticles, and polymer aggregates. The resultant cross&#8208;linked polymers normally exhibit tunable high strength, large extensibility, improved thermostability, and healable capability. Such performance portfolios enable these advanced polymers to find many significant cutting&#8208;edge applications. Major challenges facing existing H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking strategies are discussed, and some promising approaches for designing H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials in the future are also proposed.

      <title>Microplasmas for Advanced Materials and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Microplasmas with exotic high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and nonequilibrium features are highly promising for the development of advanced materials and devices. The unique and useful properties of microplasmas, recent progress in nanomaterials production, and commercial applications are reviewed. The analysis may help guide rational synthesis of advanced functional materials and design of plasma devices in the future to meet the emerging demands in various fields.








Abstract
Microplasmas are low&#8208;temperature plasmas that feature microscale dimensions and a unique high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and a nonequilibrium reactive environment, which makes them promising for the fabrication of advanced nanomaterials and devices for diverse applications. Here, recent microplasma applications are examined, spanning from high&#8208;throughput, printing&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible synthesis of nanocrystalline particles of common materials types, to water purification and optoelectronic devices. Microplasmas combined with gaseous and/or liquid media at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure open new ways to form advanced functional materials and devices. Specific examples include gas&#8208;phase, substrate&#8208;free, plasma&#8208;liquid, and surface&#8208;supported synthesis of metallic, semiconducting, metal oxide, and carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials. Representative applications of microplasmas of particular importance to materials science and technology include light sources for multipurpose, efficient VUV/UV light sources for photochemical materials processing and spectroscopic materials analysis, surface disinfection, water purification, active electromagnetic devices based on artificial microplasma optical materials, and other devices and systems including the plasma transistor. The current limitations and future opportunities for microplasma applications in materials related fields are highlighted.

Areas of application considered include nitrogen reduction, two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction, methane partial oxidation, and chorine evolution reactions to electrocatalytically generate ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, methanol, and chorine.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into value&#8208;added commodity chemicals can transform current chemical production regimes with enormous socioeconomic and environmental benefits. For these applications, 2D electrocatalysts have emerged as a new class of high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst with massive forward&#8208;looking potential. Recent advances in 2D electrocatalysts are reviewed for emerging applications that utilize naturally existing H2O, N2, O2, Cl&#8722; (seawater) and CH4 (natural gas) as reactants for nitrogen reduction (N2 &#8594; NH3), two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (O2 &#8594; H2O2), chlorine evolution (Cl&#8722; &#8594; Cl2), and methane partial oxidation (CH4 &#8594; CH3OH) reactions to generate NH3, H2O2, Cl2, and CH3OH. The unique 2D features and effective approaches that take advantage of such features to create high&#8208;performance 2D electrocatalysts are articulated with emphasis. To benefit the readers and expedite future progress, the challenges facing the future development of 2D electrocatalysts for each of the above reactions and the related perspectives are provided.

      <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Separators for Ionic&#8208;Liquid Electrolytes: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Separators with different processing methods, polymers, additives, and different ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes are reviewed, specifically, separator morphology and ionic conductivity with an IL electrolyte. A compatible separator must be developed before ionic liquid electrolytes can be used in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The challenge of a suitable separator for IL electrolytes is not solved yet.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are widely studied as a safer alternative electrolyte for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The properties of IL electrolytes compared to conventional electrolytes make them more thermally stable, but they also have poor wetting with commercial separators. In a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the electrolyte should completely wet out the separator and electrodes to reduce the cell internal resistance. Investigations of cell materials with IL electrolytes have shown that the wetting issues in IL&#8211;electrolyte cells are most likely due to poor separator compatibility, not electrode compatibility. A compatible separator must be developed before IL electrolytes can be used in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, separators for IL electrolytes, including commercial and novel separators, are reviewed. Separators with different processing methods, polymers, additives, and different IL electrolytes are considered. Collated, the separator studies show a strong correlation between ionic conductivity and membrane porosity, even more than the electrolyte type. The challenge of a suitable separator for IL electrolytes is not solved yet. Herein, it is revealed that a separator for IL electrolytes will most likely require a combination of high thermal and mechanical stability polymer, ceramic additives, and an optimized manufacturing process.

Amyloidosis is a biophysical phenomenon of protein aggregation with biological and pathogenic implications. Nanomaterials and nanocomposites possess a wide range of chemical compositions, surface properties, and architecture, thereby offering new solutions to mitigate against amyloidosis.








Abstract
Amyloidosis is a biophysical phenomenon of protein aggregation with biological and pathogenic implications. Among the various strategies developed to date, nanomaterials and multifunctional nanocomposites possessing certain structural and physicochemical traits are promising candidates for mitigating amyloidosis in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms underpinning protein aggregation and toxicity are introduced, and opportunities in materials science to drive this interdisciplinary field forward are highlighted. Advancement of this emerging frontier hinges on exploitation of protein self&#8208;assembly and interactions of amyloid proteins with nanoparticles, intracellular and extracellular proteins, chaperones, membranes, organelles, and biometals.

      <title>The Application of the Rare Earths to Magnesium and Titanium Metallurgy in Australia</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress related to research in Australia on magnesium and titanium metallurgy is reviewed, as rare earth elements (REEs) are of great interest for metallurgical applications. Several institutions are noted for extensive subject&#8208;matter expertise, while both the role of Sc and heavy lanthanides in magnesium, and the application of REEs to titanium additive manufacturing, are identified as promising research areas.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) have found application in metallurgical processes for nearly a century due to their unique chemical and physical properties but have gained increased attention in recent decades. Notably, the use of these elements may assist in the development of advanced magnesium and titanium products for applications spanning biomedicine, aerospace, and the automotive industry. To this end, current progress in this area, highlighting work done in Australian research organizations with particular academic expertise, is reviewed. Two areas that require further research are identified: the application of Sc and the heavy lanthanides to the development of novel magnesium alloys and the use of REEs as additives in the development of additive manufacturing of titanium parts.

      <title>Remedies for Polysulfide Dissolution in Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;NaS) batteries are emerging as a very competitive choice for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. The understanding of and strategies for fatal polysulfide dissolution in sulfur cathodes are of crucial importance. Effective remedies in terms of intact physical confinement, strong chemical interaction, blocking layers, and optimization of electrolytes are summarized, followed by future research directions toward practical RT&#8208;NaS batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;NaS) batteries represent one of the most attractive technologies for future stationary energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. The S cathodes can react with Na ions via two&#8208;electron conversion reactions, thus achieving ultrahigh theoretical capacity (1672 mAh g&#8722;1) and specific energy (1273 Wh kg&#8722;1). Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics of the nonconductive S, severe polysulfide dissolution, and the use of metallic Na are causing enormous challenges for the development of RT&#8208;NaS batteries. Fatal polysulfide dissolution is highlighted, important studies toward polysulfide immobilization and conversion are presented, and the reported remedies in terms of intact physical confinement, strong chemical interaction, blocking layers, and optimization of electrolytes are summarized. Future research directions toward practical RT&#8208;NaS batteries are summarized.

      <title>Toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Metal Batteries: Opportunities and Challenges for Solid Organic Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safe solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are vital to advance today's consumer electronic and automobile applications. The advances in electromaterials research at Deakin University are summarized, with a focus on alternative solid electrolyte designs, including organic ionic plastic crystals, novel polymer electrolytes, and high capacity cathodes.








Abstract
With increasing demands for safe, high capacity energy storage to support personal electronics, newer devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as the commercialization of electric vehicles, current energy storage technologies are facing increased challenges. Although alternative batteries have been intensively investigated, lithium (Li) batteries are still recognized as the preferred energy storage solution for the consumer electronics markets and next generation automobiles. However, the commercialized Li batteries still have disadvantages, such as low capacities, potential safety issues, and unfavorable cycling life. Therefore, the design and development of electromaterials toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span Li batteries with improved safety is a focus for researchers in the field of energy materials. Herein, recent advances in the development of novel organic electrolytes are summarized toward solid&#8208;state Li batteries with higher energy density and improved safety. On the basis of new insights into ionic conduction and design principles of organic&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes, specific strategies toward developing these electrolytes for Li metal anodes, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials (e.g., high voltage materials), as well as the optimization of cathode formulations are outlined. Finally, prospects for next generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes are also proposed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With increasing demands for safe, high capacity energy storage to support personal electronics, newer devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as the commercialization of electric vehicles, current energy storage technologies are facing increased challenges. Although alternative batteries have been intensively investigated, lithium (Li) batteries are still recognized as the preferred energy storage solution for the consumer electronics markets and next generation automobiles. However, the commercialized Li batteries still have disadvantages, such as low capacities, potential safety issues, and unfavorable cycling life. Therefore, the design and development of electromaterials toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span Li batteries with improved safety is a focus for researchers in the field of energy materials. Herein, recent advances in the development of novel organic electrolytes are summarized toward solid&#8208;state Li batteries with higher energy density and improved safety. On the basis of new insights into ionic conduction and design principles of organic&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes, specific strategies toward developing these electrolytes for Li metal anodes, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials (e.g., high voltage materials), as well as the optimization of cathode formulations are outlined. Finally, prospects for next generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes are also proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2D Superlattices for Efficient Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on 2D superlattices prepared by solution&#8208;phase strategies using diverse genuine unilamellar nanosheets as building blocks is summarized. A flocculation strategy is considered an efficient method for large&#8208;scale synthesis of these 2D superlattices. High&#8208;performance devices enabled by these 2D superlattices for energy storage and conversion are presented together with a discussion on challenges and perspectives.








Abstract
2D genuine unilamellar nanosheets, that are, the elementary building blocks of their layered parent crystals, have gained increasing attention, owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, and 2D features. In parallel with the great efforts to isolate these atomic&#8208;thin crystals, a unique strategy to integrate them into 2D vertically stacked heterostuctures has enabled many functional applications. In particular, such 2D heterostructures have recently exhibited numerous exciting electrochemical performances for energy storage and conversion, especially the molecular&#8208;scale heteroassembled superlattices using diverse 2D unilamellar nanosheets as building blocks. Herein, the research progress in scalable synthesis of 2D superlattices with an emphasis on a facile solution&#8208;phase flocculation method is summarized. A particular focus is brought to the advantages of these 2D superlattices in applications of supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries, and water&#8208;splitting catalysis. The challenges and perspectives on this promising field are also outlined.

Abstract
In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the most powerful approaches for revealing physical and chemical process dynamics at atomic resolutions. The most recent developments for in situ TEM techniques are summarized; in particular, how they enable visualization of various events, measure properties, and solve problems in the field of energy by revealing detailed mechanisms at the nanoscale.

Abstract
Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical processes are two key systems in harvesting sunlight for energy and environmental applications.

Here, considerations on selected typical factors governing the performances in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems, even though the same type of semiconductor is used, are provided. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms in relation to their photoactivities is of fundamental importance for rational design of high&#8208;performing photoactive materials, which may serve as a general guideline for the fabrication of good photocatalysts or photoelectrodes toward sustainable solar fuel generation.

      <title>Design Strategies to Enable the Efficient Use of Sodium Metal Anodes in High&#8208;Energy Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
To develop better and safer Na anodes for high&#8208;energy Na&#8208;based batteries, it is essential to improve the understanding of the underlying battery chemistry and the materials applied. Challenges for using Na metal anodes are summarized and the recently developed material and design strategies to enable the efficient use of Na metal anodes are provided.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based batteries have attracted considerable attention and are recognized as ideal candidates for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost energy storage. Sodium (Na) metal anodes are considered as one of the most promising anodes for next&#8208;generation, high&#8208;energy, Na&#8208;based batteries owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1166 mA h g&#8722;1) and low standard electrode potential. Herein, an overview of the recent developments in Na metal anodes for high&#8208;energy batteries is provided. The high reactivity and large volume expansion of Na metal anodes during charge and discharge make the electrode/electrolyte interphase unstable, leading to the formation of Na dendrites, short cycle life, and safety issues. Design strategies to enable the efficient use of Na metal anodes are elucidated, including liquid electrolyte engineering, electrode/electrolyte interface optimization, sophisticated electrode construction, and solid electrolyte engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and future research directions are identified. It is hoped that this progress report will shape a consistent view of this field and provide inspiration for future research to improve Na metal anodes and enable the development of high&#8208;energy sodium batteries.
