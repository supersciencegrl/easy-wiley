         <title>Multifunctional Liquid Metal&#8211;2D Material Composites: Structural Design, Properties, and Applications in Advanced Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal (LM)&#8211;2D material composites combine the high conductivity and fluidity of LM with the anisotropic properties and rich surface chemistry of 2D materials, enabling multifunctional performance in advanced electronics. This review summarizes recent advances in modification, structure, properties, and subsequently discusses current challenges and future prospects for next&#8208;generation multifunctional LM&#8211;2D material composites.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of high&#8208;integration electronics demands materials that unify thermal, electrical, and mechanical functionalities. Liquid metals (LMs) exhibit exceptional conductivity and self&#8208;healing capabilities, but their intrinsic fluidity poses leakage risks. Incorporation with 2D materials yields LM&#8211;2D material composites with enhanced structural stability and multifunctional integration. This review systematically summarizes: 1) interfacial enhancement strategies (oxidation, heterometallic doping, polymer grafting, mechanochemistry) to improve wettability and dispersion; 2) representative structural designs, including blended, core&#8211;shell, layered, and 3D networks supported by elastomers or hydrogels; 3) key properties across different structural types, such as mechanical robustness, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity; 4) multifunctional applications enabled by enabled by property synergy, spanning thermal&#8211;mechanical coupling (thermal management), electrical&#8211;mechanical coupling (electromagnetic interference shielding, wearable sensors, and energy storage electrodes), and electrical&#8211;thermal&#8211;mechanical coupling (multifunctional films). Despite significant progress, critical challenges remain in scalable fabrication, long&#8208;term reliability, and efficient recycling. To address these challenges, this review further discusses emerging directions for LM&#8211;2D material composites, including novel composite systems, responsive smart materials, multiscale manufacturing technologies, and AI&#8208;assisted design, aiming to provide a roadmap for their development in next&#8208;generation electronic applications.

         <title>Leveraging Polymeric Design for Marine Anti&#8208;Biofouling: Mechanism, System, and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in marine antifouling polymeric materials and interfaces&#8212;including chemical and physical dynamic coatings, fouling&#8208;release coatings, fouling&#8208;resistant coatings, and other emerging strategies&#8212;have been summarized. This review offers insights into the current state of marine antifouling coatings and aims to inspire the development of durable, sustainable, and non&#8208;toxic materials with excellent antifouling performance.








Abstract
Marine biofouling presents major challenges for marine industries, leading to substantial economic losses and increased energy consumption. Historically, antifouling strategies relied on coatings containing tributyltin (TBT) or metal&#8208; and organic&#8208;based biocides. While effective, these coatings pose considerable environmental and biological risks, highlighting the need for sustainable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives. Recent advances in polymer science have opened new avenues for environmentally friendly antifouling solutions. Various approaches such as dynamic coatings (chemical and physical), fouling&#8208;release coatings, fouling&#8208;resistant coatings, and other emerging strategies leveraging polymeric design to prevent organism attachment have been developed. Yet, comprehensive and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overviews focusing specifically on their design from a polymer science perspective remain limited. This review first summarizes recent progress in marine antifouling polymeric materials and interfacial designs, focusing on the relationship between polymer structure and functional performance. It then discusses the current challenges associated with these materials and proposes potential solutions for further development. Finally, the review outlines possible directions for future progress in the field, aiming to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of marine antifouling polymeric materials and interfaces while inspiring continued research and innovation in sustainable, durable, and non&#8208;toxic antifouling coatings.

         <title>Bioinspired Color&#8208;Changing Polymeric Hydrogel Actuators/Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives an in&#8208;depth overview of color&#8208;changing polymeric hydrogel actuators/robots by classifying them into three categories based on the color&#8208;changing mechanism (pigment, structural, and fluorescence color), with a particular focus on the preparation strategies, bifunctional synergistic performances, and demonstrated applications.








Abstract
Many natural creatures exhibit remarkable control over their morphologies and skin colors for better adaptability in dynamic living environments, which has inspired the emergence of biomimetic color&#8208;changing soft actuators/robots. Polymeric hydrogels are ideal candidate materials owing to their extremely biological similarity such as soft wet nature and tissue&#8208;like modulus. The past 5 years have witnessed the flourishing development of synergistic color&#8208;changing polymeric hydrogel actuators/robots with huge application potentials in camouflage, locomotion, information encryption and so on. This review is intended to give an in&#8208;depth overview of this flourishing research area by classifying them into three categories based on the mechanism of color origination (pigment color, structural color, and fluorescence color). Their typical preparation strategies, synergistic multicolor&#8208;shifting and 3D shape&#8208;morphing performances, as well as demonstrated applications are thoroughly summarized. Current challenges and future prospects on synergistic shape/color&#8208;polymeric hydrogels will also be discussed to attract more research interests.

         <title>Advances and Insights in Electrocatalytic Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate Plastic Wastes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overview of advanced electrocatalyst design, structure&#8208;activity relationship, and reaction mechanism toward the EGOR during the recycling of PET wastes.








Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most commonly used polyester plastics; however, its still&#8208;low recycling rate results in large amounts of waste emissions that pose a great threat to the ecosystem and human health. Electrocatalysis provides an effective strategy to convert waste PET plastics into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals under mild conditions, which can achieve enhanced recycling efficiency. Especially, when coupled with cathode reduction reactions such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrate reduction, etc., valuable chemicals can be concurrently produced at both anode and cathode. The corresponding coupling systems and their applicable electrocatalysts in the recycling process of PET waste have yet to be comprehensively reviewed. This review first describes the mechanisms of electrocatalytic PET upcycling in detail, and summarizes the electrochemical reforming strategies by emphasizing various anode&#8208;cathode reaction coupling pathways and related intermediates. Then, the most recent advances in developing highly active electrocatalysts in different&#8208;coupled systems, as well as typical product separation approaches of PET hydrolysate, are discussed to provide insights into innovative design principles. Finally, perspectives and outlooks are presented for electrocatalytic recycling of PET wastes, which is expected to benefit future developments of related fields, especially the electrocatalyst design toward practical application.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Piezocatalytic Water Splitting by Post&#8208;Synthetic Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexation Driven Cluster Modification in Ce&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique design of a photo&#8208;piezocatalyst is showcased by post&#8208;synthetically modifying Ce&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 with a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex. This CT complex enabled efficient light harvesting and induced a mixed&#8208;valence Ce&#8308;&#8314;/Ce3&#8314; state, leading to local symmetry breaking and piezoelectric polarization. The resulting piezopotential generation in the MOF facilitated the promotion of charge separation upon photoexcitation. The synergy of light absorption and piezoelectric polarization resulted in an ultrahigh H2 generation rate by overall water splitting, which is the highest photo&#8208;piezocatalytic rate known to date.








Abstract
The production of green H2 fuel by photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a potential solution to mitigate challenges related to the energy crisis. The inherent electric field generated within piezoelectric materials under mechanical stress offers a promising avenue for enhancing charge separation in photocatalysis through piezo&#8208;phototronic effect. Herein, we develop a photo&#8208;piezocatalyst leveraging [Ce6(&#181;3&#8208;O)4(&#181;3&#8208;OH)4(HCOO)6]6+ cluster modification via post&#8208;synthetic multistep integration of a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyad within Ce&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 (Ce&#8208;MOF). This supramolecular D&#8208;A charge transfer (CT) complex inside the confined nanopore of Ce&#8208;MOF functions as an efficient light&#8208;harvesting unit. Concomitantly, light&#8208;mediated electron transfer from the CT complex, results in a mixed valence Ce4+/Ce3+ state&#160; which creates local distortion within the Ce&#8208;oxo cluster, transitioning it from an ideal cubic state to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric configuration, giving rise to piezoelectric polarization. The synergistic interplay between piezoelectric polarization and enhanced CT driven light&#8208;harvesting capabilities culminates in an ultrahigh H2 production with a rate of 12.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, achieved through overall water splitting under photo&#8208;piezocatalytic conditions. This work not only highlights the immense potential of MOFs as efficient catalysts for water splitting but also paves the way for harnessing both solar and mechanical energy through photo&#8208;mediated piezocatalytic reactions.

     alt="Photo-Piezocatalytic Water Splitting by Post-Synthetic Charge-Transfer Complexation Driven Cluster Modification in Ce-based MOF-808"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique design of a photo-piezocatalyst is showcased by post-synthetically modifying Ce-based MOF-808 with a charge-transfer (CT) complex. This CT complex enabled efficient light harvesting and induced a mixed-valence Ce&#8308;&#8314;/Ce&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; state, leading to local symmetry breaking and piezoelectric polarization. The resulting piezopotential generation in the MOF facilitated the promotion of charge separation upon photoexcitation. The synergy of light absorption and piezoelectric polarization resulted in an ultrahigh H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation rate by overall water splitting, which is the highest photo-piezocatalytic rate known to date.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of green H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel by photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a potential solution to mitigate challenges related to the energy crisis. The inherent electric field generated within piezoelectric materials under mechanical stress offers a promising avenue for enhancing charge separation in photocatalysis through piezo-phototronic effect. Herein, we develop a photo-piezocatalyst leveraging [Ce&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;

This supramolecular D-A charge transfer (CT) complex inside the confined nanopore of Ce-MOF functions as an efficient light-harvesting unit. Concomitantly, light-mediated electron transfer from the CT complex, results in a mixed valence Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; state&#160; which creates local distortion within the Ce-oxo cluster, transitioning it from an ideal cubic state to a non-centrosymmetric configuration, giving rise to piezoelectric polarization. The synergistic interplay between piezoelectric polarization and enhanced CT driven light-harvesting capabilities culminates in an ultrahigh H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production with a rate of 12.7&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, achieved through overall water splitting under photo-piezocatalytic conditions.

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Free Supramolecular Zwitterionic Gels for Skin&#8208;Inspired Soft Iontronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An initiator&#8208;free supramolecular gelation technology has been developed to enable the spontaneous polymerization gelation of zwitterionic monomers via Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. This approach biomimetically realizes a soft ionic material with ultra&#8208;low modulus and ultra&#8208;high conductivity, meanwhile achieving force&#8208;electricity decoupling for signal sensing and robot control applications at biological ionic interfaces.








Abstract
Conventional synthetic skin for intelligent soft robotics typically relies on thermally or UV&#8208;initiated polymerization, making initiator&#8208;free rapid gelation a persistent challenge. Here, a supramolecular Lewis acid&#8211;base gelation strategy that enables facile, initiator&#8208; and crosslinker&#8208;free synthesis of polyzwitterionic gels is presented. Strong hydrogen bonding between urea (hydrogen bond donor, HBD) and the zwitterionic moieties of 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC; polymerizable zwitterionic hydrogen bond acceptor, PZHBA) drives spontaneous polymerization, establishing a general platform for zwitterionic gelation in deep eutectic solvents (DESs), such as choline chloride (ChCl) and urea. Inspired by the structural and ionic complexity of human skin, zwitterionic supramolecular eutectogel (ZSE) is designed via copolymerization of N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) and MPC in DES, yielding a bioinspired ion&#8211;hydrogen bond dynamic network. These gels exhibit tunable mechanical properties, including an ultralow Young's modulus (5&#8211;180 kPa), and exceptionally high ionic conductivity (2 S&#183;m&#8722;1), which arises from the solvation of zwitterionic groups. The dynamic supramolecular network also imparts recyclability and intrinsic self&#8208;adhesion. ZSEs can be continuously spun into highly sensitive strain sensors with environmental robustness for integration into textiles. Additionally, bio&#8208;optimized gel patches demonstrate excellent antibacterial activity and biocompatibility. This work offers a sustainable and versatile synthetic platform for next&#8208;generation soft iontronics and bioinspired human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Electrically Tunable Friction: From Sticky to Slippery with Ionic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates electrically tunable friction &#8220;from sticky to slippery&#8221; using ionic hydrogels, achieving reversible more&#8208;than&#8208;fifty&#8208;fold modulation without liquid lubricants. An electric field extracts a salt&#8208;rich interfacial layer that dramatically reduces friction. This mechanism powers the first crawling robot and high&#8208;precision manipulation driven solely by electrotunable friction, establishing a new paradigm for adaptive robotic systems.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time regulation of friction from conventional dry states to ultra&#8208;low levels represents a critical strategy for improving energy efficiency and enabling the intelligent design of adaptive systems. Yet, current friction&#8208;control methods typically achieve only modest modulation and often rely on liquid lubricants at macroscopic scales, which impose stringent sealing requirements and limit practical applications. Here, an electric&#8208;field strategy is reported for friction modulation using a polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based ionic hydrogel as an electroresponsive frictional material. During sliding against a metal ball, the friction coefficient (COF) can be reversibly modulated by more than fifty&#8208;fold&#160;under low voltage control (&#8722;30&#160;V to +30&#160;V), without the need for external lubricants. Remarkably, the COF decreases to 0.03 at &#8722;30&#160;V (with the metal ball connected to the negative pole), while at 0&#160;V or +30&#160;V it increases to 1&#8211;2. Mechanistic analyses reveal that positive charging of the ionic hydrogel triggers electroosmotic extraction of a salt&#8208;rich interfacial layer, driving the dramatic reduction in friction. It further demonstrates the first crawling robot and precision robotic arm manipulation powered by electrotunable friction, establishing a new paradigm for adaptive and energy&#8208;efficient robotic and mechanical systems.

         <title>Dimensionally Resolved Nanostructures of an Atomically Precise and Optically Active 1D van der Waals Helix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to grow nanostructures based on inorganic helical crystals with long&#8208;range order will enable a platform to realize physical states that arise from chirality. Herein, it is demonstrated that controlled vapor phase deposition of an atomically precise helical crystal, GaSI, into ultrathin 1D nanowires and quasi&#8208;2D nanoribbons. The nanostructures retain the helical and noncentrosymmetric nature of the bulk, absorb in the UV, and manifest nonlinear optical activity.








Abstract
Inorganic freestanding helices are rare and sought&#8208;after for their unusual physical states endowed by chirality. To this end, III&#8211;VI&#8211;VII solids have emerged as a distinct class of ternary 1D van der Waals (vdW) crystals which bear atomically precise helical motifs. However, the physical understanding of the intrinsic and size&#8208;dependent properties of these materials is limited by the lack of synthetic strategies to directly access freestanding nanocrystals in high volumes. Using GaSI as a representative phase, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is presented to grow high yields of ultrathin nanostructures based on this helical materials class. With this strategy, it is possible to grow single crystals of 1D nanowires with thicknesses in the 10&#8211;100&#160;nm range at high temperature conditions, as well as quasi&#8208;2D nanoribbons at lower temperatures. The bandgap of the nanowires is established in the UV region and demonstrates the persistence of nonlinear optical behavior as evidence of the persistence of the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure of GaSI at the nanoscale. Inspired by these results, the effect of the helical nature of GaSI on the electronic structure of hypothetical single chains is probed from first principles and shows the pronounced handedness&#8208;dependent and helicity&#8208;imposed spin polarization at the single helix regime.

         <title>A Wearable, Dual Closed&#8208;loop Insulin Delivery System for Precision Diabetes Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable dual closed&#8208;loop drug delivery system for diabetes management is presented, featuring an adaptive, on&#8208;body trained edge AI algorithm for precise insulin delivery, which enhances therapeutic accuracy from 92.10% to 98.82%. 








Abstract
Effective blood glucose management is an increasing demand worldwide. Traditional solutions separate glucose detection and insulin delivery, which is less efficient compared to emerging closed&#8208;loop wearable systems controlled by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, CGM&#8208;controlled systems raise new safety risks, as false CGMs readings can cause insulin overdose, which results in hypoglycemia and fatal consequences. This work proposes a concept of a dual closed&#8208;loop insulin delivery system (DuoLoop) to mitigate the risk issue of CGM&#8208;controlled systems.

&lt;p&gt;A wearable dual closed-loop drug delivery system for diabetes management is presented, featuring an adaptive, on-body trained edge AI algorithm for precise insulin delivery, which enhances therapeutic accuracy from 92.10% to 98.82%. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective blood glucose management is an increasing demand worldwide. Traditional solutions separate glucose detection and insulin delivery, which is less efficient compared to emerging closed-loop wearable systems controlled by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, CGM-controlled systems raise new safety risks, as false CGMs readings can cause insulin overdose, which results in hypoglycemia and fatal consequences. This work proposes a concept of a dual closed-loop insulin delivery system (DuoLoop) to mitigate the risk issue of CGM-controlled systems. The first closed-loop is automated insulin delivery controlled by CGM. The second closed-loop is the controlled release of glucose-responsive insulin (GRI), whose release rate depends on actual glucose levels. A customized algorithm is trained and embedded into the wearable CGMs for edge computing. The DuoLoop system shows improved safety in preliminary in vivo test&#160;(longer normoglycemia durations, 98.82% vs 92.10%), encouraging its deployment toward precision diabetes care.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shutting Down the &#8216;Language Encoder&#8217;: A Pathogen&#8208;Derived Nano&#8208;Interferer Disrupt Sialylation Metabolism and Reprogram Intercellular Communication in Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma (GBM) exploits aberrant membrane sialylation to establish a &#8216;language encoder&#8217; that translates metabolic states into glycan&#8208;mediated intercellular communication, enhancing signaling plasticity and immune evasion. This study introduces a metabolism&#8208;guided nano&#8208;interferer (OMV@HM&#8208;T/F) that crosses the BBB, suppresses the encoder by blocking glycosylation precursor synthesis and sialic acid activation, and remodels membrane glycans to restrain GBM malignancy.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM), constrained by the limited cranial space and the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), establishes a rapidly adaptable, generalized communication network through enhanced terminal sialylation of membrane proteins. This metabolism&#8208;driven network encodes cellular metabolic states into functional information at the membrane level, thereby markedly enhancing signaling plasticity, intercellular communication, and immune evasion, which together sustain and expand malignant phenotypes within a resource&#8208;limited microenvironment. Here, a &#8220;metabolism&#8208;guided decoding of communication architecture&#8221; strategy is proposed and developed a brain&#8208;targeted pathogen&#8208;derived nano&#8208;interferer (OMV@HM&#8208;T/F). By simultaneously inhibiting glycosylation precursor synthesis and sialic acid activation, the platform remodels membrane glycan structures, disrupts glycan&#8208;dependent communication scaffolds, and effectively blocks downstream signal amplification and immune suppression pathways. Integrating BBB penetrability with tumor microenvironment responsiveness, this strategy enables precise metabolic&#8208;level intervention, offering a promising approach to overcoming high adaptability and therapeutic resistance.

         <title>Meticulous Construction of Internal Encapsulation Layer via In Situ Self&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking Polymerization and Ring&#8208;Opening Addition Reactions for Efficient and Environmental Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An internal encapsulation layer (GPTFP) is developed via self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking polymerization and ring&#8208;opening addition reactions to resolve the deterioration influences of byproducts, the tradeoff between perovskite quality and Pb2+ leakage, achieving 26.83% efficiency inverted devices with over 2000 h operational stability.








Abstract
Capping an internal encapsulation layer (IEL) on the top surface of perovskite plays significant roles in enhancing perovskite quality and achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. Herein, a novel IEL is in situ synthesized by self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking polymerization of siloxane motifs and ring&#8208;opening addition of ethylene oxide groups to overcome the long&#8208;overlooked drawbacks of IEL, such as eliminating deterioration influences of byproducts, as well as the tradeoff between improving perovskite quality and minimizing Pb2+ leakage. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that amidogen, hydroxyl, and carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#9472;F) bond in GPTFP synergistically stabilize grain boundaries, passivate surface defects, block oxygen and moisture, as well as minimize the Pb2+ leakage of perovskite through hydrogen bond, oxygen&#8211;lead, fluorine&#8211;lead, and hydrophobic interactions. The resultant perovskite exhibits enhanced crystallinity quality, relieved residual strain, air&#8208;stable black phase retained after 200 days of ambient aging, and undetectable leakage of Pb2+ under simulated harsh conditions. Consequently, the resultant inverted device achieves an excellent efficiency of 26.83% (certified 26.57%) with a certified quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state output of 26.51%. Notably, such a device retains &gt;93 % of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 2000&#160;h of ambient storage (30&#177;5% relative humidity, 25&#160;&#176;C), respectively.

         <title>A General Elastomeric Agent to Addressing Embrittlement in High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The brittleness of high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells hinders wearable applications. A commercial SEEPS elastomer is introduced as a general toughening additive that boosts mechanical robustness without sacrificing efficiency. Guided by a toughening parameter for material selection, this work achieved a record efficiency surpassing 16% with an 11&#8208;fold increase in fracture strain and exceptional performance retention under extreme deformation.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) that combine high photovoltaic efficiency with mechanical resilience are critical for wearable devices. However, prevalent acceptors often act as stress concentrators, leading to film embrittlement. A general toughening approach remains elusive. Here, a broadly applicable strategy is introduced using SEEPS, an elastomeric agent with finely&#8208;tailored miscibility with the acceptor to toughen OSCs. A toughening parameter &#951;, derived from dynamic mechanical analysis is defined, that quantitatively correlates with elastomer&#8208;acceptor miscibility with mechanical enhancement. SEEPS induces pronounced secondary relaxations that dissipate strain energy, yielding an over 11&#8208;fold increase in fracture strain. In situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that SEEPS preserves molecular packing and suppresses phase separation under strain. The resulting intrinsically stretchable OSCs retain four&#8208;fifths of starting efficiency after 500 stretch&#8208;release cycles at 40% strain, and sustain its four&#8208;fifths efficiency at 52% strain. This work achieves record&#8208;breaking efficiency over 16% while preserving exceptional mechanical stretchability, offering insights for high&#8208;performance stretchable photovoltaics.

         <title>A Labor&#8208;Division Cooperation Electronic Palm System for High&#8208;Precision Crosstalk&#8208;Free Cognition of Pressure and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a novel biomimetic electronic palm system (BEPS), which solves the issues of crosstalk and low integration in existing sensing methods. Demonstrations show that the mechanical hand can detect water temperature, water level, and determine the softness and shape of objects. By integrating the neural hand contraction reflex, the BEPS achieves closed&#8208;loop control and feedback for hot and cold objects.








Abstract
Current methods for pressure and temperature sensing face issues such as crosstalk, low integration, and difficulty in achieving large&#8208;scale arrays. These problems significantly impact the practical application value of multifunctional biomimetic sensors in intelligent biomimetic robots. Herein, this paper presents a novel multifunctional biomimetic electronic palm system (BEPS) consisting of 16 bimodal decoupling biomimetic electronic skins (e&#8208;skin). By subtly introducing vertical stacking design and in situ photopolymerization and 3D printing technologies&#8208;based fabrication, large&#8208;scale arrays integration with high sensing performances is constructed. Furthermore, a universal decoupling calculation model is developed, achieving crosstalk&#8208;free sensing of temperature and pressure. To demonstrate the practical application value of the proposed biomimetic palm, three implemented demonstration applications in this paper show that the mechanical hand has the ability to detect water temperature and water level, as well as to confirm the softness and shape of grasped objects. The BEPS system combines neural hand contraction reflexes to achieve closed&#8208;loop control and feedback when dealing with hot and cold objects. This progress has enormous potential in enhancing the functionality and adaptability of robotic systems.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of MOF Reconstruction Unlocks Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a spatiotemporally decoupled reconstruction strategy to engineer a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;node metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#160;catalyst, in which orbitally coupled pore&#8208;microenvironments drive time&#8208;phased kinetic reconstruction of the spatially separated Fe/Ni metal nodes, creating a foundational platform to lay bare the mechanisms governing the reconstruction processes and the cross&#8208;scale kinetic. 








Abstract
Understanding the dynamical reconstruction mechanisms of the active phase in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) during the course of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is central to the development of efficient and durable OER catalysts, but remains elusive till present. Herein, a spatiotemporally decoupled reconstruction strategy is pioneered to engineer a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;node MOF ([Fe3O(hbdc)3][Ni2(trz)3]) catalyst (hbdc: 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalic acid, trz: 1,2,4&#8208;triazole), in which orbitally coupled pore&#8208;microenvironments drive time&#8208;phased kinetic reconstruction of the spatially separated Fe/Ni metal nodes, creating a foundational platform to lay bare the mechanisms governing the reconstruction processes and the cross&#8208;scale kinetic. Furthermore, a multimodal operando diagnostic platform is developed that integrates in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman spectroscopy, and real&#8208;time reaction kinetics tracing, to decipher the MOF atomic&#8208;to&#8208;mesoscale reconstruction kinetics from the Fe&#8208;centered active phase to the NiFe&#8208;centered more active phase. Crucially, the purpose&#8208;partitioned pore architecture synergizes the interplay between the Fe&#9472;Ni nodes, while the self&#8208;adaptive defects, bond relaxation, and structural regeneration collectively modulate the kinetic behavior, leading to the pronounced OER activity enhancement. This work establishes a structural dynamics tracking methodology that can integrate multi&#8208;scale characterization techniques and provide deep insights into the reconstruction mechanisms, thus filling the critical gap in understanding structure&#8208;activity relationships under operando conditions.

         <title>Defect Engineering in &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se Heterostructures for High&#8208;Resolution Phototransistor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;engineered heterojunction &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se with atomically sharp interfaces is created to suppress interface vacancies while enabling dual functionality&#8212;surface passivation and photoactive charge separation. The visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared transparency and high&#8208;k of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 enable top&#8208;gated phototransistors with a tunable photoresponse, achieving significantly improved optoelectronic performance. Furthermore, a high&#8208;resolution phototransistor array is fabricated via thermal scanning probe lithography and its imaging capabilities are demonstrated.








Abstract
Analogous to the pivotal SiO2/Si junction in modern electronics, the &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se architecture has been demonstrated to enhance the performance of electronic devices. However, its potential to improve the optoelectronic properties of Bi2O2Se, such as responsivity and detectivity, remains unexplored. The photodetection performance of Bi2O2Se is primarily limited by intrinsic selenium vacancies at its surface, which lead to low photocurrent and instability. To address this, a defect&#8208;engineered &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterojunction is constructed with an atomically sharp interface via a developed UV&#8208;assisted oxidation strategy. This heterostructure successfully suppresses surface vacancies while enabling dual functionality&#8212;surface passivation and photoactive charge separation, resulting in substantially enhanced optoelectronic performance. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm a stable type&#8208;II band alignment with interfacial transitions enabling efficient carrier dissociation. The visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared transparency and high&#8208;k of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 further enable top&#8208;gated phototransistors with dynamically tunable photoresponse, achieving the largely improved metrics of responsivity (1.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1), detectivity (1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;1013 Jones), and on/off ratio (2.3&#160;&#215; 106). Additionally, by using thermal scanning probe lithography, a high&#8208;resolution (pixel pitch = 6.5 &#181;m) &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se phototransistor array is fabricated and its imaging capabilities are demonstrated. The results establish an effective defect&#8208;engineered strategy with in situ large&#8208;area growth capability of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 and high&#8208;resolution device patterning, making &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se a promising photoresponsive platform for advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Precise Morphology Control via Backbone&#8208;Derived Solid Additive Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells to Achieve 20% Efficiency and Thick&#8208;Film Compatibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A backbone&#8208;derived solid additive molecular design strategy enables precise morphology control, optimizes vertical phase distribution, and extends exciton diffusion length, achieving synergistic enhancement of photovoltaic parameters, high efficiencies of 19.81% (100&#160;nm) and 16.93% (400&#160;nm) in binary device, good thickness tolerance, and scalability across multiple organic solar cell systems (over 20% efficiency achieved in various binary devices).








Abstract
Precise control of active layer morphology is essential for advancing organic solar cells (OSCs) toward practical applications. Here, a generalizable morphology regulation strategy is proposed using a structurally tailored crystallization template derived from the polymer donor backbone. A small molecule, BDD&#8208;C6, is designed by extracting the benzodithiophene (BDD) unit from PM6 and appending an alkylated thiophene terminal. When incorporated into PM6:L8&#8208;BO and PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 binary blends, compatibility studies and cross&#8208;sectional absorption analysis reveal a favorable vertical phase distribution on alcohol&#8208;soluble substrates. Thermodynamic evaluations confirm the good thermal stability and crystallinity of BDD&#8208;C6. Crystallization kinetics and morphological characterizations investigations further show that BDD&#8208;C6 delays film formation and promotes polymer ordering, thus extending exciton diffusion length. As a result, PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based binary device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.81% in thin films and maintains a PCE of 16.93% even at a 400&#160;nm thickness. Moreover, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs present an efficiency of over 20%. Extending this strategy to D18 systems using a DTBT&#8208;C6 small molecule similarly enhances morphology and device performance, realizing a PCE of 20.18% in D18:L8&#8208;BO binary device. This work offers a backbone&#8208;derived crystallization template strategy for the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency OSCs

High&#8208;Performance Air&#8208;Stable Polymer Monolayer Transistors
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202515591), Mengmeng Li and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a fibrillar polymer monolayer with a self&#8208;confinement effect, where aligned chains parallel the nanofiber axis. Employing a top&#8208;gate CYTOP dielectric, this monolayer transistor achieves high mobility (7.12 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and exceptional stability over 1260 days in air. Furthermore, monolithic 3D integration with n&#8208;type oxide transistors is achieved, enabling hybrid complementary inverters with reasonable voltage amplification capability.

IMPACTFUL Adoptive T Cell Therapy
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202510842), Mingqiang Li, Yu Tao, Haochen Yao, and co&#8208;workers present an immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL) that enables T&#8208;cell engineering through membrane fusion. This approach facilitates concurrent targeting across multiple cellular compartments, including the cell membrane and cytoplasm. By leveraging this dual&#8208;targeting strategy, T cells acquire enhanced functionalities, such as improved tumor infiltration, overcoming immune tolerance, and reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This versatile platform offers a promising approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive T cell therapies for solid tumors.

Novel Ternary Intermetallics
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202308168), Matheus A. Tunes, Konstantina Lambrinou, and co&#8208;workers introduce the ZIP phases &#8211; a new family of ternary intermetallics with two structural variants: one fcc (space group Fdm) and one hexagonal (space group P63/mmc). Atomically resolved images and crystal structure schematics of the two Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni ZIP phases are pasted on the yin&#8208;yang symbol of duality. The advent of the ZIP phases creates a new ecosystem of nanostructured solids and potential 2D derivatives with properties unlike those achieved by related solids (e.g., MAX phases/MXenes).

Systematically and deeply revealing the mechanism of vacancies in the electrocatalytic process has important value for achieving precise structural regulation and performance optimization of electrocatalysts. This work systematically reviews the research progress of vacancy modification electrocatalysts in recent years. The detection technology of vacancies is introduced, the synthetic strategies for vacancy construction are summarized, the catalytic functions of vacancies in various typical electrocatalytic reactions and their internal regulatory mechanisms are mainly discussed, and the regulatory effect of vacancies on the adsorption behavior of intermediates is analyzed. The structure&#8211;function relationship laws of factors such as vacancy type, concentration, and spatial distribution on catalytic performance are further summarized, providing theoretical support for the rational design of vacancy engineering. Finally, the future development direction of vacancy engineering is prospected, with the expectation of providing a theoretical basis and research ideas for constructing new electrocatalytic materials that are efficient, stable, and applicable on a large scale.

         <title>Floating&#8208;Gate Synaptic Transistors for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in FGSTs design for neuromorphic computing. It highlights innovative floating&#8208;gate structures, diverse material systems, and an advanced tunneling dielectric layer, along with their respective roles in enhancing synaptic performances. Finally, it analyzes critical challenges and discusses future research directions toward highly energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing hardware.








Abstract
By integrating nonvolatile memory and processing, floating&#8208;gate synaptic transistors (FGSTs) have emerged as a pivotal platform for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing, overcoming limitations inherent in conventional Von Neumann architectures. These devices utilize a unique floating&#8208;gate layer to facilitate charge storage and manipulation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in FGST device design, focusing on innovative floating&#8208;gate structures, diverse floating&#8208;gate material systems, and advanced tunneling dielectric layers. These innovations have significantly enhanced synaptic performance, including near&#8208;linear conductance modulation, ultralow energy consumption, multilevel storage, extended retention times, and robust endurance characteristics. Consequently, FGSTs achieve remarkable pattern&#8208;recognition accuracy and effectively mimic complex biological plasticity rules. Moreover, their integration into neuromorphic sensory systems for vision, audition, touch, and neuronal behavior enables these devices to conduct high&#8208;fidelity real&#8208;time multimodal and reconfigurable processing. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in scaling synaptic energy to femtojoule levels, enhancing the mechanical flexibility of wearable electronics, improving operational stability, and developing large&#8208;scale synaptic devices array. This paper outlines strategic pathways in materials and architecture to steer the development of FGSTs toward highly efficient, brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic hardware.

         <title>Supramolecular Multivalent Synergy Enabling Harsh&#8208;Condition Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs) typically suffer from severe performance deterioration under harsh conditions, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, harsh&#8208;condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials exhibit remarkable phosphorescence stability even in extreme environments, greatly expanding their potential applications. This review highlights recent progress in HCP materials, encompassing design strategies, photophysical characteristics, and underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, emerging applications of HCP materials in afterglow displays, information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging are discussed.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescence, which arises from the radiative decay of triplet excitons, has garnered significant interest owing to its exceptional photophysical properties and diverse application potential. However, the intrinsically vulnerable triplet excitons are highly susceptible to environmental factors such as heat, oxygen, and solvents, which significantly compromise the operational stability and durability of organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs). The triplet excitons undergo rapid deactivation via thermal dissipation, oxygen&#8208;mediated energy transfer, and solvent&#8208;induced collapse of rigid microenvironments, leading to severe phosphorescence quenching. Supramolecular multivalent synergy offers an effective strategy for stabilizing triplet excitons, thereby extending beyond ambient stability to sustained phosphorescence under harsh conditions, resulting in robust organic harsh&#8208;condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials. This review provides a timely and systematic introduction to recent advances in HCP materials, including design and construction strategies, unique optoelectronic properties, underlying stabilization mechanisms, and promising applications. In addition, the summary section highlights pivotal challenges and emerging perspectives within this field to suggest feasible pathways for future research endeavors. This review not only establishes design principles for HCP materials by decoding supramolecular multivalent synergy in triplet exciton stabilization but also paves new avenues toward practical applications.

         <title>Advanced Porous Materials for Maritime Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon capture from emission sources, such as marine vessels, has attracted significant attention over the years. To achieve this goal, sorbents such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous polymer networks (PPNs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and their post&#8208;synthetic modifications are currently being explored. This is because of their pore tunability, high selectivity, high surface area and porosity, and fast kinetics.








Abstract
The capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has drawn significant attention due to the devastation arising from the effects of global warming. This comes from the increasing demand for the transportation of various commodities to meet the needs of the growing population of the world. Onboard capture of CO2 in ships has attracted much attention but suffers due to the high cost of implementation and technical setbacks. This report outlines the challenges of the current CCS technology implemented in maritime operations and evaluates porous materials (MOFs, PPNs, COFs) as a novel material class for the next generation of onboard CO2 capture. Engineering challenges are discussed that can create better synergies of integration in this space, and specific advanced porous materials are suggested that show great promise. If this technology can be implemented onboard vessels, it will greatly help the maritime industry adhere to internationally mandated emission regulations.

         <title>Skin&#8208;to&#8208;Muscle Deep Tissue Stimulation System for Muscle Atrophy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The body&#8208;coupled on&#8208;target stimulation (BOOST) system and active releasing muscle stimulation (ARMS) hydrogel for skin&#8208;to&#8208;muscle deep&#8208;tissue penetration of ionic drug molecule and electrical stimulation (ES) is proposed. The &#8220;BOOSTing ARMS&#8221; system enables simultaneous ES and dexamethasone delivery, effectively restoring muscle cells damaged by oxidative stress, offering a non&#8208;invasive approach for treating muscle atrophy.








Abstract
With the rapidly growing global aging population, muscle atrophy affects &#8776;40% of older individuals, leading to severe impairments in daily activities. However, its treatment remains challenging due to adverse effects associated with drug accumulation, the difficulty of delivering drugs specifically to deep muscle tissues, and the inherent limitations of current therapeutic devices that rely on wired connections or battery&#8208;dependent external power systems. In this study, a body&#8208;coupled on&#8208;target stimulation (BOOST) system is introduced in combination with an active releasing muscle stimulation (ARMS) hydrogel, which possesses anti&#8208;drying properties and enables electroactive drug release. The BOOST system enables battery&#8208;free, wirelessly delivered electrostimulation and simultaneous drug delivery from the skin to deep muscle layers by leveraging charge accumulation in tissue capacitance. This in&#8208;body field amplification generates a muscle&#8208;targeted electric field that enables deep&#8208;tissue drug penetration. In addition, when combined with the electro&#8208;responsive ARMS hydrogel containing electrically bound dexamethasone phosphate (Dex) molecules, the BOOST system exhibits synergistic performance, achieving targeted internal electrostimulation and efficient Dex penetration into deep muscle tissue for effective transdermal&#8208;to&#8208;muscle delivery. The simultaneous application of ES and Dex effectively restores muscle cells severely damaged by oxidative stress, mimicking the pathological conditions of muscle atrophy.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Controlled Planar Guided Crystallization of Low&#8208;Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of spatially&#8208;controlled planar guided crystallization is a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low&#8208;loss Sb2S3 phase&#8208;change material (PCM), leveraging the directional crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM&#8208;based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non&#8208;volatile optical phase&#8208;shifter and a programmable metasurface with reconfigurable bound state in the continuum.








Abstract
Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) for non&#8208;volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, the concept of spatially&#8208;controlled planar guided crystallization is proposed, a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low&#8208;loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM&#8208;based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non&#8208;volatile optical phase&#8208;shifter exploiting a silicon nitride&#8208;based Mach&#8211;Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure optically uniform crystalline properties across devices is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non&#8208;volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated&#160;circuits.

         <title>Radiation Effects in Electret Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors Due to High Flux and High Dose X&#8208;Ray Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electret&#8208;style organic thin&#8208;film transistors are evaluated for synchrotron X&#8208;ray dosimetry at ultra&#8208;high dose rates, showing promising performance and agreement with standard detectors. XPS and NEXAFS reveal radiation&#8208;induced oxidation and Fermi level shifts in pentacene and polystyrene, correlating with reduced charge carrier mobility and providing insight into radiation degradation mechanisms in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic electronic devices offer lightweight, flexible, and low&#8208;cost alternatives to conventional semiconductor technologies, with growing interest in dosimetry applications. An organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) with a polymer electret is presented for high dose&#8208;rate synchrotron dosimetry. The OTFT operates in accumulated&#8208;dose and real&#8208;time readout modes and demonstrates excellent linearity with various beam filtrations. Device response increases with decreasing energy, and simulations reveal gold contacts as the primary source of energy dependence. Depth dose measurements show good agreement with a commercial detector, validating dosimetric performance. Minimal changes in mobility are observed at clinically relevant doses, but mobility degradation becomes apparent after high accumulated doses, indicating radiation damage in active materials. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) techniques are employed to analyze pristine and irradiated active material films separately and in a combined stack. XPS reveals oxidation in pentacene and a Fermi level shift in polystyrene in irradiated films, both of which likely cause the mobility reduction observed in OTFTs. Valence band and NEXAFS spectra show no evidence of new states in the bandgap. These findings demonstrate the potential of OTFTs as dosimeters for high dose&#8208;rates and clarify how radiation alters the molecular structure and electronic behavior of the device.

         <title>Thiocarboxylate&#8208;Mediated Defect Suppression and I2 Scavenging: Achieving 22.16% Efficient and Stable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (AP) is introduced as interfacial modifier to chelate undercoordinated Pb2+ for mitigating lead leakage, and bond with I&#8722; for suppressing iodide vacancy formation in CsPbI3. Crucially, AP's redox&#8208;active nature scavenges existing I2 and inhibits its generation. Consequently, AP&#8208;modified CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells achieve an efficiency of 22.16%, retaining 97% efficiency after 1000 h illumination.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer enhanced thermal stability compared to hybrid counterparts but suffer from interfacial defects, iodide vacancy&#8208;mediated recombination, detrimental I2 formation, and lead leakage, limiting performance and stability. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (AP) as a multifunctional interfacial modifier. AP features thiocarboxylate groups that strongly chelate undercoordinated Pb2+, passivating defects and mitigating lead leakage, while its nitrogen&#8208;containing moieties form hydrogen bonds with I&#8722;, suppressing iodide vacancy formation. Crucially, AP's redox&#8208;active nature chemically scavenges existing I2 and inhibits its generation under thermal and ambient stress. These synergistic interactions promote improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, optimized interfacial energy level alignment, and enhanced charge extraction dynamics. Consequently, AP&#8208;modified CsPbI3 PSCs achieve significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency of 22.16% and open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.29 V. Furthermore, the devices exhibit exceptional operational stability, retaining 97% initial efficiency after 1000 h continuous illumination under maximum power point tracking. This work demonstrates AP as a highly effective interfacial regulator and presents new insights into multifunctional molecular engineering for stable and high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.

         <title>Modulating Salt Dissociation and Solvent Immobilization Through Dipole Interactions in Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;functional cationic COF&#8208;LiTFSI filler is incorporated into PVHF&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes, where strong dipole interactions enhance lithium salt dissociation and immobilize residual solvents, thereby facilitating Li&#8314; transport and stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (VDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show great potential for application in solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, their poor ion transport capabilities and uncontrolled electrode/electrolyte interfacial reactions induced by residual solvents limit their overall electrochemical performance. To address these challenges, a LiTFSI&#8208;replaced dual&#8208;functional cationic covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;is strategically designed, denoted COF&#8208;LiTFSI, as organic fillers into poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVHF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) to regulate Li+ transport and electrode/electrolyte interface stability. The introduction of dipole interactions between cationic moieties embedded in the COF&#8208;LiTFSI framework and Li salt significantly enhances dissociation, thereby improving Li&#8314; transport and lowering the activation energy (Ea), while the strong dipole interaction between residual N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and the COF&#8208;LiTFSI framework immobilizes the NMP molecule, markedly enhancing the electrochemical stability of the PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE with a Li metal anode. Consequently, the optimized PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE achieves a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 0.63 mS cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the Li/Li, Li/LFP (LiFePO4), and Li/NCM811(LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) cells equipped with PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE achieve remarkably stable cycling. This work presents a novel strategy to regulate ion transport and interface stability in VDF&#8208;based SPEs by leveraging dipole interactions, enabling high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Tailored Xenogeneic&#8208;Free Polymer Surface Promotes Dynamic Migration of Intestinal Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a PoLymer&#8208;coated Ultra&#8208;stable Surface (PLUS), a nitrogen plasma&#8208;treated poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate), as a stable xenogeneic&#8208;free platform for intestinal stem cell culture. PLUS enhances cell attachment, supports actin&#8208;driven migration, and retains functionality after 3 years of storage. Promoting cytoskeletal reorganization, it enables dynamic migration and wound closure, offering a scalable solution for regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Regenerative therapy employing intestinal stem cells (ISCs) holds promise for epithelial restoration. However, it requires scalable and robust, but fully defined culture platforms free of xenogeneic components. Most existing systems, however, typically rely on Matrigel, which complicates clinical translation and limits understanding of stem cell&#8208;material interactions. Here, a poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate) (pEGDMA)&#8208;based synthetic culture surface is exposed to N2 plasma treatment for tailored modulation of surface properties. This modification enhances surface wettability and introduces N&#8208;containing functional groups, resulting in a PoLymer&#8208;coated Ultra&#8208;stable Surface (PLUS) that improves ISC attachment under xenogeneic&#8208;free culture conditions. Remarkably, PLUS maintains its ISC&#8208;supportive function even after 3 years of ambient storage. Gene expression and proteomic analyses reveal upregulation of factors involved in actin dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization. Consistently, colonies on PLUS exhibit a broader migratory range, with a 1.8&#8208;fold increase in migration speed compared to pristine pEGDMA. Small&#8208;molecule perturbation assays confirm the involvement of cytoskeletal remodelling by mediating ISC&#8208;substrate interaction. Furthermore, PLUS supports dynamic, actin&#8208;dependent migration, enabling up to 46.7% wound closure within 144&#160;h. These findings demonstrate that PLUS engages cytoskeletal machinery as a central mediator of ISC&#8208;substrate interaction, in part by promoting actin&#8208;dependent cytoskeletal reorganization, positioning it as a scalable, translational platform for ISC&#8208;based regenerative medicine.

         <title>3D Bioprinted Human Synovium&#8208;Cartilage Models Mimic Rheumatoid Arthritis Microenvironment and Recapitulate In Vivo Therapeutic Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents human in vitro rheumatoid arthritis models using chondrocytes recellularized type II collagen scaffold and 3D&#8208;bioprinted Gelatin&#8208;Matrigel hydrogels with fibroblast&#8208;like synoviocytes, pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, and protective barrier macrophages, closely recapitulating key rheumatoid arthritis pathological features. This model is validated by anti&#8208;arthritis drugs, and its transcriptomic and proteomic profiles are aligned with in vivo pathology, offering reliable platforms for preclinical drug screening.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) models play crucial roles in therapeutic discovery and fundamental research. However, current models have limited success at accurately simulating in vivo microenvironment and lacking intricate cellular cross&#8208;talk. Here, this work presents a human in vitro RA model that faithfully captures functional and compositional properties of cartilage and synovial lining in vivo, established with chondrocytes recellularized type II collagen scaffold and 3D&#8208;bioprinted bi&#8208;layered Gelatin&#8208;Matrigel hydrogel incorporating fibroblast&#8208;like synoviocytes (FLS) and proinflammatory macrophages in the top layer and protective barrier macrophages in the bottom layer. This synovium&#8208;cartilage system recapitulates key inflammatory processes akin to RA, including enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and degradative enzymes, as well as reactive oxygen species generation, invasion of FLS into cartilage, phenotypic alterations of macrophages and the depletion of cartilaginous extracellular matrix components. The established model enables effective screening of anti&#8208;arthritis drugs, which is validated by leveraging celecoxib and tofacitinib. Furthermore, the transcriptomic and proteomic landscape of this model demonstrates accuracy in replicating in vivo pathological conditions. Notably, this in vitro model reflects the response of the disease to the drug compared to the rat model of RA. Overall, this study provides reliable in vitro human synovium&#8208;cartilage models for screening preclinical drugs in RA therapeutics.

         <title>Vertical Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Arrays for Page&#8208;Wise Parallel Logic and Arithmetic Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a page&#8208;wise logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory architecture realized in a 3D vertical resistvie random&#8208;access memory array of self&#8208;rectifying memristors. By introducing intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;page logic primitives, the system enables Boolean and arithmetic operations to be executed directly within the memory. A memristive arithmetic logic unit is experimentally demonstrated, including a compact 2&#8208;bit full&#8208;adder, validating high reproducibility and reduced spatiotemporal cost. These results establish a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient pathway toward in&#8208;memory computing with vertical memristive arrays.








Abstract
Logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory (LIM) architectures are explored to address the data transfer bottleneck of conventional von Neumann architectures by integrating computation directly within memory arrays. Among various candidates, memristor&#8208;based LIM systems have gained significant attention due to their non&#8208;volatile switching behavior and compatibility with dense integration. In this work, a page&#8208;wise LIM architecture is implemented using a 3D vertical resistive random&#8208;access memory array composed of self&#8208;rectifying Pt&#8211;Ta2O5&#8211;Al:HfO2&#8211;TiN memristors. Two logic primitives&#8212;1&#160;M and 2&#160;M logic&#8212;are employed to perform intra&#8208;page and inter&#8208;page operations, respectively, enabling core Boolean functions to be executed entirely within the array through resistive state transitions. Based on these logic operations, a memristive arithmetic logic unit (mALU) is designed to perform essential arithmetic functions, including addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement. Owing to the vertical structure of vertical resistive random&#8208;access memory, a 2&#8208;bit full adder is implemented with a footprint of only three cells and completed in 12 steps. The proposed intra&#8208;and inter&#8208;page operations, along with complete mALU functionality, are experimentally demonstrated with high reproducibility. Combined with significantly reduced spatiotemporal cost, these results highlight the promise of this architecture for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Sustainable Recovery of Critical Minerals from Li&#8208;Ion Battery Waste</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid microwave plasma pretreatment transforms mixed battery black mass, enabling complete recovery of critical minerals in mild solvents at room temperature. Plasma&#8208;induced lattice disruption in cathode materials enhances solubility, unlocking a fast, energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable battery recycling. The process simultaneously regenerates anodic graphite.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) recycling plays a vital role in the circular economy by supporting a reliable and sustained supply of critical minerals. Commercial black mass, comprising cathode active materials and anodic graphite from spent LIBs, typically requires multiple energy&#8208;intensive steps for the recovery and regeneration of its critical minerals. Here, we report that a single&#8208;step microwave&#8208;induced plasma pre&#8208;treatment can lead to 85% selective Li recovery in water and &#8776;95% recovery of all transition metals in 1 M citric acid at room temperature. Of the various gas compositions evaluated, H2/N2 demonstrates the highest effectiveness. The synergistic action of H2 plasma, microwave coupling, and localized heating reduces the layered LIB cathode metal oxides to their metallic or lower&#8208;valence oxide forms, thereby enabling their facile extraction in green solvents. The residue consists of anodic graphite, which is regenerated through plasma treatment that reduces defects and decreases the interlayer spacing. The recovered graphite shows excellent efficiency as an LIB anode, surpassing commercial graphite in its activity. While here microwave plasma pretreatment has been explored for LIB recycling, it is a technological innovation that can serve as a versatile pretreatment step for hydrometallurgical extraction of critical minerals.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte with unique water&#8208;inter&#8208;micelle structure and tailored polymer network is prepared via a novel and facile method. Through the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic self&#8208;assembly of micelles, the limited water is distributed in the interstices between micelles, forming continuous water pathways for Zn2+ transport. Therefore, lean&#8208;water hydrogel achieves high ionic conductivity of 3.2 mS cm&#8722;1 at only 17.8 wt.% water.








Abstract
Hydrogel polymer electrolytes (HPEs) can mitigate leakage and suppress side reactions than liquid electrolytes in aqueous batteries. Nevertheless, their water content typically exceeds 80%, which perpetuates water&#8208;mediated side reactions. Characterized by a substantial reduction in water content, lean&#8208;water HPEs are designed. However, insufficient water severely impedes Zn2+ transport due to strong polymer&#8208;ion interactions. Herein, a lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte with a unique water&#8208;inter&#8208;micelle structure to overcome this dilemma via engineering water pathways is designed. Minimal water induces zinc dodecylbenzenesulfonate self&#8208;assembly into micelles, confining water within micellar interstices. This structure enables rapid Zn2+ migration along water&#8208;lubricated interstices, achieving 15.3 mS cm&#8722;1 conductivity at a water content of 20.6 wt.%. Subsequently, copolymerization of acrylamide (AM) and 4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine (ACMO) yielded a P(AM&#8208;ACMO) (PAC) lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte. Compared with conventional HPEs, densely packed micelles within PAC create ordered slit channels that establish continuous water pathways using only trace amounts of water. This maximizes water utilization, suppresses side reactions, and endows PAC with high ionic conductivity (3.2 mS cm&#8722;1) and Zn2+ transference number (0.88) at only 17.8 wt.% water content. In addition to high ionic conductivity and the ability to suppress dendrites, PAC also demonstrates exceptional adhesion and dehydration resistance, which contribute to its application in practical scenarios.

         <title>Tuning Transition Dipole Moment Alignment via Bifunctional Ligands in Perovskite Nanocrystal Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional ligand exchange with 1,5&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid suppresses surface defects and enhances carrier transport in perovskite quantum dot films. More importantly, it promotes long&#8208;range nanocrystal stacking, increasing the horizontal dipole fraction from 60% to 70%. This orientation control improves light outcoupling efficiency from 16.15% to 20.09%, enabling external quantum efficiencies above 22% with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeQLEDs) are promising for display and lighting applications. As the internal quantum efficiency of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PeQLEDs approaches unity, enhancing photon extraction becomes critical due to severe optical losses. The orientation of transition dipole moments (TDMs) plays a key role in determining the light outcoupling efficiency (&#951;out). Herein, the influence of nanocrystal (NC) shape and stacking behavior on the alignment of TDMs in the emissive layer is investigated. To modulate the TDMs, a facile ligand exchange strategy with bifunctional 1,5&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid (NDSA) is introduced, which suppresses surface defects and improves carrier transport efficiency. More importantly, it enhances long&#8208;range NC stacking and modifies the dielectric environment of the emissive layer (EML), which increases the fraction of in&#8208;plane TDMs from 60% to 70%. This improved orientation is instrumental in &#951;out from 16.15% to 20.09%. As a result, devices with NDSA modified exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.63% at 5127 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and a maximum luminance of 13&#160;950 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the pristine device. EQE remains above 20% across 400&#8211;8000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and device lifetime improves by 400% under ambient conditions with encapsulation.

         <title>Photoaccumulation of Long&#8208;Lived Reactive Electrons in a Microporous Ti(IV) Oxocluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Light and Dark Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The microporous Ti12 oxocluster&#8208;based MOF MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT exhibits effective charge separation and long&#8208;lived photogenerated electrons persisting for hours, as revealed by spectroscopy. These electrons cause reversible color changes and enable dark H2 evolution and water splitting, demonstrating remarkable electron storage and redox capability, positioning MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT as a promising material for photocatalysis and solar energy storage.








Abstract
The microporous Ti12 oxocluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT exhibits excellent stability and photoactivity, making it highly promising for photocatalysis. Using transient and photoinduced absorption spectroscopies, the behavior of reactive electrons in MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT across femtosecond&#8208;to&#8208;second timescales is investigated. The framework shows efficient charge separation and slow decay kinetics, with photogenerated charges persisting into the microsecond&#8208;second (&#181;s&#8208;s) range and displaying higher yields and slower recombination than benchmark MOFs MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 and UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;NH2. Photogenerated holes oxidize water with an O2 yield of 335&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the presence of electron scavengers. Under continuous irradiation, long&#8208;lived electrons accumulate, further enhanced by a hole scavenger (methanol). Remarkably, these electrons persist over 48&#160;h post&#8208;excitation under argon, accompanied by a reversible white&#8208;to&#8208;black color change. The stored electrons remain redox&#8208;active, efficiently reducing added O2 and methyl viologen. Dark addition of a Pt co&#8208;catalyst to photocharged MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT induces H2 evolution at &#8776;300&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;58&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1), corresponding to an accumulated electron density of one electron per 12 Ti atoms. These results highlight the photocharging properties of MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT and its potential for sustainable photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Ultrathin Monatomic Antimony Films by Sacrificial Atomic Layer Deposition for Phase Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step sacrificial atomic layer deposition (s&#8208;ALD) process enables wafer&#8208;scale growth of ultrathin and uniform antimony (Sb) thin films. An ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) Sb film is uniformly deposited with its characteristic bilayer structure (Sb&#8208;Sb) aligned along the substrate. The excellent surface coverage of the s&#8208;ALD allows facile electrical conduction even in the few&#8208;nanometer thickness range.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb) is an intriguing material for advanced electronics, with thickness&#8208;dependent properties at the nanoscale offering new functionalities. However, conventional methods for depositing Sb thin films cannot produce continuous ultrathin films with conformality in complex nanoscale structures. This study introduces a novel sacrificial atomic layer deposition (s&#8208;ALD) approach that overcomes these limitations by using chemical substitution between the antimony precursor and the pre&#8208;deposited Sb2Te3. The structural similarity between Sb2Te3 and Sb enables local epitaxial growth of a uniform, (00l)&#8208;oriented Sb film with exceptional surface smoothness (root&#8208;mean&#8208;squared roughness &lt;&lt; 1 nm) at a 4&#8208;nm thickness. Highly pure Sb films with excellent wafer&#8208;scale uniformity and conformality are achieved on high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. The mechanism involves substitution reactions driven by the preferential Te&#8208;(CH3)3Si bonding, along with enhanced atomic diffusion through the aligned crystal structure. Phase change memory devices using 5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick s&#8208;ALD Sb films demonstrate ultrafast switching with femtosecond laser pulses (&#8776;220 fs) with high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity (coefficient of variation &lt; 5 %) and ultralow drift coefficients (0.0013 for the on state and 0.0073 for the off state). This s&#8208;ALD technique offers a promising pathway for depositing ultrathin, uniform Sb films, enabling full utilization of Sb's unique nanoscale properties.

         <title>Constructing Highly Durable Fuel Cell Catalysts Through Integrating Graphitic Shell&#8208;Protected Composite Carbon Support with Gaseous Co Deposition&#8208;Driven PtCo Intermetallics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy is developed to design high&#8208;performance Pt3Co intermetallic catalysts by regulating gaseous Co&#8208;driven diffusion into finely dispersed Pt nanoparticles supported on a ZIF&#8208;8/polyaniline&#8208;derived core&#8208;shell structured composite carbon support. The corresponding PGM catalysts simultaneously achieved exceptional carbon support and catalyst stabilities owing to highly ordered PtCo intermetallic nanoparticles covered with a thin carbon layer, which are well&#8208;dispersed on the unique composite carbon support.








Abstract
Metal dissolution, nanoparticle agglomeration, and carbon support corrosion cause significant performance degradation of current PtCo catalysts under acidic and oxidative oxygen reduction reaction. Here, an integrated strategy is presented to design high&#8208;performance Pt3Co intermetallic catalysts by regulating gaseous Co deposition&#8208;driven diffusion into Pt nanoparticles supported on a composite carbon. The composite carbon is derived from ZIF&#8208;8/polyaniline, consisting of a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area (HSC) core and a protective graphitic shell (GS), which is employed to design 40&#160;wt.% Pt/HSC@GS catalyst. The corresponding membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) can maintain 1.09 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V (20. 7% loss) after 10&#160;000 cycles (1.0&#8211;1.5&#160;V for carbon stability) and 1.15 A cm&#8722;2 (16.1% loss) after 150&#160;000 cycles (0.60&#8211;0.95&#160;V for catalyst stability). A ordered Pt3Co intermetallic is synthesized via a gaseous Co&#8208;deposition process, which yields a homogeneous Co&#8208;rich layer onto the Pt nanoparticles on the composite support, thereby facilitating Co diffusion into Pt crystal during subsequent ordering annealing to form the ordered intermetallic structure. This gaseous deposition leads to a thin carbon layer on PtCo nanoparticles, inhibiting particle growth during the annealing and mitigating Co dissolution under dynamic electrochemical conditions. The PtCo catalyst achieves impressive MEA performance and long&#8208;term durability (1.45 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V after 120&#160;000 cycles) under heavy&#8208;duty conditions.

         <title>Photochemical Anchoring of Ultrahigh&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in MOFs for Enhanced Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a pyrolysis&#8208;free, low&#8208;temperature photochemical strategy to anchor ultrahigh&#8208;loading single&#8208;atom catalysts in meta&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Preserving structural integrity and pyridinic N sites, enables unique coordination environments (Pt&#8208;N2Cl2) for exceptional oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity and ultrasensitive biosensing.








Abstract
Achieving high metal loadings in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) remains a major challenge due to the degradation of anchoring sites during high&#8208;temperature synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;temperature photochemical reduction strategy that preserves the structural integrity of MOF and maximizes the density of unsaturated pyridinic nitrogen sites for efficient metal atom anchoring is reported. This pyrolysis&#8208;free approach enables the synthesis of SACs with record&#8208;high metal loadings, up to 20.5 wt.% for Pt, 16.9 wt.% for Ru, 15.4 wt.% for Os, 12.9 wt.% for Fe, and 9.6 wt.% for Cu, surpassing previous MOF&#8208;derived SACs by one order of magnitude. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the unique Pt&#8208;N2Cl2 coordination significantly enhances oxidase&#8208;like activity compared to conventional Pt&#8208;N3 configurations. Furthermore, the high metal loading increases the density of catalytically active sites, thereby improving overall catalytic efficiency. As a proof of concept, a Pt&#8208;SACs@MOF&#8208;based immunosensor achieves ultrasensitive detection of &#945;&#8208;fetoprotein (AFP) with a detection limit as low as 3 fg mL&#8722;1. This work offers a general and scalable strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;density SACs, addressing the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between metal loading and structural stability in MOF&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>A New Family of Ternary Intermetallic Compounds with Dualistic Atomic Ordering &#8211; The ZIP Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZIP phases are ternary intermetallic compounds with dualistic atomic ordering, i.e., they exhibit one face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc; space group Fd3&#175;$\bar 3$m) variant and one hexagonal (space group P63/mmc) variant. The ZIP phases in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni system are the Nb3SiNi2 (fcc) and Ni3SiNb2 (hexagonal) ternary IMCs, crystal structure schematics of which are pasted on the yin&#8208;yang Chinese cosmological symbol of duality.








Abstract
A new family of nanostructured ternary intermetallic compounds &#8722; named the ZIP phases &#8722; is introduced in this work. The ZIP phases exhibit dualistic atomic ordering, i.e., they form two structural variants: one with the fcc diamond cubic structure (space group Fd3&#175;$\bar 3$m) and one with the hexagonal structure (space group P63/mmc). They are also characterized by metallic behavior, ionic bonding, and atomic zigzagging. Powder metallurgical routes involving pressure&#8208;assisted densification are adopted to demonstrate ZIP phase synthesis in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Co, Ta&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, V&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, and Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Fe ternary systems. Crucially, reactive hot pressing is capable of producing high&#8208;purity ZIP phase materials after the judicious, elemental system&#8208;specific optimization of the processing route. Synthesis of phase&#8208;pure materials &#8211; demonstrated in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni ternary system by the synthesis of quasi phase&#8208;pure Nb3SiNi2 and Ni3SiNb2 ZIP phase&#8208;based materials &#8211; is a steppingstone to the prospective exploitation of the ZIP phases. Characterization of Nb3SiNi2 and Ni3SiNb2 involves crystal structure determination, spatially resolved chemical analysis, and determination of select thermal, electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and physical properties. Density functional theory is used to assess the stability of Nb3SiNi2 &amp; Ni3SiNb2 and derivative binary compounds at different temperatures, also exploring the exfoliation of these two ZIP phases along specific surfaces to produce 2D derivatives.

         <title>Vanadium&#8208;Assisted Epitaxy Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale Bilayer Tungsten Disulfide Ferroelectric Semiconductor Single Crystals with High&#8208;Endurance Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium&#8208;assisted epitaxy strategy is designed to synthesize two&#8208;inch bilayer 3R&#8208;WS2 single crystals. The introduction of vanadium not only increases interlayer coupling to break the formation energy degeneracy between 3R&#8208; and 2H&#8208;WS2, but also promotes parallel steps evolution on sapphire surfaces to induce unidirectional bilayer domains nucleation. FeS&#8208;FETs with high&#8208;endurance and a large write/erase ratio are fabricated due to excellent polarization.








Abstract
Bilayer rhombohedral&#8208;stacked (3R) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with switchable polarization expand the ferroelectric scope and provide a promising avenue to construct low&#8208;power and nonvolatile memory devices. However, epitaxy growth of wafer&#8208;scale 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystals is still on the way due to the challenge of phase structure and domain orientation control. Here, a vanadium&#8208;assisted epitaxy strategy is designed to synthesize two&#8208;inch bilayer 3R&#8208;WS2 single crystals on c&#8208;plane sapphire. The introduction of vanadium not only increases the interlayer coupling to break the formation energy degeneracy between 3R&#8208; and hexagonal&#8208;stacked (2H) WS2, but also promotes the parallel steps evolution on sapphire surfaces to induce the unidirectional bilayer domains nucleation. Ferroelectric semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors with high endurance (more than 105 cycles) and a large write/erase ratio (3.0 &#215; 105) are fabricated due to excellent polarization.

&lt;p&gt;A vanadium-assisted epitaxy strategy is designed to synthesize two-inch bilayer 3R-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals. The introduction of vanadium not only increases interlayer coupling to break the formation energy degeneracy between 3R- and 2H-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but also promotes parallel steps evolution on sapphire surfaces to induce unidirectional bilayer domains nucleation. FeS-FETs with high-endurance and a large write/erase ratio are fabricated due to excellent polarization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilayer rhombohedral-stacked (3R) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with switchable polarization expand the ferroelectric scope and provide a promising avenue to construct low-power and nonvolatile memory devices. However, epitaxy growth of wafer-scale 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystals is still on the way due to the challenge of phase structure and domain orientation control. Here, a vanadium-assisted epitaxy strategy is designed to synthesize two-inch bilayer 3R-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals on &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-plane sapphire. The introduction of vanadium not only increases the interlayer coupling to break the formation energy degeneracy between 3R- and hexagonal-stacked (2H) WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but also promotes the parallel steps evolution on sapphire surfaces to induce the unidirectional bilayer domains nucleation. Ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors with high endurance (more than 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cycles) and a large write/erase ratio (3.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) are fabricated due to excellent polarization. This work represents a substantial leap in terms of controlling synthesis and memory device construction of wafer-scale 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further design of logic-in-memory chips to overcome von Neumann architecture bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Giant Acceptor with a Novel Oxygenated Linker Modulates Molecular Crystallization Kinetics for High&#8208;Efficiency Non&#8208;Halogenated&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells</title>

A novel oxygenated Linker of giant acceptor modulates molecular&#8208;crystallization kinetics for high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;halogenated&#8208;processed organic solar cells and modules.








Abstract
The use of low&#8208;boiling&#8208;point halogenated solvents is common in lab&#8208;scale organic solar cell (OSC) fabrication to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), but their high volatility hinders large&#8208;scale fabrication. High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point, non&#8208;halogenated solvents are adopted as alternatives, but they often result in significant efficiency losses due to inferior morphology. In this work, toluene is adopted, enabling scalable production without any post&#8208;treatment. Two giant guest acceptors, featuring distinct oxygenated side chains, are introduced to modulate pre&#8208;aggregation in solution and crystallization kinetics within the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. The incorporation of giant acceptors effectively inhibits rapid acceptor aggregation and promotes smaller phase separation. Moreover, G&#8208;1O with a shorter oxygenated side chain yields more homogeneous phase separation, whereas G&#8208;3O with a longer side chain leads to uneven separation. Therefore, the G&#8208;1O&#8208;based ternary device achieves an outstanding PCE of 20.02%. Notably, a high PCE of 16.97% is also obtained in a large&#8208;area module (15.6 cm2, without dead zone). These findings highlight the critical role of oxygenated side&#8208;chain engineering in guest molecules for tuning crystallization kinetics under toluene processing.

         <title>Unfolding and Degradation of Micellar Immunodrug Carriers Derived From End Group Modified Aliphatic Poly(Carbonate)s with Acid&#8208;Responsive Ketal Side Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;responsive polymeric micelle system based of aliphatic poly(carbonate)s with benzyl ketal side chains is designed for targeted immunodrug delivery. It can disassemble in endosomal environments, enabling site&#8208;specific immunoactivation and enhanced biodegradability. Covalent end group conjugation of a TLR7/8 agonist regulates immune cell activation and cytokine regulation, offering a promising platform for safer, more effective immunotherapeutics.








Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule immunodrugs hold significant promise for immunotherapeutic applications including vaccination and cancer therapy. However, their clinical use is limited by severe side effects resulting from systemic distribution. To address this challenge, a biodegradable, acid&#8208;responsive nanocarrier system designed for controlled immunodrug delivery in vivo is presented. It is based on polymeric micelles that disassemble in response to acidic environments, enabling site&#8208;specific particle unfolding following endocytosis by antigen&#8208;presenting cells. Its core structure features a hydrolysable aliphatic poly(carbonate) backbone, promoting both biocompatibility and biodegradability. The high precision of the applied ring&#8208;opening polymerization allows for polymer end group functionalization, including the integration of fluorophores for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;based monitoring of particle integrity and unfolding. The observations reveal a pH&#8208;dependent disassembly profile both in vitro and in vivo. Comparative studies with non&#8208;responsive poly(carbonate)s demonstrate the superior performance of the acid&#8208;responsive design in selectively disassembling under acidic conditions and enhancing polymer backbone degradation. Furthermore, covalent conjugation of a small molecule Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonist promotes its controlled delivery in vitro and in vivo, resulting in improved immune cell uptake and regulated cytokine production. The findings underscore the potential of this biodegradable, acid&#8208;responsive micellar nanocarrier system as precision delivery platform for safer and effective immunotherapeutics.

         <title>Ultrafast Terahertz Field Control of the Emergent Magnetic and Electronic Interactions at Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense single&#8208;cycle THz electric&#8208;field pulses enable ultrafast control of emergent electronic and magnetic states at LaNiO3/CaMnO3 interfaces. Combined X&#8208;ray and optical probes reveal sub&#8208;picosecond demagnetization driven by spin&#8208;polarized currents and slower magnetoelastic dynamics linked to spin&#8211;lattice coupling. These intertwined processes uncover a pathway to manipulate interfacial ferromagnetism in correlated oxides using ultrafast THz&#8208;field control.








Abstract
Ultrafast electric&#8208;field control of emergent electronic and magnetic states at oxide interfaces offers exciting prospects for the development of the next generation of energy&#8208;efficient devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the electronic structure and emergent ferromagnetic interfacial state in epitaxial LaNiO3/CaMnO3 superlattices can be effectively controlled using intense, single&#8208;cycle THz electric&#8208;field pulses. A suite of advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic techniques is employed to measure a detailed magneto&#8208;optical profile and the thickness of the ferromagnetic interfacial layer. Then, a combination of time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent optical measurements is used to disentangle several correlated electronic and magnetic processes driven by ultrafast, high&#8208;field THz pulses. Sub&#8208;picosecond non&#8208;equilibrium Joule heating of the electronic system is observed, ultrafast demagnetization of the ferromagnetic interfacial layer, and slower dynamics indicative of a change in the magnetic state of the superlattice due to the transfer of spin&#8208;angular momentum to the lattice. These findings suggest a promising avenue for the efficient control of 2D ferromagnetic states at oxide interfaces using ultrafast electric&#8208;field pulses.

         <title>A Biomimetic MOF&#8208;Based &#8220;Dual&#8208;Stage Cumulative Activation&#8221; Autophagic Degradation System to Counter Tumor Recurrence Following Incomplete Radiofrequency Ablation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gallium metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based dual&#8208;stage autophagic degradation system cloaked with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell membranes delivers YTHDF1 binder Y040 and Beclin&#8208;1 to degrade YTHDF1, suppress m6A&#8211;EGFR signaling, induce immunogenic cell death, and prevent incomplete RFA (iRFA)&#8208;induced HCC recurrence while synergizing with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 therapy.








Abstract
Incomplete RFA (iRFA) often leads to local tumor recurrence and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The m6A reader protein YTHDF1 plays an important role in this process. However, there are currently no effective YTHDF1&#8208;specific inhibitors capable of overcoming tumor relapse following iRFA. This study successfully develops a &#8220;dual&#8208;stage cumulative activation&#8221; autophagic degradation system based on a gallium MOF scaffold. The MOF are cloaked with HCC&#8208;derived membranes, and a YTHDF1&#8208;specific small molecule binder Y040 and the autophagy&#8208;activating peptide Beclin&#8208;1 are assembled through metabolic glycan engineering combined with click chemistry. GaMOF@M&#8208;Beclin&#8208;Y040 increases autophagic flux in the HCC cells by 7.1&#8208;fold, and selectively degrades YTHDF1 with an efficiency of up to 92%. This in turn reduces m6A&#8208;mediated transcript stability of EGFR and protein translation. Moreover, GaMOF@M&#8208;Beclin&#8208;Y040 could trigger immunogenic cell death of HCC cells. Across three distinct HCC tumor models, GaMOF@M&#8208;Beclin&#8208;Y040 effectively prevent local tumor recurrence post&#8208;iRFA with an inhibition rate of 93.4%, synergized with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody to suppress metastatic tumor growth by 96.6% after iRFA relapse, and induced durable immune memory that reduced the recurrence rate to 7.5%. This novel protein degradation platform can address tumor recurrence after iRFA, and potentially be applied to other oncogenic targets. Furthermore, it offers a conceptual framework for treating tumors harboring traditionally &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets.

&lt;p&gt;A gallium metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-based dual-stage autophagic degradation system cloaked with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell membranes delivers YTHDF1 binder Y040 and Beclin-1 to degrade YTHDF1, suppress m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A&#8211;EGFR signaling, induce immunogenic cell death, and prevent incomplete RFA (iRFA)-induced HCC recurrence while synergizing with anti-PD-1 therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incomplete RFA (iRFA) often leads to local tumor recurrence and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A reader protein YTHDF1 plays an important role in this process. However, there are currently no effective YTHDF1-specific inhibitors capable of overcoming tumor relapse following iRFA. This study successfully develops a &#8220;dual-stage cumulative activation&#8221; autophagic degradation system based on a gallium MOF scaffold. The MOF are cloaked with HCC-derived membranes, and a YTHDF1-specific small molecule binder Y040 and the autophagy-activating peptide Beclin-1 are assembled through metabolic glycan engineering combined with click chemistry. GaMOF@M-Beclin-Y040 increases autophagic flux in the HCC cells by 7.1-fold, and selectively degrades YTHDF1 with an efficiency of up to 92%. This in turn reduces m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-mediated transcript stability of EGFR and protein translation. Moreover, GaMOF@M-Beclin-Y040 could trigger immunogenic cell death of HCC cells. Across three distinct HCC tumor models, GaMOF@M-Beclin-Y040 effectively prevent local tumor recurrence post-iRFA with an inhibition rate of 93.4%, synergized with anti-PD-1 antibody to suppress metastatic tumor growth by 96.6% after iRFA relapse, and induced durable immune memory that reduced the recurrence rate to 7.5%. This novel protein degradation platform can address tumor recurrence after iRFA, and potentially be applied to other oncogenic targets. Furthermore, it offers a conceptual framework for treating tumors harboring traditionally &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarimetric Photodetector with Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitivity and Polarity Reverse Based on Quasi&#8208;1D Semimetal (TaSe4)2I/2D MoTe2 Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel (TaSe4)2I/MoTe2 heterojunction architecture achieves four&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude dark current suppression via interfacial band engineering, enabling ultra&#8208;broadband detection with high sensitivity. Furthermore, its unique polarization&#8208;state reversal permits filter&#8208;free dual&#8208;band polarimetric imaging, showcasing significant potential for advanced on&#8208;chip photonic systems.








Abstract
Polarimetric photodetectors, capable of resolving both intensity and polarization states of light, are pivotal for advanced multispectral imaging and target recognition. Examples have been demonstrated for applications such as autonomous vehicle lidar systems and polarization&#8208;based biomedical imaging, where accurate polarization information improves target detection and contrast. However, conventional polarimetric detectors are constrained by complicated optical components and single&#8208;band polarization resolution. Here, a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction strategy is proposed that synergizes the unique optoelectronic properties and giant anisotropy of quasi&#8208;1D Weyl semimetal with 2D semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoTe2, achieving great dark current suppression and dual&#8208;band polarization&#8208;spectrum detection through interfacial band engineering. The (TaSe4)2I/2H&#8208;MoTe2 photodetectors demonstrate high&#8208;performance broadband operation (395&#8211;2200&#160;nm) with a detectivity of 2.1&#215;1012 Jones, responsivity of 40&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and quantum efficiency exceeding 11400%, setting a new benchmark for comprehensive performance in phototransistors. Notably, the intrinsic wavelength&#8208;dependent dichroic inversion of (TaSe4)2I enables the orthogonal polarization response polarity reversal between the visible (532&#160;nm) and infrared (1550&#160;nm) bands. Note that dual&#8208;band polarization imaging is successfully achieved, which can be used for multispectral interference identification. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy by constructing mixed&#8208;dimensional semimetal/semiconductor heterojunctions toward future ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity and broadband polarimetric detectors.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Nanomotor: H2S&#8208;Driven Cascade Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanomotor integrates photodynamic therapy, mild photothermal therapy, and enzyme dynamic therapy into a self&#8208;amplifying cascade through H2S&#8208;driven metabolic reprogramming.








Abstract
Despite advances in combination therapies for cancer treatment, most strategies rely on modular&#8208;additive designs that lack dynamic molecular cues to achieve intrinsic synergy. Herein, a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanoplatform is introduced that orchestrates photodynamic therapy (PDT), mild photothermal therapy (mPTT), and enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) into a self&#8208;amplifying cascade network through gasotransmitter (H2S)&#8208;driven metabolic reprogramming. It is constructed from an Au2Pt core with a surface functionalized mesoporous silica shell loaded with photosensitizers, encapsulated within a tumor cell membrane (Au2Pt@4sMSN/PS&#8208;TPP@CM). Upon GSH exposure, nanomotors produce H2S to boost diffusive motion, while TPP targeting directs this motility toward mitochondria, enabling efficient mitochondrial accumulation (internalization of &gt;100&#160;nm nanoparticles). Subsequently, mitochondrial targeted H2S releasing&#8208;mediated suppression of oxidative phosphorylation amplifies PDT efficacy; HSP70 downregulation enables mPTT; and hyperactive glycolytic metabolism fuels EDT. Furthermore, these enhanced modalities also interconnect in a positive feedback loop: mPTT&#8208;derived hyperthermia accelerates EDT&#8208;catalyzed oxygen generation for PDT, while mitochondria&#8208;localized PDT further inhibits HSP70 to boost mPTT. Ultimately, these interconnected molecular cues establish an H2S&#8208;driven, self&#8208;reinforcing therapeutic loop that enables effective eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, this study identifies mitochondria as the biological initiator and signal integrator for multimodal therapy, delivering a distinctive paradigm to overcome the limitations of conventional combination therapies.

         <title>Suppressing Reverse Intersystem Crossing by Confining Organic Molecules within LDH Interlayers for Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active photosensitizer prepared by intercalating I&#8208;IPA into ZnAl&#8208;LDH interlayers via a co&#8208;precipitation strategy is designed for NIR&#8208;II photodynamic immunotherapy, which possesses the highest relative 1O2 quantum yield among all the reported PSs due to the I&#8208;induced heavy&#8208;atom effect and LDH&#8208;mediated confinement effect, resulting in excellent performance in cell apoptosis and tumor ablation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) leveraging near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) light holds promise for deep&#8208;tissue cancer treatment, yet conventional photosensitizers (PSs) suffer from low singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yields due to inefficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and short&#8208;lived triplet states, hindering PDT effectiveness and subsequent immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction. Herein, a dual&#8208;optimized PS is reported by intercalating I&#8208;functionalized isophthalic acid (I&#8208;IPA) into ZnAl&#8208;LDH interlayers (LDH@I&#8208;IPA) for NIR&#8208;II PDT/immunotherapy. LDH&#8208;mediated confinement effect not only narrows the bandgap for effective NIR&#8208;II excitation, but also prolongs its triplet lifetime by 3 orders of magnitude through suppressing reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). Combined with I&#8208;induced heavy&#8208;atom effect promoting ISC, LDH@I&#8208;IPA achieves a record&#8208;high relative 1O2 quantum yield of 1.89. After polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification, LDH@I&#8208;IPA&#8208;PEG demonstrates potent tumor apoptosis and ICD, suppressing primary/metastatic tumors by 99.5%/52.2% through dendritic cell maturation, macrophage polarization, and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell activation. Theoretical calculations and transcriptomic analysis confirm bandgap engineering, RISC inhibition, and immune pathway regulation.

         <title>Largely Enhanced Photocatalysis Process by Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient and Eco&#8208;Friendly Recovery of Gold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an organic&#8208;inorganic composite microsphere catalyst for efficient gold extraction from electronic waste combined contact&#8208;electro&#8208;photocatalysis (CE&#8208;PhC). Fabricated by co&#8208;firing PTFE and TiO2, the catalyst enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic performance under ultrasonic excitation. Comparative tests show nearly an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in efficiency, offering potential for sustainable precious metal recovery and electronic waste recycling.








Abstract
Precious metal recovery has become increasingly critical due to resource scarcity, while conventional extraction methods often suffer from low efficiency and pollution problem. Here, this work proposes an efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic strategy based on the integration of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) and photocatalysis. The composite microsphere catalyst is fabricated by using low temperature co&#8208;firing TiO2/PTFE particles, which have an average diameter of &#8776;10 &#181;m and expose both TiO2 and PTFE active sites on its surface, enabling dual CEC&#8211;photocatalytic synergy reactions.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents an organic-inorganic composite microsphere catalyst for efficient gold extraction from electronic waste combined contact-electro-photocatalysis (CE-PhC). Fabricated by co-firing PTFE and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the catalyst enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic performance under ultrasonic excitation. Comparative tests show nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency, offering potential for sustainable precious metal recovery and electronic waste recycling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precious metal recovery has become increasingly critical due to resource scarcity, while conventional extraction methods often suffer from low efficiency and pollution problem. Here, this work proposes an efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic strategy based on the integration of contact-electro-catalysis (CEC) and photocatalysis. The composite microsphere catalyst is fabricated by using low temperature co-firing TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PTFE particles, which have an average diameter of &#8776;10 &#181;m and expose both TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PTFE active sites on its surface, enabling dual CEC&#8211;photocatalytic synergy reactions. Compared to pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with similar weight, this composite microsphere catalyst exhibits a tenfold enhancement in gold extraction efficiency from electronic waste. This high-performance leaching system operates under mild conditions, alleviating the need for traditional strong oxidants and offering potential for industrial application. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that charge transfer from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to PTFE and subsequently into TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with favorable energy band alignment between PTFE and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ensuring efficient carrier hopping and enhanced photocatalytic activity. This composite catalytic strategy based on organic&#8211;inorganic microsphere catalysts may be extended to areas like wastewater treatment, organic synthesis, and industrial waste valorization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization of S&#8208;Pt&#8208;C Atomic Site Enables Durable Mg&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A pd orbital hybridization strategy strengthens metalsupport interactions in single&#8208;metal&#8208;site COFs, stabilizing active sites and steering CO2 conversion pathways. The catalyst enables durable MgCO2 batteries with reduced energy barriers, flower&#8208;like discharge products, and record&#8208;long cycling stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts integrated within covalent organic framework (COFs) combine maximized atomic utilization with tunable porosity and robust coordination environments, enabling efficient CO2 diffusion, precise active&#8208;site control, and enhanced electron transfer for superior performance in metal&#8208;CO2 batteries. However, their practical application is limited by structural instability owing to the weak coordination effect of metal and &#960; electron under high redox&#8208;active operating condition. Herein, a p&#8208;d orbital hybridization strategy to strengthen metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) by introducing a sulfur atom with lone&#8208;pair electrons is reported, achieving highly durable Mg&#8208;CO2 and photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The p&#8208;d orbital hybridization strategy effectively lowers the reaction energy barrier and steers the reaction pathway toward the formation of flower&#8208;like discharge products, thereby enhancing both the energy conversion efficiency and reversibility of the battery. The Mg&#8208;CO2 battery with strengthen MSI achieves a high stable operation for over 420&#160;h at an ultralow overpotential of 0.34&#160;V and a high capacity of 50&#160;Ah&#160;g&#8722;1, representing the best&#8208;reported performance among Mg&#8208;CO2 batteries with single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalyst to date. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical studies prove that the strong MSI decreases discharge/charge energy barriers and switches the product morphology from dense, compact films to flower&#8208;like morphology.

         <title>Evidence of n&#8208;type Doping in Cubic Boron Arsenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lack of control in charge carrier type and concentration in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) limits its application as a high thermal conductivity semiconductor. Evidence of n&#8208;type behavior in boron arsenide crystals is shown. They are prepared by an improved growth process, reducing compensating impurities. Defect analysis revealed that silicon&#8208;substituted boron is a potential donor in BAs.








Abstract
Cubic boron arsenide (BAs) is a recently emerging semiconductor that has exceedingly high thermal conductivity. However, the lack of charge carrier concentration control in cubic BAs is a significant hindrance to its application in electronic devices. As&#8208;grown micro crystals of BAs are reported to be unintentionally p&#8208;type. Here, the evidence of inhomogeneous n&#8208;type behavior in BAs crystals grown by an improved growth process reducing the impurities is present. Local n&#8208;type doping is confirmed by four methods: current&#8208;voltage measurement, scanning photocurrent microscopy, Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, and Hall effect. Their analysis enables the formulation of a model describing BAs band bending on contacts and bias. Analysis of scanning photocurrent microscopy reveals that the diffusion length of minority carriers in BAs is substantial, reaching 33&#160;&#181;m. Defect analysis performed by current transient spectroscopy, photo&#8208;induced current transient spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that silicon&#8208;substituted boron is a candidate for a donor in BAs. Presented results show the perspective for bipolar control of charge carrier type in BAs and consequently its application in better thermally managed microelectronics.

         <title>Methylation&#8208;Engineered MR&#8208;TADF Emitters for BT.2020&#8208;Compliant Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with High kRISC and ACQ Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly distorted MR&#8208;TADF emitters are developed by precise methylation of the B/N core, boosting spin&#8211;orbit coupling and suppressing ACQ. The resulting OLEDs exhibit BT.2020&#8208;compliant blue emission, record&#8208;high EQEs (up to 34.8%) with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off, and negligible performance loss up to 10 wt% doping, representing a breakthrough toward practical deep&#8208;blue OLED applications.








Abstract
Achieving deep&#8208;blue emission with high efficiency and color purity remains a major challenge for next&#8208;generation organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), particularly those targeting the BT.2020 color standard. Herein, a methyl substitution&#8208;induced molecular distortion strategy is proposed to construct deep&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;M2 and BN&#8208;M3), that simultaneously enhance spin&#8211;orbit coupling and suppress &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Strategic methyl substitution induces significant distortion in the B/N core geometry (dihedral angle &gt; 40&#176;), boosting reverse intersystem crossing rates (up to 2.71 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1) and mitigating aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The optimized emitters achieve narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission (Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage y coordinate, CIEy = 0.045) and near&#8208;ultraviolet emission (CIEy = 0.035), with a full width at half maximum of 22&#8211;24&#160;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (&#8776;100%). Furthermore, OLEDs show record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency with minimal roll&#8208;off: BN&#8208;M3 achieves 34.8% for BT.2020 blue emission, while BN&#8208;M2 reaches 21.4% in the near&#8208;UV spectrum, setting a new benchmark. Notably, the device performance remains stable even at high doping concentrations (up to 15 wt%). This work provides a viable pathway toward realizing BT.2020&#8208;compliant blue OLEDs with both outstanding optoelectronic performance and excellent industrial processability.

         <title>Reprogrammable Dual&#8208;Regulated Pollen Actuators for Geometric Encoding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging abundant natural pollen materials, a novel sustainable bilayer actuator demonstrating dual&#8208;layer modulation and complete re&#8208;programmability for controlled complex deformation is presented. The toner pattern defines deformation direction, while the pollen layer adjusts humidity responsiveness via pH. Along with complete reprogramming effectively encodes information through complex geometries as responsive smart devices.








Abstract
Bilayer actuators capable of autonomously responding to complex environmental stimuli have attracted increasing interest for their potential in intelligent and multifunctional systems. Yet, achieving simultaneous programming and reprogramming of shape transformations in both active and passive layers through scalable, sustainable methods remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel bilayer actuator derived from naturally abundant pollen is reported, offering unprecedented dual&#8208;layer re&#8208;programmability. The passive layer, composed of digitally patterned toner, dictates the deformation direction, with the folding angles ranging from 0&#176; to &#8776;152&#176;. Meanwhile, the active pollen layer exhibits tunable humidity responsiveness modulated by pH, controlling actuation curvature ranging from 0.036 to 0.28&#160;cm&#160;cm&#8722;1 and response speed ranging from 1.04 to 0.15&#176;&#160;s&#8722;1.

     alt="Reprogrammable Dual-Regulated Pollen Actuators for Geometric Encoding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging abundant natural pollen materials, a novel sustainable bilayer actuator demonstrating dual-layer modulation and complete re-programmability for controlled complex deformation is presented. The toner pattern defines deformation direction, while the pollen layer adjusts humidity responsiveness via pH. Along with complete reprogramming effectively encodes information through complex geometries as responsive smart devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilayer actuators capable of autonomously responding to complex environmental stimuli have attracted increasing interest for their potential in intelligent and multifunctional systems. Yet, achieving simultaneous programming and reprogramming of shape transformations in both active and passive layers through scalable, sustainable methods remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel bilayer actuator derived from naturally abundant pollen is reported, offering unprecedented dual-layer re-programmability. The passive layer, composed of digitally patterned toner, dictates the deformation direction, with the folding angles ranging from 0&#176; to &#8776;152&#176;. Meanwhile, the active pollen layer exhibits tunable humidity responsiveness modulated by pH, controlling actuation curvature ranging from 0.036 to 0.28&#160;cm&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and response speed ranging from 1.04 to 0.15&#176;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, the entire bilayer system can be fully disassembled via a mild, one-pot alkaline process, enabling more than 10 cycles of complete reprogramming without structural degradation. This dual-regulated architecture supports complex 3D geometric transformations and is demonstrated as a carrier of confidential information, encoding data through morphing analogs of encrypted binary code. By integrating programmable mechanics, renewable biomaterials, and energy-efficient reusability, this work establishes an eco-friendly and versatile platform for next-generation responsive materials and encrypted smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Energetic Disorder of Organic Semiconductors for Semitransparent Photovoltaics and Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of using phthalate esters as assembly&#8208;inducing agents (AIAs) is introduced to improve the packing ordering of organic semiconductors, thereby reducing the energetic disorders. After AIA processing, the light utilization efficiency of semitransparent organic photovoltaics and the mobility of organic field&#8208;effect transistors are improved by 13.7% and 33.3%, respectively.








Abstract
The weak intermolecular interaction and short&#8208;range aggregation endow organic semiconductors with the merits of flexibility, light weight, and solution processibility, while introducing more disorders at the same time. The greater degree of disorders in organic semiconductors, compared to inorganic semiconductors, is one of the major obstacles to their performance; thus, minimizing disorders is a key approach to boost the performance of organic electronics. Here, a strategy of using phthalate esters is introduced as assembly&#8208;inducing agents (AIAs) to improve the packing ordering of organic semiconductors, thereby reducing the energetic disorders and improving the device performance. With dioctyl phthalate AIA, the organic semiconductor PM6 shows a 24% reduction in Urbach energy, 11% narrower absorption full width at half maximum, and suppressed absorption tails in thin film. In organic field&#8208;effect transistors, this strategy offers a lift of hole mobility by 33.3%. In semitransparent organic photovoltaics, this strategy improves the average visible transmittance by 11.2% while maintaining the power conversion efficiency, yielding a high light utilization efficiency of 4.63% in optical structure&#8208;free devices. This work provides a facile and effective approach to suppress the energetic disorder of organic semiconductors and opens up a new avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Scale Carrier Localization Boosts High&#8208;Temperature Energy Storage and High&#8208;Entropy Energy Harvesting</title>

Molecular&#8208;scale carrier localization: Carrier regulation via molecular engineering and directional interpenetrating structures, enabling energy storage (high operating condition energy density) and high&#8208;entropy energy harvesting (device driving via Triboelectric Nanogenerator&#8208;Voltage Management Circuit systems).








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature insulation/energy storage applications boost the rapid development of polymer dielectrics such as polyimide (PI) with excellent thermal stability. However, PI exhibits significant leakage current due to intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;chain charge transfer complexes (CTCs), which seriously increases the risk of thermal runaway. Although single charge transfer inhibition strategies have been developed, the results remain unsatisfying due to the &#8220;short&#8208;board effect in carrier suppression.&#8221; Herein, a &#8220;carrier localization&#8221; approach is introduced that synergistically regulates both intramolecular and intermolecular CT suppression. Thanks to molecular engineering and a directional intercalation structure, the all&#8208;organic polyimide dielectric materials with multidimensional carrier migration suppression achieve an exceptional breakdown strength of 878.9&#160;kV&#160;mm&#8722;1 and Ud of 8.93&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 150&#160;&#176;C and energy density of 5.64 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 200&#160;&#176;C (&#951; &gt; 90%), outperforming many reported systems. The all&#8208;organic polyimide dielectric materials also enable to possess high charge density (215 &#181;C&#160;m&#8722;2) when integrated into a self&#8208;excited triboelectric nanogenerator, which is highly desirable for the harvesting of low&#8208;frequency, irregular mechanical energy from a high&#8208;entropy environment. Collectively, this work provides a solid foundation for advanced energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>High Performing Ambipolar Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Solid&#8208;State Inverters Enabled by Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Side Chains Integration</title>

Record&#8208;high &#181;C* and normalized transconductance are achieved based on DPP&#8208;V&#8208;based ambipolar polymers with hydrophilic/hydrophobic side&#8208;chain integration, with balanced n/p&#8208; type performance in ambipolar OECTs and a high voltage gain of 393&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1 in aqueous electrolytes. Single&#8208;component polymer also enables SS&#8208;OECTs with high transconductance and antiambipolar behavior, achieving a record&#8208;high SS&#8208;inverter gain of 163&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, setting a benchmark for solid&#8208;state bio&#8208;integrated electronic circuits. 








Abstract
Progress in solid&#8208;state organic electrochemical transistors (SS&#8208;OECTs) and complementary circuits is limited by the lack of high&#8208;performance single component ambipolar mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (AMIECs). Herein, two DPP&#8208;V&#8208;based terpolymers, p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05)&#160;and&#160;p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B20) are designed, featuring an ambipolar backbone and tunable integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic side&#8208;chain engineering to optimize mixed conduction. Both polymers exhibited state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ambipolar performance in aqueous OECTs, with p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05) demonstrating the record &#181;C* values of 384.8&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (n&#8208;type) and 691.7 F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 (p&#8208;type), along with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art normalized transconductance of 72.6 S&#160;cm&#8722;1for n&#8208;type.&#160;These exceptional performances are attributed to the synergistic enhancement of electronic mobility and optimized ion capacity. Aqueous inverters based on single&#8208;component p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05) delivered a high voltage gain of 393&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, benefiting from well&#8208;balanced n/p&#8208;type characteristics. Notably, this material also enabled high&#8208;performing SS&#8208;OECTs, which retained strong transconductance and current output, and exhibited typical antiambipolar behavior. Furthermore, single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state inverters (SS&#8208;inverters) achieved a record&#8208;high voltage gain of 163&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, representing the first SS&#8208;inverters based on AMIECs and the highest value reported for SS&#8208;inverter systems to date. These results underscore the effectiveness of the molecular design strategy and highlight the promise of ambipolar polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) for scalable, solid&#8208;state, bio&#8208;integrated electronic circuits.

         <title>Stabilizing Frustrated Phase Transitions in Selective Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using multimodal operando spectromicroscopy, the frustrated phase transition responsible for selective oxidation over cobalt oxide spinel catalysts is identified, corresponding to combined surface reaction and Mars&#8208;van Krevelen (MvK) dynamics. This regime is disrupted by the formation of mobile vacancies and the depletion of active oxygen at high temperatures. Co&#8208;feeding water vapor mitigates these effects, thereby enhancing both selectivity and lifetime.








Abstract
Frustrated phase transitions represent the ideal working state of a heterogeneous catalyst. These states exist within a narrow parameter window, making them difficult to stabilize. Here, it is shown for the selective oxidation of 2&#8208;propanol to acetone over Co3O4 spinels that the addition of water extends the stability regime of the relevant frustrated phase transition. This conclusion is based on results obtained from multi&#8208;modal experiments, including operando scanning electron microscopy (OSEM), near ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP&#8208;XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and computer vision analysis. It is found that the most selective state for acetone formation coincides with a dynamic spinel structure that fluctuates through reversible redox processes. At elevated temperatures, this metastable state undergoes a complete phase transition into the rock&#8208;salt CoO phase characterized by low acetone selectivity. This process is found to be mediated by the generation of mobile vacancies. The addition of water vapor mitigates vacancy mobility and stabilizes the selective, but thermodynamically frustrated, state. As such, the study conceptualizes a strategy to extend the lifetime of a catalyst during reaction by the adequate addition of a co&#8208;reactant.

         <title>Engineered Cryo&#8208;Shocked Cancer Cells Deliver Dual&#8208;Function Gene Medicines for Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering integrated platform for melanoma immunotherapy is presented using cryo&#8208;shocked cancer cells as a targeted &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; delivery system. This nanocarrier transports a novel dual&#8208;function plasmid that co&#8208;delivers the chemokine CXCL9 and a PCSK9 adenine base editor, synergistically enhancing T&#8208;cell infiltration and activation to achieve strong antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Immunotherapies for melanoma are frequently hindered by resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and poor infiltration of T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome these limitations,&#160;a novel dual&#8208;function plasmid is designed, termed CXCL9&#8208;ABEPCSK9, that combines adenine base editing to knock down PCSK9 (a newly identified immunosuppressive factor that impairs CD8&#8314; T cell activity) with overexpression of the chemokine CXCL9, known for its role in recruiting T cells. The plasmid is first encapsulated into a liposome and then loaded on the liquid nitrogen&#8208;treated (LNT) tumor cells, generating LNT@LipoC9AP particles. These LNT cells maintain structural integrity and tumor&#8208;homing properties, functioning as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; delivery system, while losing pathogenicity. It is find that LNT@LipoC9AP effectively increased CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and exhibited potent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. To further improve tumor targeting, LNT@LipoC9AP is engineered by decorating the LNT cell surface with RGD4C peptides, yielding R&#8208;LNT@LipoC9AP, which targets &#945;v&#946;3 integrins commonly overexpressed in melanoma. R&#8208;LNT@LipoC9AP demonstrated superior tumor accumulation, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and a favorable safety profile. Altogether, the LNT cell&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system for CXCL9 and ABEPCSK9 overcomes the limitations of current tumor immunotherapy and may serve as a promising gene therapy strategy for solid tumors treatment.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Directed Assembly of Stretchable Strain Sensors with Tunable Performance on Complex Curved Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a bilayer strain sensor fabrication strategy that enables large&#8208;scale patterning via laser direct writing on 3D stretchable substrates. The resulting sensors exhibit tunable performance through laser&#8208;induced microstructural engineering. By constructing a sensor array on a hemispherical surface, the authors further demonstrate the potential of this approach for curved&#8208;surface strain mapping and deformation reconstruction.








Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are capable of accurately mapping deformation across object surfaces, serving as critical components in structural health monitoring and failure mitigation across diverse systems. However, the inherent geometric complexity and non&#8208;uniformity of real&#8208;world surfaces pose significant challenges to conformal sensor integration. Moreover, conventional strain sensors face inherent trade&#8208;offs among sensitivity, detection range, and tunability, limiting their adaptability in practical applications. This study introduces a laser direct writing strategy that combines material and process innovations to enable scalable fabrication of strain sensors on preformed stretchable curved surfaces. Precise control of laser&#8208;induced microstructures allows programmable tuning of electromechanical properties, enabling selective behaviors such as high linearity, strain insensitivity, or pronounced resistance changes at small strains. The resulting devices exhibit a high gauge factor of up to 106, a strain detection range exceeding 100%, a minimum detectable strain of 0.1%, and excellent linearity (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.98) within defined operational ranges. As a proof of concept, a sensor array is implemented for strain mapping and deformation reconstruction on a hemispherical 3D stretchable substrate, demonstrating the capability of this approach for high&#8208;resolution strain monitoring on complex, non&#8208;planar geometries.

         <title>Janus Nanohybrids Enable Superflash Warming and High&#8208;Affinity Ice Confinement for Cross&#8208;Scale Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a Janus nanocryoprotectant featuring a heterogeneous cranial and corporal structure, achieving 98.4% ice recrystallization inhibition and record&#8208;high superflash warming rates across various scales. It effectively addresses key challenges in cross&#8208;scale cryopreservation of commercial cell cryopackages, offering significant advancements for cell therapy and organ transplantation.








Abstract
Strong hydration of cryoprotective agents reduces the glass transition temperature of water and suppresses ice formation. However, lethal cooling and warming remain a critical obstacle to cross&#8208;scale cryopreservation of clinical biospecimens. Herein, a snowman&#8208;like Janus nanohybrid composed of magnetic iron tetraoxide and photothermal polypyrrole is reported. Its cranial&#8211;corporal asymmetry enables heterogeneous hydration for a record high efficiency of ice confinement, reducing mean ice crystal area by 98.4%. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Janus architecture simultaneously enhances interactions with ice and strengthens the local hydration anisotropy, accounting for the effective inhibition of ice growth. Superflash warming over 920&#160;&#176;C min&#8210;1 by magnetically rotating its anisotropic structure for uniform heat dissipation narrows the hostile temperature window in micro&#8208;/macroscopic scenarios, as further confirmed by Monte Carlo modeling. This design enables cost&#8208;effective post&#8208;thaw magnetic retrieval, eliminating the need for heavy centrifuges, well&#8208;suited for scalable and on&#8208;site applications. As a result, cryopreserved samples from single cells, bacteria, to porcine trachea retain near&#8208;complete viability and functionality. Therefore, this study offers a promising technique to bridge the gap between microscale cell storage and whole&#8208;organ preservation.

         <title>3D Flat Band in Ultra&#8208;Thin Kagome Metal Mn3Sn Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy have been used to demonstrate that ultra&#8208;thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn exhibit a robust dispersionless 3D flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV.Importantly, manganese defect engineering was used to demonstrate chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level. The realization of a robust three&#8208;dimensional kagome band in an ultra&#8208;thin kagome metal is an important step towards observing kagome&#8208;lattice derived strongly correlated topological and quantum phases when the flat band is tuned to the Fermi level, with implications for quantum computing, spintronics, and low&#8208;energy electronics.








Abstract
Flat bands with narrow energy dispersion can give rise to strongly correlated electronic and topological phases, especially when located at the Fermi level. Whilst flat bands are experimentally realized in 2D twisted van der Waals heterostructures, they are highly sensitive to twist angle, necessitating complex fabrication techniques. Geometrically frustrated kagome lattices have emerged as an attractive alternative platform as they can natively host flat bands that are observed experimentally in quasi&#8208;2D bulk&#8208;crystal kagome metals. An outstanding experimental question is whether flat bands can be realized in ultra&#8208;thin metals, with opportunities for stronger electron&#8211;electron interactions through tuning of the surrounding dielectric environment. Here, angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and band structure calculations are used to show that ultra&#8208;thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn host a robust dispersionless flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV. Furthermore, chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level via manganese defect engineering is demonstrated.

     alt="3D Flat Band in Ultra-Thin Kagome Metal Mn3Sn Film"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy have been used to demonstrate that ultra-thin films of the kagome metal Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn exhibit a robust dispersionless 3D flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV.Importantly, manganese defect engineering was used to demonstrate chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level. The realization of a robust three-dimensional kagome band in an ultra-thin kagome metal is an important step towards observing kagome-lattice derived strongly correlated topological and quantum phases when the flat band is tuned to the Fermi level, with implications for quantum computing, spintronics, and low-energy electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat bands with narrow energy dispersion can give rise to strongly correlated electronic and topological phases, especially when located at the Fermi level. Whilst flat bands are experimentally realized in 2D twisted van der Waals heterostructures, they are highly sensitive to twist angle, necessitating complex fabrication techniques. Geometrically frustrated kagome lattices have emerged as an attractive alternative platform as they can natively host flat bands that are observed experimentally in quasi-2D bulk-crystal kagome metals. An outstanding experimental question is whether flat bands can be realized in ultra-thin metals, with opportunities for stronger electron&#8211;electron interactions through tuning of the surrounding dielectric environment. Here, angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and band structure calculations are used to show that ultra-thin films of the kagome metal Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn host a robust dispersionless flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV. Furthermore, chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level via manganese defect engineering is demonstrated. The realization of tunable kagome-derived flat bands in an ultra-thin kagome metal represents a promising platform to study strongly correlated and topological phenomena, with applications in quantum computing, spintronics and low-energy electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Photoactivatable Cobalt(III) Nanoparticles for Photoactivated Metal Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

This study presents new insights on NIR&#8208;II accelerated prodrug reduction of Co(III) nanoparticles by co&#8208;assembling of a pseudo&#8208;conjugated polymer with Co(III) in the polymer main chain, and NIR&#8208;II phototriggered effective photothermal therapy synergistic photo&#8208;activated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Photoactivated cobalt(III) (Co(III)) complexes have great potential for cancer therapy due to their unique interactions with cancer cells. However, its clinical application remains limited by its high toxicity due to low spatial&#8208;temporal control. Here, a second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) photoactivated Co(III) nanoparticles (NanoCo) is shown. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NanoCo is capable of generating photothermal heat to accelerate the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II). Under hypoxic conditions, NanoCo is 166 times more effective than cisplatin at killing platinum&#8208;resistant A549DDP tumor cells. Notably, when exposed to 1064&#160;nm irradiation, NanoCo becomes 5000 times more effective than oxaliplatin at killing CT26 cells under normoxic conditions. NanoCo accumulates at the tumor site, generating photothermal heat and killing tumor cells under 1064&#160;nm irradiation. Additionally, NanoCo under 1064&#160;nm irradiation triggers immunogenic cell death, further stimulating dendritic cell maturation and inducing anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. The combination of Pt(IV) nanoparticles (HSA@Pt) with NanoCo under 1064&#160;nm irradiation achieves a 99% tumor growth inhibition rate in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. This work is the first to introduce Co(III) complexes activated by NIR&#8208;II light for photoactivated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Handed Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Polymer Fiber&#8208;Confined and Stabilized Perovskite Nanocrystals in Hydrated Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) composite is achieved by confining perovskite nanocrystals within polymer nanofibers and integrating them into a chiral cellulose nanocrystal framework. The nanofiber confinement enables high photoluminescence efficiency, mechanical robustness, and tunable CPL handedness from a single left&#8208;handed structure for advanced optical encryption applications.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of interest for optical encryption and anticounterfeiting applications. However, achieving dual&#8208;handed CPL emission from perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) in hydrated chiral liquid crystal systems remains a challenge because of their susceptibility to water&#8208;induced degradation and disruption of liquid crystal ordering. These issues limit luminescence efficiency, structural integrity, and chiroptical control. Here, a confinement strategy is presented using polymer&#8208;encapsulated perovskite nanofibers, which isolate PNCs from water while supporting the in situ self&#8208;assembly of cellulose nanocrystals into a cholesteric photonic framework. The resulting solid&#8208;state composite achieves high photoluminescence quantum yield (65.56%), mechanical strength (32.15&#160;MPa), and a broad dissymmetry factor range (glum from &#8722;0.96 to +0.49) from a single left&#8208;handed cholesteric structure. Importantly, by engineering the reflectivity of asymmetric bilayer architectures, the composite exhibits enhanced dual&#8208;handed CPL emission depending on the viewing direction. The multimodal optical properties demonstrated here highlight the potential of this system in optical encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Selected Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction defines the vector spin chirality in Mn3Sn thin films, enabling deterministic control of the anomalous Hall conductivity polarity. Combining experiments, symmetry analysis, and atomistic simulations, this study reveals a chirality&#8208;selected noncollinear antiferromagnetic state stabilized by interfacial engineering, offering a pathway to controllable Berry&#8208;curvature phenomena in antiferromagnets.








Abstract
The topological noncollinear antiferromagnet (AFM) Mn3Sn exhibits a giant anomalous Hall conductance (AHC) originating from its nonvanishing Berry curvature. Conventionally, the two AHC states are regarded as time&#8208;reversal pairs coupled to the magnetic octupole moment, and their control has relied on reversing this moment by external magnetic fields or electric currents. Here, an alternative mechanism is demonstrated&#8212;the chirality&#8208;selected noncollinear antiferromagnetic state&#8212;in which the AHC polarity is defined by the vector spin chirality (VSC) of the Kagome lattice. By constructing Mn3Sn/Pt heterostructures, a Fert&#8211;Levy&#8211;type Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) is introduced that sets the lattice chirality. The induced DMI changes the VSC from counterclockwise (CCW) to clockwise (CW), resulting in a corresponding inversion of the AHC sign. This behavior is confirmed by symmetry analysis and atomistic simulations that link the polarity inversion to the competition between DMI energy and intrinsic anisotropy. These findings establish a chirality&#8208;defined route for controlling noncollinear antiferromagnetic order and highlight DMI engineering as a powerful means of tailoring Berry&#8208;curvature&#8208;driven transport in AFMs.

         <title>La(OH)3&#8208;Based Lithium Ionic Conductor for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydroxide&#8208;based Li0.15Sr0.525La0.6(OH)3 (LSLOH) conductor is first designed and synthesized. The LSLOH is air&#8208;stable and cost&#8208;effective compared to existing inorganic electrolytes, and shows Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. The pouch cell with polymer&#8208;inorganic electrolyte delivers 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 reversible capacity over 200 cycles, showing the potential for quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (QSSLMBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage but face major challenges for applications, including air instability of electrolytes, high synthesis cost, and poor interfacial compatibility. Here, La(OH)3&#8208;based Li+ conductor Li0.15Sr0.525La0.6(OH)3 (LSLOH) is reported, which is air&#8208;stable and cost&#8208;effective. LSLOH serves as an ionic conductor exhibiting Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. To improve interfacial transport, LSLOH is incorporated into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;LiTFSI polymer electrolyte (PL) to form a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PL&#8208;LSLOH). LSLOH provides additional Li&#8314; transport channels, while La3+ and Sr2+ interact with TFSI&#8722; to promote Li&#8314; mobility. Moreover, LSLOH induces the formation of a LiOH and Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. As a result, the LiNi0.6Co0.1Mn0.3O2 | PL&#8208;LSLOH | Li pouch cells achieve 2.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (with cathode loading of 19&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) over 200 cycles with 92.5% initial capacity retention, underscoring the potential for scale&#8208;up. For the first time, this work demonstrates La(OH)3&#8208;based lithium ionic conductors and electrolyte design that address key barriers to the QSSLMBs.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-solid-state lithium metal batteries (QSSLMBs) hold great promise for next-generation energy storage but face major challenges for applications, including air instability of electrolytes, high synthesis cost, and poor interfacial compatibility. Here, La(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductor Li&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.525&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LSLOH) is reported, which is air-stable and cost-effective. LSLOH serves as an ionic conductor exhibiting Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30&#160;&#176;C. To improve interfacial transport, LSLOH is incorporated into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-LiTFSI polymer electrolyte (PL) to form a quasi-solid-state electrolyte (PL-LSLOH). LSLOH provides additional Li&#8314; transport channels, while La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; interact with TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to promote Li&#8314; mobility. Moreover, LSLOH induces the formation of a LiOH and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-rich solid electrolyte interphase, effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. As a result, the LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | PL-LSLOH | Li pouch cells achieve 2.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (with cathode loading of 19&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) over 200 cycles with 92.5% initial capacity retention, underscoring the potential for scale-up. For the first time, this work demonstrates La(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based lithium ionic conductors and electrolyte design that address key barriers to the QSSLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy: Synergizing Cavitation Amplification and Efficient Sonoluminescence&#8208;to&#8208;ROS Conversion for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic therapy strategy that simultaneously amplifies acoustic cavitation and optimizes sonoluminescence&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion is exploited. The developed pH&#8208;responsive nano&#8208;sonosensitizer combines an acid&#8208;activated carrier with an aggregation&#8208;induced emission sonosensitizer, achieving potent ROS generation. This system demonstrates remarkable therapeutic efficacy, significantly inhibiting orthotopic breast tumor growth through enhanced sonodynamic effects.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), as a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality with superior penetration depth, receives tremendous attention. To date, the widely accepted mechanism for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in SDT involves acoustic cavitation&#8208;triggered sonoluminescence (SL), followed by the SL&#8208;activation of sonosensitizers. However, current research on sonosensitizer development primarily focuses on promoting SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion, overlooking the essential role of the cavitation process. To fully unleash the potential of SDT, herein, a dual&#8208;enhanced strategy that harnesses the enhanced cavitation for SL generation and efficient SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion is developed for the first time to realize an all&#8208;around enhancement of SDT. Specifically, the proposed nano&#8208;sonosensitizer, namely MeTTh&#8208;PAE NPs, is released as hydrophobic aggregates with a rough surface in response to an acidic environment, allowing for highly enhanced cavitation&#8208;triggered SL under ultrasound. Meanwhile, as a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecule, MeTTh demonstrates a highly promoted intersystem crossing process at its aggregated state, facilitating efficient SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion. Notably, combining these two fascinating attributes in MeTTh&#8208;PAE NPs results in an excellent sonodynamic antitumor effect in both in vitro and in vivo. This work proposes a novel strategy to fully exploit the potential of SDT and provides valuable insights for advancing the design of nano&#8208;sonosensitizers.

         <title>A One&#8208;Pot Carbonyl&#8208;Functionalization Strategy for Hybrid Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Towards Highly Efficient Narrowband Blue and Yellow&#8208;Green OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel one&#8208;pot method is developed for introducing carbonyls into the B/N&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF molecule BCzBN, yielding blue&#8208;emitting BN&#9472;CO. BN&#9472;CO is further converted into yellow&#8208;green BN&#8208;CN via iron&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;annulation, which combines B/N&#8208;based and imine/amine&#8208;based structures. Both molecules showed narrower spectra compared with their B/N&#8208;based precursors as well as good OLED performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed MR hybridization design.








Abstract
The incorporation of fused carbonyl structures into multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecular frameworks is a promising strategy for precise emission color tuning and spectral narrowing. However, few molecules have been developed through this strategy, primarily because of the harsh reaction conditions required for carbonyl&#8208;related reactions. Herein, a feasible one&#8208;pot synthetic approach is reported for embedding carbonyl groups as lockers in B/N&#8208;based skeletons under mild conditions, yielding BN&#8208;CO, a blue boron/nitrogen/carbonyl hybrid MR emitter. Owing to enhanced molecular planarity and rigidity, BN&#8208;CO exhibits an emission maximum (&#955;e) of 462 nm with an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16 nm. These carbonyl groups also function as versatile modification sites. Subsequent aza&#8208;annulation affords a yellow&#8208;green&#8208;emitting BN&#8208;CN (&#955;e = 546 nm, FWHM = 26 nm), which uniquely combines imine/amine with B/N MR characteristics while exhibiting a significant 84 nm emission red&#8208;shift. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit high maximum EQEs (33.5% for BN&#8208;CO and 38.0% for BN&#8208;CN). Notably, BN&#8208;CN&#8208;based devices exhibit extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;offs (EQE = 34.2% at 100,000 cd/m2) and a maximum luminance of 5.61&#215;10&#8309; cd/m2. The proposed approach provides a versatile route for fabricating novel MR architectures and enables the use of carbonyl groups as tunable modification sites facilitating molecular engineering.

         <title>Regulation of Solvation and Interfacial Chemistry via Monofluorinated Cations Enables High&#8208;Voltage and Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A novel localized moderate&#8208;concentration ionic liquid electrolyte, derived from the monofluorinated ionic liquid, has been developed that exhibits superior safety performance and good compatibility with lithium metal anodes and Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
The fluorine&#8208;rich electrode electrolyte interphase, chemically sourced from fluorinated anions and solvents, plays a pivotal role in improving the cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) equipped with Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. To prestore fluorine source on cations, here a novel monofluorinated cationic skeleton has been designed and synthesized. Its role is first investigated in the regulation of solvation structure and evolution in both bulk and interface regions. The monofluorinated cation can compete with lithium ions for coordinating electrolyte molecules, which improves the oxidative stability of solvents on the cathode surface and prevents the undesirable transition from the anion&#8208;rich to anion&#8208;deficient structure at the anode interface induced by the interfacial electric field. By leveraging this ionic liquid architecture carrying fluorine in both cation and anion, A localized moderate&#8208;concentration ionic liquid electrolyte (LMCILE) is developed that exhibits exceptional compatibility with lithium metal anodes and superior safety characteristics. LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|LMCILE|Li (4.5&#160;V) cells display excellent cycle stability with a good capacity retention of 82.9% over 950 cycles. The Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2|LMCILE|Li (4.5&#160;V) system also delivers good electrochemical performance with high capacity retention of 91.4% after 300 cycles and 90.3% after 200 cycles, even at 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Hyperthermia: Diamond Quantum Thermometry Reveals Thermal Control of Macrophage Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal nanodiamonds with quantum sensing capabilities generate lysosome&#8208;confined hyperthermia, enabling simultaneous temperature and radical detection via diamond sensing. This localized thermal and oxidative stress drives pro&#8208;inflammatory (M1) macrophage polarization, revealing a new strategy for precision immunomodulation through subcellular control of heat and redox signaling.








Abstract
Fever elevates body temperature to enhance immune response; however, intracellular temperature can fluctuate by up to 15&#160;&#176;C, suggesting a previously unrecognized layer of thermal regulation. While hyperthermia has long been exploited in medicine, how localized temperature gradients influence cellular fate remains poorly understood. Here, a dual&#8208;function nanodiamond platform is introduced that integrates optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) thermometry with croconium&#8208;dye&#8208;based photothermal heating to precisely modulate temperature within endo&#8208;lysosomal compartments of macrophages. Controlled intracellular hyperthermia triggers oxidative stress, transcriptional reprogramming, and polarization toward a pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype, as confirmed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and transcriptomics. These findings reveal intracellular thermal gradients as active regulators of immune signaling and gene expression. By establishing a direct subcellular thermal trigger for immune activation, independent of the canonical heat&#8208;shock pathway.

     alt="Single-Cell Hyperthermia: Diamond Quantum Thermometry Reveals Thermal Control of Macrophage Polarization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal nanodiamonds with quantum sensing capabilities generate lysosome-confined hyperthermia, enabling simultaneous temperature and radical detection via diamond sensing. This localized thermal and oxidative stress drives pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage polarization, revealing a new strategy for precision immunomodulation through subcellular control of heat and redox signaling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fever elevates body temperature to enhance immune response; however, intracellular temperature can fluctuate by up to 15&#160;&#176;C, suggesting a previously unrecognized layer of thermal regulation. While hyperthermia has long been exploited in medicine, how localized temperature gradients influence cellular fate remains poorly understood. Here, a dual-function nanodiamond platform is introduced that integrates optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) thermometry with croconium-dye-based photothermal heating to precisely modulate temperature within endo-lysosomal compartments of macrophages. Controlled intracellular hyperthermia triggers oxidative stress, transcriptional reprogramming, and polarization toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, as confirmed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and transcriptomics. These findings reveal intracellular thermal gradients as active regulators of immune signaling and gene expression. By establishing a direct subcellular thermal trigger for immune activation, independent of the canonical heat-shock pathway. This work introduces a quantum-enabled strategy for probing and programming cellular thermodynamics at the nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase Engineering of Nanogold: Non&#8208;Close Packed Square Planes in A&#8242;B&#8242; Stacking with a 0.5 &#197; Channel</title>

Gold is well known to adopt the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) structure. This work presents an unusual non&#8208;close&#8208;packed phase attained in a 40&#8208;atom gold nanocluster, which is in contrast with the close&#8208;packed fcc quasi&#8208;isomer. The non&#8208;compact structure exhibits exclusive square planes in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, hence, possessing a unique 0.5 &#197; channel. Its photoexcited state lifetime is nearly two orders of magnitude shorter than that of the fcc isomer.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering of inorganic materials is one of the most important strategies for achieving new material properties and functionality. Gold is well known to adopt the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) structure, and it remains challenging to create new phases, but recent research on nanogold has provided exciting opportunities by achieving 2H (note: H denotes hexagonal), 4H, and body&#8208;centered&#8208;tetragonal (bct) phases. In the current work, an unusual non&#8208;compact phase in 40&#8208;atom gold nanoclusters is reported, which is in contrast to the close&#8208;packed isomer of fcc structure. The non&#8208;compact isomer exhibits exclusive square planes in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, hence giving rise to a unique 0.5 &#197; channel, whereas the fcc isomer is composed of close&#8208;packed planes with a closed structure (i.e., no 1D channel). The two Au40 isomers lead to a nearly two orders of magnitude difference in electronic excited&#8208;state lifetime. The attainment of the new non&#8208;compact phase in nanogold presents potential opportunities in terahertz emission owing to the strong electron&#8208;vibration coupling, ion channeling and ion selection, artificial photosynthesis, and biocatalysis.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Molecular Regulation of Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncontrolled nucleation and growth in perovskite films often result in defective morphologies, degrading device efficiency and stability. Diphenyl carbonate (DPC) acts as a dual&#8208;functional crystallization regulator, employing synergistic covalent (carbonyl&#8208;Pb2+) and non&#8208;covalent (aromatic &#960;&#8208;Pb2+) interactions to control film formation. Consequently, DPC&#8208;modified PSCs achieve a PCE of 26.61% (certified: 26.21%). Mini&#8208;modules (active area: 14.0 cm2) incorporating DPC also reach 21.24% PCE.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most promising photovoltaic technologies, yet their performance is critically constrained by uncontrolled crystallization, which generates suboptimal film morphologies and abundant defects. In this study, diphenyl carbonate (DPC) is introduced as a dual&#8208;functional molecular regulator that simultaneously governs nucleation and growth in FAPbI3 films. Through synergistic covalent carbonyl&#8208;Pb2+ coordination and non&#8208;covalent aromatic &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions, DPC promotes controlled PbI2 pre&#8208;aggregation to lower the nucleation barrier, while its strong precursor binding retards subsequent crystal growth. This cooperative regulation yields uniform, large&#8208;grain perovskite films with markedly reduced defect densities. Consequently, DPC&#8208;enabled PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.61% (certified 26.21%), outperforming the control devices (23.65%). Scalable mini&#8208;module (14.0&#160;cm2 active area) with DPC achieves a PCE of 21.24%. Furthermore, DPC&#8208;modified devices exhibit outstanding stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h storage under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;3 accelerated aging conditions and after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point tracking following ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocols. These findings establish a generalizable molecular strategy for overcoming intrinsic crystallization bottlenecks, advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward efficient, stable, and scalable deployment.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Chiral COF&#8211;2D Molecular Crystal Heterojunctions for Neuromorphic Circular Polarization Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction integrating a 3D chiral covalent organic framework with a 2D molecular crystal is presented. This design enables chiral&#8208;selective sensing, efficient exciton dissociation, and neuromorphic processing in a single device. The resulting synaptic transistors demonstrate record chiroptical discrimination (gEPSC = 0.73) and photoresponsivity (7.7 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1), facilitating in&#8208;sensor preprocessing for high&#8208;accuracy neuromorphic vision capable of handling noisy environments.








Abstract
Emulating the biological visual system's ability to perceive and preprocess circularly polarized light (CPL) offers transformative opportunities for advanced imaging, quantum communication, and autonomous navigation. However, the implementation of such functionality in artificial systems demands the seamless integration of chiral selective sensing, efficient exciton dissociation, and neuromorphic processing capabilities, a combination that remains beyond the reach of current optoelectronic materials. Herein, a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction architecture is presented, integrating a 3D chiral covalent organic framework (COF) with a 2D molecular crystal (2DMC), to overcome these limitations. By constructing a type&#8208;II band&#8208;aligned interface between a &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked TpPa&#8208;COF and an air&#8208;stable dithienothiophene&#8208;based 2DMC, the architecture enables directional, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer and efficient exciton dissociation at the interface. The resulting chiroptical synaptic transistor achieves a record polarization discrimination ratio (gEPSC = 0.73) and exceptional photoresponsivity (7.7 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1), substantially surpassing existing organic CPL&#8208;sensitive detectors. Furthermore, when configured into a 3 &#215; 3 convolutional kernel array, the device enables in&#8208;sensor noise reduction and feature extraction, elevating the classification accuracy of noisy images from 51.5% to 71.2% in the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset.

         <title>Green Porphyrin Interface Anchoring Enables &gt;24% Efficiency in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Minimodules</title>

This study demonstrates an environmentally benign interfacial engineering strategy based on dual&#8208;sided chemical coordination, providing a promising pathway toward scalable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Scaling of n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite photovoltaics to large&#8208;area modules is impeded by intensified nonradiative recombination at the buried interface of perovskite and electron transport layer, resulting in severe carrier transport losses. Therefore, effective and environmentally benign interfacial modifiers are urgently required. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable tetrasulfonated porphyrin interlayer with a strong dipole moment and multiple coordination sites is designed, which can be vertically anchored at the SnO2/perovskite interface via a simple water&#8208;based post&#8208;treatment. Two sulfonic acid groups form robust bonds with Sn atoms in SnO2, while the remaining two coordinate with Pb in the perovskite lattice, passivating interfacial defects. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing character of sulfonic acid groups imparts the porphyrin with a pronounced intrinsic dipole moment (10.12 D), which significantly promotes rapid and efficient electron extraction and transport from perovskite to SnO2. Consequently, the treated perovskite modules deliver a power conversion efficiency of 24.49% (certified 23.95%), ranking among the highest reported, while small&#8208;area devices reach 26.66%. Notably, after more than 1500&#160;h of maximum power point tracking, the treated device preserves 90% of its initial efficiency. This study demonstrates an environmentally benign interfacial engineering strategy based on dual&#8208;sided chemical coordination, providing a promising pathway toward scalable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates an environmentally benign interfacial engineering strategy based on dual-sided chemical coordination, providing a promising pathway toward scalable fabrication of high-efficiency perovskite optoelectronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling of n-i-p perovskite photovoltaics to large-area modules is impeded by intensified nonradiative recombination at the buried interface of perovskite and electron transport layer, resulting in severe carrier transport losses. Therefore, effective and environmentally benign interfacial modifiers are urgently required. Herein, a solution-processable tetrasulfonated porphyrin interlayer with a strong dipole moment and multiple coordination sites is designed, which can be vertically anchored at the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/perovskite interface via a simple water-based post-treatment. Two sulfonic acid groups form robust bonds with Sn atoms in SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while the remaining two coordinate with Pb in the perovskite lattice, passivating interfacial defects. Strong electron-withdrawing character of sulfonic acid groups imparts the porphyrin with a pronounced intrinsic dipole moment (10.12 D), which significantly promotes rapid and efficient electron extraction and transport from perovskite to SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Consequently, the treated perovskite modules deliver a power conversion efficiency of 24.49% (certified 23.95%), ranking among the highest reported, while small-area devices reach 26.66%. Notably, after more than 1500&#160;h of maximum power point tracking, the treated device preserves 90% of its initial efficiency. This study demonstrates an environmentally benign interfacial engineering strategy based on dual-sided chemical coordination, providing a promising pathway toward scalable fabrication of high-efficiency perovskite optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Radiotherapy&#8208;Responsive Peptide Hydrogel for Pulsatile Release of mRNA&#8208;LNPs Synergizes with Immune Activation to Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiotherapy&#8208;responsive peptide hydrogel encapsulating mRNA&#8208;lipid nanoparticles (NBSGel@mLNP) is presented, serving as a single&#8208;injection vaccine platform that spatiotemporally synchronizes radiation&#8208;induced dendritic&#8208;cell recruitment with pulsatile antigen release, thereby amplifying antigen presentation and T&#8208;cell priming to generate durable antigen&#8208;specific immunity and prevent tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) is a widely used treatment after tumor resection to prevent tumor recurrence. A major limitation of ART is the insufficient capacity to elicit durable antitumor immunity, typically due to inadequate tumor&#8208;associated antigen supply. Although mRNA vaccines provide a promising strategy to supplement neoantigens, current delivery systems require multiple injections and lack spatiotemporal synchronization with radiotherapy. Here, a radiotherapy&#8208;responsive peptide hydrogel (NBSGel) is first presented that enables radiation&#8208;synchronized pulsatile release of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles (mLNPs). NBSGel is formed by co&#8208;assembling two sulfide&#8208;modified peptides (NapS and BenS) with distinct oxidation sensitivities, yielding stepwise hydrogel disassembly under fractionated radiation. NBSGel@mLNP enables pulsatile mLNP release from a single dose, mimicking multi&#8208;injection vaccination while synchronizing antigen availability with DC recruitment. In tumor postoperative models, NBSGel@mLNP combined with ART markedly amplifies antigen&#8208;specific CD8&#8314; T&#8208;cell responses, reduces tumor relapse by 80%, and prolongs survival, outperforming intramuscular vaccination and non&#8208;pulsatile controls. Tumor rechallenge experiment shows no tumor regrowth in the long&#8208;term surviving mice, confirming a durable anti&#8208;tumor immune memory. This work establishes a materials&#8208;guided paradigm that achieves spatiotemporal synergy between radiotherapy and mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy through pulsatile antigen delivery, providing a clinically viable strategy for preventing postoperative cancer recurrence.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Electro&#8208;Optic Modulator Based on Chemical&#8208;Vapor&#8208;Deposited Graphene with van der Waals Hybrid Dielectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile integration of a Sb2O3/Al2O3 hybrid dielectric on the chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposited (CVD) graphene for the graphene electro&#8208;optic modulators is demonstrated. Benefitting from the preservation of graphene's electronic properties by van der Waals (vdW) Sb2O3/graphene interface, the graphene electro&#8208;absorption modulator shows a 160% higher modulation efficiency (0.0054 dB V&#8722;1 &#181;m&#8722;1) and 580% higher bandwidth (&#8776;35 GHz). 








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based optoelectronic devices have shown high bandwidth and easy incorporation in silicon photonics. However, given that graphene is a single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick material with a large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, the intriguing properties of the graphene optoelectronic devices are very susceptible to surrounding environments, including interfacial states and dangling bonds from dielectrics. This has degenerated the performance of graphene electro&#8208;optic modulators that rely on uniform electrical gating. Herein, a facile integration of a Sb2O3/Al2O3 hybrid dielectric on the chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposited (CVD) graphene is reported for electro&#8208;absorption modulators. The Sb2O3 molecular crystal as interfacial layer enables a homogeneous Al2O3 dielectric growth and a van der Waals (vdW) interface with graphene, which can significantly reduce the interfacial scattering centers (such as dangling bonds) and thus preserves the electronic properties of graphene, showing an averaged carrier mobility (&#956;) of 10880 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and residual carrier concentration (n*) of 1.35 &#215; 1011 cm&#8722;2. In contrast to the device with a single dielectric, the electro&#8208;absorption modulator with the vdW interface shows a 1.6 times higher modulation efficiency (0.0054 dB V&#8722;1 &#181;m&#8722;1) and 5.8 times higher bandwidth (&#8776;35 GHz). Moreover, modulation rate is up to 30 Gbit s&#8722;1. Our work provides a promising dielectric option for graphene optoelectronic devices.

         <dc:description>
The developed chirality&#8208;sensitive photoelectric conversion strategy enables the construction of multifunctional circularly&#8208;polarized optoelectronic logic gates, supporting 9 distinct logic operations with large dissymmetry factors. These devices demonstrate applications in image processing, max&#8208;pooling simulation, and chiroptical signal processing, offering a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation optical computing.








Abstract
Optoelectronic logic gates, key components in optical computing and optoelectronic integration, are promising for advancing computing performance in the post&#8208;Moore era. Nonetheless, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates still depend largely on complex regulation, showing restricted functionality and intricate configuration. Circularly polarized light offers a promising route toward highly integrated multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates with its high&#8208;dimensional optics. However, existing circularly&#8208;polarized logic gates are hampered by insufficient discrimination ability and difficulty in adjusting functionality, hindering their applications. Here, a chirality&#8208;sensitive photoelectric conversion strategy is demonstrated, and based on which a series of circularly&#8208;polarized optoelectronic logic gates are constructed&#8212;encompassing the majority of logic operations. These devices exhibit an photocurrent dissymmetry factor of 1.86, underpinning their application in efficient image processing tasks, including stylization and edge extraction. Furthermore, their utility is extended to simulating max&#8208;pooling and realizing chiroptical signal processing with high recognition accuracy. This work effectively integrates chiroptics and electronics, paving the way for expanding the horizons of optical computing.

         <title>Lock&#8208;and&#8208;Shield Strategy Enables Stable and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Tumor&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield system integrates a nanogel &#8220;lock&#8221; for stable nucleic acid encapsulation with a hybrid membrane &#8220;shield&#8221; that confers homotypic targeting and fusion&#8208;mediated entry. This dual design protects nucleic acids in circulation, enables tumor&#8208;specific release, and achieves efficient gene silencing with strong antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
A major challenge to effective cancer gene therapy is the absence of delivery systems that both protect nucleic acids in circulation and release them efficiently inside tumor cells. Nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by nucleases, cleared from the blood, and poorly internalized due to size and charge. Existing vectors address parts of this problem but remain limited by cytotoxicity, instability, or inadequate tumor selectivity. Here, a lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield strategy integrating a hyaluronic acid Nanogel with a hybrid membrane shell&#160;(Nanogel@hMVs) is reported. The Nanogel &#8220;lock&#8221; physically entraps nucleic acids with high efficiency (81.6%&#8211;89.2%) and incorporates dual pH/redox&#8208;responsive linkers for controlled release under tumor&#8208;associated conditions. The membrane &#8220;shield&#8221;, derived from tumor cell membranes and fusogenic lipids, reinforces systemic stability, preserves homotypic recognition, and mediates fusion&#8208;driven cytosolic entry, ensuring tumor&#8208;selective and efficient intracellular delivery. Nanogel@hMVs remain stable for 30 days, promote efficient uptake with minimal lysosomal sequestration, and silence Survivin. Across DNAzyme, siRNA, and ASO, they consistently produce potent gene silencing and in vitro antitumor activity. In vivo systemic administration yields preferential tumor accumulation, marked tumor inhibition, and prolonged survival without detectable toxicity. Collectively, Nanogel@hMVs establish a robust, safe, and adaptable lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield platform for systemic nucleic acid delivery in cancer therapy.

     alt="Lock-and-Shield Strategy Enables Stable and Stimuli-Responsive Tumor-Targeted Gene Delivery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lock-and-shield system integrates a nanogel &#8220;lock&#8221; for stable nucleic acid encapsulation with a hybrid membrane &#8220;shield&#8221; that confers homotypic targeting and fusion-mediated entry. This dual design protects nucleic acids in circulation, enables tumor-specific release, and achieves efficient gene silencing with strong antitumor efficacy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge to effective cancer gene therapy is the absence of delivery systems that both protect nucleic acids in circulation and release them efficiently inside tumor cells. Nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by nucleases, cleared from the blood, and poorly internalized due to size and charge. Existing vectors address parts of this problem but remain limited by cytotoxicity, instability, or inadequate tumor selectivity. Here, a lock-and-shield strategy integrating a hyaluronic acid Nanogel with a hybrid membrane shell&#160;(Nanogel@hMVs) is reported. The Nanogel &#8220;lock&#8221; physically entraps nucleic acids with high efficiency (81.6%&#8211;89.2%) and incorporates dual pH/redox-responsive linkers for controlled release under tumor-associated conditions. The membrane &#8220;shield&#8221;, derived from tumor cell membranes and fusogenic lipids, reinforces systemic stability, preserves homotypic recognition, and mediates fusion-driven cytosolic entry, ensuring tumor-selective and efficient intracellular delivery. Nanogel@hMVs remain stable for 30 days, promote efficient uptake with minimal lysosomal sequestration, and silence Survivin. Across DNAzyme, siRNA, and ASO, they consistently produce potent gene silencing and in vitro antitumor activity. In vivo systemic administration yields preferential tumor accumulation, marked tumor inhibition, and prolonged survival without detectable toxicity. Collectively, Nanogel@hMVs establish a robust, safe, and adaptable lock-and-shield platform for systemic nucleic acid delivery in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Dynamics Engineering in COF@MOF Enabled by Laser&#8208;Embedded Metallic Clusters for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk embedding of laser&#8208;generated metal clusters in covalent organic framework@metal&#8211;organic framework hybrids simultaneously overcomes the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers in photocatalytic hydrogenation, achieving nearly 100% conversion for selective C&#9552;O reduction and record&#8208;high hydrogen production rates, with general applicability to other metallic clusters and heterostructures.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogenation can convert solar and biomass resources into value&#8208;added chemicals but is hindered by sluggish CO reduction and inadequate photogenerated&#8208;carrier dynamics. Here, bulk embedding of laser&#8208;derived metal clusters into covalent organic framework@metalorganic framework (COF@MOF) hybrids is proposed and validated to overcome these challenges, a process in which the generated active hydrogen species enable near 100% selective hydrogenation of the C&#9472;O bond. In situ laser embedding enables spatial control of clusters within the COF bulk and COF@MOF interfaces, promoting CO over CC reduction. Bulk&#8208;embedded Pt clusters serve as sites on preformed MOF to nucleate COF growth, forming physical and carrier transfer bridges at the heterointerface via optimized band alignment. By virtue of the dual dynamics improvement, present work achieves an unprecedented yield of 100% tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, which is so far the highest value among all furfural hydrogenation catalysts. Further control over the loading of Pt clusters leads to hydrogen production rates up to 125.48 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, solidifying its status as the most active Pt&#8208;based photocatalytic system reported to date. This dual&#8208;dynamics strategy is general and easily adaptable to diverse metallic clusters and heterostructures, offering a versatile route to boost photocatalytic hydrogenation.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Tandem Solar Cells With Conformal Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite on Fully Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables conformal deposition of perovskite via solution&#8208;processing on industrially textured silicon bottom cells. The regulated ratio of cesium in perovskite results in a uniform and fully covered thin film over large&#8208;scale pyramidal textures on silicon bottom cells based on hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon tunneling junctions. This approach enables perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with a certified efficiency of 32.94%.








Abstract
Conformal deposition of perovskite on fully textured silicon bottom cells using low&#8208;cost solution processing remains challenging, limiting the process compatibility and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Herein, this challenge through synergetic engineering of the perovskite composition and tunneling recombination junction (TRJ) is addressed. The utilization of wide bandgap perovskite with high cesium content and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) bottom cell with hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc&#8208;Si:H) TRJ is found to enable conformal perovskite on fully textured SHJ bottom cells using solution processing. A remarkable PCE of 33.38% (certified 32.94%) is achieved for the tandem, featuring a record short&#8208;circuit current density of 21.21&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The tandem displays excellent stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 2324&#160;h of operation at maximum power point (AM 1.5G, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Sustainable Structural Hot&#8208;Melt Adhesives Enabled by Functionalized Crystalline Lamellae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, recyclable hot&#8208;melt adhesive is developed from renewable materials. It features functional crystalline lamellae that enhance shear strength and enable closed&#8208;loop recycling. The adhesive also provides excellent water and oxygen barrier properties, meeting both sustainability and performance demands for advanced bonding and sealing applications.








Abstract
Conventional hot&#8208;melt adhesives (HMAs) suffer from low shear strength and poor recyclability, limiting their structural applications. Here, a sustainable HMA system is developed from renewable building blocks that combines strong adhesion with closed&#8208;loop chemical recyclability. Incorporating polar functional groups into crystalline lamellae enables efficient stress transfer through rigid domains, achieving a balance between cohesive and adhesive forces. The resulting sulfur&#8208;based polymers exhibit shear strengths above 14.7&#160;MPa on wood and 15.1&#160;MPa on stainless steel, along with excellent oxygen and water vapor barrier properties suitable for microelectronic encapsulation. Moreover, these materials can be fully depolymerized from a mixed materials system under mild hydrogenation to regenerate the original monomers. This work establishes a design strategy for structural HMAs that unifies high performance, sustainability, and recyclability.

         <title>Stabilizing SnO2 Colloids via Phosphate Buffering for Efficient and Durable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphate&#8208;buffered strategy stabilizes the chemical environment of SnO2 colloids, suppressing aggregation and maintaining surface equilibrium. The optimized PSCs achieve a 26.4% PCE and retain over 99% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous MPP tracking.








Abstract
SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) solutions are considered a highly efficient&#160;inks for fabricating electron transport layers in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solution&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, SnO2 colloids exhibit thermodynamic instability in aqueous solution due to strong van der Waals attractions between nanoparticles, often leading to aggregation and precipitation. Here, a phosphate&#8208;buffered synthesis strategy is reported that effectively stabilizes SnO2 colloids. The phosphate buffer maintains a stable pH during synthesis, dynamically regulating the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles to suppress aggregation and promote homogeneous dispersion. This method enables precise control over surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies in the resulting SnO2 films, facilitating efficient electron transport and reducing interfacial recombination. As a result, PSCs achieve a high power convertion efficiency (PCE) of 26.40% while demonstrating exceptional operational stability. The encapsulated device maintains 99%, 84%, and 95% of their initial efficiency under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1, ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2, and ISOS&#8208;O&#8208;1 protocols, respectively. Furthermore, a perovskite solar module (5&#160;cm &#215; 5&#160;cm) with an active area of 12.6&#160;cm2 delivers an impressive PCE of 23.11%. These results highlight the scalability and practical viability of the strategy for developing large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance photovoltaic modules.

         <title>A Soft Actuator with Simultaneous Ultra&#8208;High Actuation Strain and Power Density Under Human&#8208;Safe Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft actuator responsive to mild, human&#8208;safe stimuli (body temperature) is developed, exhibiting a large actuation strain (88%) and high power density (1960&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1). This performance arises from a liquid crystalline network engineered with an ultra&#8208;high preset strain (2000%) and an orientation gradient, enabling simultaneous enhancement of actuation stress and strain.








Abstract
Diverse soft robotic applications, such as wearable devices, haptic interfaces, artificial muscles, and biomedical systems, require soft actuators to simultaneously deliver large actuation strain (&gt;40%) and high power density (&gt;323&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1) in response to mild, human&#8208;safe stimuli. However, no existing soft actuator system has successfully met these combined requirements. To address this critical gap, body&#8208;temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) films are designed with a thickness direction orientation gradient achieved through macromolecular engineering of lightly crosslinked gels during the initial stage of network formation. Using ultrahigh stretch ratios to 2000% and with controlled entropic recovery, the degree of molecular orientation through the film thickness can be established. As a result, the fully crosslinked monodomain LC soft actuator simultaneously provides a high actuation strain of 88% and a high power density of 1960&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 under body&#8208;temperature stimulation, a level of performance unmatched by existing actuators sensitive to mild stimuli. Device&#8208;level demonstrations, including a rotary soft robot and an intelligent safety switch, highlight the actuator's versatility and potential for real&#8208;world integration in next&#8208;generation soft robotic systems.

         <title>Disrupting Complement&#8208;Inflammation Positive Feedback Circuit via Oligonucleotide Hydrogel Microspheres for Reversing Joint Inflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following intra&#8208;articular injection, MMP&#8208;9&#8208;responsive hydrogel microspheres release C5 antisense oligonucleotide liposomes, selectively inhibiting complement activation in inflammatory synovial cells, reducing C5a&#8208;driven inflammatory cell activation, and inhibiting immune complexes&#8211;mediated complement reactivation. This multilayer regulation can remodel the RA joint immune microenvironment and significantly delay disease progression by suppressing the complement&#8211;inflammation circuit.








Abstract
The positive feedback circuit between the complement system and inflammatory immune responses maps the malignant progression of chronic joint inflammation. Prolonged dysregulation of the immune microenvironment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) further exacerbates sustained complement activation, thereby establishing a vicious cycle. In this study, MMP&#8208;9&#8208;responsive, injectable micro&#8208;nano geneplexes (C5ASO@HAP&#8208;CL&#8208;TIMP@HMs) are developed for on&#8208;demand regulation of complement component C5, aiming to disrupt this pathological circuit. C5 antisense oligonucleotides (C5ASO) are loaded into cationic liposomes, which are subsequently encapsulated within hyaluronic acid microspheres via click chemistry. In vitro, these geneplexes effectively block abnormal C5 activation in RA synoviocytes, restore macrophage polarization balance, reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels and immune complex precursor molecules, and upregulate anti&#8208;inflammatory mediators. In an adjuvant&#8208;induced arthritis rat model, they significantly alleviate joint swelling and cartilage degradation and suppress inflammatory responses, further highlighting the therapeutic potential of geneplexes in dismantling the complement&#8208;inflammation circuit. In summary, the development of micro&#8208;nano geneplexes capable of precisely disrupting the complement&#8208;inflammatory circuit in RA offers a promising new perspective for the targeted treatment of chronic joint inflammation.

         <title>Synergistic Defect Engineering in Ca&#8208;Based Pellets for Durable and High&#8208;Absorptance Solar Thermochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;scale defect engineering is used to create robust CaCO3$\rm {CaCO_3}$&#8208;based thermochemical pellets that resist high&#8208;temperature sintering while strongly absorbing sunlight. Nanoscale precipitates and lattice strain stabilize the reactive matrix, and Mn&#8208;induced bandgap tuning raises absorptance from 2.9% to 78.5%. The pellets deliver an average of 848.3 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ\ m^{-3}}$ over 217 cycles, enabling compact, durable solar heat storage.








Abstract
Solar thermochemical energy storage (TCES) holds immense promise for a carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, its large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;cost implementation is severely hampered by the poor solar absorptance, rapid performance degradation, and low volumetric energy density of conventional calcium carbonate/oxide materials. Herein, a multi&#8208;scale synergistic defect engineering strategy is proposed to resolve this conflict fundamentally. Guided by predictive ray&#8208;tracing models and density functional theory calculations that pinpoint dopant d&#8208;electron effects as the key modulator of optical properties, Mn/Mg co&#8208;doped pellets are rationally designed. These engineered pellets demonstrate a suite of outstanding properties: a dramatic leap in solar absorptance from a mere 3.4% to 78.5%, a 1.54&#8208;fold enhanced thermal conductivity, and exceptional cycling durability. Over 123 cycles, the pellets achieve a remarkable average volumetric energy density of 877.9 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ\ m^{-3}}$ (2.1 times that of the pristine powder), maintaining a high average of 848.3 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ}\ {\rm m}^{-3}$ over 217 cycles. This unprecedented performance comes from a unique multi&#8208;scale defect synergy, where 0D point defects induce beneficial lattice strain, while in situ formed 3D nano&#8208;precipitates strategically pin 2D grain boundaries to suppress high&#8208;temperature sintering effectively. This work not only delivers a record&#8208;performing TCES material but also establishes a promising, theory&#8208;guided strategy for the intelligent design of next&#8208;generation energy storage&#160;materials.

         <title>Emergent Global&#8208;Pinning Exchange Bias in van der Waals Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an emergent global&#8208;pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of diverse 2D vdW magnets, achieving long&#8208;range magnetic pinning up to 100&#160;&#181;m via simply partial stacking. By tuning interlayer coupling and coverage ratio, it offers a scalable approach for energy&#8208;efficient spintronic memory devices based on 2D vdW materials.








Abstract
As magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technology becomes increasingly vital for emerging applications, such as artificial intelligence, the development of cost&#8208;effective and miniaturized solutions is essential. van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which can be vertically stacked with various functional blocks, offer promising potential to enhance the performance and scalability of memory devices. Nevertheless, the need for perfect alignment between adjacent layers and finite local interactions at the interfaces often complicates device architectures and leads to high power consumption. Addressing these challenges, a new device configuration with partial overlap while maintaining the global effect would be a promising scheme. Here, using Fe3GeTe2/MnBi2Te4 (FGT/MBT) as a paradigm, the global&#8208;pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect is successfully achieved with a horizontal pinning distance approaching 100 &#181;m. Specifically, once stacking a small&#8208;area MBT on FGT, the entire FGT is fully biased due to magnetic couplings inherent to vdW magnets, as confirmed by the theoretical model. Interlayer coupling and coverage ratio provide additional degrees of freedom to manipulate the GPEB. Remarkably, this emergent GPEB effect is prevalent across vdW heterostructures composed of various vdW magnets. This work expands design flexibility and offers strategies for constructing new in&#8208;memory computing devices, opening exciting possibilities for future spintronic applications.

The study presents a microphase&#8208;separated single&#8208;zinc&#8208;ion conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) formed by disentangling polyanionic zinc&#8208;alginate chains using Nafion (ZA/N). The engineered hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains create continuous Zn2+ pathways, yielding high ion selectivity and fast transport. The ZA/N electrolyte enables dendrite&#8208;free cycling and long&#8208;life, deformation&#8208;tolerant flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries, offering a general strategy for high&#8208;performance SIHEs.









Abstract
Flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics and soft robotics, yet their development is hindered by the non&#8208;selective ion transport of conventional hydrogel electrolytes, which induces concentration polarization, uneven Zn2+ flux, and dendrite formation, ultimately causing battery failure. Here, a microphase&#8208;separated single&#8208;zinc&#8208;ion conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) constructed via polymer chain disentanglement within a polyanionic zinc&#8208;alginate (ZA) matrix is reported. Due to the pronounced steric disparity between Zn2+ and the alginate chains, ZA holds intrinsic potential for ion&#8208;selective transport. However, spontaneous chain entanglement within the alginate network under the applied electric field severely impedes the formation of continuous ion transport pathways, limiting Zn2+ conduction. By incorporating Nafion, well&#8208;defined hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains are induced that simultaneously relax the entangled polymer network and establish continuous Zn2+&#8208;conducting pathways. This microstructural engineering enables a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.967 and ionic conductivity of 25.5 mS cm&#8722;1, resolving the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and transport kinetics. The zinc&#8208;alginate/Nafion (ZA/N) electrolyte enables dendrite&#8208;free cycling for over 4600 h. The ZA/N&#8208;based flexible ZIB retains 90% capacity after 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This work presents a general strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance SIHEs for safe and durable flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Dynamic Geminal&#8208;Atom Coordination for Highly Efficient Photo&#8208;Fenton Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu based geminal&#8208;atom catalyst leverages inert carbonate ions in seawater to dynamically reorganize active centers, enhancing photo&#8208;Fenton reactivity. In situ spectroscopy and theory reveal reversible Cu&#8208;CO32&#8722; coordination and accelerated charge transfer, achieving 17&#8208;fold higher &#183;OH yield, efficient pollutant and Chlorella degradation, and proven environmental and economic sustainability.








ABSTRACT
Understanding and leveraging non&#8208;reactive species in natural environments to modulate the active centers of geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) is crucial for enhancing their catalytic performance. Here, we develop a two&#8208;coordinated copper geminal&#8208;atom catalyst and reveal that the ubiquitous yet inert carbonate ions (CO32&#8722;) in seawater dynamically reorganize the coordination environment of active copper sites, thereby enhancing photo&#8208;Fenton reactivity. Control experiments, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical modeling demonstrate that CO32&#8722; induces reversible coordination transformations that modulate the electronic structure and facilitate interfacial charge transfer, resulting in a 17&#8208;fold increase in hydroxyl radical production. This effect enables efficient degradation of diverse marine pollutants, including effective Chlorella decomposition under natural sunlight. Life&#8208;cycle and technoeconomic assessments further demonstrate the environmental benefits and economic feasibility of this approach. Overall, this work establishes a generalizable strategy for active geminal&#8208;atom catalysts via environmentally abundant species, offering mechanistic insights and scalable pathways toward large&#8208;scale and sustainable aquatic pollution remediation.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Designed BCZT&#8211;SBT Heterointerface Unlocks Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning guides the design of BCZT&#8211;SBT ceramics that form an atomically thin epitaxial interlayer between perovskite and tungsten bronze phases. This hetero&#8208;barrier suppresses carrier injection while homogenizing polarization, enabling a fatigue&#8208;free performance over 10&#8313; cycles as well as excellent recoverable energy performance. The work establishes a mechanistic route to reliable lead&#8208;free dielectric capacitors.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are attractive for advanced energy storage owing to their ultrafast charge&#8211;discharge capability, yet their practical use is hindered by severe fatigue under repeated operation at ultrahigh electric fields. Achieving fatigue&#8208;free performance therefore represents a key challenge in dielectric design. Here, guided by machine learning (ML), SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) is introduced into Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) to construct a (1&#8208;x)BCZT&#8208;xSBT solid solution. At x = 0.10, the coexistence of perovskite and tungsten bronze phases gives rise to an epitaxial interfacial layer only a few unit cells thick, formed by lattice mismatch. Atomic&#8208;scale analyses reveal that this hetero&#8208;barrier effectively suppresses carrier migration, while the tungsten bronze phase promotes polarization homogenization, together enhancing both voltage endurance and reliability. As a result, 0.90BCZT&#8208;0.10SBT achieves a recoverable energy density (Wrec) of 9.94 J cm&#8722;3 with 92.1% efficiency, and more strikingly, maintains stable performance after 109 charge&#8211;discharge cycles without degradation, enabled by an elevated Schottky barrier. This work not only uncovers the atomic origin of fatigue resistance in lead&#8208;free dielectrics but also establishes a ML&#8208;guided strategy for designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance, fatigue&#8208;free capacitors for reliable energy storage.

         <title>Quadruple Moir&#233; Pockets in Lateral Heterobilayers: Programmable Phononic Reconfiguration and Anomalous Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable CVD&#8208;grown lateral heterostructures stacked with controllable twist angles form quadruple moir&#233; pockets, enabling programmable tuning of phonon, exciton, and SHG. Material&#8208;selective lattice relaxation modulates strain, interlayer coupling, Davydov splitting, valley polarization, and anomalous SHG enhancement. Such multi&#8208;moir&#233; networks establish a scalable pathway for multifunctional moir&#233; engineering, opening opportunities in opto&#8208;straintronics, nonlinear optoelectronics, and quantum photonics.








Abstract
Moir&#233;&#8208;engineering in 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides offers access to correlated quantum phenomena. However, simultaneous control over twist&#8208;angle (&#952;) and material combinations to tune phonons, excitons, and their collective interactions remains limited. This study presents scalable, quadruple moir&#233;&#8208;pockets formed by vertically stacking chemical vapor deposition&#8208;grown monolayer MoS2&#8211;WS2 and MoSe2&#8211;WSe2 lateral heterostructures with controlled &#952; (0&#8304;&#8211;60&#176;), within a single flatland. Moir&#233; non&#8208;rigidity induces lattice&#8208;relaxation via rotational reconstruction (&#952;&lt;8&#176;) and volumetric dilation (&#952;&gt;8&#176;), resulting in strain&#8208;mediated phonon frequency&#8208;softening and linewidth&#8208;broadening, respectively. Strain localizes selectively in mechanically softer crystal for &#952;&lt;8&#176;, while an epitaxial&#8208;pseudomorphic pattern dominates for &#952;&gt;8&#176;. Degree of phonon&#8208;reconfiguration and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy uncover the role of interfacial orbitals in modulating interlayer coupling. At aligned angles (&#952;&#8211;0&#176; and 60&#176;), specifically, MoS2 exhibits Davydov splitting and reduced valley polarization, reflecting symmetry breaking and chiral phonon effects. At &#952;&#8211;3&#176;, WS2/WSe2 shows up to 480% enhancement in second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), while WS2/MoSe2 records the lowest due to variations in interlayer&#8208;coherence and band&#8208;offset&#8208;driven phase delay. Notably, at &#952;&#8211;60&#176;, only WS2/MoSe2 exhibits an anomalous 300% SHG enhancement, attributed to large phase delay and reconstruction&#8208;induced strain. Electronic bandstructure calculations support these observations. These findings offer programmable multi&#8208;moir&#233; platforms for opto&#8208;straintronics, sensing, and on&#8208;chip quantum photonics applications.

         <title>Metallophilic Non&#8208;van der Waals Roll&#8208;ups Engineered for Long&#8208;Life Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique metallophilic non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups of transition metal carbides are developed by metal&#8208;bonding MXene roll&#8208;ups via a pulsed Joule&#8208;heating technology. These non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups exhibit high thermal stability and unexpected metallophilic property to molten metals, facilitating the formation of thin metal foils with high mechanical tensile strengths. Moreover, the full cells with these metal hybrid electrodes exhibit a long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Metal hybrid electrodes are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to their high theoretical capacities. However, their practical employment is hampered by the inherent incompatibility between molten metals and composite materials resulting from the high surface tensions. Herein, unique metallophilic non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) roll&#8208;ups of transition metal carbides are produced via metal&#8208;bonding adjacent atomic layers in scrolled MXenes, featuring a nano&#8208;sized hollow structure and abundant surface dangling bonds as well as remarkable thermal stability up to 800&#160;&#176;C. These features enable the formation of chemical bonding and strong capillary forces between the non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups and molten metals such as Li, Ga, Mg, and their alloys, leading to the unexpected metallophilic property. As a result, the surface tensions of metal&#8208;based composites are significantly reduced, facilitating the fabrication of thin metal hybrid foils with high mechanical tensile strengths. For instance, a Mg foil incorporated with non&#8208;vdW Al&#8208;V2CTx roll&#8208;ups exhibits a high tensile strength up to 204&#160;MPa, &#8776;2 times that of bare Mg. When employed as an anode in magnesium batteries, the full cell coupled with the Mo6S8 cathode delivers long&#8208;term cycling stability with &#8776;90.0% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C, attributed to the low diffusion resistance of the hybrid electrode.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Vat Photopolymerization of Ceramics and Metals with Low Shrinkages via Repeated Infusion Precipitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an in situ precipitation strategy for the hydrogel&#8208;based vat photopolymerization of architected ceramics and metals with reduced shrinkages and improved densities. Repeated infusion&#8208;precipitation significantly increases metal loading within the hydrogels, which improves part quality after thermal conversion. This strategy offers a versatile platform for&#160;the fabrication of&#160;advanced structural and functional materials and next&#8208;generation 3D&#8208;architected devices.








Abstract
Vat photopolymerization (VP) is a powerful tool for the fabrication of architected ceramic and metal structures. However, conventional methods of ceramic/metal VP, such as with the use of slurries or organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid resins, have challenges with viscosities, light&#8208;scattering, and limited material compositions. Recently, the use of metal&#8208;salt solutions has emerged as a promising approach for the VP of ceramics and metals. While versatile and accessible, the process is accompanied by a significant amount of shrinkage, which causes warping, porosity, and structural damage. Here, a versatile method is presented for fabricating dense architected ceramics and metals with low conversion linear shrinkages. Central to this method is a post&#8208;fabrication repeated infusion&#8208;coprecipitation process that progressively&#160;increases the metal loading in the 3D &#8220;blank&#8221; hydrogels. Thermal treatment of these high metal content hydrogels then converts them into ceramic or metal architectures. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, a variety of 3D ceramic and metal structures with shrinkages as low as 20% while maintaining densities &gt;80% is fabricated. This infusion&#8208;precipitation&#8208;based process thus enables the VP of high&#8208;quality ceramics and metals, which is necessary for the fabrication of advanced architected materials and devices.

         <title>Enzymatically Switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing Polymer Conjugate to Coordinate Host Immune Responses in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis is a potent form of immunogenic cell death that orchestrates innate and adaptive immunity. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is developed that selectively induces gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis in cancer cells via chemiluminescence&#8208;triggered lysosomal disintegration. EPIC enhances dendritic and NK cell activation in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. When combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, EPIC boosts cytotoxic T&#8208;cell infiltration and memory T&#8208;cell formation, achieving durable tumor regression.








Abstract
Gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, an immunogenic cell death predominantly occurring in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, is pivotal in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, this dynamic process holds significant potential as an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy. However, its adequate spatiotemporal control in cancer remains challenging. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is reported that selectively triggers chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) in the lysosome in the presence of Cathepsin B, abundant in cancer cells. When exposed to cancer cells in vitro, EPIC generates reactive oxygen species via self&#8208;immolation&#8208;mediated CRET, triggering lysosomal membrane disintegration, followed by activation of the signaling cascade that cleaves gasdermin&#8208;D. Cleaved gasdermin&#8208;D forms pyroptotic pores in the cancer cell membrane, promoting the efflux of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines. When systemically administered into the tumor&#8208;bearing mice, EPIC provokes a robust immune response by promoting dendritic cell maturation and reinvigorating cytotoxic NK cells. Combination of EPIC with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody enhanced infiltration of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells and promoted memory T cells, resulting in a durable remission of established tumors with complete tumor regression in more than half of the treated mice. Overall, EPIC has potential as a nanoplatform with multifaceted advantages for precise and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Texture in Fe3O4 Thin Films on SiO2 Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe3O4 thin films grown on ordered SiO2 nanospheres form curved nanocaps with 3D geometry, inducing magnetic domain texture. X&#8208;ray spectromicroscopy (XMCD&#8208;PEEM), cross&#8208;sectional electron microscopy (STEM), and polarized grazing&#8208;incidence small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (GISANS) reveal how topography modulates magnetization. This system provides a new platform to explore geometry&#8208;induced magnetic phenomena at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Topographically complex interfaces offer a promising route to engineer magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with potential implications for next&#8208;generation spintronic and neuromorphic devices. Here, Fe3O4 thin films are grown on self&#8208;assembled SiO2 nanospheres to investigate how local curvature, together with polycrystalline morphology, influence magnetic behavior compared to flat films. STEM and GISANS confirm connected growth with preserved lateral ordering, while XMCD&#8208;PEEM reveals in&#8208;plane magnetic domains that extend across both nanosphere&#8208;patterned and flat regions. Despite the low net magnetization of the Fe3O4 caps, their domain orientations align with neighboring flat areas, indicating correlated domain behavior across structurally different regions. These findings demonstrate how nanoscale topography and morphology can be leveraged as design parameters to modulate magnetism in complex&#160;oxides.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Air&#8208;Stable Polymer Monolayer Transistors for Monolithic 3D CMOS logics</title>

         <dc:description>
A fibrillar polymer monolayer with a self&#8208;confinement effect is demonstrated, in which aligned chains parallel the nanofiber axis. Employing a top&#8208;gate CYTOP dielectric, this monolayer transistor achieves high mobility (7.12 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and exceptional stability over 1260 days in air. Furthermore, monolithic 3D integration with n&#8208;type oxide transistors is achieved, enabling hybrid complementary inverters with reasonable voltage amplification capability.








Abstract
The monolayer transistor, where the semiconductor layer is a single molecular layer,&#160;offers an ideal platform for exploring transport mechanisms both theoretically and experimentally by eliminating the influence of spatially correlated microstructure.&#160;However, the structure&#8208;property relations in polymer monolayers remain poorly understood, leading to low transistor performance to date. Herein, a&#160;self&#8208;confinement effect is demonstrated in the polymer monolayer with nanofibrillar microstructures and&#160;edge&#8208;on orientation, as characterized by the 4D scanning confocal electron diffraction&#160;method. The polymer chains align parallel to the nanofiber long axis, while the &#960;&#8208;stacking direction aligns perpendicular to this axis. To reduce the trap density at the&#160;semiconductor/dielectric interface, a top&#8208;gate configuration is employed with CYTOP as gate dielectric, and the resulting monolayer transistors achieve a field&#8208;effect mobility&#160;of 7.12 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, an on/off ratio of 10&#8312;, and a subthreshold swing of 0.21&#160;V&#160;dec&#8722;1, among the performance records for polymer monolayer transistors. Notably, the top&#8208;gate&#160;architecture allows self&#8208;encapsulation, and the monolayer network induces the morphologic lock effect, contributing to a remarkable device stability over 1260 days. Additionally, the low thermal budget of this polymer monolayer transistor enables the monolithic 3D integration with n&#8208;type oxide transistor, resulting in hybrid&#160;complementary inverters with reasonable voltage amplification capabilities.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition of 2D Semiconducting Bi2O2S for High&#8208;Performance Field&#8208;Effect Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the successful low&#8208;temperature growth of high&#8208;quality Bi2O2S nanoplates via MOCVD, achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV and high field&#8208;effect mobility of 227&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Bi2O2S&#8208;based FETs exhibit outstanding on/off ratios, while photodetectors show high responsivity and fast response times, establishing Bi2O2S as a promising candidate for low&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Bi2O2S has emerged as a promising 2D semiconductor for high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) applications, effectively addressing limitations observed in conventional 2D materials, including environmental instability, challenges with achieving optimal bandgaps, and insufficient static power efficiency. However, practical application of Bi2O2S has been hindered by synthesis challenges; previous methods often relied on high&#8208;temperature processes (&gt;700&#160;&#176;C) for precursor sublimation resulting in the formation of undesired phases or solution&#8208;based approaches that compromise material quality. In this work, the growth of single&#8208;crystalline Bi2O2S nanoplates at a low temperature of &#8776;400&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV compatible with Si&#8208;based devices. Fabricated Bi2O2S&#8208;based FETs through this process exhibit excellent electrical performance, with a maximum on/off ratio of 3.6 &#215; 10&#8313; and a field&#8208;effect mobility of 227&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, benefiting from the low effective mass (0.15&#160;m0) inherent to Bi2O2S. Furthermore, Bi2O2S photodetectors display remarkable optoelectronic characteristics, including a high responsivity of 11,577&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, rapid response time in the millisecond range, and a specific detectivity of 1014 Jones. These results confirm Bi2O2S's potential as a versatile semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, offering both BEOL&#8208;compatible low&#8208;temperature synthesis and high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power device capabilities.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Packed T&#8208;Cell&#8208;Fusogenic Liposome Empowers Adoptive T Cell Therapy for Solid Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL) platform is developed to engineer T cells to overcome solid tumor challenges. Using membrane fusion, it simultaneously confers three abilities in one step: enhanced tumor infiltration, immune tolerance evasion, and tumor microenvironment modulation. This approach offers a promising T cell engineering strategy, potentially broadening adoptive T cell therapy's scope against solid tumors.









Abstract
Adoptive T cell therapy has achieved remarkable success in certain blood cancers, but&#160;its efficacy against solid tumors remains limited by multiple immunological challenges including inadequate tumor infiltration, tumor cell's immune tolerance, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a one&#8208;step cell engineering strategy is reported to enhance T cell therapy for solid tumors using an immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL). Through membrane fusion, IMPACTFUL simultaneously decorates therapeutic T cells with DPPA peptides on their surface and delivers interleukin&#8208;12 mRNA&#8208;loaded magnetic nanoparticle cores (MNP/IL&#8208;12) into the cytoplasm. MNP/IL&#8208;12 internalization grants T cells with effective tumor targeting under external magnet and TME reversion through IL&#8208;12 expression. DPPA peptide presentation enables T cells to overcome tumor cells&#8217; immune tolerance through PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade. In a murine solid tumor model, IMPACTFUL&#8208;engineered T cells infiltrate tumors more effectively, resist exhaustion, and induce a more pro&#8208;inflammatory TME, leading to significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to unmodified T cells. Together, IMPACTFUL can empower adoptive T cell therapy by endowing T cells with multiple complementary functions in a single step. This approach offers a versatile platform to improve the therapeutic outcomes of T cell therapies against solid tumors and can accelerate their translation to clinical settings.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Conductivity Enhancement of Robust All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Ion Elastomers via Strain&#8208;Induced Ion Channel Alignment and Temperature&#8208;Activated Ion&#8208;Gated Release</title>

Enhancing the electrical conductivity of ionic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state conductors under stretch and temperature&#8208;altering conditions remains challenging. This work simultaneously achieves strain&#8208;induced and temperature&#8208;gated conductivity enhancement by modulating the microphase structure and interfacial interactions through in situ polymerization of polyacrylamide and the introduction of lithium salts in SEBS. With their remarkable conductivity and mechanical properties, flexible strain sensors in a wide temperature and stretching range are realized.








Abstract
Despite their potential in ionic electronics, conventional ionic conductors face critical limitations, including modest strain&#8208;modulated conductivity and restricted self&#8208;regulation under temperature variations. Here, a mechanically robust all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ionic elastomer is presented, engineered through molecular design and microphase separation. By in situ integrating polyacrylamide (PAM) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) into maleic anhydride&#8208;grafted styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;butylene&#8208;styrene (SEBS&#8208;MAH), a hierarchical structure with dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, lithium bonds, and cation&#8208;&#960; effects) is achieved. This design yields exceptional mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 46.4 MPa, strain of 1066%, and toughness of 207.8 MJ m&#8722;3, alongside outstanding recyclability and puncture resistance. Remarkably, strain&#8208;induced alignment of microphase&#8208;separated domains reduces ion transport tortuosity, enabling a 1300 times conductivity enhancement at 1066% strain. Concurrently, temperature&#8208;gated ion release from confined regions triggers a 1600 times conductivity increase at 120&#160;&#176;C. The elastomer maintains high conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1) across an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (&#8722;45&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C), overcoming the limitations of conventional hydrogels and ionogels. This work pioneers a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive strategy for advanced ionic conductors, offering transformative potential in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and adaptive sensors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their potential in ionic electronics, conventional ionic conductors face critical limitations, including modest strain-modulated conductivity and restricted self-regulation under temperature variations. Here, a mechanically robust all-solid-state ionic elastomer is presented, engineered through molecular design and microphase separation. By in situ integrating polyacrylamide (PAM) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) into maleic anhydride-grafted styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS-MAH), a hierarchical structure with dynamic non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, lithium bonds, and cation-&#960; effects) is achieved. This design yields exceptional mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 46.4 MPa, strain of 1066%, and toughness of 207.8 MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, alongside outstanding recyclability and puncture resistance. Remarkably, strain-induced alignment of microphase-separated domains reduces ion transport tortuosity, enabling a 1300 times conductivity enhancement at 1066% strain. Concurrently, temperature-gated ion release from confined regions triggers a 1600 times conductivity increase at 120&#160;&#176;C. The elastomer maintains high conductivity (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) across an ultra-wide temperature range (&#8722;45&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C), overcoming the limitations of conventional hydrogels and ionogels. This work pioneers a dual-stimuli-responsive strategy for advanced ionic conductors, offering transformative potential in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and adaptive sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Successive Orthorhombic Distortions in Kagome Metals by Molecular Orbital Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthorhombic distortions in kagome metals break the symmetry required for exotic charge order. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction of NdRu3Si2 reveals successive orthorhombic transitions driven by molecular orbital formation between kagome layers. The frustrated kagome lattice hosts degenerate patterns of kagome dimers whose short&#8208;range correlations produce diffuse scattering. A chemistry&#8208;based framework provides design principles for realizing structurally pristine kagome metals.








Abstract
The kagome lattice, with its inherent frustration, hosts a plethora of exotic phenomena, including the emergence of 3q charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave order. The high rotational symmetry required to realize such an unconventional charge order is broken in many kagome materials by orthorhombic distortions at high temperature, the origin of which remains much less examined&#160;despite their ubiquity. In this study, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a structural phase transition from a parent hexagonal structure to an orthorhombic ground state, mediated by a critical regime with diffuse scattering in the prototypical kagome metals RRu3Si2 (R = Nd, Pr). Structural analysis uncovers partially ordered bonds between kagome layers in the orthorhombic phases. Accordingly, a short&#8208;range correlated dimer model on the kagome layers reproduces the diffuse scattering, with the short&#8208;range order arising from competing structures induced by the geometrical frustration of the kagome lattice. The observations point to molecular orbital formation between Ru 4dz2$4d_{z^2}$ orbitals as the driving force behind the transition, consistent with ab initio calculations. A framework based on electronegativity and a tolerance factor is proposed to evaluate the stability of the hexagonal phase in various kagome metals, guiding the design of highly symmetric&#160;materials.

         <title>Direct Construction of a LiF&#8208;Rich Interphase for Sustainable Regeneration of Spent Graphite Electrodes via In Situ Decarbonization&#8208;Fluorination Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the failure mechanisms of graphite electrodes and develops a straightforward decarbonization&#8208;fluorination approach, achieving facile recycling and regeneration of graphite electrodes. This work paves the way for more sustainable direct&#8208;recycling technologies for graphite electrodes.








Abstract
Recycling graphite anodes is critical due to the high economic and environmental costs of producing battery&#8208;grade graphite. However, traditional recycling primarily regenerates graphite powder through complex steps like separation and purification. In spent graphite anode materials, the primary cause of electrochemical failure is the surface formation of a thick, poorly conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Herein, a decarbonization&#8208;fluorination strategy is developed to directly regenerate spent graphite electrodes. The process can convert the poorly conductive SEI layer into a highly conductive LiF&#8208;rich layer by reacting Li2CO3 present in the SEI with an NH4F solution. This reconstructed interface boosts ionic conductivity, lowers interfacial resistance, and creates a fast pathway for lithium ions. The regeneration graphite electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 303.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C and a capacity retention of 92.3% after 500 cycles. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)//regenerated graphite pouch cell (550 mAh) shows a 92% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, its areal capacity is 4.9 times higher than that of a spent graphite pouch cell. The techno&#8208;economic analysis indicates cost reductions &#8776;78% compared to conventional approaches. This work lays the foundation for a more sustainable technology for the direct recovery of graphite electrodes.

         <title>Biocompatible Liquid Crystal Elastomer Optical Fiber Actuator for In Vivo Endoscopic Navigation and Laser Ablation Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible liquid crystal elastomer optical fibers achieve a physiological phase transition temperature (37.6&#160;&#176;C) with a waveguide structure, enabling low&#8208;loss light transmission (0.76 dB&#160;cm&#8722;1) and large photothermal actuation (30% contraction) under safe laser power. Integrated endoscopically in vivo, they facilitate controlled navigation, hemorrhage detection, and tumor ablation without thermal damage, offering a mechanically compliant platform for interventions in confined anatomical spaces.








Abstract
Photothermal&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) face critical barriers in biomedical applications: phase transition temperatures exceeding&#160;80&#160;&#176;C risk thermal injury, and free&#8208;space optical actuation fails in confined spaces. Here, a thiol&#8208;ene crosslinked LCE is developed with a biocompatible phase transition temperature (37.6&#160;&#176;C), enabling safe actuation within biological tissues. Through coaxial extrusion, the fabrication of waveguide&#8208;structured LCE optical fibers is pioneered, achieving ultralow optical loss (0.76 dB&#160;cm&#8722;1) and enabling long&#8208;range light transmission and remote actuation via silica optical fiber coupling. Under 808 nm laser stimulation (375 mW), these LCE optical fibers generate 30% contraction strain in 23 s, maintaining maximum surface temperature &lt; 48&#160;&#176;C. Integrated into an endoscopic system, LCE optical fibers replaced rigid mechanical components. Ex vivo characterization reveals their omnidirectional bending capability (94&#176; angular range), while in vivo trials on live rats and rabbits validate their operational functionality in anatomical environments, enabling hemorrhage detection and laser&#8208;steered tumor ablation via controlled navigation. Histopathological analysis confirms no thermal damage at fiber&#8208;tissue interfaces. This work establishes biocompatible LCE optical fibers as a photonic platform integrating photonic&#8208;driven soft actuation and tissue&#8208;compliant adaptability, enabling mechanically safe interventions in confined anatomical environments.

         <title>Highly Efficient Narrow&#8208;Emitting Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with an Intramolecular Sensitization Mechanism by Through&#8208;Space Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>

Highly efficient and narrow&#8208;emitting solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are developed using a novel multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter operated by an intramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitized fluorescence emission mechanism.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable circularly polarized (CP) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are unique devices generating CP electroluminescence. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed CP OLEDs is still low compared with vacuum&#8208;processed CP OLEDs. In this work, highly efficient and narrow&#8208;emitting solution&#8208;processed CP OLEDs are developed using a novel multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter operated by an intramolecular TADF sensitized MR&#8208;TADF emission mechanism. The CP&#8208;type MR&#8208;TADF emitter is designed to have a TADF antenna unit and a terminal MR&#8208;TADF unit connected through a planar chiral unit. The TADF antenna unit plays the role of initial exciton generator, harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons, and the exciton energy is transferred to the terminal MR&#8208;TADF unitby through&#8208;space energy transfer. As a result, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the chiral MR&#8208;TADF emitter is significantly enhanced from 16.2% of the MR&#8208;TADF emitter without the TADF antenna unit to 28.0% by solution process. The CP OLEDs showed an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;3 order, demonstrating that the molecular design is also effective to achieve highly efficient CP emission in OLED. This work establishes an effective strategy for realizing highly efficient narrowband CP electroluminescence via intramolecular TADF&#8208;sensitized MR emission.

The TADF antenna unit plays the role of initial exciton generator, harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons, and the exciton energy is transferred to the terminal MR-TADF unitby through-space energy transfer. As a result, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the chiral MR-TADF emitter is significantly enhanced from 16.2% of the MR-TADF emitter without the TADF antenna unit to 28.0% by solution process. The CP OLEDs showed an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; order, demonstrating that the molecular design is also effective to achieve highly efficient CP emission in OLED. This work establishes an effective strategy for realizing highly efficient narrowband CP electroluminescence via intramolecular TADF-sensitized MR emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Association Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes a universal molecular association chemistry to endow electrolyte solvents with synergistically medium polarity, high LUMO, and low HOMO by dipole&#8208;dipole and weak hydrogen bonding interactions, which facilitates superior high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging performance in Li batteries (68.4% capacity retention at 10C under 4.7&#160;V) via promoting the formation of electrolyte ion aggregate solvation structures.








Abstract
The ideal electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging lithium batteries (VFC&#8208;LBs) should solve two couples of paradoxes: low solvation barriers and high ionic conductivity, high oxidative and reductive stability. A single solvent&#8208;based electrolyte is very challenging to meet this demand because of its strong correlation between energy level and polarity. Here, the study develops a strategy of molecular association chemistry to endow electrolyte solvent with moderate polarity and wide energy level that are key to VFC&#8208;LBs. A descriptor of molecular association energy contributed from non&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed to directionally screen out VFC solvents. In an optimal fluorinated ethylene carbonate&#8208;ethyl acetate electrolyte, the 4.7&#160;V Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811, 2.2&#8201;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) coin cells maintain 68.4% of initial capacity at 10&#8201;C (1&#8201;C&#8201; = &#8201;220&#8201;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). And 400 mAh Li||NCM811 pouch cells (50&#160;&#181;m Li, 4.4&#8201;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 NCM811) exhibit stable cycling at 2.8&#8211;4.7&#160;V over 130 cycles. Molecular association chemistry reinforces VFC capability through inducing aggregate solvation structure and suppressing NiO phase formation. Notably, this molecular association strategy can also be readily extended to silicon@carbon||NCM811 and graphite||LiFePO4 batteries.

         <title>A Bioinspired Force&#8208;Inducible Hydrogel Conduit for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes serious health problems for patients. A bioinspired force&#8208;inducible nerve conduit can self&#8208;generate enhanced capillary forces without external stimuli to promote directed axon growth and delivery of Schwann cells toward the nerve distal ends, paralleling the repairing efficacy of autografts in long&#8208;gap PNI. This innovative approach enhances the potential for clinical implementation in long&#8208;gap PNI therapies.








Abstract
Long&#8208;gap peripheral nerve injury (PNI) presents a significant challenge since the growth cone at the proximal end fails to detect and respond to neurotrophic signals from the distal ends, even when bridging the long&#8208;gap with nerve guide conduits (NGCs), impeding the motivated growth of new axons. In this study, a bioinspired force&#8208;inducible multichannel nerve guide conduit (FI&#8208;MNGC) is developed, constructed from silk fibrin&#8208;based hydrogel. By mimicking the gradient capillary architectures in vascular plants, the FI&#8208;MNGC utilizes a multichannel design with gradient apertures that can self&#8208;generate enhanced capillary forces, which not only promote directed axon growth but also guide the directed delivery of Schwann cells (SCs) toward the distal ends of the injured nerve, without the need for any external stimuli. Implemented in a rat model with a 16&#160;mm and a rabbit model with a 30&#160;mm long&#8208;gap sciatic nerve defect, the FI&#8208;MNGC significantly accelerates the recovery process, paralleling the efficacy of autografts in nerve regeneration, functional recovery, and repair speed. This innovative approach offers a promising alternative to autografts, enhancing the potential for clinical implementation in long&#8208;gap PNI therapies.

         <title>Senescence Reprogramming Unleashes Tumor Immune Surveillance via Coordinated Gene Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target&#8208;enhanced gene delivery nanoparticle (TEPP) is developed to reprogram tumor&#8208;specific senescence by coordinating P16INK4a overexpression with PD&#8208;L1 knockdown. Through the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)&#160;targeting and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter&#8208;driven expression, TEPP selectively induces senescence in tumor cells, enhances senescence&#8208;associated secretory phenotype (SASP)&#8208;mediated immune activation, and alleviates immunosuppression. In combination with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 checkpoint blockade, TEPP elicits robust anti&#8208;tumor immune responses across multiple tumor models.








Abstract
Cellular senescence can recruit immune cells for tumor therapy through the senescence&#8208;associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by immune tolerance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Reprogramming tumor&#8208;specific senescence through coordinated modulation of P16INK4a and PD&#8208;L1 enhances tumor immunogenicity and alleviates immunosuppression. To achieve this, a target&#8208;enhanced gene delivery nanoparticle is engineered using the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) as a senescence&#8208;specific targeting ligand, combined with a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter and a nuclear localization signal&#8208;microtubule&#8208;associated sequence (NLS&#8208;MTAS) peptide. This system efficiently induces tumor&#8208;specific senescence through cell&#8208;cycle arrest and promotes the chemotactic recruitment of cytotoxic immune cells. In vivo, the nanoparticle induces a robust anti&#8208;tumor response without causing systemic toxicity and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 immune checkpoint blockade in subcutaneous, lung metastasis, postoperative recurrence, and spontaneous tumor models. This study emphasizes the therapeutic potential of reprogramming tumor&#8208;specific senescence to improve targeted gene delivery and immunotherapy outcomes, offering a viable approach for the treatment of immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.

         <title>Ultralight and Ablation&#8208;Resistant Shape&#8208;Memory Ceramizable Polymer Aerogel for Self&#8208;Adaptive Thermal Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape&#8208;memory ceramizable polymer aerogel is developed that sequentially activates shape recovery and in situ ceramization under increasing temperatures, thereby combining aerodynamic deceleration with high&#8208;temperature thermal insulation.








Abstract
Deployable thermal protection systems (DTPS) for deep&#8208;space exploration require materials that integrate lightweight design, high deformability, and extreme temperature resistance. However, existing shape memory polymers (SMPs) suffer from limited thermal stability, while shape memory ceramics (SMCs) lack rapid programmability and efficient deployment capability. To overcome these limitations, a shape&#8208;memory ceramizable polymer aerogel (SMCPA) is developed capable of sequential self&#8208;adaptive thermo&#8208;responsive behavior, enabling the integration of structural deployment and thermal protection within a single material system. Upon exposure to high temperatures, SMCPA first undergoes rapid shape recovery to increase the projected area, followed by in situ ceramization at elevated temperatures to form a continuous ablation&#8208;resistant ceramic layer. The resultant SMCPA combines ultralow density (0.12 &#177; 0.02&#160;g cm&#8722;3), outstanding shape&#8208;memory performance (shape fixation ratio of 97.0 &#177; 0.5% and shape recovery ratio of 94.2 &#177; 0.6%), with remarkable ablation resistance (mass ablation rate of 0.012 &#177; 0.003&#160;g s&#8722;1 under 1.5 MW m&#8722;2 heat flux), outperforming conventional SMPs and SMCs in its ability to simultaneously provide programmable shape change and high&#8208;temperature stability. This study demonstrates that SMCPA successfully reconciles the conflict between lightweight deployable structures and high&#8208;temperature thermal protection, offering a promising material solution for next&#8208;generation DTPS in deep&#8208;space missions.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Polymer Electrolyte with Liquid Single&#8208;Atoms for Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic liquid single&#8208;atoms introduce high disorder into the polymer chain segments, elevating the entropy of polymer the system and enabling entropy&#8208;driven fast ion transport. Simultaneously, the liquid metal atoms exhibit voltage&#8208;responsive stress behavior, which enhances the mechanical strength of polymer. This combination breaks the traditional view that polymer disorder and mechanical strength are mutually exclusive.








Abstract
The rate of interfacial transport and bulk transport of Na+ are determining steps that restrict fast&#8208;charging in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Owing to the high interfacial compatibility, SPEs can reduce the interfacial impedance associated with ionic conduction. Despite the ability of high interfacial compatibility in the SPEs to promote the interfacial ion transfer, there remains no known material capable of concurrently boosting bulk&#8208;phase ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Specifically, the study reports an entropy&#8208;driven strategy based on dynamic liquid single atoms that rapidly rearranges polymer chains into entropy&#8208;increased regions, accelerating polymer complexation and dissociation to facilitate ion transport for fast&#8208;charging. Meanwhile, dynamic stress regulation by liquid atoms enhances the mechanical strength of the electrolyte. An independently designed stress&#8208;monitoring electrolytic cell is employed to perform in situ monitoring of the stress&#8208;voltage relationship. The novel SPE exhibits the capacity of 85.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and the capacity retention of 91.76% after 1000 cycles at 10 C. Cell has the capability of 5&#8208;minute fast&#8208;charging with 19.8&#160;&#181;m thickness for the full&#8208;capacity at 10 C. Ah&#8208;level engineering application cells have the retention of 93.69% after 600 cycles at 1 C. Electrolytes incorporating liquid single&#8208;atoms offer new strategies for fast charging.

         <title>A New Strategy for&#160;Controlled&#160;In Situ Release of IL&#8208;2 from Tumor Spheroids Using a NIR&#8208;II Light&#8208;Mediated Optogenetic Manipulation System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic system using photothermal conjugated polymer nanoparticles is developed for controlled in situ interleukin &#8208; 2 (IL&#8208;2) release from 3D tumor spheroids. This approach enhances IL&#8208;2 secretion and activates NK&#8208;92 cells via specific IL&#8208;2RA upregulation, triggering JAK&#8208;STAT, PI3K&#8208;Akt, and MAPK signaling to improve immunotherapy within a biomimetic tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) is a clinically significant immunotherapeutic agent; its short half&#8208;life and poor targeting specificity in vivo have made controlled in situ release an important area of investigation. However, traditional 2D cell experiments and animal studies cannot fully replicate the real environment of human tumors and are limited by interspecies heterogeneity. Here, a NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic manipulation system based on photothermal conjugated polymer nanoparticles is successfully constructed, enabling the controlled in situ release of IL&#8208;2 from 3D tumor spheroids. Maintaining tumor spheroids at a relatively low temperature (&#8776;40&#160;&#176;C) can enhance IL&#8208;2 release by up to 4.3 times upon irradiation with 1080&#160;nm laser for 30 min. The released IL&#8208;2 further activates peripheral NK&#8208;92 cells, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Additionally, the in situ release of IL&#8208;2 specifically upregulates the expression of IL&#8208;2RA on NK&#8208;92 cells, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;affinity complexes between IL&#8208;2 and IL&#8208;2RA. This process activates multiple signaling pathways, including JAK&#8208;STAT, PI3K&#8208;Akt, and MAPK, for improved immunotherapy. Therefore, this NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic system provides a promising method for the controlled in situ release of important cytokines in the 3D tumor immune microenvironment for immunotherapy.

         <title>Molecular Bonding Engineering Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Electrochromic Energy Storage in Flexible PEDOT Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterium&#8208;engineered PEDOT (PEDOT&#8208;D) is synthesized via isotopic substitution and Lewis acid&#8208;assisted polymerization. Strong C&#9472;D bonds damp backbone vibrations, yielding films with a &lt;5% capacitance loss after 300&#160;000 cycles. Flexible PEDOT&#8208;D&#8208;based electrochromic&#8208;supercapacitors present operational stability over 10&#160;000 cycles and from &#8722;25 to 50&#160;&#176;C with real&#8208;time visual state&#8208;of&#8208;charge feedback.








Abstract
Wearable electronics require materials that can withstand mechanical deformation while retaining electrochemical and optoelectronic functionality. Conducting polymers (CPs) are attractive candidates due to their inherent flexibility and electronic conductivity. However, their practical application is often limited by poor long&#8208;term stability and deteriorated performance, particularly under thermal or mechanical stress, owing to structural degradation and overoxidation at high potentials. Herein, a dual&#8208;strategy molecular design is adopted to intrinsically stabilize poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) by combining deuterium substitution with Lewis acid&#8208;assisted polymerization, which suppresses backbone vibrational energy and mitigates over&#8208;oxidative degradation during redox cycling. The resulting deuterated PEDOT film demonstrates exceptional multifunctional performance, including &lt;5% capacitance loss after 300&#160;000 cycles, a high electrochromic contrast of 40.9% at 700&#160;nm, and a specific capacitance of 317&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. PEDOT&#8208;D&#8208;based wearable electrochromic&#8208;supercapacitor devices subsequently exhibit 14.3% transmittance at 550&#160;nm, a specific capacitance of 39.7&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, robust stability, and reliable operation from &#8722;25 to 50&#160;&#176;C. This work establishes a structurally grounded molecular strategy for advancing the durability of CPs, providing a rational design for next&#8208;generation flexible energy systems that are mechanically robust, thermally adaptive, and optically responsive.

         <title>P&#8208;Block Compounds Incorporated into SEI Enable Ultra&#8208;Stable Cell Cycling in Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

The electrochemically activated NiTe2@NC forms a p&#8208;block matrix as a functionalized sodium metal anode host. In&#8208;situ generated sodiophilic Na2Te and conductive Ni reduce the Na nucleation barrier and establish a bi&#8208;continuous ion/electron network, enabling uniform deposition. Concurrently, Na2Te facilitates formation of a robust, ion&#8208;conductive inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, homogenizing Na&#8314; flux to suppress dendrites.








Abstract
Sodium metal anodes (SMAs) are pivotal for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries but suffer from uncontrolled dendrite growth and interfacial instability caused by infinite volume expansion and a fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed, in which a p&#8208;block matrix is in&#8208;situ formed from NiTe2 nanocrystals onto N&#8208;doped carbon hollow microspheres (NiTe2@NC) during electrochemical activation to overcome these challenges. The p&#8208;block matrix with sodiophilic Na2Te and conductive metallic nickel effectively reduces the nucleation barrier and establishes bi&#8208;continuous ion/electron conduction networks, guiding uniform Na plating. Critically, Na2Te dominates the formation of a gradient inorganic&#8208;rich SEI with high Young's modulus and low Na&#8314; diffusion barrier, significantly enhancing mechanical resilience and ion transport kinetics. Consequently, the NiTe2@NC electrode achieves exceptional cyclability (1,000 cycles at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.79%). When configured in full&#8208;cells with a Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 cathode, it maintains the capacity retention of over 96.1% (103.9 mAh g&#8722;1) after 1,200 cycles at 10.0 C. Critically, the full&#8208;cell maintains superior electrochemical resilience with high discharge&#8208;capacity and &gt;90% retention at low&#8208;temperatures (&#8722;20 and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C), demonstrating exceptional practicality for sodium metal batteries. This work establishes a new paradigm for stabilizing reactive metal anodes via in&#8208;situ&#8208;constructed multifunctional interfaces.

Critically, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te dominates the formation of a gradient inorganic-rich SEI with high Young's modulus and low Na&#8314; diffusion barrier, significantly enhancing mechanical resilience and ion transport kinetics. Consequently, the NiTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@NC electrode achieves exceptional cyclability (1,000 cycles at 1.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.79%). When configured in full-cells with a Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, it maintains the capacity retention of over 96.1% (103.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) after 1,200 cycles at 10.0 C. Critically, the full-cell maintains superior electrochemical resilience with high discharge-capacity and &amp;gt;90% retention at low-temperatures (&#8722;20 and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C), demonstrating exceptional practicality for sodium metal batteries. This work establishes a new paradigm for stabilizing reactive metal anodes via in-situ-constructed multifunctional interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoding Molten Salt&#8208;Mediated Crystallization Achieves Controllable Transformation of Heptazine&#8594;Triazine for Efficient Homojunction Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the mechanism of structure and morphology transformation of PHI in molten salt synthesis. By controlling the solidification state of the salt template, the well&#8208;defined homojunction composed of PHI nanorods and PTI hexagonal prisms is synthesized. After decorating with unsaturated Ni&#8211;N2 sites, the Z&#8208;scheme homojunction exhibits superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.








Abstract
Molten salt synthesis offers a versatile platform for catalyst fabrication, however, the mechanistic understanding of crystallization within molten salt system remains limited, hindering the rational tailoring of composition and morphology of the catalysts. Here, the intrinsic mechanism of molten salt&#8208;mediated crystal growth is revealed, which is exemplified by the growth of poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) and poly(triazine imide) (PTI). It is demonstrated that the solidification state of the salt template determines the structural and morphological transformation. By controlling the cooling program, the synthesis of PHI/PTI homojunctions with controllable components and morphologies is realized. Furthermore, the well&#8208;defined homojunction composed of PHI nanorods and PTI hexagonal prisms is obtained, with unsaturated Ni&#8722;N2 sites selectively anchored on PHI via ion exchange. The resulting Ni&#8208;decorated homojunction follows a Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism, which significantly promotes charge separation and maximizes the redox ability. When applied to photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the homojunction catalyst reaches a CO production rate of 121 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 3.6 and 7.6 times those of pure PHI and PTI, respectively. This work deepens the understanding of molten salt&#8208;mediated crystallization and demonstrates a viable pathway for fabrication of high&#8208;performance catalysts through crystallization manipulation.

         <title>A Universal Laser&#8208;Driven Controllable Synthesis Methodology Enabling Electromagnetic Absorption in High&#8208;Entropy Rare&#8208;Earth Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromagnetic absorption functionality is successfully enabled in a series of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth oxides using a laser&#8208;driven controllable synthesis technique. The profoundly broadened effective absorption bandwidth, from 0.01 to 5.26 GHz, in a prototype 20&#8208;cation G&#8208;type high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth disilicate is attributed to the laser&#8208;induced generation of extensive oxygen vacancies and the intensified local chemical order resulting from extreme element mixing.








Abstract
Imparting electromagnetic absorption functionality is key to realizing integrated structural and functional applications of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth oxides (HEREOs). Here, a laser&#8208;driven controllable synthesis (LDCS) technique is reported to achieve this long&#8208;desired goal. Specifically, utilizing this approach, all polymorphs of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth disilicates (HEREDs), including unreported &#948;&#8208;, F&#8208;, and G&#8208;type phases with up to 20 principal elements are successfully synthesized. Crucially, it is demonstrated that a G&#8208;type 20&#8208;cation HERED is conferred with exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption: an effective absorption bandwidth profoundly broadened from 0.01 to 5.26 GHz. This enhancement is attributed to a laser&#8208;induced generation of extensive oxygen vacancies, which markedly increases conductance in electrical insulating HEREOs, and an exacerbation of nanointerface polarization loss caused by intensified local chemical order inherent to the incorporation of 20 constituent elements. The universality of this LDCS technique in enabling electromagnetic wave absorption across diverse HEREO families, including monosilicates, hafnates, zirconates, tantalates, niobates, and aluminates is finally verified, making them promising as radar stealth and thermal/environmental barrier integrated coating materials for use in hot section components of aircraft engines.

         <title>The Promise of Solid Lubricants for a Sustainable Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lubricants are vital for technology, saving energy and resources. The industry seeks sustainable solutions beyond fossil fuels. Solid lubricants offer extremely low friction and reduce environmental impact, especially in harsh conditions. Can these solids truly replace liquid lubricants, or are they limited to extreme applications? Explore the status and prospects of solid lubricants for a greener future.








Abstract
There's no question that lubricants will become more crucial in a world where technology plays an ever&#8208;more&#8208;important role. Lubricants save vast amounts of energy and material resources by reducing friction and increasing the lifetime of devices. It is no surprise that the lubrication industry is one of the largest in the world. The climate crisis demands solutions independent of non&#8208;renewable fossil energy, from which most of the liquid lubricants are extracted. Solid lubricants are the focus of the research community because they provide extremely low friction with a potentially much lower environmental impact. They are used when the operating conditions of machines do not allow the use of liquids, such as in a high temperature or vacuum environment, or when contamination mitigation is critical. The future of solid lubricants is bright. Can they truly be a direct substitute for liquid lubricants in certain applications, as many researchers claim, or will they be used only for applications where operating conditions are too harsh? In this perspective, the status and prospects of several classes of solid lubricants for greener and more effective lubrication are critically reviewed, with the hope that they can help us achieve the sustainability goals for the planet.

         <title>Nanomedicine Reimagined: Translational Strategies for Precision Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective review critically examines key challenges and emerging strategies for translating cancer nanomedicines into clinical practice. Integrating mechanistic insights, design principles, and regulatory considerations, it highlights biological, toxicological, and manufacturing barriers, while outlining innovative solutions, including multimodal imaging, AI&#8208;driven analytics, and human&#8208;relevant models, to advance precision nanotheranostics toward clinical impact.








Abstract
Nanomedicine has shown remarkable promise in advancing tumor imaging and therapy through its ability to achieve targeted delivery, precision imaging, and therapeutic efficacy. However, translating these preclinical successes into clinical practice remains fraught with challenges, including inconsistent tumor targeting, off&#8208;target organ accumulation, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of in vivo behavior of nanomedicines. In this perspective, the current state of nanomedicine research is critically analyzed, emphasizing the translational bottlenecks and offering a forward&#8208;looking view on potential solutions. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect are revisited, dissecting its variable relevance across small animals, large animals, and human patients. Emerging strategies are also discussed to overcome its limitations, such as active targeting and bioengineered delivery systems. Highlighting the need for multimodal imaging, it is proposed to combine nuclear imaging for deep&#8208;tissue penetration with high&#8208;resolution optical imaging to refine our understanding of nanomedicine biodistribution and tumor targeting. Additionally, nonspecific uptake in organs like the liver and spleen is examined, advocating for strategies such as carrier surface modification and biomimetic design to enhance tumor specificity. Moving forward, integrate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven data analytics and humanized in vitro and in vivo models are proposed to better predict clinical outcomes. By critically synthesizing the current knowledge and proposing transformative directions, this review aims to inspire innovative approaches that will pave the way for nanomedicines to achieve their full clinical potential in tumor theranostics.

         <dc:description>
A sheath&#8208;inspired semi&#8208;convertible hydrogel integrating photothermal&#8208;responsive supramolecular networks into covalent polymer frameworks exhibits well elasticity after 15000 compression cycles, photothermal&#8208;responsive lubrication achieving superlubricity (COF of 0.007), and excellent durability over 100 000 shearing cycles, showing significant potential for applications in sheath implantation and soft devices.








ABSTRACT
The dynamic lubrication of sheath surrounding the tendon is significant to the motion of limbs. The sheath&#8208;inspired hydrogels for soft actuator and transplantable substitutes primarily focus on high toughness and intrinsic lubricating ability, it remains a significant challenge to design the hydrogels with secreting lubricants capability for continuous lubrication like sheath. In this work, a sheath&#8208;inspired semi&#8208;convertible hydrogel is designed by cooperating responsive supramolecular networks (gelatin and polydopamine particles) into covalent polymer network (polyvinyl alcohol/poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)). The interpenetrating covalent networks provide the high mechanical strength of 1.73&#160;MPa and reversible contracting capability. The non&#8208;covalent disassembly of gelatin network under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation endows photothermal&#8208;responsive dynamic lubricating function, which could reach superlubricity level (coefficient of friction of 0.007) by introducing hydrophosphatidylcholine in the hydrogel. The synergy of well&#8208;lubricating capability and mechanical property of the hydrogel endows excellent durable property, which presents well elasticity after 15&#160;000 compression cycles; and extreme low wear even after 100&#160;000 shearing cycles. The developed hydrogel in this work is further processed into smart lubrication platform and photothermal regulation switch, which can broaden the application of smart responsive and interfacial lubricating materials.

         <title>Stable Glycerol Electrooxidation to Glycerate Over 1000 Hours on a Hydroxyl&#8208;Modulated PdNiMo Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a ternary PdNiMo alloy electrocatalyst that enhances glycerol electrooxidation to glycerate by synergistically modulating the electronic structure and optimizing surface hydroxyl (*OH) coverage. This catalyst achieves a high current density of 171&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#160;V vs. RHE with 67.5% glycerate selectivity and exceptional long&#8208;term stability, maintaining over 50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 1000&#160;h in a flow electrolyzer. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that balanced *OH coverage is critical for this high performance.








ABSTRACT
The electrochemical upgrading of glycerol into a single, valuable C3 product remains a long&#8208;standing challenge, constrained by the limitations of insufficient activity, low selectivity, and poor stability. Here, we report a ternary PdNiMo alloy catalyst that synergistically modulates the electronic structure and optimizes the surface *OH coverage for efficient and stable glycerol&#8208;to&#8208;glycerate conversion. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Mo incorporation downshifts the d&#8208;band center and weakens *OH binding, while Ni introduction optimizes the balance between *OH&#8208;covered and free Pd sites. The resulting PdNiMo catalyst exhibits exceptional GEOR performance, achieving a high current density of 171&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.8&#160;V vs. RHE and a superior glycerate selectivity of 67.5%. More impressively, in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, the catalyst demonstrates outstanding durability, maintaining a current density of over 50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 1000&#160;h at a cell voltage of 1.2&#160;Vcell. This work elucidates the critical role of tailored hydroxyl coverage in selective oxidation and provides a design principle for advanced electrocatalysts in renewable energy&#8208;powered electrosynthesis.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large&#8208;Period Moir&#233; Lattices in Twisted Trilayer MoS2 Induced by High&#8208;Symmetry Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The twisted trilayer (Tt) MoS2 structures with a fixed top&#8208;layer twist of 2.7&#176;and versatile the middle&#8208;to&#8208;bottom interlayer twists were directly synthesized using a NaCl&#8208;assisted CVD approach. An ultra&#8208;large&#8208;period super moir&#233; lattice with a relaxation periodicity of about 24 nm is achieved in the 2.7&#176;/21.9&#176;&#8208;Tt MoS2 samples, evidenced via scanning transition electron microscopy measurements, which clearly showing that one unit cell is composed of two mirror&#8208;symmetric triangle domains hierarchically containing five kinds of high&#8208;symmetric stacking registrations. This robust super moir&#233; lattice in 2.7&#176;/21.9&#176;&#8208;Tt MoS2 generates deep moir&#233; potential to confine the intralayer excitons against external magnetic field up to &#177; 9T, associated with the enhanced valley polarization by two&#8208;fold compared to that of the trilayer systems with incommensurate angles (2.7&#176;/30&#176;).








ABSTRACT
Twisted trilayer (Tt) transition metal dichalcogenides with multiple rotational degrees of freedom offer unprecedented opportunities for constructing large&#8208;wavelength moir&#233; superlattices to maximize the effect of correlated behaviors. Precisely stacking trilayer structures to realize ultra&#8208;large moir&#233; superlattices remains a significant challenge, hindering investigations of moir&#233;&#8208;tuned excitonic properties. Here we fabricate Tt MoS2 via chemical vapor deposition, in which two commensurate twists of 2.7&#176; and 21.9&#176; are sequentially introduced from the top to middle, and to bottom layers. An unprecedented super&#8208;moir&#233; structure with an ultra&#8208;large periodicity of around 24&#160;nm is achieved, 30 times larger than that of 21.9&#176;&#8208;bilayer MoS2, hierarchically composed of periodical mirror&#8208;symmetric triangular tessellation patterns consisting of five kinds of high&#8208;symmetric stacking registrations and the relaxation regions resulting from the interlayer gliding. This robust ultra&#8208;large&#8208;period superstructure generates a deep moir&#233; potential to effectively suppress intralayer moir&#233; excitons recombination and be against intervalley exchange interaction at the magnetic field up to 9T, associated with the enhanced layer&#8208;valley&#8208;locked polarization by two&#8208;fold larger than that of the trilayer systems with incommensurate angles. Our work presents angle&#8208;dependent super&#8208;moir&#233; architectures in Tt systems as a versatile platform for designing moir&#233; quantum materials with tailored optoelectronic responses, advancing applications in valleytronic and excitonic devices.

A &#8220;dual&#8208;gas coadsorption domain&#8221; architecture (NiO1&#8208;x/pZnO) for solar&#8208;driven methane photocatalytic oxidation. Oxygen vacancies in porous zinc oxide (pZnO) act as oxygen pumps, while adjacent reduced nickel oxide (NiO1&#8208;x) nanoclusters chemisorb and polarize methane, lowering the C&#8208;H activation barrier and steering the radical cascade toward methyl hydroperoxide and formaldehyde instead of methanol. 








ABSTRACT
Photocatalytic oxidation of methane to formaldehyde at concentrations compatible with direct fuel&#8208;cell use remains a critical yet unmet challenge. Here we introduce a &#8220;dual&#8208;gas coadsorption domain&#8221; architecture discovered through a high&#8208;throughput screen of 37 earth&#8208;abundant transition metals and their oxides. Reduced nickel oxide (NiO1&#8208;x) emerged as the optimal co&#8208;catalyst, decorating the pore edges of vacancy&#8208;rich porous ZnO (pZnO). Oxygen vacancies in pZnO act as oxygen pumps, while adjacent NiO1&#8208;x nanoclusters chemisorb and polarize methane, lowering the C&#8208;H activation barrier and steering the radical cascade toward methyl hydroperoxide instead of methanol. Methyl hydroperoxide quantitatively decomposes to formaldehyde, delivering 28.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 (3&#160;mM in solution, 88.5% selectivity). An outdoor reactor powered only by natural sunlight (peak 72.8&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) produced 12.3&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 formaldehyde in 6&#160;h without detectable by&#8208;products. The concentrated effluent feeds an alkaline formaldehyde fuel cell directly&#8212;no purification&#8212;co&#8208;generating 0.2&#160;kWh of electricity and valuable formate at a peak power density of 32.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. The work establishes a scalable, solar&#8208;driven pathway for simultaneous methane valorization and on&#8208;site energy conversion.

         <title>Freeform Manufacturing of Plant&#8208;Based Structural Colors for Scalable Photonic and Mechanochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green, freeform manufacturing approach that utilizes robust aqueous two&#8208;phase systems to create intricate and scalable photonic structures and non&#8208;planar mechanochromic hydrogel actuators from plant&#8208;based hydroxypropyl cellulose. This approach broadens the structural possibilities of sustainable photonic devices and mechanochromic systems, offering advantages of good optical fidelity during fabrication, freeform design possibilities, scalability potential, and multi&#8208;color designability.








ABSTRACT
Plant&#8208;based, iridescent, and dynamically tunable structural colored materials are highly attractive for sustainable photonic devices. However, fabricating complex architectures at the decimeter&#8208;scale with optical fidelity using plant&#8208;derived materials remains challenging, limiting their use in photonic devices and adaptive actuation. Here, we introduce an aqueous two&#8208;phase freeform fabrication strategy for vibrantly colored hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), where a robust immiscible aqueous environment is developed to preserve HPC cholesteric structures with &lt; 3% shift in peak reflection wavelength over three days, enabling stable processing of large&#8208;scale structural colored materials. Our technique involves a food&#8208;grade support medium with low interfacial tension, allowing for embedded 3D printing of photonic structures and post&#8208;extrusion recovery of the HPC cholesteric domains. Intricate constructs, including interlocking chainmail, with feature sizes down to &#8764;50&#160;&#181;m and color consistency over lengths exceeding ten centimeters, can be achieved. Additionally, this approach can be utilized to create non&#8208;planar, mechanochromic hydrogel actuators with programmable multicolor designs, as demonstrated in an octopus&#8208;inspired hydrogel actuator and a color&#8208;shifting display for information encryption, camouflage, and human&#8211;machine interaction. Our green, freeform manufacturing approach provides new design possibilities for sustainable photonic devices and can be applied to industrially relevant applications.

         <title>A Design Strategy for Durable Anionic Redox via Fluorine&#8208;Induced Electronic Structure Modulation in In Situ Formed Disordered Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that F substitution in Immm&#8208;Li2NiO2 modulates O redox activity by forming stable Li&#8208;O&#8208;M&#8208;F units. During cycling, in situ disorder generates Li&#9472;O&#9472;Li configurations that enable reversible anionic redox. F lowers O 2p energy levels, suppresses O2 evolution, and enhances structural stability, offering a design blueprint for durable, high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;excess cathode materials.








ABSTRACT
Disordered cathode materials are attractive candidates for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but the intrinsic instability of anionic redox hinders their commercialization. Unlike conventional Li&#8208;excess disordered systems limited by compositional constraints of Li1+xM1&#8208;xO2, Immm&#8208;Li2NiO2 offers a platform to access highly lithiated chemistries that enable in situ disorder formation during electrochemical cycling. This allows lattice O to contribute to charge compensation; however, O2 release at high voltages compromises reversibility and cycling stability. To address this, fluorination generates a quadrupolar Li&#8208;O&#8208;M&#8208;F configuration that lowers the Li&#9472;O&#9472;Li band energy level and delays the onset of anionic redox. This electronic structure modification suppresses O2 evolution, enhances structural stability, and improves cycling performance. By coupling electrochemically induced disorder with stabilization through Li&#8208;O&#8208;M&#8208;F units, this work establishes a new framework for engineering durable, high&#8208;capacity cathodes, offering a blueprint for material design strategies that transcend stoichiometric restrictions and unlock stable anion redox functionality.

         <title>Stable P&#8208;Type PbS Quantum Dot Ink for all&#8208;Blade&#8208;Coated Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization of p&#8208;type PbS quantum dot ink is achieved through hydrogen bonding between fluorinated alcohols solvent and the MP ligand, allowing a six&#8208;day shelf&#8208;life. The solvent does not compromise pre&#8208;deposited layers, enabling fully blade&#8208;coated photodiodes in both n&#8211;p and p&#8211;n architectures, with enhanced detectivity and bandwidth compared to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer controls, attributed to improved film morphology and charge transport.








ABSTRACT
PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) hold strong promise for short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) optoelectronics. However, current photodetectors rely on p&#8208;type CQD layers fabricated via a laborious, defect&#8208;prone layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer process. While robust n&#8208;type CQD inks have been realized, p&#8208;type inks remain challenging due to the absence of suitable ligands and solvents. An ideal solvent must ensure colloidal stability and be orthogonal to underlying layers. Here, we report a thiolate&#8208;capped p&#8208;type PbS CQD ink using mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;propanol as the ligand and hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol as the solvent. Stabilization arises from ligand&#8211;solvent hydrogen bonding, providing a shelf&#8208;life exceeding six days. The solvent does not compromise pre&#8208;deposited layers, enabling fully blade&#8208;coated photodiodes in both n&#8211;p and p&#8211;n architectures. Devices fabricated with this ink exhibit a twofold increase in specific detectivity (2.55&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones) and a 70% enhancement in bandwidth (155&#160;kHz) compared to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer controls, attributed to improved film morphology and charge transport.

         <title>A Novel Design Strategy for Benzo[b]Thiophene Substituted Multiple Resonance Type Blue Fluorescent Dopant With Maximized Efficiency and Super&#8208;Narrow FWHM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel double boron&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type blue fluorescent emitter, v&#8208;DABNA&#8208;BT, was developed by incorporating a benzo[b]thiophene unit into the core to address the efficiency and color purity issues of the blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, achieving a maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.7% with a full width at half maximum of 18.2 nm in the blue devices.








ABSTRACT
Conventional blue fluorescent emitters suffer from low efficiency and broad full width at half maximum (FWHM), limiting their application in next&#8208;generation organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, we report a novel double boron&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type blue fluorescent emitter, v&#8208;DABNA&#8208;BT by incorporating a benzo[b]thiophene unit into the v&#8208;DABNA core to address the efficiency and color purity issues of the blue OLEDs. The v&#8208;DABNA&#8208;BT exhibited deep blue emission with a photoluminescence peak at 466&#160;nm and an exceptionally narrow FWHM of 13.9&#160;nm. As a pure blue fluorescent emitter, it delivered a high external quantum efficiency of 10.8%, FWHM of 15.6&#160;nm, and color coordinate of (0.115, 0.138). In addition, the v&#8208;DABNA&#8208;BT&#8208;based hyperfluorescent (HF) OLEDs achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.7% with a FWHM of 18.2&#160;nm, one of the best performances reported among HF systems employing pure fluorescent terminal emitters. This result underscores the potential of benzo[b] thiophene&#8208;modified boron&#8208;based MR&#8208;type fluorescent emitters as promising candidates for high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;color&#8208;purity OLED applications.

         <title>Oral Magnetoelectric Neuroimmunomodulation via the Gut&#8211;Brain&#8211;Spleen&#8211;Heart Axis for Noninvasive Atrial Fibrillation Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a rat atrial fibrillation (AF) model, orally administered NG MPs adhere to the stomach lining and, upon magnetic activation, generate pulsed currents that stimulate vagal afferents, enhance parasympathetic tone, and activate the splenic arm of the cholinergic anti&#8208;inflammatory pathway. This dual neuroimmune modulation reduces systemic inflammation, shortens AF duration, and prevents cardiac remodeling, providing a safe strategy for AF management.








ABSTRACT
Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is closely associated with autonomic imbalance and inflammation. While low&#8208;level vagus nerve stimulation (LL&#8208;VNS) offers therapeutic benefits, its clinical application is limited by the need for surgical implants. Here, we present a noninvasive, orally delivered magnetoelectric neuroimmunomodulation platform that targets the gut&#8211;brain&#8211;spleen&#8211;heart axis to deliver LL&#8208;VNS for AF therapy. The platform comprises ingestible microparticles (MPs) embedding magnetostrictive Fe3O4@BaTiO3 nanogenerators (FO@BTO NGs) within a conductive matrix of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which facilitates electrical signal transmission, and dopamine&#8211;alginate, which promotes gastric adhesion via catechol&#8208;mediated interactions. After oral gavage in a rat AF model, MPs adhere to the stomach lining and, upon alternating magnetic activation, FO@BTO NGs generate pulsed electrical currents that stimulate vagal afferent fibers. This activates brainstem autonomic circuits, enhancing parasympathetic tone and suppressing sympathetic activity. Concurrently, it engages the splenic neuroimmune circuit via the cholinergic anti&#8208;inflammatory pathway, thereby reducing systemic inflammation. This dual neuroimmune modulation significantly shortens AF duration and mitigates cardiac inflammation and electrical remodeling. These findings establish a clinically translatable, implant&#8208;free strategy for delivering LL&#8208;VNS through coordinated neural and immune pathways, offering a safe and accessible alternative to implantable systems for AF management.

&lt;p&gt;In a rat atrial fibrillation (AF) model, orally administered NG MPs adhere to the stomach lining and, upon magnetic activation, generate pulsed currents that stimulate vagal afferents, enhance parasympathetic tone, and activate the splenic arm of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. This dual neuroimmune modulation reduces systemic inflammation, shortens AF duration, and prevents cardiac remodeling, providing a safe strategy for AF management.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Functional Polymers for Ionic Thermoelectrics: Multiscale Design Strategies for Ion Dynamics, Mechanics, and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the impact of the polymers at the molecular&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macro&#8208;scale engineering. Particular emphasis is placed on their roles at different scales to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of performance improvement. In addition, current challenges and potential research approaches are discussed, outlining directions for the future development of iTE&#8208;based energy harvesting systems.








ABSTRACT
The efficient conversion of dissipated heat into useful electrical energy has emerged as a promising approach for sustainable energy technologies. Ionic thermoelectrics (iTEs) are particularly attractive because they generate substantial thermo&#8208;voltages, effectively harvest low&#8208;grade heat, and offer advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, easy scalability, and remarkable performance. Unlike liquid&#8208;state platforms, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state iTEs exhibit properties that are critically governed by the polymer matrix and polymer&#8208;ion interactions, which are closely related to the overall device performance. Consequently, the use of functional polymers effectively improves the characteristics and performance of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state iTEs. Therefore, this paper highlights the impact of the polymer matrix on performance and mechanical properties in iTEs from molecular&#8208;, micro&#8208;, to macro&#8208;scale engineering. Particular emphasis is placed on clarifying the role of polymers at various scales to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of performance enhancement. Furthermore, the current challenges and prospective research directions are discussed, offering guidance toward the development of next&#8208;generation iTE&#8208;based energy harvesting platforms.

         <title>Nanolaminate Ferroelectric Transistor Enabling Wide&#8208;Reservoir In Sensor Neuromorphic Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanolaminate HZO/HfO2/HZO&#8208;gated IGZO FeTFT integrates wavelength&#8208;multiplexed volatile photo&#8208;reservoir dynamics with nonvolatile ferroelectric synaptic weight storage. Multi&#8208;wavelength optical inputs (405, 450, and 532&#160;nm) generate diverse reservoir states for wide reservoir computing, while Incremental Step Pulse with Verify Algorithm&#8208;programmed multi&#8208;bit potentiation and depression enable highly linear readout weight updates for accurate image recognition.








ABSTRACT
This work reports a hardware&#8208;oriented hybrid reservoir computing (HRC) system based on a nanolaminate ferroelectric thin&#8208;film transistor (FeTFT) that unifies volatile and nonvolatile functions in a single three&#8208;terminal device. The HZO/HfO2/HZO gate stack modulates grain size and suppresses ferroelectric variability, enabling precise multilevel control and highly linear weight updates via the incremental step pulse with verify algorithm (ISPVA). Electrical input induces long&#8208;term memory, while optical excitation yields short&#8208;term memory, allowing dual&#8208;mode operation. Light&#8208;driven 4&#8208;bit reservoirs operate at picoampere currents (&#8764;10&#160;pW/device) and emulate nociceptive neuron behavior. Combining three wavelength&#8208;dependent reservoirs (405, 450, 532&#160;nm) expands the feature space and improves classification accuracy. Using ISPVA&#8208;linearized readout, the system achieves 93.1% and 85.1% accuracies on MNIST and Fashion&#8208;MNIST, respectively exceeding prior FeTFT/memristor&#8208;based RC systems. This approach establishes a scalable, energy&#8208;efficient route toward multifunctional in&#8208;sensor neuromorphic computing based on a unified ferroelectric platform.

         <title>Coupling Data&#8208;Driven and Reinforcement Learning for Material Development and Device Management in Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the core theories, characteristics, and application paradigms of both data&#8208;driven approaches and reinforcement learning, highlighting their complementarity. It then elaborates on the coupled paradigm's applications across the full battery life cycle, forming closed loops for material development and device management. Furthermore, it also discusses technical challenges and outlines potential research directions.








ABSTRACT
The growing demand for high&#8208;energy, safe, and durable batteries demands innovative strategies in both material discovery and device management. Conventional approaches, rooted in empirical trial&#8208;and&#8208;error and physics&#8208;based modeling, often struggle to address the complexity and dynamic nature of next&#8208;generation battery systems. Here, we highlight the emerging synergy between data&#8208;driven machine learning and reinforcement learning (RL), establishing a coupled paradigm that unifies predictive modeling with adaptive optimization. Data&#8208;driven methods enable rapid screening of cathodes, anodes, and liquid/solid electrolytes through multi&#8208;source data mining, while RL agents iteratively optimize synthesis conditions, interfacial properties, and charging protocols. Together, these approaches create closed&#8208;loop frameworks for materials development (prediction, exploration, and validation) and device management (data insight and strategy optimization), which accelerate discovery, enhance safety, and improve performance across the battery lifecycle. Finally, we further outline critical opportunities in data processing, feature engineering, and model building that can elevate this coupled paradigm from conceptual promise to industrial deployment. This integration of data&#8208;driven learning with reinforcement intelligence paves a pathway toward autonomous, high&#8208;throughput battery innovation, providing new foundations for next&#8208;generation energy technologies.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Edge Burst of Sound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study experimentally demonstrates non&#8208;Hermitian edge bursts in 1D acoustic crystals, confirming their universality across quantum and classical systems. Bipolar edge bursts emerge from twisted&#8208;winding topology, while boundary&#8208;selectable bursts are achieved through coupling engineering without changing band topology. The results advance the understanding of edge&#8208;burst dynamics by highlighting the critical interplay between gap&#8208;closing points and non&#8208;Hermitian band topology.








ABSTRACT
Non&#8208;Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. A well&#8208;known example is the non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non&#8208;Hermitian lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary&#8208;localized loss probability&#8212;a phenomenon that requires not only non&#8208;Hermitian band topology but also the closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the non&#8208;Hermitian edge burst in a classical&#8208;wave metamaterial: a lossy nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non&#8208;Hermitian band topology; the latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non&#8208;Hermitian band topology and other physical properties in non&#8208;Hermitian systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance, Recyclable Thermosets Enabled by Thiosemicarbazone Dynamic Bonds via Synergistic Dynamic Covalent and Supramolecular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single thiosemicarbazone (TSC) dynamic bond unifies covalent and supramolecular networks, enabling high&#8208;performance thermosets with a Tg of 217&#176;C, strength of 127.1 MPa, toughness of 15.1 MJ m&#8722;3, and Young's modulus of 2.1 GPa. The material enables efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling through in situ depolymerization and reformation over multiple cycles without performance loss. This synergistic effect overcomes performance&#8208;recyclability trade&#8208;offs, advancing sustainable materials with robust properties and streamlined reproduction.








ABSTRACT
Recyclable thermosets have emerged as promising candidates to mitigate plastic pollution, yet reconciling high performance with efficient recyclability remains challenging. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance, readily recyclable thermoset engineered through a synergistic dynamic covalent and supramolecular network. This design employs a single thiosemicarbazone (TSC) dynamic linkage to intrinsically unify dynamic covalent and noncovalent bonds within one chemical moiety, thereby overcoming conventional performance&#8208;recyclability trade&#8208;offs. The dual&#8208;network architecture endows the TSC&#8208;derived polymers (PTSCs) with exceptional thermal stability (glass transition temperature: 217&#176;C), mechanical robustness (tensile strength: 127.1&#160;MPa; elongation at break: 16.6%; Young's modulus: 2.1&#160;GPa; toughness: 15.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), dimensional stability, and chemical resistance. Critically, the inherent reversibility of TSC bonds enables closed&#8208;loop recycling through in situ depolymerization and reconstruction over multiple cycles while retaining performance parity with virgin materials. This efficient recycling route confers genuine circularity, avoiding intermediate purification steps, minimizing solvent consumption, and streamlining the recycling workflow. Furthermore, PTSCs enable selective recovery from complex mixed plastic waste streams and carbon fiber composites without sophisticated separation processes. This work establishes a versatile molecular paradigm for designing readily recyclable thermosets with exceptional performance, advancing sustainable high&#8208;performance materials innovation.

         <title>Breaking the 2&#8208;nm Barrier in Hard Disk Drives Using Monolayer Amorphous Carbon Overcoats</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid growth of AI has increased demand for large&#8208;scale data storage, making HDDs indispensable&#160;in data centers. Increasing&#160;areal storage density is crucial, but limited by the traditional&#160;carbon overcoats (COC). Monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC) offers a superior&#160;alternative. It provides high thermal stability, corrosion resistance, and low friction, enabling HDDs to reach 10 Tb/in2.








ABSTRACT
The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased the demand for large&#8208;scale data storage, making hard disk drives (HDDs) indispensable in data centers due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and stability. To support AI&#8208;driven data requirements, increasing the areal storage density is critical. However, this metric is increasingly constrained by the carbon overcoat (COC), the essential protective layer for magnetic media. Traditional diamond&#8208;like carbon (DLC) can no longer fulfill the stringent demands for ultrathin coatings and high thermal stability required by next&#8208;generation technologies like Heat&#8208;Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) and bit&#8208;patterned media. Here, we introduce monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC) as a superior&#160;alternative. MAC is directly grown on the heterogeneous (Fe, Pt, SiO2) HDD surface at low temperatures (&#8764; 300&#176;C), achieving an uniform&#160;0.8 nm thickness across 2.5&#8208;inch disks. Despite its atomic thickness, MAC demonstrates high corrosion resistance and low roughness comparable to commercial 2.5 nm COCs. Its fully amorphous, sp2&#8208;hybridized structure ensures excellent thermal stability under HAMR&#8208;like conditions (&#8764;450&#176;C) and a low friction coefficient, enabling potential lubricant&#8208;free operation. Replacing traditional COCs with MAC facilitates the development of HDD media capable of achieving 10 Tb/in2, addressing the urgent storage demands of the digital era.

         <title>Diffraction&#8208;Free Omnidirectional Antireflection Binary Metasurface via Femtosecond Laser Hybrid Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces breakthrough cone&#8208;cylinder binary metasurface structures that achieve ultra&#8208;broadband (3&#8208;5 &#181;m) non&#8208;diffractive anti&#8208;reflection through multi&#8208;mode resonance and phase compensation. The innovative FsLPE fabrication technique enables centimeter&#8208;scale sapphire windows with an average transmittance exceeding 92.0% and minimal degradation (0.3%) even at a 50&#176; incidence angle. Remarkably, these structures withstand 1200&#176;C, suitable for harsh&#8208;condition infrared applications.








ABSTRACT
An ideal anti&#8208;reflection window requires both diffraction&#8208;free transmission and mechanical robustness, which poses significant challenges for hard and brittle materials. Conventional subwavelength structures often achieve diffraction&#8208;free transmission by either reducing the periodicity or increasing aspect ratio yet low processing efficiency hinders scalable fabrication. Herein, we propose a novel cone&#8208;cylinder binary metasurface that overcomes the limitations of traditional subwavelength designs by exploiting multi&#8208;mode resonance and phase compensation. This synergy enables non&#8208;diffractive transmission in a scalable non&#8208;subwavelength sapphire architecture. To realize the metasurface, we developed a femtosecond laser penetrating hybrid etching (FsLPE) technique, which enables the fabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale mid&#8208;infrared broadband windows on sapphire. The resulting device exhibits a peak transmittance of 98.3% at 5&#160;&#181;m, an average transmittance exceeding 92.0%, and minimal degradation (0.3%) even at a 50&#176; incidence angle. Moreover, the window withstands temperatures up to 1200&#176;C, demonstrating great potential for applications in infrared optical systems and optical sensing under extreme environmental conditions.

         <title>STAR Therapy: Spatiotemporal Antitumor Regimen via a Size&#8208;Gated DNA Hydrogel Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal antitumor regimen (STAR) based on size&#8208;gated DSH enables spatiotemporal release: small Los first remodels tumor ECM by reducing density, while larger ICG/PLT is retained and released later. This avoids non&#8208;selective synchronous release of conventional carriers, enhancing tumor accumulation of ICG/PLT, resulting in superior photodynamic efficacy and improved therapy for ECM&#8208;dense solid tumors.








ABSTRACT
Current cancer therapies for solid tumors are significantly hampered by the dense tumor extracellular matrix (ECM), which restricts antitumor drug penetration and accumulation. Hence, there is a critical need for controllable drug delivery systems capable of spatiotemporally controlling the sequential action of ECM&#8208;modulating agents and cytotoxic drugs. However, conventional carriers often suffer from &#8220;non&#8208;selective synchronous release&#8221;, failing to achieve such spatiotemporal control. Herein, we propose a spatiotemporal antitumor regimen (STAR) based on a size&#8208;gated DNA supramolecular hydrogel (DSH) drug delivery system. In this system, a small&#8208;molecule drug Losartan (Los) and a larger indocyanine green&#8208;loaded platelet&#8208;mimetic particle (ICG/PLT) are co&#8208;encapsulated within the DSH. The programmable size&#8208;selectivity of DSH allows for the rapid diffusion of Los to first remodel tumor ECM by reducing matrix density and enhancing tissue perfusion; meanwhile, the larger ICG/PLT particles are retained within the hydrogel structure and released later along with hydrogel degradation. Notably, this size&#8208;gated sequential release strategy significantly enhances the accumulation of ICG/PLT at the tumor site, resulting in superior light&#8208;activated photodynamic therapeutic outcomes against tumors. Taken together, this study establishes a novel STAR paradigm based on size&#8208;gated DSH, holding promise to advance the therapeutic strategy for solid tumors with dense ECM.

         <title>A Tongue&#8208;Computer Tactile Interface Mediated by the Magnetoelectric&#8208;Driven Tribovoltaic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a groundbreaking tongue&#8208;machine haptic interface, activated by subtle tongue gestures, for silent communication and human&#8208;computer interaction. The magnetoelectric&#8208;driven tribovoltaic effect between magnetic particle&#8208; filled Gallium&#8211;Indium (EGaIn) liquid metal and conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) significantly enhances sensing sensitivity and precision. This interface demonstrates a wide range of interactive applications, including human&#8208;machine collaboration, intelligent wheelchair control, and gaming interactions.








ABSTRACT
Current human&#8208;computer interaction (HCI) technologies often suffer from wearing discomfort, noise sensitivity, user fatigue, and privacy concerns, particularly for users with physical disabilities or those requiring high&#8208;precision control.

&lt;p&gt;We have developed a groundbreaking tongue-machine haptic interface, activated by subtle tongue gestures, for silent communication and human-computer interaction. The magnetoelectric-driven tribovoltaic effect between magnetic particle- filled Gallium&#8211;Indium (EGaIn) liquid metal and conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) significantly enhances sensing sensitivity and precision. This interface demonstrates a wide range of interactive applications, including human-machine collaboration, intelligent wheelchair control, and gaming interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies often suffer from wearing discomfort, noise sensitivity, user fatigue, and privacy concerns, particularly for users with physical disabilities or those requiring high-precision control. In this study, we address the aforementioned challenges by designing an interactive tongue-computer interface (ITCI) that enables precise, hands-free interaction through subtle tongue movements. The ITCI utilizes an array of direct current tribovoltaic tactile sensors enhanced by the magnetoelectric effect, achieving a peak current density of 10.72 A m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a charge density of 718 mC m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a sensitivity of 90 &#181;A N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. integration with a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network yields a recognition accuracy of 99.98%, supporting diverse interactive applications, including smart wheelchair control, robotic manipulation, and immersive gaming. This self-powered, noninvasive interface enhances user autonomy and privacy, offering a robust platform for intelligent, energy-efficient, and hands-free human&#8211;machine interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells With Stabilized Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric cross&#8208;link molecule agent, 4,4'&#8208;Oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide), is introduced into wide&#8208;bandgap iodide&#8208;bromide mixed perovskite to stabilize the&#160;vulnerable grain boundaries and suppress halide segregation. This approach enables single&#8208;junction 1.68 eV perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 23.48%, and perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells with an efficiency of 32.19%, along with excellent thermal and operational stability.








ABSTRACT
Halide perovskite absorber with a bandgap near 1.68&#160;eV is pivotal for constructing perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, these wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites are susceptible to light&#8208;induced halide segregation and consequential non&#8208;radiative and transport loss, severely compromising device performance and operational stability. Here, we incorporate a symmetric cross&#8208;link agent, 4,4'&#8208;oxydibenzenesulfonyl hydrazide, to stabilize the iodide&#8208;bromide mixed perovskite lattice. The agents are introduced during film growth to regulate the crystallization process and subsequently assemble at grain boundaries, where they firmly anchor to the perovskite grain surface and stabilize the chemically active boundary regions. Through this approach, photostable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites are achieved, exhibiting enhanced crystallinity, reduced band&#8208;tail states, and suppressed halide segregation and lattice decomposition. The resultant 1.68&#160;eV single&#8208;junction devices delivered an independently certified power conversion efficiency of 23.48%. When integrated with silicon heterojunction cells, the resulting two&#8208;terminal monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 32.19%, and retained 90% of their initial efficiency after 1020 h of continuous operation.

         <title>Intrinsically Thermally Robust Nanocrystals for High&#8208;Flux Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sb3+&#8208;induced lattice stiffening and exciton recycling endow 0D Cs3YCl&#8326; nanocrystals with intrinsic resistance to thermal quenching, enabling stable high&#8208;flux photonic operation at elevated temperatures.








ABSTRACT
High&#8208;brightness photonic platforms driven at high currents self&#8208;heat beyond 400 K; under such conditions, colloidal emitters (II&#8211;VI, III&#8211;V, I&#8211;III&#8211;VI2, group&#8208;IV semiconductors, and both leaded and lead&#8208;free halide perovskite nanocrystals) typically lose efficiency and drift in color. Extrinsic passivation offers limited thermal gains with trade&#8208;offs such as organic&#8208;matrix degradation or oxide&#8208;shell phonon bottlenecks. Here we establish a lattice&#8208;encoded chemical strategy that imparts intrinsic thermal resilience to colloidal nanocrystals via defect&#8211;phonon&#8211;exciton coupling in a zero&#8208;dimensional Sb3+&#8208;doped Cs3LnCl6 lattice. A controlled&#8208;ramp synthesis co&#8208;modulates site occupancy and defect chemistry, creating rigid, low&#8208;phonon [BX6]3&#8722; octahedra that localize lattice expansion and suppress multiphonon relaxation. &#197;ngstr&#246;m&#8208;scale engineered deep traps (&#8764;0.6&#8211;1.2 eV) recycle thermally activated carriers, enabling trap&#8208;compensated anti&#8208;thermal quenching and stabilizing emission through Ln3+ 4f cascade coupling. Tunable from deep violet to ultra&#8208;narrow green and yellow, these nanocrystals show enhanced photoluminescence at elevated temperatures (Cs3LnCl6:Sb3+ reaches 160% intensity at &#8764;410 K while retaining &gt;93% photoluminescence quantum yield). High&#8208;power devices retain &gt;90% luminous flux after 50 h at 1.4 A (junction temperature &#8764;410 K) with &lt;1% chromaticity shift. This work turns thermal robustness from extrinsic protection into intrinsic bonding, providing a molecular design framework for high&#8208;flux photonics.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Efficiency Thin&#8208;Film Perovskite Solar Cells in Air via Polymer&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a scalable strategy using PPG&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 microcrystals that may be processed in air and undergo controlled redissolution to form highly oriented, defect&#8208;suppressed perovskite films. The PSCs derived from these films deliver a PCE of 26.5% and exhibit enhanced stability, demonstrating potential for industrial large&#8208;scale perovskite photovoltaic manufacturing.








ABSTRACT
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) demonstrate exceptional photovoltaic performance but face critical stability challenges impeding commercialization. Herein, we integrate polypropylene glycol (PPG) into an inverse temperature crystallization process to synthesize highly stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 microcrystals, which retain phase purity for over six months in air. Our approach enables large&#8208;scale production (nearly 50&#160;g) of PPG&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 (target) microcrystals from low&#8208;cost PbI2, with over 95% yield&#8212;sufficient to manufacture 23 m2 of perovskite solar modules. Redissolving the target &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 microcrystals, followed by spin&#8208;coating and annealing, yields target perovskite films with reduced defect density, minimized residual strain, and enhanced carrier transport. Mechanistic investigations reveal that colloidal species form upon the redissolution of target microcrystals which modulate the film crystallization kinetics, i.e. accelerating (100)&#8208;oriented nucleation and growth. Employing this integrated strategy, a champion PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.50% (certified 26.22%) was obtained at a laboratory scale (0.06 cm2) and 22.66% for a module with an aperture area of 28.99 cm2, together with prolonged operational stability. This work opens new avenues for the industrial&#8208;scale fabrication of efficient and stable large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>A Recyclable Polythioester With &#945;&#8208;Gem&#8208;Dimethyl Substitution: Instantaneous Crystallization Triggered by Large and Rapid Stretching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PaGMTE, a depolymerizable polythioester (PTE) prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thiolactone, crystallizes extremely slowly in a quiescent melt. However, large and rapid stretching can trigger its instantaneous crystallization, yielding PaGMTE fibers with outstanding mechanical properties and the potential of a waveguide. Furthermore, we unveil PaGMTE's orthorhombic crystal structure featuring antiparallel&#8208;packed homochiral 83 helices&#8212;the first one resolved for any PTE.








ABSTRACT
Designing and fabricating recyclable polymers combining closed&#8208;loop depolymerizability with high mechanical performance remains a major challenge in sustainable materials. To reach both high recyclability without compromising the mechanical properties, precise controlling of the crystallization behaviors emerges as a crucial strategy. Here, we demonstrate unexpected crystallization behavior in a depolymerizable polythioester (PTE), PaGMTE, and report the first crystal structure of this kind. Derived from organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thiolactone, PaGMTE exhibits exceptionally slow quiescent crystallization, which stands in sharp contrast to its polyester analog polypivalolactone that crystallizes rapidly. However, large&#8208;amplitude rapid stretching (strain ~600%, strain rate &#8805; 10 s&#8722;1), where the Deborah number based on the Rouse time of entanglement strand exceeds 1, triggers its crystallization, accelerating the crystallization rate by &gt; 200,000 fold and achieving ~40% crystallinity within 1 s. This approach yields highly oriented fibers with outstanding mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 0.80 GPa, tensile strength of 120 MPa, breaking strain of 70%), high transparency, and the potential as a waveguide. We unveil PaGMTE's orthorhombic crystal structure (space group P212121, a = 1.075 nm, b = 0.622 nm, c = 3.618 nm) with antiparallel&#8208;packed homochiral 83 helices. The slow quiescent crystallization shall arise from entropic barriers associated with conformational adjustments toward the helix.

&lt;p&gt;PaGMTE, a depolymerizable polythioester (PTE) prepared by ring-opening polymerization of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-gem-dimethyl-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-thiolactone, crystallizes extremely slowly in a quiescent melt. However, large and rapid stretching can trigger its instantaneous crystallization, yielding PaGMTE fibers with outstanding mechanical properties and the potential of a waveguide. Furthermore, we unveil PaGMTE's orthorhombic crystal structure featuring antiparallel-packed homochiral 8&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; helices&#8212;the first one resolved for any PTE.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing and fabricating recyclable polymers combining closed-loop depolymerizability with high mechanical performance remains a major challenge in sustainable materials. To reach both high recyclability without compromising the mechanical properties, precise controlling of the crystallization behaviors emerges as a crucial strategy. Here, we demonstrate unexpected crystallization behavior in a depolymerizable polythioester (PTE), PaGMTE, and report the first crystal structure of this kind. Derived from organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-gem-dimethyl-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-thiolactone, PaGMTE exhibits exceptionally slow quiescent crystallization, which stands in sharp contrast to its polyester analog polypivalolactone that crystallizes rapidly. However, large-amplitude rapid stretching (strain ~600%, strain rate &#8805; 10 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), where the Deborah number based on the Rouse time of entanglement strand exceeds 1, triggers its crystallization, accelerating the crystallization rate by &amp;gt; 200,000 fold and achieving ~40% crystallinity within 1 s. This approach yields highly oriented fibers with outstanding mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 0.80 GPa, tensile strength of 120 MPa, breaking strain of 70%), high transparency, and the potential as a waveguide. We unveil PaGMTE's orthorhombic crystal structure (space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; = 1.075 nm, &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; = 0.622 nm, &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; = 3.618 nm) with antiparallel-packed homochiral 8&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; helices. The slow quiescent crystallization shall arise from entropic barriers associated with conformational adjustments toward the helix. Our findings highlight sulfur substitution's profound impact on polymer properties and prove that significantly enhancing the crystallization process holds promise for making PTE a high-value-added recyclable material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Meissner Effect and Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in Non&#8208;Topological 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates interface&#8208;induced superconductivity (Tc &#8764;12 K) with a robust Meissner effect and pronounced nonreciprocal transport in epitaxial 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures, where 1T&#8208;CrTe2 is a 2D ferromagnet, and FeTe is an antiferromagnetic metal. This finding establishes that topological surface states are not required to induce superconductivity in FeTe&#8208;based heterostructures. The 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provide a platform for exploring magnetically controllable superconducting diode effects.








ABSTRACT
Interface&#8208;induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T&#8208;CrTe2 layer, a 2D ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of &#8764;12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T&#8208;CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto&#8208;chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.

         <title>Directed Functionalization of Recombinant Spider Silk Nonwoven Membranes with Antibodies Using Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recombinant spider silk protein was functionalized by incorporating genetically encoded bio&#8208;orthogonal reactive azido&#8208;groups. The azido&#8208;functionalized proteins were produced in a scalable biotechnological process, and particles, films, as well as nanofibers were established as anchorage for fully functional antibodies via site&#8208;specific bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry. Spider silk nonwoven membranes decorated with antibodies constitute a cutting&#8208;edge tool for bio&#8208;separation processes as well as other applications.








ABSTRACT
Natural spider silk fibers are recognized for their outstanding mechanical properties. The production of underlying recombinant spider silk proteins in scalable quantities unlocks their potential for technical and biomedical applications. The recombinant spider silk technology further enables the introduction of new functions via genetic encoding. In the present study, the non&#8208;canonical amino acid L&#8208;azidohomoalanine is incorporated into the engineered Araneus diadematus fibroin 4, eADF4(C16), at positions explicitly defined by methionine codons in an N&#8208;terminal peptide tag. The azido&#8208;functionalized eADF4(C16) is processed into particles, films, or electrospun into nanofibers. As functional entities, high molecular weight molecules, such as antibodies, are modified with bio&#8208;orthogonal groups suitable for strain&#8208;promoted cycloaddition to the exposed azido&#8208;groups on the spider silk supports. The antibody&#8208;activated spider silk nonwoven meshes exemplarily show their applicability as bio&#8208;capturing membranes.

         <title>Toward a Consensus Characterization Protocol for Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We advocate a common consensus on accurate and standardized reporting of performance metrics in the field of organic thermoelectrics. We summarize prevalent issues in the literature and propose a pre&#8208;submission checklist to support the publication of reproducible results.








ABSTRACT
As the field of organic thermoelectrics advances toward maturity, an accurate and standardized reporting of performance metrics becomes essential to drive further progress and assess real&#8208;world viability. The common geometric form factors and material properties (conductivity, anisotropy, stability, etc.) differ from those of conventional bulk inorganic systems, and thus specific recommendations may apply. Herein, we compile prevalent points of concern in the reporting of thermoelectric performance for organic materials and devices. Moreover, we propose a list of critical factors and metrics that should be explicitly documented when reporting the performance of novel organic thermoelectric materials or devices.

         <title>Cold, Rapid, and Scalable Stamping of Aramid&#8208;Networked Viscoelastic h&#8208;BN Doughs for Complex Thermal Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly viscoelastic ceramic doughs composed of h&#8208;BN, Al2O3, and p&#8208;aramid fibers enable a rapid and scalable stamping&#8208;based process for constructing complex 3D thermal structures within 2 s. The resulting fiber&#8208;reinforced architectures exhibit shape integrity, improved thermal conductivity, and mechanical durability under extreme temperatures (&#8722; 50&#176;C to 200&#176;C). This approach offers a low&#8208;energy and efficient route for designing advanced thermal composites.








ABSTRACT
Extensive efforts have been made to fabricate complex 3D thermal management materials from hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using 3D printing and templating. However, these techniques are often energy&#8208;intensive, time&#8208;consuming, and inherently limited in scalability, owing to prolonged processing times and low throughput. Herein, we report a cold, rapid, and scalable stamping approach for constructing intricate, large&#8208;area h&#8208;BN&#8208;based thermal architectures. This strategy relies on forming highly viscoelastic h&#8208;BN doughs achieved through developing a para&#8208;aramid (p&#8208;aramid) fiber network and densification via a bimodal alumina mixture. The p&#8208;aramid network maximizes viscoelasticity with a minimal binder content (5.1 wt.%), enabling the doughs to exhibit pronounced plasticity during stamping while maintaining solid&#8208;like behavior after relaxation. Consequently, the doughs conform precisely to complex stamp geometries within 2 s under ambient conditions, preserving their high structural integrity. Scalability is demonstrated by stamping various 3D geometries exceeding 10&#160;cm, including cubes, cylinders, annular sectors, and honeycombs. Furthermore, the fiber&#8208;reinforced structures exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity (TC) and fatigue resistance under extreme temperatures (&#8722; 50&#176;C and 200&#176;C). Notably, the resulting architectures substantially improve the TC of the polymer composites when used as internal frameworks. This low&#8208;energy stamping strategy represents a paradigm shift in the processing of advanced thermal materials.

         <title>Charge Carrier and Spin Transport Properties in Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8211;A copolymers based on DPP building blocks with different alkyl side chains were synthesized, and the charge and spin transport properties were systematically investigated. The PFETs and OSVs based on DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 exhibited an electron mobility of 0.36 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, a MR value of 24.6 %, and a spin diffusion length as high as 66.9&#160;nm, respectively.








ABSTRACT
The organic active layer in organic spin&#8208;valves (OSVs) plays a vital role in regulating the device's performance, and the variations in molecular structure can significantly modulate their physicochemical properties. Herein, we synthesized two diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor copolymers with distinct alkyl side chains, namely DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 (with side&#8208;chain branching points closer to the conjugated skeleton) and DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C3. To evaluate the charge carrier transport properties, a polymer field&#8208;effect transistor and space charge limited current method based on the two molecules were conducted. The experimental results demonstrated that the DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 materials had a higher electron transport mobility. Moreover, the spin transport properties were also revealed by fabricating OSVs devices. In the OSVs with a 50&#160;nm interlayer, DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 exhibited a higher magnetoresistance (RM) value of up to 24.6 %. By fitting the polymer thickness dependence of the MR value at 10 K, a longer spin diffusion length and higher spin polarization injection efficiency were achieved for the DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 structure. We attributed the differences in charge and spin transport performance to the modulation of the film microstructure and energy levels by the alkyl side chains. This work studied the structure&#8208;property relationship of polymer OSVs from the perspective of side&#8208;chain engineering, providing valuable insights for the design of polymers with enhanced spin properties.

         <title>Macroscopic Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Single Crystals With Enhanced Piezoelectricity and Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we synthesize millimeter&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline Janus TMDC monolayers via an optimized atomic&#8208;layer substitution process. These obtained Janus TMDC exhibit exceptional spatial homogeneity, a record out&#8208;of&#8208;plane piezoelectric response (d33 &#8776; 2.10 pm/V), and high mobility (13 cm2&#183;V&#8722;1&#183;s&#8722;1), enabling their integration into advanced electronic and quantum devices. 








ABSTRACT
Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), featuring intrinsic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane symmetry breaking and permanent electrical dipole moments, open novel avenues for atomic&#8208;scale symmetry control. However, the absence of high&#8208;quality, macroscopic single crystals has hindered the exploration of their predicted intriguing properties and practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of millimeter&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal Janus TMDC monolayers, including MoSSe, WSSe, MoSeS, and WSeS. A combination of spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrical measurements confirms their exceptional crystallinity and spatial homogeneity over large areas. Notably, in contrast to conventional TMDC monolayers, the obtained Janus materials exhibit a strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane piezoelectric response, with record experimental &#119889;33 value of &#8764;2.06 pm/V for WSSe and &#8764;1.56 pm/V for MoSSe, representing an enhancement of over 15 times compared to previously reported experimental results. Moreover, field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) based on Janus MoSSe achieve an exceptional carrier mobility of &#8764;13 cm2&#183;V&#8722;1&#183;s&#8722;1, along with a device yield of 95% across an array of 100 devices. This work provides a feasible pathway for the scalable production of high&#8208;quality, single&#8208;crystal Janus materials and highlights their promise for integration into next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Ultrasound in Women's Health: Mechanisms, Applications, and Emerging Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As healthcare moves toward decentralization, ultrasound technologies are evolving from strictly imaging tools in clinical settings into versatile diagnostic and therapeutic platforms, with growing roles addressing women's health needs. This review highlights how ultrasound's underlying physical mechanisms can be harnessed to reduce disparities in women's health and improve outcomes for conditions historically underserved by conventional treatments.








ABSTRACT
Women's health remains inadequately served due to the historical predominance of males as the biological reference in medical research, leading to persistent sex&#8208;based gaps in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of disease. As healthcare moves toward decentralization, e.g., through the collection of person&#8208;generated health data, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics, and wearable devices, there is a critical need for tools tailored to women's unique conditions and presentations. Ultrasound technologies, recognized for their versatility and safety, have evolved from imaging to multifunctional platforms, with growing roles in diagnosis and therapy. Diagnostic ultrasound non&#8208;invasively assesses anatomical features and functional information, and therapeutic ultrasound can perform targeted interventions, including neuromodulation, immunomodulation, thermal ablation, and drug delivery. By exploring the fundamental physical principles of ultrasound, including acoustic streaming, cavitation, and thermal interactions, and linking these mechanisms to cellular and tissue responses, this review highlights the capability of ultrasound to address female&#8208;specific health disparities, especially in conditions that are undertreated or differentially expressed in women. Advancements in ultrasound technologies could significantly enhance clinical outcomes and improve the quality of life for women affected by conditions currently underserved by traditional medical interventions.

         <title>Evolution of Fe Single Atom in SiOC Ceramic Fibers and Their High&#8208;Temperature and Ultrathin Electromagnetic Wave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diffusion&#8208;dissolution mechanism of metal nanoparticles through an atomic&#8208;level engineering strategy was proposed to effectively control the evolution of Fe nanoparticles into Fe single atoms in SiOC ceramic fibers, and realized high&#8208;temperature and ultrathin electromagnetic wave absorption.








ABSTRACT
Accurately controlling the particle state and clarifying the relationship between particle structure and electromagnetic wave (EMW) are crucial for the development of high&#8208;performance EMW absorbers, which are essential to address the challenges of electromagnetic pollution and stealth technology. However, achieving both high&#8208;temperature resistance and low&#8208;frequency response in ceramic&#8208;based absorbers remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a metal nanoparticle diffusion&#8208;dissolution mechanism through an atomic&#8208;level engineering strategy to effectively control the evolution of Fe nanoparticles into Fe single atoms within SiOC ceramic fibers. By precisely optimizing the nitrogen source, the regulatory mechanisms of nitrogen doping on the evolution of iron species and the resulting electromagnetic behavior are systematically investigated. Due to the interaction between Fe single atoms (Fe&#8208;Nx) and adjacent N/C atoms, the local microstructure symmetry of SiOC is disrupted, which improves the polarization behavior of SiOC&#9472;Fe&#9472;CN and enables multiple polarization loss mechanism. Notably, the SiOC&#9472;Fe&#9472;CN&#8208;10 fiber exhibits exceptional absorption capability with a reflection loss (RL) of &#8722;59.33&#160;dB at an ultrathin thickness of 1.60&#160;mm and &#8722;58.0&#160;dB at a low&#8208;frequency of 5.93&#160;GHz. The effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reaches 5.5&#160;GHz at a thickness of 1.49&#160;mm. It also delivers remarkable high&#8208;temperature (&#8805;500&#176;C) EMW absorption performance, with an RL of &#8722;53.2&#160;dB at a low&#8208;frequency of 4.78&#160;GHz, which is the high performance of SiC&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature absorbers currently available. Moreover, the SiOC&#9472;Fe&#9472;CN&#8208;10 composite demonstrates favorable thermal diffusion properties. This concept of precise control over particle state provides a valuable strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance EMW absorbers and promotes the ongoing advancement of electromagnetic technology.

         <title>Excited State Opto&#8208;Ionic Reservoir Computing in Hybrid Perovskite Electrochemically&#8208;Gated Luminescent Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neuromorphic computing system exploiting opto&#8208;ionic modulation in lead halide perovskite microcrystals demonstrates high&#8208;dimensional reservoir dynamics with diffraction&#8208;limited node resolution. Leveraging ultrafast excited&#8208;state interactions, it achieves efficient computation (800 pJ/node&#8208;operation), robustly distinguishing 4&#8208;bit pulse sequences, paving the way for next&#8208;generation nanoscale, high&#8208;speed neuromorphic platforms based on photophysics.








ABSTRACT
We introduce a neuromorphic reservoir computing concept that leverages the complex interplay between electronic and ionic states in lead halide perovskites to run algorithms by harnessing opto&#8208;ionic modulation of photoexcited state populations. The system leverages the heterogeneous material microstructure and ultrafast spatio&#8208;temporal electronic state dynamics in perovskite microcrystals to generate a high&#8208;dimensional internal state space reservoir within the charge carrier populations. This reservoir exhibits complex, nonlinear, and adaptive behavior. The computation output is read directly from the photogenerated luminescence using diffraction&#8208;limited resolution with 106 nodes per cm2 and energy of 800 pJ per node&#8208;operation. The system performs robustly in distinguishing 4&#8208;bit pulse sequences with a mean accuracy of 87%, showcasing its potential for neuromorphic computing tasks.

     alt="Excited State Opto-Ionic Reservoir Computing in Hybrid Perovskite Electrochemically-Gated Luminescent Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neuromorphic computing system exploiting opto-ionic modulation in lead halide perovskite microcrystals demonstrates high-dimensional reservoir dynamics with diffraction-limited node resolution. Leveraging ultrafast excited-state interactions, it achieves efficient computation (800 pJ/node-operation), robustly distinguishing 4-bit pulse sequences, paving the way for next-generation nanoscale, high-speed neuromorphic platforms based on photophysics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce a neuromorphic reservoir computing concept that leverages the complex interplay between electronic and ionic states in lead halide perovskites to run algorithms by harnessing opto-ionic modulation of photoexcited state populations. The system leverages the heterogeneous material microstructure and ultrafast spatio-temporal electronic state dynamics in perovskite microcrystals to generate a high-dimensional internal state space reservoir within the charge carrier populations. This reservoir exhibits complex, nonlinear, and adaptive behavior. The computation output is read directly from the photogenerated luminescence using diffraction-limited resolution with 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; nodes per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and energy of 800 pJ per node-operation. The system performs robustly in distinguishing 4-bit pulse sequences with a mean accuracy of 87%, showcasing its potential for neuromorphic computing tasks. Our work reveals excited-state dynamics as a platform for exploring nanoscale computing with photoactive materials, also at high speeds using ultrafast photophysics, with large potential for the development of next-generation neuromorphic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as an Allosteric Regulator for Albumin&#8208;Responsive Therapy of Diabetic Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based synthetic receptor system is constructed to achieve customized biological functions using dual signaling gates. Ultrathin MOF nanosheets act as synthetic allosteric regulators of glucose oxidase, and serum albumin can activate the enzymatic activity. This MOF&#8211;enzyme system exhibits effective antibacterial activity and accelerated wound healing in a diabetic mouse model.








ABSTRACT
Customizing sense&#8208;and&#8208;respond programs that link natural actuations with user&#8208;defined cues has emerged as a promising strategy for modulating life processes. Herein, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based synthetic receptor system is presented for realizing customized biological functions using write&#8208;in signaling gates. This is achieved by integrating glucose oxidase into a series of engineered Zr&#8208;MOF nanosheets. Notably, ultrathin MOF architectures act as synthetic allosteric regulators by reshaping the interaction network at the enzyme&#8211;dimer interface, thus compromising electron&#8208;transfer efficiency during catalysis. Leveraging this mechanism, activity modulation is achieved by converting an endogenous yet functionally irrelevant protein, serum albumin, into an activating cue for enzymatic catalysis. This MOF&#8211;enzyme system with an albumin/glucose dual&#8208;gated output behavior exhibits effective antibacterial activity through kinetically controlled oxidative stress. The therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated in a diabetic wound&#8208;healing model. These findings establish MOFs as versatile modules for constructing synthetic receptor systems to advance their use in precision biomedicine.

         <title>Bond&#8208;Mode Engineering in Copper(I) Halides: From Excitation&#8208;Dependent Luminescence to High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging Screens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a bond&#8208;mode control strategy to design two distinct copper halides from one precursor. The ionic compound shows excitation&#8208;dependent dual emission, elucidated by TDDFT calculations. A large&#8208;area flexible film fabricated from this material achieves high&#8208;resolution, afterglow&#8208;free dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging when integrated into a commercial CMOS system, outperforming standard CsI:Tl screens.








ABSTRACT
Copper(I)&#8208;based halides are promising for X&#8208;ray detection due to their excellent scintillation efficiency and solution processability. However, the structure&#8211;property relationship remains elusive, and their practical viability for X&#8208;ray imaging is largely unverified. In this work, we employ a bond&#8209;mode control strategy to synthesize two compounds from the same amine precursor: ionic (4&#8209;ATHP)2CuI3 and coordinative (4&#8209;ATHP)4Cu4I4 (4&#8208;ATHP = 4&#8208;Aminotetrahydropyran), providing a model system to study their photophysics and underlying mechanism. (4&#8209;ATHP)2CuI3 adopts a unique 1D crystal structure with alternating arrangement of Cu2I6 dimers, which shows excitation&#8209;dependent dual emissions. Experimental and calculation results indicate that the dual emissions originate from the Cu2I6 dimer with a different Cu&#9472;Cu bond length. In contrast, the (4&#8209;ATHP)4Cu4I4 shows single emission centered at 635&#160;nm, in which the organic component contributes to the excited state. The ionic (4&#8209;ATHP)2CuI3 achieves a much higher light yield (55&#160;923 photons/MeV) than that of the coordinative counterpart (31&#160;866 photons/MeV). Furthermore, a large&#8209;area flexible film (15 &#215; 20&#160;cm2) based on (4&#8209;ATHP)2CuI3 delivers a spatial resolution of 20&#160;lp/mm. Critically, integrating this film into a CMOS imager demonstrates superior dynamic imaging without afterglow, outperforming the commercialized CsI: Tl screen. This study not only deciphers the bond&#8209;mode&#8209;dependent photophysics but also validates a commercial&#8209;grade scintillator, paving the way for high&#8209;performance X&#8209;ray imaging materials.

         <title>Probing Cellular Activity Via Charge&#8208;Sensitive Quantum Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new quantum sensing modality detects shifts in zero&#8208;field splitting caused by charge rearrangement with diamond nanocrystals in response to cellular activity. These electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven effects provide an alternative to temperature&#8208;based interpretations, enabling real&#8208;time, single&#8208;cell readout of inflammation. This approach reframes NV spectroscopy as a tool for monitoring biologically induced electrochemical changes.








ABSTRACT
Nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real&#8208;time single&#8208;cell sensing with far&#8208;reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional&#160;challenge. Here, we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment&#8208;induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge&#8208;induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment&#8208;induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle&#8208;induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramifications for the critical discussion surrounding single&#8208;cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.

         <title>High Concentration Antibody Formulations Enabled via Thermostable Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report concentrated (90&#8208;230 mg/mL) antibody solutions for patient&#8208;compliant subcutanoues injection through incorporation of ionic liquids (ILs). Our approach establishes an IL&#8208;dependent effect that reduces protein&#8208;protein interactions, thereby lowering formulation viscosity to levels suitable for injection (&lt;20 cP). The resulting IL&#8208;antibody formulations achieve 4 months of room&#8208;temperature stability and a 5&#8208;fold improvement in serum adsorption compared with saline controls.








ABSTRACT
Concentrated protein formulations have garnered significant attention in both commercial and research domains due to their relevance in patient&#8208;favored, subcutaneous administration. However, these formulations face challenges such as high viscosity and elevated potential for aggregation, primarily driven by intermolecular electrostatic and hydrophobic protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Achieving an acceptable injectability profile (&lt;20 cP) often necessitates the incorporation of excipients that mitigate PPIs through shielding effects. Current clinical formulations exhibit a narrow colloidal stability window, largely due to molecular changes under physical and thermal stress, whilst also suffering from suboptimal bioavailability (50%&#8211;85%). To address these limitations, we harness the utility of ionic liquids (ILs) that offer tunable charge and amphiphilicity profiles&#160;as a means to simplify and stabilize protein formulations. Herein, we synthesized biocompatible choline and organic acid&#8208;based ILs&#160;and assessed their viscosity profiles with IgG antibody at both high (90 mg/mL) and ultra&#8208;high (230 mg/mL) concentrations. Functional and structural stability assays conducted over 4 months at room temperature identified promising IL candidates for in vivo studies at both IgG concentrations. Through a multi&#8208;tiered screening strategy, we generated thermally stable, ultra&#8208;high concentration antibody solutions that achieved a five fold improvement in serum absorption of polyclonal IgG compared to their saline solutions.

         <title>Stabilizing Iodine Redox Mediator Enables High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an efficient redox mediator, I&#8722; species can catalyze the sluggish sulfur conversion reaction of zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries, while the additional introduction of ammonia&#8208;oxidized lignin convoys iodine&#8208;loss&#8208;free and polyiodide shuttle&#8208;free behavior during cycling process through strong chemisorption capability for polyiodides and remarkable thermodynamic condition for iodine conversion reaction, thus guaranteeing ultra&#8208;stable iodine redox mediator and high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries (AZSBs) are regarded as promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and low&#8208;cost energy storage devices. However, sluggish conversion reaction of sulfur&#8208;loading cathode and notorious polyiodide shuttle of iodine redox mediator in aqueous electrolytes severely hinder the development of AZSBs. Herein, ammonia&#8208;oxidized lignin (AOL) is introduced as electrolyte additive to stabilize the redox mediator function of ZnI2, which effectively facilitates the reversible sulfur conversion reaction (S8&#8596;ZnS). As demonstrated, AOL monomer is rich in active hydroxyl/amide moieties, and exhibits strong chemisorption capability for polyiodides as well as remarkable thermodynamic condition for iodine conversion reaction (I3&#8722;&#8596;I&#8722;), which significantly blocks the ZnI2 mediator loss and I3&#8722;/I5&#8722; shuttle behavior during cycling, thereby maximizing the catalytic effect of ZnI2 for S8&#8596;ZnS reaction and high&#8208;performance AZSBs. Consequently, the optimized AZSBs deliver high specific capacity of 1532 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, and high reversible capacity of 326.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 320 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Even if assembled into pouch batteries with high sulfur loading of 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, high capacity of 514.5 mAh g&#8722;1 is still maintained after 134 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights to accelerate sulfur conversion reaction kinetics through stabilizing the redox mediators of AZSBs.

         <title>Arch Shaped Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Wave Energy Harvesting and Corrosion Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs an Arch&#8208;TENG for wave energy harvesting, addressing TENG's marine corrosion and low&#8208;frequency inefficiency issues. It outperforms CS&#8208;TENG, shows stable performance, and its array form enables low&#8208;power supply and seawater cathodic protection, expanding marine TENG applications.








ABSTRACT
As a renewable energy source, wave energy exploitation reduces fossil energy pollution and aids carbon neutrality. Traditional electromagnetic generators (EMGs) have low low&#8208;frequency conversion efficiency, limiting large&#8208;scale application. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), invented in 2012, offer a new way for wave energy harvesting with advantages of wide material selection, low&#8208;frequency adaptability, light weight and low cost, but are restricted by marine corrosion and inefficient low&#8208;frequency capture. This work designed an arch&#8208;structured TENG (Arch&#8208;TENG) that captures wave energy via bending. Compared with CS&#8208;TENG, its charge transfer increases by over 450%, with a charge output density of 12.7&#160;nC&#160;cm2 at 0.5&#160;Hz and stable performance after 26&#160;h tests. The array&#8208;integrated device capable of large&#8208;scale wave energy harvesting is designed based on the Arch&#8208;TENG. It was verified that this device can not only stably power low&#8208;power electronic devices but also be used for cathodic protection tests of carbon steel Q235 in seawater, which will provide more practical applications of TENG in marine environments.

         <title>Single&#8208;Fiber Design for Higher Performance Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highlighting the paradigm shift toward single&#8208;fiber artificial muscles, this review elucidates how intrinsic actuation is encoded through precise molecular engineering. We systematically examine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material systems to reveal key structure&#8208;property relationships. This roadmap offers strategies for achieving high&#8208;performance actuators for next&#8208;generation soft robotics and intelligent wearables.








ABSTRACT
Artificial muscles are essential components in the advancement of next&#8208;generation soft robotics, biomedical devices, and adaptive wearables. While conventional fiber&#8208;based actuators often rely on multi&#8208;material assemblies and complex interfacial engineering, their performance is limited by structural heterogeneity and low&#8208;efficient energy coupling. This review highlights the emerging paradigm of single&#8208;fiber or in&#8208;fiber artificial muscle design, where actuation functionality is intrinsically encoded within the molecular architecture of individual fibers. We comprehensively examine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material systems such as phase&#8208;transition materials, block copolymer self&#8208;assemblies, mechanically interlocked polymers, covalent supramolecular hybrids, and woven polymer networks. Particular emphasis is placed on the structure&#8211;property&#8211;function relationships that govern the actuation strain, stress output, response speed, and long&#8208;term durability. We also propose a unified framework for evaluating single fiber actuator performance based on key metrics and critically discuss manufacturing challenges, scalability, and integration with smart sensing system. This review provides a roadmap for molecular design of the high&#8208;performance artificial muscle, offering new strategies for intelligent actuation and soft material systems in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Puncture&#8208;Needle&#8208;Integrated Optical Fibers and NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Activated Thermosensitive Hydrogels for Deep&#8208;Seated Tumor Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
We propose a drug&#8208;device integrated platform combining a stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogel (SW8@Gel) with SPOF, assisted by a puncture needle. Syringe injects SW8@Gel (1.0&#160;mg mL&#8722;1, 25&#160;&#181;L) in situ through a flexible catheter, and SPOF emits 360&#176; divergent near&#8208;infrared II (110&#160;mW, 1064&#160;nm) excitation light. This integration enables deep&#8208;adaptive photothermal ablation while maintaining temperature (44&#176;C) without off&#8208;target damage.








ABSTRACT
Deep&#8208;seated tumors are difficult to treat because of their location, conventional treatment resistance, and limited light penetration during photothermal therapy (PTT). Interstitial PTT with &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; laser irradiation using optical fibers (OFs) offers a promising solution. This study proposes a drug&#8208;device integrated platform assisted by a puncture needle combining stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with a spherical&#8208;tip polymer OF (SPOF) to overcome dual challenges: Inadequate photothermal agent retention and insufficient optical penetration. The injectable thermosensitive hydrogel (SW8@Gel), composed of Pluronic F127 and aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene&#8208;derived SW8 nanoparticles, rapidly undergoes sol&#8211;gel transition at 38&#176;C, facilitating localized and sustained delivery of the photothermal agent. The flexible low&#8208;bending&#8208;loss SPOF emits 360&#176; divergent near&#8208;infrared II (1064&#160;nm) light from its spherical tip, allowing single&#8208;fiber illumination of deep&#8208;seated tumors (penetration &gt;10&#160;cm) in complex biological environments. Integrating these components enables depth&#8208;adaptive tumor ablation. Compared to other methods, the SPOF/SW8@Gel combination demonstrates the lowest frequency and shortest duration for PTT of deep&#8208;seated tumors and achieves superior efficacy, with a 90% tumor regression rate in mice models and no off&#8208;target damage due to enhanced heating uniformity and reduced systemic toxicity. This platform offers a transformative clinically viable solution for precise ablation of deep malignancies, bridging advanced photonics and targeted oncotherapy.

         <title>Exciton Diffusion&#8208;Suppressed Scintillator for Ultrafast and High&#8208;Resolution Radiography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we demonstrate a general fabrication of large&#8208;area PEA2PbBr4 nanowire scintillation screens. By spatially confining excitons within nanowires, the radioluminescence decay time is drastically shortened to &#964;1/e = 1.87&#160;ns, while the aligned waveguide structure enables high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, opening avenues for ultrafast radiation detection.








ABSTRACT
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillator PEA2PbBr4 has emerged as a promising fast scintillator for applications in ultrafast radiation imaging, transient diagnosis of pulsed radiation fields, and medical radiodiagnosis. However, its performance is limited by notably prolonged decay times under high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray excitation due to inefficient radiative recombination of sparsely distributed bulk excitons. Furthermore, the difficulty in growing and processing high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;area single crystals hinders the development of scalable scintillation screens. Here, we report a general fabrication strategy for large&#8208;area uniform scintillation screens that synergistically enhances the decay time and imaging resolution under X&#8208;ray excitation by suppressing bulk exciton diffusion in PEA2PbBr4. By leveraging the spatial confinement of nano&#8208;porous templates, we reduce the dimensionality of PEA2PbBr4 from bulk single crystals to uniform 1D nanowires, leading to spatial localization of bulk excitons. This localization significantly shortens the radioluminescence decay time from 11.85 to 1.87&#160;ns. Meanwhile, the regularly aligned periodic optical waveguide structure enables directional propagation of scintillation photons along the nanowires, yielding high spatial resolution imaging (57.1 lp/mm at MTF = 0.2). This work provides a viable approach for advancing the application of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillators in ultrafast radiation imaging.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adaptive Periodontal Ecosystem Engineered With Molybdenum&#8208;Based Nanozyme&#8208;Embedded Composite Hydrogel for Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Precision Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
The proposed Ce6@PEG&#8208;MoOx&#8208;loaded hydrogel exhibits self&#8208;adapted responsiveness, target&#8208;specific SOD&#8208; and CAT&#8208;like activities to amplify PDT, while avoiding off&#8208;target harms including chemodynamic or photothermal stimulation. The hydrogel enables noninvasive PAI for periodontitis monitoring, powerfully eliminates biofilms in the anaerobic niches, and activates PI3K/AKT to promote comprehensive tissue restorations. This theranostic closed&#8208;loop ecosystem is a promising smart platform for comprehensive periodontitis treatment.








ABSTRACT
Periodontitis, the sixth most significant global pandemic driven by bacterial biofilms, is characterized by cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and histolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) accumulation, resulting in progressive periodontal destruction. Current therapies are limited by diagnostic inaccuracy, incomplete biofilm elimination, and inadequate tissue regeneration. To address these challenges, an injectable theranostic Ce6@PEG&#8208;MoOx&#8208;loaded hydrogel through facile construction is proposed, encompassing an intelligent closed&#8208;loop for comprehensive periodontitis management. After being injected into periodontal pockets, the hydrogel adheres to tissues and responds to microenvironmental MMPs, realizing on&#8208;demand therapeutic release. By integrating photoacoustic imaging, the hydrogel facilitates noninvasive, precise and reproducible measurement of porcine periodontal pocket depths, enabling periodontitis diagnosis and monitoring. Subsequently, released oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich MoOx nanozyme mitigates cellular oxidative stress, generates O2 to enhance Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic eradication of deep&#8208;seated biofilms, and scavenges residual ROS after bactericidal process. Notably, this system avoids off&#8208;target ROS generation and photothermal damage, preserving surrounding tissues including dental pulp, thus exhibiting exceptional light&#8208;controlled ROS&#8208;modulation. Furthermore, released Mo activates the PI3K/AKT pathway to upregulate angiogenic factors, reprograms M2 macrophages polarization, and stimulates osteogenesis of periodontal stem cells. Altogether, this self&#8208;adaptive ecosystem integrates diagnosis, monitoring, biofilm debridement, and tissue regeneration, establishing a closed&#8208;loop precision therapy for periodontitis with significant clinical potential.

         <title>Phase Transition Regulation Mechanisms in P2&#8208;Type Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of elemental doping on phase transition inhibition can be attributed to the enhanced cationic potential within the alkali or transition metal layers, which strengthens interactions between cation and oxygen including O&#8722;AM&#8722;O shielding effect and TM&#8722;O hybridization. Under such conditions, the NaO6 octahedron formation can be suppressed through the strong inhibition on oxygen layer slipping.








ABSTRACT
Layered sodium transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2) are one of the promising cathodes for sodium ion batteries due to the high energy density and advantages of large&#8208;scale manufacturing. Recently, P2&#8208;type oxides cathodes, as an important family of NaxTMO2, has been paid much attention because the oxygen redox chemistry can further boost the energy density of the cathodes through the special configurations of &#8220;Na&#8722;O&#8722;Li&#8221; or &#8220;Na&#8722;O&#8722;Mg&#8221;. However, these materials suffer the phase transition due to highly depleting Na+ in the structure, when the oxygen redox chemistry is triggered. Past of the decade has witnessed the effective strategies to cope with the phase transition issues through elements doping, but the universal rule behind the elements doping strategies is still a mystery, which is essential to provide guidance to design the advanced cathodes. In this perspective, we present a discussion on phase transitions during charge/discharge process in P2&#8208;type oxides, drawing from the research within our group and recent publications. Phase transition process in P2&#8208;type cathodes is analyzed through the lens of structural geometry evolution toward intrinsic physical/chemical properties. Governing principles and regulation mechanisms of phase transition are elucidated as well, which can give contributions to the rational design of high&#8208;performance P2&#8208;type oxide cathodes.

         <title>Localized Solvent&#8208;Anchored Carboxylate Ester Electrolyte Enables Wide Temperature and Fast Charging Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs a local solvent molecular anchoring strategy based on the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction between methyl propionate (MP) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC) to anchor free FEC onto MP. This effectively reduces FEC decomposition and HF generation, enabling operation across an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;40&#176;C to 70&#176;C and at an ultra&#8208;high rate of 80C under ambient conditions.








ABSTRACT
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) have attracted considerable interest due to their abundant raw material supply and high energy density. Nevertheless, realizing fast charging and long&#8208;term cycling stability over a wide temperature range remains a considerable challenge. In this work, we propose a novel strategy that integrates molecular anchoring with weak solvation by modulating the dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between methyl propionate (MP) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). This approach effectively stabilizes the free solvent ratio, suppresses the irregular dendrite formation under low&#8208;temperature and fast&#8208;charging conditions, and minimizes HF generation at elevated temperatures, thereby enhancing electrolyte chemical stability and Na+ desolvation kinetics. These synergistic enhancements enable rapid Na+ transport and facilitate the formation of a robust interface layer across a broad temperature range. Consequently, Na3V2(PO4)3||Na cells demonstrate stable operation from &#8722;40&#176;C to 70&#176;C and sustain over 10&#160;000 cycles at 80&#176;C, outperforming previous reports on wide&#8208;temperature fast&#8208;charging systems. Notably, the cells achieve a capacity retention of 98.58% after 1200 cycles at &#8722;20&#176;C and 85.93% after 1500 cycles at 60&#176;C. Moreover, pouch cells configured with this electrolyte exhibit superior all&#8208;weather adaptability and fast&#8208;charging capability. This work offers valuable insights for developing high&#8208;performance SMBs operable under broad&#8208; temperature conditions.

         <title>Reversible Oxygen Redox in Li&#8208;Rich Mn Based Cathodes Achieved by Regulating the Local Environments of Bulk and Surface Lattice Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxides deliver high capacities by harnessing both cationic and anionic redox reactions, yet their practical application is severely limited by the instability of lattice oxygen redox (L&#8208;OR). Here, we disentangle the distinct roles of bulk and surface lattice oxygen in L&#8208;OR, demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously regulating their local environments, and elucidate the critical importance of such regulation in stabilizing L&#8208;OR.








ABSTRACT
Lattice&#8208;oxygen redox (L&#8208;OR) has been widely considered a viable approach to attain high&#8208;capacity cathodes for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, achieving highly reversible L &#8208; OR remains challenging due to the intrinsic chemical instability of lattice oxygen. As such, stabilizing the lattice oxygen becomes necessary for improving the performance of cathode materials with oxygen redox chemistry. In this study, the distinct properties of both bulk and surface lattice oxygen are systematically studied in a model Li&#8208;rich layered oxide material (LRMO, i.e., Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2) by employing different techniques. We find that, in the bulk, distortions in octahedral coordination geometry are closely correlated with variations in the electronic structure, and the substitution of Li ions with protons in a subsurface layer enhances the stability of surface lattice oxygen by altering its coordination environment. By jointly regulating the local environments of both bulk and surface lattice oxygen, the initial Coulombic efficiency is remarkably improved from 73.88% to 91.72%. Moreover, the modified LRMO demonstrates an impressive cycle stability, which realizes a capacity retention of 95.9% after 500 cycles at 250&#160;mA g&#8722;1.

     alt="Reversible Oxygen Redox in Li-Rich Mn Based Cathodes Achieved by Regulating the Local Environments of Bulk and Surface Lattice Oxygen"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-rich Mn-based oxides deliver high capacities by harnessing both cationic and anionic redox reactions, yet their practical application is severely limited by the instability of lattice oxygen redox (L-OR). Here, we disentangle the distinct roles of bulk and surface lattice oxygen in L-OR, demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously regulating their local environments, and elucidate the critical importance of such regulation in stabilizing L-OR.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lattice-oxygen redox (L-OR) has been widely considered a viable approach to attain high-capacity cathodes for next-generation batteries. However, achieving highly reversible L - OR remains challenging due to the intrinsic chemical instability of lattice oxygen. As such, stabilizing the lattice oxygen becomes necessary for improving the performance of cathode materials with oxygen redox chemistry. In this study, the distinct properties of both bulk and surface lattice oxygen are systematically studied in a model Li-rich layered oxide material (LRMO, i.e., Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by employing different techniques. We find that, in the bulk, distortions in octahedral coordination geometry are closely correlated with variations in the electronic structure, and the substitution of Li ions with protons in a subsurface layer enhances the stability of surface lattice oxygen by altering its coordination environment. By jointly regulating the local environments of both bulk and surface lattice oxygen, the initial Coulombic efficiency is remarkably improved from 73.88% to 91.72%. Moreover, the modified LRMO demonstrates an impressive cycle stability, which realizes a capacity retention of 95.9% after 500 cycles at 250&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work demonstrates that&#160;rationally-designed local environments of lattice oxygen can effectively stabilize the oxygen redox in Li-rich cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perspective on Aqueous Batteries: Historical Milestones and Modern Revival</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review retraces the development of aqueous batteries from classical Zn&#8208;MnO2 chemistry to modern Zn and Ni systems, correlating voltage, capacity, and electrolyte formulation with practical performance. By mapping historical success and failure onto current and future research directions, it identifies guiding principles that steer the design of safe, low&#8208;cost, and application&#8208;oriented aqueous energy storage.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous batteries have played a pivotal yet fluctuating role in the evolution of electrochemical energy storage. From their foundational success in lead&#8211;acid and nickel&#8208;based chemistries to their eclipse by lithium&#8208;ion batteries, aqueous systems were long regarded as technologically inferior due to limited energy density and poor cycling stability. However, the urgent demand for safe, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable storage has sparked a renaissance, fueled by breakthroughs in electrolyte engineering and advanced electrode materials for both anodes and cathodes. This review revisits the historical trajectory of commercialized aqueous batteries, extracting lessons from past successes and failures while highlighting the technological advances that now enable extended voltage windows, improved cycling stability, and scalable manufacturing. We argue that the future of aqueous batteries lies not in directly competing with lithium&#8208;ion in high&#8208;energy applications, but in complementing them across grid&#8208;scale storage, uninterruptible power supplies, and decentralized energy systems where safety, cost, and recyclability are paramount. By connecting history with current progress, we reflect on how these insights reshape expectations for the next generation of aqueous batteries and their role in a more diversified and sustainable energy storage landscape.

         <title>Residual Strain Evolution in Perovskite Solar Cells throughout Fabrication to Operation: Mechanisms, Characterization, and Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in residual strain engineering for perovskite solar cells, with a focus on the origins of strain during fabrication and operation, characterization methods, and strain regulation strategies. Besides, the impact of residual strain on device stability and efficiency is evaluated. Key factors influencing strain distribution are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing high&#8208;performance devices.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 27%, but further improvements of both PCEs and stability are needed for commercialization. One of the key factors hindering their development is the unpredictable residual strain in perovskites. The unstable octahedral structure of the perovskite cage leads to easy changes in bond lengths, bond angles, and crystal structure. It in turn generates, accumulates, and causes the non&#8208;uniform distribution of residual strain, ultimately affecting device performance. Therefore, given the versatility and precise tunability, residual strain engineering provides an effective pathway to optimize the performance of PSCs. This review summarizes the causes of residual strain during device fabrication and operation, qualitative/quantitative/auxiliary characterization methods, and various effective strain regulation methods in the past two years. Finally, unresolved scientific issues and future research directions in strain engineering are discussed. This comprehensive review aims to provide researchers with the latest advances in strain engineering, deepen fundamental understanding of strain effects, and eventually help enhance the performance of PSCs.

         <title>Dynamic Upconversion Manipulation via Cross&#8208;Relaxation Engineering for Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise manipulation of cross&#8208;relaxation between specific energy levels, enabled by a dual&#8208;wavelength cooperative strategy, allows for dynamic control of upconversion luminescence in Er3+&#8208;Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Tm3+, Ho3+, Yb3+) doped NaYS2. Based on switchable luminescent colors and lifetime imaging, programmable logic gate arrays are implemented to construct a dynamic&#8208;random&#8208;visual encryption system for advanced optical information security.








ABSTRACT
Lanthanide ions (Ln3+) doped upconversion originates from their diverse 4f electron transitions. However, the direct manipulation of excited&#8208;state electron populations for dynamic emission modulation remains challenging. In this study, a cross&#8208;relaxation control paradigm, enabled by dual&#8208;wavelength cooperative excitation, is developed for dynamic upconversion engineering. The Er3+&#8208;Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Tm3+, Ho3+, Yb3+) doped NaYS2 platform precisely populates the dual&#8208;target energy levels via cross&#8208;relaxation pathways under cooperative excitation. This approach enables dynamic green&#8208;to&#8208;red luminescence switching while amplifying the red emission (&#8764;20&#8208;fold) by accelerating the cross&#8208;relaxation kinetics; Er3+ acts as the photon harvester, and Ln3+ serves as the cross&#8208;relaxation mediator to redirect population fluxes. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that this phenomenon originates from the unique properties of the low phonon energy, unique layered structure with a large interionic spacing, and high refractive index of the NaYS2 host. Finally, programmable upconversion logic gate arrays are implemented to develop a dynamic&#8208; random&#8208;visual encryption system for optical information security. This study establishes a novel paradigm for upconversion manipulation with unprecedented capabilities for advanced information technologies.

         <title>Flexible Hygroscopic Electronics for Real&#8208;Time Moisture Sorption&#8208;Desorption Monitoring and Smart Humidity Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a humidity&#8208;regulation flexible hygroscopic electronics with ultra&#8208;sensitive properties using TEMPO&#8208;CNF polymeric gel. This is a new idea of combing the hygroscopic function with the sensory one together for active, real&#8208;time, sensitive detection of moisture sorption&#8208;desorption process and sensory warning, which establishes a new paradigm for smart humidity regulation systems by synergistically integrating moisture capture/release with in situ monitoring capabilities.








ABSTRACT
Humidity regulation plays a critical role in precision electronics, advanced storage, thermal, and energy management applications. While real&#8208;time monitoring of water molecule dynamics during moisture sorption and desorption processes could provide crucial hygroscopic parameters for smart humidity regulation, conventional gravimetric methods suffer from low tracking speed, limited accuracy, and an inability to perform in situ detection. Here, we report a flexible hygroscopic electronics (FHE) capable of simultaneously regulating environmental moisture and dynamically monitoring sorption&#8208;desorption processes through water&#8208;mediated resistive changes in confined space. The targeted electronics exhibit exceptional performance, including a fast hygroscopic response of &#8764;2.1 s at 90% RH, cycling stability, and stable sorption&#8208;desorption properties over more than 50 cycles. By engineering a series of modular array&#8208;based sensors, we achieve adjustable humidity control in enclosed spaces according to application&#8208;specific requirements. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the intelligent electronic array successfully maintains stable humidity conditions even in damaged equipment enclosures (&gt;3.5&#160;h) and provides rapid sensory alerts. This work establishes an intelligent core&#8208;shell FHE system, that absorbs unexpected moisture through a bio&#8208;based hygroscopic core and simultaneously monitors the water sorption/desorption behaviors by a thin conductive shell, which allows remote warning for potential seal risk of equipment in an early stage.

This work introduces a hollow carbon nanoreactor with a self&#8208;confinement strategy for lithium&#8208;chlorine (Li&#9472;Cl2) batteries. By trapping active Cl2 species within its mesopores using size&#8208;selective micropores, it achieves a record capacity of 8000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an ultrahigh current density of 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable Li&#9472;Cl2 batteries represent a promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technology. However, the open&#8208;pore structure of conventional cathode materials poses a fundamental challenge by permitting the uncontrolled diffusion of Cl2 into the electrolyte, resulting in severe local concentration dilution that plagues rate capability and specific capacity. Herein, a self&#8208;confinement strategy by hollow carbon nanoreactors (HCNRs) is proposed to regulate the local concentration of active Cl2 species with micropores (&#8776;0.8&#160;nm) on their walls. These micropores act as size&#8208;selective barriers, allowing to block the escape of larger active Cl2 species (kinetic diameter &#8776;0.86&#160;nm), and mesopores (30&#8211;50&#160;nm) function as nanoreactors that concentrate active Cl2 species. This design enables the as&#8208;assembled Li&#9472;Cl2 cell to achieve an ultrahigh current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 during the charge/discharge process and a record&#8208;breaking specific capacity of 8000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (9 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), superior to the reported literature. This hollow nanoreactor design highlights the potential of Li&#9472;Cl2 batteries as high&#8208;power and energy&#8208;dense systems, paving the way for their practical application.

         <title>High Charge Carrier Mobility in Non&#8208;Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;conjugated 3D COF constructed via boronate ester linkages from tetraphenylene and pyrene&#8208;based monomers is reported, which exhibits a high charge carrier mobility of 14 &#177; 1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








ABSTRACT
&#960;&#8208;Conjugation, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and long&#8208;range order play a central role in determining charge transport efficiency in organic materials. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which uniquely integrate these key structural and electronic features, have emerged as a promising platform for the development of novel electrically conductive organic materials. Intraframework &#960;&#8208;conjugation has shown to play a key role in improving charge carrier mobility. Here, we report Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;2, a 3D COF lacking extended intraframework &#960;&#8208;conjugation, yet exhibiting a remarkable charge carrier mobility of 14 &#177; 1&#160; cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;2 adopts an 11&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia topology, featuring a tight interframework &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which enables efficient charge transport in the absence of intraframework &#960;&#8208;conjugation.

         <title>Scalable Growth of Quasi&#8208;1D TiS3 Nanoribbons for High&#8208;Temperature Flexible Strain Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethanol&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition produces vertically aligned TiS3 nanoribbons (NRs) with controllable aspect ratios, facilitating easy transfer. These TiS3 NRs maintain high conductivity from 80 to 593 K. Flexible strain sensors made from TiS3 NR networks stably detect microstrains as low as 40 at high temperatures of 773 K.








ABSTRACT
Quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;1D) van der Waals MX3 transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), have emerged as a compelling material platform due to their unique quantum confinement effects and anisotropic properties. Nevertheless, the narrow growth window and extreme sensitivity to growth parameters make it challenging to synthesize TMTCs via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Herein, we demonstrate an ethanol&#8208;assisted CVD method for the scalable growth of TiS3 nanoribbons. This approach utilizes the combination of ethanol with TiCl4 and S powder to form a Ti source precursor, enabling the high yields of TiS3 nanoribbons with a thickness as low as 10 nm and lengths on the micrometer scale (140&#177;30 &#181;m, aspect ratio of approximately 260). Moreover, the nanoribbons exhibit epitaxial vertical alignment on substrates, facilitating the versatile transfer to arbitrary target substrates. The single TiS3 nanoribbon exhibits high conductivity (&#963;293 K = 3.1 &#215; 104 S/m) from 80 to 593 K. Flexible strain sensors based on TiS3 nanoribbon networks demonstrate a high gauge factor of 135.3, a wide strain detection range (40&#8211;7400 &#956;&#949;), and strong tolerance to temperatures up to 773 K. This strategy provides a unique pathway for synthesis of TMTCs, providing essential material support for the development of high&#8208;performance flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Alleviating the Misalignment of Fe Single Sites Relative to Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces to Achieve High Performance Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relatively hydrophilic sandwiched ionomer/catalyst structure induces the formation of a continuous proton transfer network and the reduction of oxygen transportation. The unique structure results in the 80% increase of site utilization in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, with power density comparable to the currently reported best Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst.








ABSTRACT
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), represented by Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C, are promising alternatives to Pt in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, the molecular&#8208;scale misalignment of the SACs at the triple&#8208;phase interfaces (TPIs) has led to extremely low atomic efficiency, making it difficult to translate the high activity of SACs into the actual cell performance. Therefore, the design of the catalyst layer structure to increase the density of reactant&#8208;accessible single sites is crucial for the application of SACs in PEMFCs. Here, we report tailored catalyst layer structure induced by hierarchical porous Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Cpot catalysts with tuned surface hydrophilicity. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic (MD) reveals macropores and tuned surface hydrophilicity act as molecular&#8208;level &#8220;on&#8208;switches&#8221; that pull Nafion/water domains deep inside, collapsing the classic transport bottlenecks for both O2 and H3O+. Combinatory spectroscopic evidence confirms the superiority of the structure in forming continuous mass transfer channels, thereby increasing site utilization of Fe by 80%. Exceptional Pmax at 1581&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 is achieved, and capable of sustaining 60k AST with 63% performance retained. This study establishes the first design rule that links pore hierarchy and surface chemistry to TPI activation.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Ru&#8211;NiFe Cathode Catalysts for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis at Large Electrode Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical calculations guidance, a large&#8208;scale electrocatalyst with uniform activity was fabricated through an energy&#8208;efficient approach. By tuning properties like hydrogen intermediate adsorption/desorption strength, the catalyst achieves high activity and long&#8208;term stability. These large&#8208;area electrodes, with high activity, long&#8208;term stability, and scalable production, are highly significant for industrial hydrogen production via water electrolysis.








ABSTRACT
A significant gap persists between advanced catalyst synthesis in laboratories and the industrial requirements for water electrolysis. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving electrode scalability, high catalytic activity, and long&#8208;term stability. Through theoretical simulation screening, we synthesized a free&#8208;standing cathode catalyst composed of Ru clusters anchored on a NixFeyOOH substrate via Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges. Advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#8211;NiFe catalyst achieves efficient catalytic activity due to Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges, fine&#8208;tuning the electronic structure and enhancing catalytic energetics, while Ru cluster introduction increases the number of active sites and modulates hydrogen intermediate adsorption/desorption strength. The as&#8208;prepared Ru&#8211;NiFe electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction delivers ultralow overpotentials of 5&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains stable operation at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1000 h. A large&#8208;scale (19&#160;&#215;&#160;19 cm2) anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer (AEM&#8211;WE) based on Ru&#8211;NiFe shows a low cell voltage of 2.98&#160;V at 10 A and stable operation for 2800 h. This study provides valuable insights into designing large&#8208;area electrodes with high activity, long&#8208;term stability, and scalable production for industrial AEM&#8211;WE applications.

&lt;p&gt;Based on theoretical calculations guidance, a large-scale electrocatalyst with uniform activity was fabricated through an energy-efficient approach. By tuning properties like hydrogen intermediate adsorption/desorption strength, the catalyst achieves high activity and long-term stability. These large-area electrodes, with high activity, long-term stability, and scalable production, are highly significant for industrial hydrogen production via water electrolysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant gap persists between advanced catalyst synthesis in laboratories and the industrial requirements for water electrolysis. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving electrode scalability, high catalytic activity, and long-term stability. Through theoretical simulation screening, we synthesized a free-standing cathode catalyst composed of Ru clusters anchored on a Ni&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Fe&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;OOH substrate via Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges. Advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#8211;NiFe catalyst achieves efficient catalytic activity due to Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges, fine-tuning the electronic structure and enhancing catalytic energetics, while Ru cluster introduction increases the number of active sites and modulates hydrogen intermediate adsorption/desorption strength. The as-prepared Ru&#8211;NiFe electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction delivers ultralow overpotentials of 5&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains stable operation at 500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for over 1000 h. A large-scale (19&#160;&#215;&#160;19 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) anion-exchange-membrane water electrolyzer (AEM&#8211;WE) based on Ru&#8211;NiFe shows a low cell voltage of 2.98&#160;V at 10 A and stable operation for 2800 h.

         <title>Combinatorial Assembly of Biomimetic Janus Membrane with Multiscale Architectures for Guided Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combinatorial assembly strategy for constructing a continuous Janus membrane with multiscale architectural features inspired by biological materials. The membrane features an asymmetric design, comprising a compact layer with a Bouligand architecture and a porous layer that recapitulates the trabecular structure of cancellous bone, enriched with hydroxyapatite crystals. The combinatorial assembly strategy offers a promising pathway toward multifunctional regenerative materials.








ABSTRACT
Guided bone regeneration (GBR) has gained significant attention in the field of bone tissue engineering. However, designing an effective barrier membrane that simultaneously meets the mechanical and biological requirements at the soft&#8211;hard tissue interface remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we&#160;introduce a combinatorial assembly strategy to construct a continuous Janus membrane with multiscale architectural features inspired by biological materials. Structurally, the membrane features an asymmetric design, comprising a compact layer with a Bouligand architecture that incorporates amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) to enhance mechanical strength and prevent soft tissue infiltration, and a porous layer that recapitulates the trabecular structure of cancellous bone, enriched with hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals to promote cellular adhesion and osteoinduction. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo results show that the membrane not only exhibits excellent biocompatibility and barrier function but also significantly enhances osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration in a cranial defect model. This work demonstrates that integrating diverse fabrication techniques enables the creation of functionally efficient GBR membranes with hierarchical structures, offering a promising pathway toward multifunctional regenerative materials.

         <title>Aequorea Victoria&#8208;Inspired Covalent Anchoring Enables Water&#8208;Resistant and Scalable Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Aequorea victoria, a covalent anchoring strategy using amphiphilic cellulose acetate enables water&#8208;resistant and mechanically adaptable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The covalently immobilized chromophores exhibit long&#8208;lived afterglow even in water, while the thermoplastic and hydroplastic nature of cellulose allows scalable fabrication of 1D/2D/3D architectures for information encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.








ABSTRACT
Developing organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials stable in aqueous environments remains highly challenging due to the facile quenching of triplet excitons. Inspired by the protective &#946;&#8208;barrel architecture of the green fluorescent protein (Aequorea victoria), the study presented a covalent anchoring strategy based on an amphiphilic cellulose derivative (cellulose acetate) to construct water&#8208;resistant and scalable RTP materials. Covalent immobilization of chromophores within the rigid framework yields dynamic photoactivated afterglow, extending the lifetime from 2.1 to 946.4&#160;ms. The resulting films retain bright RTP even under water while exhibiting water&#8208;mediated tunable mechanical properties. Furthermore, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer with Rhodamine B enables full&#8208;color RTP spanning blue to orange. Benefiting from the inherent thermoplasticity and hydroplasticity of cellulose acetate, the RTP cellulose derivatives are readily processed into diverse 1D/2D/3D architectures and applied in multilevel information encryption. This covalent anchoring strategy offers a sustainable and commercially viable pathway to robust polysaccharide&#8208;based RTP, opening new opportunities for optoelectronics, security, and eco&#8208;friendly photonic technologies.

         <title>Bright 2D Polar Perovskite Scintillator with Ultrafast Decay by Suppressing Free Carrier Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous polarization in polar RP perovskites suppresses the free&#8208;carrier recombination and promotes exciton formation, leading to the enhancement of exciton population and light yield. Meanwhile, the ultra&#8208;low dielectric constant accounts for the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling and ultrafast luminescence decay. The synergy effects enable the ultrafast scintillation and high light yield in polar perovskite scintillator.








ABSTRACT
High light yield and ultrafast decay time are highly demanded for scintillators in sensitive, rapid radiation detection and imaging, but both properties can hardly coexist in a scintillator so far. Herein, we report a design principle for spontaneous polarization&#8208;enhanced scintillation in 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites. As anticipated, the (4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexanecarboxylate)2PbBr4 (APB) perovskite displays high light yield up to 19&#160;660 photons/MeV and a lifetime of 0.90&#160;ns. Combining the experimental and computational results, we demonstrate that enhancement of dielectric screening effect and suppression of free carrier recombination are responsible for the ultrafast decay time and high light yield, respectively. Moreover, the practical applications for fast neutron imaging and flash X&#8208;ray radiography are successfully demonstrated with excellent spatial resolutions of 2.4 and 31 lp/mm, respectively. In addition, the potential for PET technique is verified by shorter CTR values than (LuxY1&#8208;x)2SiO5: Ce (LYSO). This work will open up a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance ultrafast scintillators for practical applications in biomedical and nuclear detection techniques.

         <title>Universal Fluorine&#8208;Free Proton Exchange Polymers for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Fuel Cells Operable Under Severe Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to excellent physical and chemical stability, the novel designed fluorine&#8208;free polymers with aliphatic&#8208;chain backbones (SP&#8208;PAC12&#8208;QP) are regarded as promising and universal alternatives to perfluorosulfonic acid membranes. Their performances are further improved by physical reinforcement, where the fuel cell performance under high temperature and combined chemical and mechanical durability (109,580 cycles) of the produced SP&#8208;PAC1267&#8208;QP&#8208;4.5&#8208;PE&#8208;7 outperforms commercially stabilized Nafion XL.








ABSTRACT
Fluorine&#8208;free proton exchange membranes (PEMs) could offer a promising alternative to perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes, addressing challenges such as negative environmental impact, high cost, and limited performance under harsh conditions. However, fluorine&#8208;free PEMs inherently suffer from low proton conductivity due to weaker acidity and poorly developed hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase&#8208;separation, along with limited mechanical and chemical stability. Here, we report a novel and universal fluorine&#8208;free PEMs featuring aliphatic chains in the backbone, which for the first time to dissolve all the issues mentioned, such as 2.6 times higher proton conductivity than PFSAs. Further physical reinforcement (SP&#8208;PAC1267&#8208;QP&#8208;4.5&#8208;PE&#8208;7) effectively extended their lifetime to 335.1 times of the original SP&#8208;PAC1267&#8208;QP&#8208;3.5, and exceeded 1.3 times of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fluorinated Nafion XL reinforced membrane, in the severely accelerated durability test. Furthermore, the fluorine&#8208;free PEMs exhibited outstanding performance than Nafion XL, especially at elevated temperatures, proving their practical applicability as a promising alternative to the fluorinated counterparts.

         <title>Rewriting Polymer Fate via Chemomechanical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a life&#8208;like &#8220;living&#8221; polymer platform that can grow, degrow, and reprogram its properties after fabrication. By integrating mass transport, reversible polymerization, and controlled catalysis, the material achieves on&#8208;demand changes in size, shape, and mechanical properties. Such dynamic behavior has enabled self&#8208;growable electronics, transformable soft robots, and regenerating devices, paving the way for reprogrammable applications.








ABSTRACT
How can synthetic polymers be endowed with the continuous, life&#8208;like ability to grow, degrow, heal, and alter their chemical and physical properties after fabrication? This study addresses this question by coupling theory and experiment to create an open&#8208;system &#8220;living&#8221; polymer platform that integrates mass transport, reversible polymerization, chain exchange, and evolving elasticity into a fully chemomechanically coupled network. Controlled transport, reaction, and stresses enable continuous growth and degrowth with microscale control enabled by light&#8208;activated catalysts. Their chemical composition can be reprogrammed on demand, tuning modulus by up to two orders of magnitude to either stiffen or soften the material. These capabilities enable self&#8208;growable electronics, transformative soft robots, and on&#8208;site damage&#8208;regenerating devices, establishing a foundation for sustainable, endlessly reprogrammable polymers.

         <title>Optimizing f&#8208;d Hybridization Descriptor in Rare&#8208;Earth Oxides for Efficient Sulfur Catalysis in all Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth oxides enable strong f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization at the catalyst&#8208;sulfur interface, which enhances interfacial electronic coupling and Li+ transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This enlarged electron cloud overlap effectively lowers kinetic barriers for sulfur redox. The hybridization strength is quantitatively captured by If&#8208;d, which serves as an effective descriptor for sulfur reaction kinetics and electrochemical performance.








ABSTRACT
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) offer high theoretical energy density and intrinsic safety, yet their development is hindered by sluggish sulfur redox kinetics at the solid&#8211;solid interfaces due to the weak orbital overlap and discontinuous electronic coupling at these regions. Here, we propose rare&#8208;earth oxide catalysts that accelerate the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) in ASSLSBs by strengthening the f&#8208;d&#8208;p hybridization at catalyst&#8208;sulfur&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. We first define a hybridization&#8208;strength factor, If&#8208;d, derived from the electron densities of occupied 4f and unoccupied 5d states, which quantifies interfacial hybridization and directly correlates with the metal&#8208;sulfur coupling strength. Catalysts with higher If&#8208;d exhibit lower activation energy (Ea) and the overpotential (&#951;) during SRR, validating its role as a structure&#8208;activity descriptor for catalyst screening and design. Guided by this descriptor, the screened Lu2O3 catalyst minimizes kinetic barriers (0.088&#160;eV), and thus enabling stable cycling for over 20&#160;000 cycles at 5 C, and an ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 14.48 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature, among the highest performances reported for ASSLSBs. This work fills the mechanistic gap between interfacial orbital interactions and battery performance and paves the way toward catalyst design for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life ASSLSBs.

         <title>Synergistic Ternary Heterostructures Cathode With &#8220;Electron&#8208;Complementation&#8221; Bridging Interfaces Enable High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary all&#8208;component&#8208;active heterostructures featuring electron&#8208;complementation interfaces were synthesized via a versatile overpotential&#8208;driven strategy, enabling high capacity of 492 mAh g&#8722;1 and robust cycling stability up to 9000 cycles, outperforming any individual integrated component. The synthesis strategy has been validated across typical vanadium/bismuth/manganese&#8208;based oxide&#8208;chalcogenide&#8208;metal ternary heterostructures, demonstrating broad universality and impressive performance advances.








ABSTRACT
Constructing multiphase heterostructures by interweaving characteristically complementary oxides, sulfides, and metals is promising for advancing aqueous battery electrodes, yet versatile synthesis and heterointerface insight pose significant challenges. Traditional methods often suffer from specificity optimization and non&#8208;redox&#8208;active substrate dependency, compromising performance. Herein, we overcome these limitations with a versatile overpotential&#8208;driven synthetic strategy that enables precisely engineering ternary all&#8208;component&#8208;active heterostructures for compromise&#8208;free high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries. Analysis of localized structure and first&#8208;principles calculations in the model integrated V2O5@Cu2S@Cu heterostructure strongly suggest the formation of amorphous/crystalline bridging interfaces with electronic complementarity, which facilitates deep charge transfer and superior kinetics. In situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the synergistic multi&#8208;electron redox merging anion coordination, collectively enabling the all&#8208;component redox activity and preferred rate capability. As results, V2O5@Cu2S@Cu delivers a high reversible capacity of 492 mAh g&#8722;1, enabling 9000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 with 90% capacity retention, greatly surpassing those of any single component. Such synthesis method has been further extended to other accessible vanadium&#8208;based, manganese&#8208;based and bismuth&#8208;based ternary heterostructures, representing an important yet unexplored path to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance aqueous battery cathodes featuring elaborate heterointerface manipulation.

In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202510618), Woojin Park, Yonghun Kim, Byungjin Cho, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV dec&#8722;1 in graphene/IGZO cold source transistor arrays. Linear density of states with Dirac cone in graphene suppress the Boltzmann thermal tail, while high&#8208;k HfO2 dielectric having small body factor enhanced gating efficiency, hereby further reducing SS. An average SS of &#8776;46.4 mV dec&#8722;1 is achieved in the array, enabling ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronics.

         <title>Polymers for Biomedical Applications: the Quest for Treating Cardiovascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modifications of stents can improve their endothelialization, which reduces the risk for thrombosis and restenosis. Biodegradability ensures no foreign body material remains over time, while shape memory expansion reduces damage to the arterial wall. Finally, advanced processing methods enable personalized treatments. The convergence of all these research fields could lead to improved stents for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide. Current treatments using balloon angioplasty, stents, and bypass grafts still suffer from significant risks of restenosis and thrombosis. This review outlines key research areas where polymers are used in treatments for cardiovascular diseases, highlighting developments from the last decade. Designed to serve both experts and non&#8208;experts in the field, it requires little prior knowledge of the subject. A description of the cardiovascular system, cardiovascular diseases, current treatments, and their limitations are first introduced. After providing a detailed overview of the basic and advanced requirements for new treatments, recent advances in key research fields where polymers are applied to achieve these goals are highlighted. While surface modifications aim to improve endothelialization and/or prevent neointimal proliferation, shape memory polymer stents are intended to reduce damage to the arterial wall upon expansion. Research has also focused on developing biodegradable polymer stents to avoid any remaining material in the artery after healing. Finally, various advanced processing methods enable the production of polymeric personalized stents. By addressing various research areas in a single review, the interplay among them is highlighted, demonstrating that their convergence is essential for optimizing treatments and improving human quality of life.

Abstract
Thin&#8208;film batteries (TFBs) are vital for powering miniaturized electronics and Internet of Things(IoT) devices, offering compact size, long cycle life, and high safety. Utilizing solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thin&#8208;film deposition, TFBs integrate seamlessly with microelectronic systems. Advances in fabrication methods such as magnetron sputtering and atomic layer deposition, adapted from semiconductor manufacturing, have enhanced scalability, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical performance. Direct on&#8208;chip integration simplifies design and boosts energy efficiency, making TFBs key for next&#8208;generation electronics. Coupling TFBs with energy&#8208;harvesting technologies like solar cells or thermoelectrics enables self&#8208;sustaining systems. However, challenges remain, including low areal energy density and limits to further miniaturization. Progress in materials science, electrochemistry, and microfabrication is needed to overcome these barriers. This review summarizes recent TFB advances, classifying and analyzing materials, and detailing deposition processes and their refinements. It also addresses issues in processing, packaging, and operation, and describes analytical tools for evaluating structural and chemical stability. Finally, it highlights future application prospects and unresolved questions, providing a blueprint for ongoing research and guiding innovation toward wider adoption of TFB technology.

Direct on-chip integration simplifies design and boosts energy efficiency, making TFBs key for next-generation electronics. Coupling TFBs with energy-harvesting technologies like solar cells or thermoelectrics enables self-sustaining systems. However, challenges remain, including low areal energy density and limits to further miniaturization. Progress in materials science, electrochemistry, and microfabrication is needed to overcome these barriers. This review summarizes recent TFB advances, classifying and analyzing materials, and detailing deposition processes and their refinements. It also addresses issues in processing, packaging, and operation, and describes analytical tools for evaluating structural and chemical stability. Finally, it highlights future application prospects and unresolved questions, providing a blueprint for ongoing research and guiding innovation toward wider adoption of TFB technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferroelectrics Hybrids: Harnessing Multifunctionality of 2D Semiconductors in the Post&#8208;Moore Era</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, the state of art of ferroelectric hybrid systems&#8212;combining ferroelectrics, 2D semiconductors, and molecular switches is presented&#8212;as next&#8208;generation platforms for high&#8208;density, multifunctional electronics. By discussing 2D FeFET applications, nanoscale material downscaling, M3D integration, and emerging ferroelectrics, it highlights strategies to overcome scaling bottlenecks and unlock device&#8208;level multifunctionality.








Abstract
The rise of big data in today's computing has highlighted the significant limitations of von Neumann architectures for data storage and processing. Concurrently, the downscaling of silicon&#8208;based transistors while retaining low power efficiency and high system reliability has become increasingly challenging. By adopting a post&#8208;Moore approach, this Review proposes the use of hybrid systems comprising ferroelectric materials, 2D semiconductors, and functional molecular switches to respond to current demands for simultaneous high integration density and multifunctional performance. The representative applications of 2D ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) are reviewed and advances in shrinking ferroelectric domain walls at the (sub)nanometer scale are highlighted. The incorporation of molecular switches to enable multimodal device programmability is explored and the implementation of monolithic 3D (M3D) integration to boost chip&#8208;level density and system functionality is discussed. Finally, a forward&#8208;looking vision is presented for future transistors built upon novel ferroelectric platforms. Taken together, this triple&#8208;hybrid paradigm offers a compelling path to transcend Moore's law, paving the way for next&#8208;generation electronics with unprecedented functions and performance.

Abstract
Leveraging the artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm for the innovation of advanced polymeric materials is emerging as an exciting frontier in the cross&#8208;disciplinary material community. The big data analysis and prediction capabilities of AI accelerate the discovery and development of polymers with tailored properties. The concept of AI&#8208;assisted polymer design involves a paradigm shift from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimentation to a more efficient, data&#8208;driven methodology. To date, various AI algorithms have been developed for the structural design and composition optimization of advanced polymeric materials. It mainly involves three steps, including material information digitization and database construction, establishment of AI prediction models, and AI&#8208;based design and optimization. However, the intrinsic data characteristics and intricate relationships between multiscale structure and polymer property pose tough data and modeling challenges. Advanced approaches are proposed to address these challenges, such as digitalizing polymer multiscale structures, implementing multitask and multimodal learning methods, and inverse design and automatic optimization. This review aims to provide an insightful overview of the current state of AI&#8208;assisted polymer design, highlighting the polymer characteristics and corresponding challenges, achievable strategies, and development direction.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Engineered Rubidium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyro&#8208;Phototronic effect in centrosymmetric 2D RbPb2Cl5 nanocrystals have been observed as a function of halide deficiency. These have lead heptrahedra and prepared following a template approach of cation exchange. Using ligand chemistry, different morphologies of these nanocrystals are synthesized and their pyro&#8208;phototronic response recorded from visible to near IR spectral region.








Abstract
Cesium lead halide has been extensively studied as efficient materials for optoelectronic device applications. Beyond Cs(I), the exploration of other inorganic A&#8208;site monovalent cations remains limited, though Rb(I) stands out as a potential alternative whose role in colloidal nanocrystals is largely unexplored. Here, Rb (I) is employed as an effective A&#8208;site cation in forming monoclinic&#8208;phase RbPb2Cl5, where Pb (II) heptahedrally coordinated. A template&#8208;mediated cation exchange strategy is employed where 0D Rb4CdCl6 used as host nanocrystals. Upon introduction of Pb (II), fast Cd to Pb ion exchange triggers and 2D RbPb2Cl5 in rhombic prism, hexagonal prism or hexagonal platelet&#8208;shaped nanocrystals are formed depending on the reaction conditions. Further to explore the optoelectronic properties, photo response measurements are carried out which exhibit significant pyro&#8208;photocurrent response from these nanocrystals even under ultra&#8208;low&#8208;intensity light illumination (7 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2) across ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Despite its centrosymmetric structure, RbPb2Cl5 generates pyro&#8208;photocurrent due to surface halide deficiencies, supported by DFT which shows surface polarization of |&#120665;P| = 0.173 C&#160;m&#8722;2. These findings highlight the pivotal role of Rb (I) in stabilizing these nanostructures and open a new avenue for their application in advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Promoting Active Hydrogen Supply and Nitrate Adsorption by Disordering Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disordered tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; (CAO) by Co doping promotes water dissociation for hydrogen supply and formation of oxygen vacancy for hydrogen storage, enabling high&#8208;efficiency deoxygenation and hydrogeneration of nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
Modulating the local coordination environment can optimize the electronic structure and reaction pathway of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR), beneficial to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. Herein, a disordered tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; (CAO) is proposed by Co doping as an efficient catalyst. Theoretical calculations reveal Co doping induces strong Co&#8208;Al orbital interactions at octahedral sites, which lowers the energy barrier for water dissociation, and meanwhile, Oxygen vacancies (Vos) induced by Co doping not only enhance NO3&#8722; adsorption, but also serve as reservoir sites for transient *H storage, thereby promoting hydrogenation steps. The synergistic Cu&#8208;Vo interaction facilitates the conversion of *NO3&#8211; to *NO2&#8211; and the interfacial electron transfer between Co and Cu suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The substitution of 30% Co in CAO (Co&#8208;3) nanofibers creates the most Vos, resulting in a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.00% and a substantial NH3 yield rate of 27.86 mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1cat. in neutral media. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional long&#8208;term electrochemical durability and chemical stability. Thermodynamic analysis unveils the potential&#8208;determining step of *NO2 to *NO for Co&#8208;3 possesses a low free energy of only 0.05 eV, highly superior to 0.29 eV for the pristine CAO.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Actuated Hot&#8208;Carrier/Polarization Triggers Catalysis to Coordinate Staphylococcus aureus Ribosome Stalling and Treat Deep&#8208;Seated Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medical microwave actuation of Seebeck&#8208;type and pyroelectric&#8208;type tandem reactors generates hot&#8208;carrier and quick&#8208;change polarization, respectively, by triggering the temperature, while synergizing with microwave&#8208;induced bacterial ribosome stalling to efficiently eliminate deep&#8208;seated bacterial infections.








Abstract
Due to the low energy of microwaves (MW), MW dynamic therapy (MWDT) remains inefficient in treating deep&#8208;seated infections. Here, an MW&#8208;actuated hot&#8208;carrier/polarization&#8208;triggers catalysis strategy is proposed via two types of tandem reactors to amplify the efficacy of MWDT. By combining MW&#8208;thermosensitive carbon nanotube (CNT) with thermal&#8208;electricity conversion materials, the Seebeck&#8208;type and pyroelectric&#8208;type MW&#8208;thermal&#8208;electricity tandem reactors (CNT&#8208;Bi2Te3 and CNT&#8208;ZnO) are prepared. The CNT converts MW into a local heat source and rapidly heats Bi2Te3 or ZnO to activate hot&#8208;carrier or polarization for high&#8208;yield reactive oxygen species production to treat deep&#8208;seated infections. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal MW stalls the ribosomes of Staphylococcus aureus, thereby hindering its proliferation. Therefore, the biocompatible tandem reactor synergizes with bacterial ribosome stalling to demonstrate a targeted bactericidal effect in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, a series of antimicrobial products is developed for precise and efficient antimicrobial therapies.

         <title>LDI, A Lipid Droplet Inhibitor, Disrupts Lipid Accumulation and Modulates Hepatic Lipid Profiles in Fatty Liver</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet inhibitor (LDI), templated with large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica and functionalized with PKC&#945; C1A and lipase, targets lipid degradation in fatty liver. The LDI maintains stable association with lipid droplets, thereby suppressing their formation and expansion. It significantly alleviates liver abnormalities in vivo and effectively regulates hepatic lipid metabolism.









Abstract
Excessive lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes drives the progression of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), often leading to inflammation and fibrosis. As obesity and metabolic syndrome rise, MASLD has become a global concern, spurring research into effective treatments. Here, the design of a Lipid droplet inhibitor (LDI) is presented, incorporating porous silica nanostructures along with PKC&#945; C1A and Candida Rugosa lipase, aimed at directly degrading lipid droplets. Through its dual&#8208;functional design, this nanostructure captures diacylglycerol using PKC&#945; C1A while hydrolyzing triacylglycerol into smaller molecular fragments via the lipase. Notably, the amphiphilic biomolecules in LDI facilitate the formation of a Pickering emulsion, ensuring stable localization at the lipid&#8208;water interface for efficient interaction with lipid droplets. LDI reduces lipid droplet formation and triglyceride levels in palmitic acid&#8208;treated HepG2 cells. In a high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;induced MASLD model, it alleviateds liver pathology and, lowered injury scores by up to 84%. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis confirmed that LDI effectively modulated the hepatic lipid profile, suggesting its potential as a nanoplatform for counteracting lipid droplet accumulation.

         <title>Implanting Metal&#8208;Oxo Single Sites on Metal Surface: A Path to Geometric and Electronic Synergy in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding isolated metal&#8211;oxo sites onto a metallic surface enables synergistic covalent hybridization and geometric regulation, thereby optimizing the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates.








Abstract
Promising and diverse strategies have emerged for creating isolated catalytic active sites, such as single&#8208;atom catalysts and single&#8208;atom alloys, aiming at achieving efficient and selective catalysis. However, the structural tunability of isolated active sites has largely been restricted to their chemical compositions, primarily due to the absence of a higher&#8208;order structure associated with these isolated atoms. To address this, an additional degree of freedom is introduced by incorporating functional groups onto these active sites. Specifically, metal&#8208;oxo single sites are implanted onto metal surfaces to achieve geometric and electronic synergy. As a demonstration of this concept, bismuth single sites are embedded onto a palladium surface, promoting p&#8208;d orbital hybridization and facilitating the formation of terminal Bi&#8208;oxo species. This cooperative interaction optimizes the adsorption strength of intermediates through both covalent electronic hybridization and geometric interactions. The Bi&#8208;oxo&#8208;embedded Pd hybrid nanostructure, created through consecutive etching and displacement deposition, enables the simultaneous optimization of key intermediates for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. Remarkably, this hybrid nanostructure achieves specific and mass activities 11.03 and 8.45 times greater than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates high stability and achieves a power density of 280 mW cm&#8722;2 in direct methanol fuel cells.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;in&#8208;Liquid Prints: High&#8208;Density Biochemically Encoded Information Preserved in Microdroplet Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel approach for encoding and storing information in the liquid state in microdroplet arrays. These liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid prints are generated by a droplet printing system capable of dynamically setting the composition of each droplet pixel. Information in the form of color images, QR codes, text characters, words and basic programmes are biochemically written into micro&#8208;liquid patterns.








Abstract
Liquids are dense repositories of information, challenged only by how well their compositions are defined, preserved, accessed, or measured. The precise spatial patterning of solutes within a bulk liquid is challenging since diffusion disperses local concentrations and thereby attenuates functionality. Herein, a new concept is introduced for writing and preserving information in the liquid state through liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid microdroplet array printing. This technology produces fine resolution, 2D liquid structures, composite of indexed water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet pixels each with a precise composition, a high spatial resolution and a tight inter&#8208;pixel pitch. With extreme control over droplet composition and by applying standard and custom encoding schemes, various forms of information are written biochemically such as images, QR codes, text characters and words. As a composite material, reversible phase transitions between dissolved liquid and crystallized solid states control information encryption and decryption. Compared to current liquid printing and chemical encoding paradigms, ours introduces a fundamentally new precedent for deterministically programming information release, exchange or decay without stimuli or physical processing. Further computational principles such as error correction and information storage are demonstrated. These micro&#8208;liquid patterns are relevant to any application based on precise liquid handling such as information theory, materials design and biological assays.

         <title>Regulating H&#8208;/J&#8208;Aggregation and Suppressing Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling of Fused Ring Electron Acceptors Enable 20.51% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An analogue of L8&#8208;BO, L8&#8208;OPh, is developed to efficiently regulate molecular H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregation, suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, and enforce intermolecular interaction, prolonging exciton lifetime and exciton diffusion length of the L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieve the remarkable power conversion efficiency of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), among the highest values for OSCs so far.








Abstract
The limited exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic photovoltaic materials puts organic solar cells (OSCs) into a harsh position to compromise exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport, impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The exciton behavior of organic semiconductors is strongly related to the molecular alignment. Herein, an analogue of L8&#8208;BO, L8&#8208;OPh with benzyl&#8208;alkyl inner side chains is developed to blend with L8&#8208;BO and successfully regulate its molecular alignment.

&lt;p&gt;An analogue of L8-BO, L8-OPh, is developed to efficiently regulate molecular H-/J-aggregation, suppress exciton-vibration coupling, and enforce intermolecular interaction, prolonging exciton lifetime and exciton diffusion length of the L8-BO:L8-OPh blend. Therefore, D18:L8-BO:L8-OPh based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieve the remarkable power conversion efficiency of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), among the highest values for OSCs so far.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited exciton diffusion length (&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) of organic photovoltaic materials puts organic solar cells (OSCs) into a harsh position to compromise exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport, impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The exciton behavior of organic semiconductors is strongly related to the molecular alignment. Herein, an analogue of L8-BO, L8-OPh with benzyl-alkyl inner side chains is developed to blend with L8-BO and successfully regulate its molecular alignment. Incorporating L8-OPh into L8-BO enhances the H-aggregation tendency, weakens exciton-vibration coupling, and enforces the intermolecular interaction of L8-BO:L8-OPh blend films. Such endows the L8-BO:L8-OPh blend film with improved exciton lifetime and larger exciton diffusion coefficient to prolong the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; up to 22.1&#160;nm, compared to L8-BO (16.5&#160;nm). Besides, L8-BO:L8-OPh blend films acquire increased crystallinity and better crystal quality to afford lower trap density, prolonged charge carrier lifetime and higher mobilities in D18:L8-BO:L8-OPh ternary devices. Therefore, D18:L8-BO:L8-OPh ternary OSCs achieve the remarkable PCE of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), which is among the highest PCEs in OSCs so far. It highlights the importance of finely regulating molecular alignment of organic photovoltaic materials to prolong the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Trace Chlorine&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Activation for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

Trace Cl&#8722; incorporation into Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8722;&#948; weakens metal&#8211;oxygen covalency to activate lattice oxygen, enhances CO2 adsorption, promotes bulk O2&#8722; transport, and accelerates CO2 reduction kinetics, collectively enabling a current density of 2.02 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.5 V with &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency and outstanding 500 h stability for high&#8208;temperature CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis.








Abstract
Tuning lattice oxygen activity in perovskite oxides (ABO3) offers a promising approach to overcome the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and stability in redox reactions. However, precise modulation and mechanistic understanding of lattice oxygen activation remain elusive under high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis conditions. Herein, a novel anion activation strategy is proposed by incorporating trace chloride ions (Cl&#8722;) into the O&#8208;sites of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8722;&#948; perovskite forming an oxychloride cathode. This Cl&#8722; substitution activates lattice oxygen reactivity by weakening Mo&#8722;O/Fe&#8722;O covalency, thereby facilitating the formation and redistribution of oxygen vacancies, accelerating bulk oxygen ion transport, enhancing CO2 adsorption and carbonate intermediate formation, and ultimately promoting CO2 reduction kinetics. As a result, the oxychloride cathode achieves a 60.2&#8211;80.8% enhancement in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis, reaching 2.02 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.5&#160;V with &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency, while maintaining exceptional stability of 500 h. This work establishes a new paradigm of O&#8208;site anion engineering to unlock lattice oxygen activity for electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Creep Adhesive Tapes via Trapped&#8208;Entanglement&#8208;Regulated Topological Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under continuous external force, creep deformation occurs on the adhesive joint insidiously, which will gradually result in failure. Authors introduce topological trapped entanglements to build a permanent yet compliant polymer network, effectively improving the long&#8208;term adhesion performance of adhesive tapes under static load condition.








Abstract
Adhesive tapes with high adhesion strength are critical in applications from structural bonding, biomedical devices, to flexible electronics. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by creep&#8212;time&#8208;dependent deformation under sustained stress&#8212;which leads to irreversible failure in long&#8208;term applications. While transient non&#8208;covalent interactions are widely engineered to enhance short&#8208;term energy dissipation, they inherently compromise creep resistance due to their dynamic reversibility. Herein, this persistent challenge is addressed by designing anti&#8208;creep adhesive tapes through precise topological regulation of polymer networks. By systematically comparing linear, covalent&#8208;crosslink, and trapped&#8208;entanglement&#8208;dominated architectures, the entanglement&#8208;stabilized networks are demonstrated to achieve a three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in creep rate while maintaining strong interfacial adhesion. The unique combination of long&#8208;chain entanglements and spare crosslinks enables efficient elastic energy storage without sacrificing tackiness, resolving the trade&#8208;off between dynamic dissipation and permanent mechanical integrity. This work provides both a mechanistic framework for understanding creep in adhesive materials and a scalable strategy for developing durable, high&#8208;performance polymer adhesives.

         <title>Optically Driven Eutectogel Pyroelectric for Efficient Deformable Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an elastomeric, self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a polyvinyl alcohol pyroelectric eutectogel, which achieves an ultrabroad spectral response, high responsivity and detectivity, as well as a fast response time. Its versatile applicability is demonstrated in encrypted optical communication, conformal image sensing, and diffuse reflection imaging.








Abstract
Ionic gels are emerging stimuli&#8208;response elastomers for biomimetic sensors in diverse fields. Photoresponse ionic gels can detect light as a photoreceptor to emulate biological vision for artificial retina and skin. However, the existing ionic gel&#8208;based photosensors face limited response speeds and detecting sensitivity due to inefficient ion transport. Here, a high&#8208;performance elastomeric photodetector made of polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based pyroelectric eutectogels, containing polar ions and crystalline domains, is reported, which exhibits a high pyroelectric coefficient and enables efficient optical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion via spontaneous polarization, even under 30% tensile strain. The resulting self&#8208;powered photodetector features a broad spectral response spanning 365&#8211;1300&#160;nm, with photoresponsivity, detectivity, and response time of 42.06&#160;mA W&#8722;1, 7.65 &#215; 1010 Jones and 24/35&#160;ms at 455&#160;nm, respectively. The photodetector array enables light&#8208;encrypted communication and sensitive optical imaging.

         <dc:description>
Starting with an overview of the concepts, classifications, principles, and fabrication methods for nanopores, this review presents a comprehensive picture of the broad application scenarios for nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule sequencing (SMS), particularly for precision diagnosis. Additionally, it encourages researchers and readers to explore potential directions for enhancing nanopore&#8208;based SMS beyond typical applications by focusing on the intrinsic properties of nanopores.








Abstract
Nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule sequencing (SMS) is a powerful tool for acquiring detailed heterogeneous information on critical building blocks of life, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and a wide array of biomolecules, at the single&#8208;molecule level. Real&#8208;time current&#8208;intensity fluctuations corresponding to the passage of target molecules through nanopores enable long&#8208;read length, high&#8208;throughput, and high&#8208;accuracy detection, thus meeting the stringent demands of precision diagnosis. Herein, a concise overview of various principles and fabrication methods is provided for nanopores, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in nanopore&#8208;based DNA and protein sequencing, revealing innovative approaches for effectively capturing and translocating target molecules, and rapid and accurate identification. Further typical cases of nanopore&#8208;based SMS applications in precision diagnosis are analyzed, focusing on genetic disorders, infectious diseases, cancers, and abnormal post&#8208;translational modifications to highlight the clinical potential of nanopores. Additionally, the inherent limitations and challenges of nanopores in terms of sensitivity, detection range, and selectivity are discussed and present the latest strategies for enhancing nanopore performance. Finally, perspectives are provided on the future of nanopore&#8208;based SMS, particularly at the intersection of microfluidic devices, surface functionalization, and machine learning, to facilitate more diverse and advanced developments in this field.

         <title>Engineering of Stabilized Ru&#8208;Based Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing the stabilized Ru&#8208;based proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a significant step for the low&#8208;cost production of green hydrogen. The stability degradation mechanism of the whole system, and the mutual effects of core components are systematically sorted out, with an emphasis on synergistic optimization strategies. Aiming to provide a guidance for the design of high&#8208;stable and low&#8208;cost Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising blueprint for the industrial production of green hydrogen in the short term, but its large&#8208;scale deployment is extremely constrained by the high cost and low storage of Ir&#8208;dependent anode catalysts. Ru&#8208;based PEMWE, employing Ru&#8208;based composites as anode catalysts, has emerged as a promising alternative to Ir&#8208;dependent PEMWE in recent years, offering lower electrolytic voltages and improved cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the practical application of Ru&#8208;based PEMWE is hindered by stability degradation involving Ru&#8208;based catalyst dissolution, membrane chemical degradation, corrosion of porous transport layer and bipolar plate, and the interactions between them. In this review, the stability degradation mechanisms from Ru&#8208;based catalyst to other core components to the cell system alongside the mutual effects of core components are systematically sorted out. The stability synergistic optimization strategies are subsequently discussed, ranging from individual components to system&#8208;level comprehensive consideration, for the engineering of a stable Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system. Finally, the outlook is provided based on the promising development direction and key scientific challenge for Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system, aiming to provide theoretical guidance and technical reference for the design of highly stable and low&#8208;cost Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system by integrating industry&#8208;aligned standards and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in system engineering.

         <title>Graphene Liquid Cells for In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy: Unveiling Nanomaterial Growth and Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how graphene liquid cells (GLCs) enable in situ transmission electron microscopy of nanomaterial growth and etching. It presents strategies for preparing suspended graphene, diverse routes for fabricating GLCs, and representative applications in monitoring dynamic nanoscale transformations. The discussion provides insights into opportunities and challenges of advancing GLC&#8208;based liquid&#8208;phase studies.








Abstract
The liquid&#8208;phase growth and etching process of nanomaterials profoundly affects their size, morphology, and composition, thereby determining their properties. Achieving real&#8208;time atomic&#8208;resolution visualization of these processes has driven the development of in situ liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy imaging. Especially, graphene liquid cells (GLCs) have emerged as a powerful platform due to their high resolution, facile fabrication, and compatibility with conventional transmission electron microscopy holders. This review first summarizes the preparation of suspended graphene, the key window material for GLCs, and the fabrication of GLCs with diverse configurations. It then systematically outlines the applications of GLCs in revealing the growth and etching processes of nanomaterials, and finally concludes with perspectives on the opportunities and challenges associated with GLC&#8208;based research. This review aims to provide a panoramic understanding and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>The Space Within: How Architected Voids Promote Tissue Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the role of void spaces in tissue engineering scaffolds and examines four key methods for introducing porosity into hydrogels at different scales. It discusses sacrificial templating, microgels, phase separation, and 3D printing, highlighting principles, advantages, and limitations. It also addresses emerging strategies integrating these techniques to better mimic physiological microenvironments in hierarchical structures and enhance scaffold functionality.








Abstract
Physiological void spaces exist at every scale of the human body, from organs to molecules, facilitating transport, signal propagation, and localized biochemical activity. Constriction of these spaces (e.g., arterial occlusion, fibrosis) highlights their importance, making their mimicry essential in tissue engineering (TE). This review examines four key strategies for introducing porosity into hydrogels across multiple length scales: templating, microgels, phase separation, and 3D printing. The first three methods enable the engineering of physiological environments at the nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale, mimicking tissue&#8208; and extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;level spaces. Templating involves embedding and removal of gas, liquid, or solid phases, leaving behind pores. Microgel annealing generates inherent interstitial voids. Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) creates biphasic networks reminiscent of native ECM. The fourth approach, extrusion&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing techniques, enables the fabrication of larger&#8208;scale spaces, such as luminal structures (e.g., vasculature, airways, and ducts). Combining these methods enables the creation of hierarchical architectures from the nano&#8208; to centimeter scale. The review also highlights Filamented Light (FLight) technology, which creates internal microstructural voids relevant to anisotropic tissues. This review offers insights into current methods and their convergence for generating biomimetic void spaces to meet the physiological demands of cells, tissues, and organs.

         <title>Advanced Design and Characterization of Polyether&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyether solid electrolytes possess strong lithium&#8208;salt solvation ability and flexible interfacial contact, yet suffer from sluggish ion transport and poor interfacial stability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cells. This review integrates multicomponent and structural tuning strategies, illustrates structure&#8211;property insights via multiscale characterizations, benchmarks pouch&#8208;cell performance, and outlines the scalability and consistency challenges facing commercialization.








Abstract
Polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential in lithium batteries due to their excellent interfacial flexibility and high solvation ability for lithium salts. However, the problems of limited ion transport and insufficient interfacial stability have restricted the application of polyether&#8208;based electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#160;batteries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored a variety of strategies, such as multi&#8208;component compounding and structural regulation, and developed a vast array of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Therefore, this review first summarizes the key modification strategies and representative examples of electrolytes from a systematic design perspective, aiming at the two aforementioned major issues. Meanwhile, to precisely implement the above strategies and to design more effective modification strategies, latent yet valuable structure&#8211;property relationships should be further uncovered. Thus, multiscale characterizations are rationally integrated through representative case studies. Finally, it summarizes the reported performance of representative polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state pouch cells, emphasizes scale&#8208;up and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency, and outlines future research directions for translating these electrolytes into high&#8208;energy, market&#8208;ready batteries.

         <title>Breaking Dilution Limits: Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production from Low&#8208;Concentration Nitrate Streams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3). It covers reaction mechanisms, efficiency factors, and key challenges at low&#8208;concentration conditions. Performance improvement strategies are analyzed, alongside feasibility assessment for large&#8208;scale application through application scenarios, techno&#8208;economic, and life&#8208;cycle. Future research directions are outlined to inspire future work.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) in water to high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) using an electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) provides a viable technological pathway to address the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle. Unfortunately, most of the existing studies have focused on the ideal conditions of high&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722;, but most of the polluted waters around the world are usually at low&#8208;concentration levels. Consequently, researching eNO3&#8722;RR under low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; is more practical. Although the study of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; has gradually gained attention in recent years, a systematic review of the literature in this area has not yet been reported. To fill this research gap, this paper reviews recent advances in the electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; to NH3. Initially, the nature of NO3&#8722; as a reactant, the reaction mechanism of eNO3&#8722;RR, and the factors affecting the efficiency are introduced. Subsequently, the key challenges of electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; are analyzed, and various strategies to improve the performance of eNO3&#8722;RR are summarized on this basis. Additionally, the feasibility of large&#8208;scale ammonia recovery using eNO3&#8722;RR under low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; is assessed through application scenario exploration, economic analyses, and life cycle assessment. Ultimately, future research directions are outlined to inspire future work.

         <title>Characterization of Complex Stacking of Semiconductors Through Near Field Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
SNOM imaging and spectroscopy on a mechanically cleaved facet is used to characterize the different layers of complex epitaxial heterostructures composed of a type II superlattice and highly doped semiconductors. Both the geometrical parameters of the stack and the optical properties of the individual layers and of the interfaces are retrieved, as well as the doping level of the heavily doped semiconductors.








Abstract
While high operating temperature infrared photodetection remains a major technological objective, huge improvements have been obtained through the use of increasingly complex semiconductors epitaxies such as quantum cascade structures or III&#8211;V superlattice junction. However, the characterization of these layers is challenging and often requires the use of destructive processes. Here, SNOM imaging and spectroscopy on a mechanically cleaved facet is used to characterize the different layers of a complex epitaxial heterostructure composed of a type II superlattice and highly doped semiconductors. These near&#8208;field experimental data are compared to simulation in order to retrieve both the cut&#8208;off frequency of the superlattice and the doping level of each highly doped semiconductor layers. Additionally, information about interfaces is optically retrieved through hyperspectral characterization of plasmons propagating at these vertical interfaces. In parallel, all the materials and exact stacking of the epitaxy are confirmed through scanning transmission electron&#160;microscopy.

         <title>Giga&#8208;Voxel Multiscale Composite Architecture Mirrored Through a Data&#8208;to&#8208;Model Closed&#8208;Loop Digital Twin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a systematic digital twin workflow tailored for generating high&#8208;fidelity virtual representations of anisotropic composite microstructures and giga&#8208;voxel meso&#8208;structural models is presented, leveraging a harmonious integration of top&#8211;down image&#8208;based modeling and bottom&#8211;up data&#8208;driven voxel generation.








Abstract
Giga&#8208;voxel digital models offer abundant geometric detail; however, no mainstream method currently exists to efficiently distribute individual voxels across massive image volumes, and designing complex anisotropic composite materials remains infeasible due to the absence of promising methods. Herein, we propose a systematic digital twin workflow tailored for generating high&#8208;fidelity virtual representations of anisotropic composite microstructures and giga&#8208;voxel meso&#8208;structural models, leveraging a harmonious integration of top&#8208;down image&#8208;based modeling and bottom&#8208;up data&#8208;driven generation. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of micro&#8208;digital representations as foundational building blocks within a continuum of digital assembly processes tailored for mesostructural models. Utilizing 3D image data, specifically X&#8208;ray tomography, our data&#8208;driven modeling meticulously characterizes the geometric attributes of the experimentally observed objects, thereby facilitating the creation of digital unit twins, each endowed with distinct identities assigned through a random seed generation. The closed&#8208;loop system provides feedback mechanism between data and model to ensure the 3D quality of the generated models. For hierarchical organization at the giga&#8208;voxel level, the digital unit twins are methodically expanded into cohesive 3D architectures based on assembly relationship at length scales of more than four orders of magnitude. Remarkably, this hierarchical model provides intricate insight into micro&#8208;to&#8208;macro geometrics while preserving the intrinsic microstructure.

         <title>Unveiling of Unpaired Surface Spins Regulated Magnetism in 2D &#945;&#8208;Te Nanosheets: an Implication on Magnetoelectric Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;2D tellurium nanosheets unveil a novel form of magnetism regulated by their unpaired surface spins. This emergent property, coupled with ferroelectricity, generates a giant magnetoelectric response. When utilized as a catalyst, this effect significantly accelerates the hydrogen evolution reaction, drastically reducing the required overpotential and demonstrating impressive electrochemical stability for next&#8208;generation energy technologies.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D tellurium (Te) unlocks surface spins (of valence 5p4 electrons) of tunable ferromagnetic order and response to strain&#8208;engineered electronic properties of widespread applications. In spin&#8211;orbit coupling, the inversion symmetry is broken in a 1S0 &#8594; 3S1 spin&#8208;transition of the ground electronic state, a synergetic pathway to charge spin&#8208;order under applied driving forces. The surface magnetism, combined with the ferroelectricity, gives a giant magnetoelectric response (absent in 1S0 bulk Te state) that is explored to boost the H2 evolution reaction (HER) with 2D &#945;&#8208;Te as a synergetic catalyst. High&#8208;quality 2D &#945;&#8208;Te synthesized as nanosheets is ordered primarily along (001) facets at duly enhanced d001 atomic spacing in the 5s2&#8208;Te lone pair electrons (diamagnetic) are spaced (Coulomb repulsion) via the 5p2 unpaired spins. Poled 2D &#945;&#8208;Te in small fields, such as 30 mT, presents a HER overpotential that is decreased up to 100&#160;mV, while the Tafel slope is declined up to 138 from 211&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 for the bulk sample. The electrochemical stability of 2D &#945;&#8208;Te is found quite impressive with 93% current retention (71% if non&#8208;magnetized) under chronoamperometric conditions. The results present that the 2D &#945;&#8208;Te plays a game&#8208;changing role towards sustainable energy technologies, spintronics, and next&#8208;generation magnetoelectric devices.

         <title>MXene Membrane as Multifunctional Interface for Vapor Splitting via Photothermal&#8208;Catalytic Membrane Distillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional MXene&#8208;based membrane integrates photothermal evaporation and photocatalytic vapor splitting in a sweeping&#8208;gas membrane distillation (PTC&#8208;SGMD) platform, simultaneously generating freshwater and hydrogen. The SrTiO3/MX@PVDF interface leverages broad&#8208;spectrum solar absorption, efficient heat/mass transfer, and gas&#8211;solid catalysis to achieve high flux, robust H2 production, and long&#8208;term stability, highlighting a sustainable water&#8211;energy solution.








Abstract
Advancements in solar&#8208;driven processes are fundamentally transforming the production of freshwater and energy into a more sustainable manner. Realizing such potential requires developing highly efficient solar responsive materials and advanced solar systems. Here, an MXene&#8208;based membrane is reported as a multifunctional interface capable of simultaneously producing freshwater and hydrogen through a strategically designed photothermal&#8208;catalytic sweeping gas membrane distillation (PTC&#8208;SGMD) system. By leveraging membrane interface engineering, the innovative design integrates solar evaporation, vapor transportation, and vapor splitting within a single membrane. Unlike conventional liquid&#8211;solid systems, this liquid&#8211;solid&#8211;gas configuration overcomes photocatalyst leaching, interfacial heat loss, and inefficient mass transfer. The multifunctional membrane exhibits enhanced solar absorption and optimal permeability, enabling the MXene&#8208;photocatalyst composite to achieve efficient photocatalytic vapor splitting. Remarkably, the optimized SrTiO3/MX@PVDF membrane achieves a simultaneous water flux of 2.37&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2h&#8722;1 and hydrogen production of 947.8&#160;&#181;mol m&#8722;2h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation. The PTC&#8208;SGMD system demonstrates total solar efficiency of 92.305% with outstanding stability over 72 h of continuous operation. This innovative approach offers a scalable solution to global water scarcity and energy challenges.

         <title>Silver Ions as Ambipolar Dopants in InAs Nanocrystal Solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8314; ions post&#8208;introduced into InAs nanocrystal films act as ambipolar dopants whose effect depends on host polarity and dopant concentration. In n&#8208;type InAs nanocrystal films, Ag&#8314; occupies interstitial sites to yield n&#8208;type doping effect, whereas in Zn&#8208;doped p&#8208;type InAs nanocrystal films, it first forms p&#8208;type surface doping effect and later induces n&#8208;type doping effect, enabling polarity&#8208;tunable III&#8211;V nanocrystal devices.








Abstract
The precise control of semiconductor polarity in nanocrystals (NCs) is crucial for optimizing device performance in various optoelectronic applications. In this study, it is shown that Ag&#8314;, added post&#8208;synthetically to InAs NCs using an AgNO3 solution, can induce either n&#8208;type or p&#8208;type doping of the solid, depending on the intrinsic polarity of the host and the dopant concentration. In n&#8208;type InAs NCs, Ag&#8314; consistently acts as an interstitial n&#8208;type dopant, shifting the conduction band minimum closer to the Fermi level. Conversely, in p&#8208;type InAs NCs (innately doped with Zn during synthesis), Ag&#8314; initially exhibits a p&#8208;type doping effect at low concentrations by forming surface dipoles but transitions to an n&#8208;type doping effect at higher concentrations through interstitial incorporation. These results offer a unified understanding of the intricate and adjustable doping behavior of Ag&#8314; in colloidal NC systems and present new opportunities for post&#8208;synthetic polarity engineering in III&#8211;V nanomaterials.

         <title>Autonomous Spatiotemporal Regulation of Reversible Hydrogel Actuators by Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators with reversible response to thiols are developed using reversible binding of thiols to Michael acceptors. Autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible movement of these hydrogels is achieved using thiol&#8208;based chemical reaction networks containing both positive and negative feedback.








Abstract
Achieving autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible hydrogel movement remains challenging, as existing approaches typically rely on external regulation or irreversible actuation mechanisms. This work presents the autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible hydrogel actuators using thiol&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs). The core innovation is a bilayer actuator whose active layer is functionalized with phenylcyanoacrylate Michael acceptors. In their initial state, these groups are hydrophobic, keeping the active layer moderately collapsed. Binding to thiols, such as cysteamine or thiocholine, converts the acceptors into more hydrophilic adducts. This change drives water uptake, causing the active layer to swell and the entire structure to bend. The screening revealed that a methoxy&#8208;substituted acceptor provides the optimal balance of binding strength and reversibility for robust actuation. Autonomous control of reversible actuation is achieved by an autocatalytic, thiol&#8208;producing CRN coupled with negative feedback in the form of slow oxidation of thiols or their irreversible addition to acrylamides. In the hydrogel, this CRN generates a wave of thiols, which causes forward and reverse actuation. This principle is demonstrated with linear, flower&#8208;shaped, and hand&#8208;like actuators. This integrated system, which unites reversible chemistry with spatiotemporal control, takes a significant step toward emulating the autonomy of motion found in living systems.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Fluorinated Gases by Porous Organic Cages &#8211; Effects of Fluorinated Side&#8208;Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of a series of porous organic cages with perfluorinated alkyl side&#8208;chains of different lengths is presented. The structure&#8208;property relationship of the various cages on gas sorption of highly potent greenhouse gases, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) is investigated. Very high selectivities have been obtained especially for PFC&#8208;218 and PFC&#8208;318.








Abstract
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as related gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) or nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) are examples of F&#8208;gases, a subclass of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). F&#8208;gases are anthropogenic greenhouse gases with the highest global warming potentials known and thus contribute significantly to global warming. To reduce their amount in the atmosphere, selectively adsorbing materials would be beneficial, but such materials are rare. A homologous series of porous organic cages with fluorinated side&#8208;chains is synthesized and depending on the targeted gas as well as operating temperature, different cages have high selectivities for certain F&#8208;gases against N2, CO2, and O2. Within this series, new benchmark selectivities against, e.g., perfluoro propane (PFC&#8208;218) and perfluoro cyclobutane (PFC&#8208;318) have been achieved based on attractive fluorine&#8208;fluorine interactions. Furthermore, these interactions are exploited for the first time in the adsorption of sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.

         <title>In Situ Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes Enables Long&#8208;Life Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QSPE) incorporating PVTC enables in situ formation of a LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) that stabilizes WO3/NiO electrochromic devices. Using a salt&#8208;pressed configuration, the first direct FIB&#8211;TEM observation of the SEI at the WO3/solid&#8208;electrolyte interface is achieved. This QSPE delivers large optical modulation (&gt;45%), rapid response, and exceptional durability over 40 000 cycles.








Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) offer significant energy&#8208;saving potential for applications such as smart windows and displays by modulating optical properties in response to electrical stimuli. However, their widespread adoption is limited by challenges associated with electrolyte stability and the formation of a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). In this study, a novel quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QSPE) based on a UV&#8208;curable matrix of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) incorporated with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE), abbreviated as PVTC] is presented. The high dielectric constant of PVTC facilitates lithium&#8208;ion transport, while electrochemical cycling triggers partial dehydrofluorination, thereby promoting in situ formation of a LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer on WO3 surface. The optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent properties, including high optical transparency (88.7%), ionic conductivity (1.76 mS cm&#8722;1), and mechanical robustness. When applied in ECDs, PVTC enables outstanding performance, achieving 86.29% optical retention from the 5000th to the 40 000th cycle and 98.78% charge retention after 50 000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Furthermore, prototype demonstrations in smart windows and electrochromic sunglasses validate the scalability and flexibility of the proposed system, highlighting a promising strategy for advancing durable, high&#8208;performance ECDs through innovative electrolyte design.

         <title>Melt Densification Enables Fracture&#8208;Resistant Blend Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt densification of miscible polymers enables the formation of highly entangled blend hydrogels with exceptional fracture resistance. The resulting networks combine high stiffness and fatigue thresholds with optical transparency, oxygen permeability, and antifouling performance. This generalizable approach provides a straightforward strategy to design robust functional hydrogels for biomedical and electronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogels and elastomers are integral components in biomedical and electronics devices, but their toughness and crack resistance are often unsatisfactory for load&#8208;bearing applications. Synthetic polymer networks predominantly rely on solution fabrication, which compromises the ultimate mechanical properties. This work presents a universal melt crosslinking strategy, which densifies entanglements well beyond solvated conditions. When deformed, mutually entangled dissimilar chains stiffen the gels, while sparse crosslinks amplify fracture resistance. At water contents up to 83%, the resultant hydrogels demonstrate over 2 orders increase in mechanical properties, including moduli (1.3&#8211;35 MPa), toughness (0.7&#8211;24.5 kJ/m2), and fatigue thresholds (1.2&#8211;3.3 kJ/m2), tunable in a wide range beyond existing hydrogels. Furthermore, the hydrogels show high optical clarity (&gt;96%), oxygen permeability (Dk/t &gt; 40), and anti&#8208;fouling properties (&lt;0.6&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2). This generalizable strategy could guide the design of tough functional soft materials in fields such as healthcare and smart electronics.

         <title>Polymer&#8211;Perovskite Microcrystal Heterojunction for Self&#8208;Powered Optical Sensing and Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable fabrication strategy is demonstrated for self&#8208;powered polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunction (PPMC HJ) photodetectors with clean interfaces and excellent performance: ultralow dark current, high dark&#8208;to&#8208;light ratio, fast response, and long&#8208;term stability. Design optimization boosted yield to 38%. KPFM revealed the Br&#8722; vacancy effects. Integration into an LISF converter validated its potential for next&#8208;gen optoelectronic and optical communication applications.








Abstract
The quasiepitaxial polymer&#8208;perovskite interface is a critical enabler for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, offering opulent features of efficient exciton dissociation and carrier transport. However, interfacial complexities, including energy barriers, poor interface, and defect states, pose significant challenges to scalability and performance. This study maps the nanoscale barrier landscape across the polymer&#8208;perovskite interface, revealing excellent photodetection performance and robust optical communication capacity. A tactical quasiepitaxial growth approach enables the fabrication of a high&#8208;yield inorganic&#8211;organic abrupt hybrid heterojunction (HHJ) photodetector by integrating CsPbBr3 monocrystal with a patterned poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) film. This strategy boosts the fabrication yield from 5% to 38% and exhibits significant autonomous light&#8208;sensing performance, including an ultra&#8208;low dark current of below 10 fA at room temperature, a substantial dark&#8208;to&#8208;light conductivity ratio exceeding 106, a linear dynamic range (LDR) of &#8776;132.2&#160;dB, and an open&#8208;circuit photovoltage of &#8776;0.7&#160;V. The critical role of Br&#8722; vacancies in governing the photoelectrical behavior of the polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunction&#160;(PPMC HJ) device is revealed precisely at the nanoscale using various advanced KPFM techniques. Additionally, a light&#8208;to&#8208;frequency converter demonstrates its advanced sensing capabilities. These findings highlight the importance of precision&#8208;engineered polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunctions in overcoming current performance bottlenecks, paving the way for scalable, ultrafast photonic devices with superior performance and reliability.

         <title>Deterministic Switching of Antipolar Variants in Antiferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;beam engineering of freestanding PbZrO3 membranes enables selective and reversible switching between in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antiferroelectric domain variants. By tuning the built&#8208;in electric field through beam focusing, deterministic control of antipolar order is achieved. This programmable, non&#8208;contact approach offers a general strategy for reconfigurable domain engineering in perovskite antiferroelectrics and nanoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric (AFE) materials, characterized by their antiparallel dipole alignments, offer distinct ferroic functionalities desirable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage and next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices. However, the intrinsic degeneracy among antipolar domain variants poses a critical obstacle to their deterministic, nonvolatile control and practical integration into functional architectures. Here, selective and reversible manipulation of AFE domain configurations in freestanding PbZrO3 membranes via electron beam irradiation are demonstrated. By tailoring the electron beam&#8211;induced built&#8208;in electric field, controlled writing and erasure of both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antipolar domain variants are enabled. Complementary phase&#8208;field simulations uncover the underlying energetic landscape and domain evolution under varying irradiation conditions, offering mechanistic insight into the observed transformations. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy for domain&#8208;level engineering of antiferroelectrics, establishing a generic and programmable approach to deterministically control antipolar ordering in perovskite systems&#8212;suggesting a pathway toward controlled, reversible switching of AFE domains in nanoscale oxide architectures.

         <title>Artificial Microtubules from Microrobot Swarm Unraveling for Directed Cargo Transport under Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular transport on microtubules, here it is shown that artificial microtubules can spontaneously form when propelling microrobot swarms encounter pointwise or edgewise confinements and work effectively for cargo transport in biological setting such as in blood, making it a particularly exciting delivery platform.








Abstract
Cargo transport on artificial microtubules (AMTs) has been extensively explored in various biomedical applications, including drug delivery and cancer therapy. However, the transport velocity and directional controllability are still poor compared to their natural counterparts, especially under confinement.

     alt="Artificial Microtubules from Microrobot Swarm Unraveling for Directed Cargo Transport under Confinement"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by molecular transport on microtubules, here it is shown that artificial microtubules can spontaneously form when propelling microrobot swarms encounter pointwise or edgewise confinements and work effectively for cargo transport in biological setting such as in blood, making it a particularly exciting delivery platform.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo transport on artificial microtubules (AMTs) has been extensively explored in various biomedical applications, including drug delivery and cancer therapy. However, the transport velocity and directional controllability are still poor compared to their natural counterparts, especially under confinement. Here, we show that confinement can induce the spontaneous formation of AMTs from structural transformations of microrobot swarms, and that these AMTs are particularly adept at directionally controlled cargo transport. It is shown that a magnetically driven microrobot cluster, when locally pinned, can be unraveled along the boundary into a strand that can function as a microtubule thanks to collective tangential flows. We demonstrate with both experiments and simulations that the local pinning required for AMT formation can come from a single pinned particle, or from corners and necks ubiquitous in microchannels and cavities. By modulating the driving magnetic field, the microtubule formation process can be precisely manipulated following periodic perturbations and re-establishments of local order, thereby simultaneously controlling the velocity and direction of cargo transport. The general applicability of this method has also been tested in biological environments including flowing blood, as well as in an in vitro delivery model under confinement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled MUC1 Ablation via Steric Locking of Turn&#8208;On Reactors Enhances Pyroptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered theranostic reactor is developed, which could bind to MUC1 on glycoengineered triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells and enter a sterically locked state. It inactivates MUC1 under remotely&#8208;controlled light signals while enabling in&#8208;situ visualization of membrane MUC1, leading to a potent pyroptosis&#8208;associated immunostimulatory effect.








Abstract
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly upregulated in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and presents major roles in orchestrating TNBC pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. Herein, a bioorthogonal MUC1&#8208;binding strategy is reported to install MUC1&#8208;lockable aggregation&#8208;induced emission theranostic reactor (AIETR) onto MUC1 for pyroptosis&#8208;immunotherapy while enabling in situ MUC1 visualization. TNBC&#8208;bearing hosts are first treated with 1,3,4&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;containing bioresponsive nanoassemblies to generate azido groups on MUC1 via sialic acid metabolism pathway. Dibenzocyclooctyne and MUC1&#8208;binding aptamer arms in AIETR can separately bind with azide moieties and aptamer binding domains in MUC1 of glycoengineered TNBC cells and restrict intramolecular rotation to activate their AIE&#8208;dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and fluorescence imaging capacity. The proximity&#8208;dependent ROS damage abolishes membrane MUC1 to activate pyroptosis cascades. Moreover, treatment&#8208;enabled MUC1 inactivation also ameliorates MUC1&#8208;dependent immunosuppression in TNBC microenvironment to boost anti&#8208;TNBC immunity. This study offers an effective approach for precision TNBC theranostics in the clinic.

         <title>Chimeric Glycoprotein Nanoparticles Elicit Robust Neutralizing Antibodies Against Epstein&#8211;Barr Virus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV) lacks vaccines/therapeutics despite causing cancers. Chimeric nanoparticles co&#8208;displaying EBV's gB/gHgL fusion apparatus are designed. These induce stronger neutralizing antibodies than cocktails in animals, mimicking whole&#8208;virion antibody patterns. Single&#8208;BCR sequencing reveals a novel gB&#8208;targeting neutralizing antibody (Fab5) to a new site. This strategy offers potent EBV vaccine candidates and insights for multi&#8208;antigen pathogens.








Abstract
Epstein&#8210;Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gammaherpesvirus linked to a broad spectrum of malignancies and autoimmune diseases with no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines. EBV infection relies on the viral glycoproteins gB and gHgL, which, together, function as the fusion apparatus, mediating viral recognition and membrane fusion in both epithelial and B cells. Despite discovering potent neutralizing antibodies targeting gB and gHgL, the heterogeneous antigen structures and distribution of multiple glycoproteins in the virion hinder rational vaccine design targeting this apparatus complex. In this study, Chimeric nanoparticles (Chimeric&#8208;NPs) are designed that co&#8208;display EBV fusion apparatus and induce significantly more neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates than the cocktail counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the Chimeric&#8208;NPs elicited neutralizing antibodies predominantly targeting gB, closely mimicking the antibody induction pattern by the whole EBV virion. Additionally, single&#8208;BCR sequencing is used to analyze the B cell response to Chimeric&#8208;NP, and a novel gB neutralizing antibody Fab5 targeting a new vulnerable site EBV gB is identified. These findings provide novel candidates and vaccine design strategies for EBV and reveal the underlying mechanisms of antibody induction and immune response regulation by chimera vaccines, with potential implications for all multi&#8208;antigen&#8208;harbored pathogens.

         <title>High Thermal Conductivity Porous Organic Polymers with Low Permittivity via Desolvation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops porous polyacrylonitrile (P&#8208;PAN) films via PEG&#8208;induced desolvation. This strategy creates uniform micropores (reducing permittivity to 1.44, &#8208;73.1%) while simultaneously promoting PAN chain reorganization into aligned crystalline domains. This enhances thermal conductivity tenfold to 1.39 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, overcoming the typical permittivity&#8208;thermal conductivity trade&#8208;off in organics. As a thermal interface material, P&#8208;PAN reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Miniaturization of microelectronic devices demand organic dielectric polymers with ultralow permittivity (k &lt; 2.0) and high thermal conductivity (&#955; &gt; 1.0 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1) to mitigate signal delay and thermal accumulation. However, organic polymers inherently face a trade&#8208;off: porosity reduces k but sacrifices &#955; due to disordered pores and interchain hopping barriers. Here, a desolvation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed, fabricating all organic porous polyacrylonitrile (P&#8208;PAN) films. By incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a porogen and plasticizer, followed by water exchange and freeze drying, the P&#8208;PAN film features uniform microscale holes, which reduce dipole density and electronic polarization, resulting in k to 1.44 (73.1% reduction from PAN). Simultaneously, PEG&#8208;induce hydrogen bonds enable PAN chains mobility, promoting the reorganization of amorphous chains into crystalline domains during desolvation. This ordered framework facilitates efficient phonon transport via crystalline domains, elevating &#955; to 1.39&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, nearly tenfold improvement over PAN (0.13&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Notably, P&#8208;PAN synergizes k &lt; 2.0 and &#955; &gt; 1.0 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1 without fillers, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic polymers. As a proof of concept, P&#8208;PAN as a thermal interface material (TIM) reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C, decoupling the k&#8208;&#955; trade&#8208;offs in organic polymers and demonstrating its potential for flexible electronics.

         <title>Integrated TRNG and PUF Based on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Polymer Dielectric Gated Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed that incorporates a photoactivable RTP film as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, giving two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (Ip) and photocurrent (Id), enabling integrated true random number generator (TRNG) and physical unclonable function (PUF) functionalities.








Abstract
Harnessing the entropy of multiple transitions between different electronic states in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) not only overcomes the drawbacks of authentication via afterglow but also holds significant potential for cryptographic protocols that are immune to attacks from future quantum computers. However, such an objective has yet to be realized. Here, RTP films are incorporated as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, which give two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (Ip) from the dielectric layer and photocurrent (Id) across the source&#8208;drain electrode. The susceptible thermodynamics of electron transitions and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer at the dielectric&#8208;semiconductor interface causing Ip to vary with each readout, thereby enabling true random number generator (TRNG) functionality. Whereas Id is mainly governed by film quality and interfacial defects, which vary among different batches due to inherent randomness introduced during fabrication, making it suitable as a physical unclonable function (PUF). Detailed studies reveal that the two outputs demonstrate excellent uniqueness and independence, with a Hamming weight of 0.50, an inter&#8208;Hamming distance of 50.27%, a Pearson correlation coefficient of &#8722;0.0054, and an encoding capacity of 225 within a 5 &#215; 5 transistor array.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy is proposed that incorporates a photoactivable RTP film as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, giving two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) and photocurrent (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;), enabling integrated true random number generator (TRNG) and physical unclonable function (PUF) functionalities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harnessing the entropy of multiple transitions between different electronic states in room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) not only overcomes the drawbacks of authentication via afterglow but also holds significant potential for cryptographic protocols that are immune to attacks from future quantum computers. However, such an objective has yet to be realized. Here, RTP films are incorporated as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, which give two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) from the dielectric layer and photocurrent (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) across the source-drain electrode. The susceptible thermodynamics of electron transitions and the triplet-to-singlet energy transfer at the dielectric-semiconductor interface causing &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; to vary with each readout, thereby enabling true random number generator (TRNG) functionality. Whereas &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is mainly governed by film quality and interfacial defects, which vary among different batches due to inherent randomness introduced during fabrication, making it suitable as a physical unclonable function (PUF). Detailed studies reveal that the two outputs demonstrate excellent uniqueness and independence, with a Hamming weight of 0.50, an inter-Hamming distance of 50.27%, a Pearson correlation coefficient of &#8722;0.0054, and an encoding capacity of 2&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; within a 5 &#215; 5 transistor array. This work represents a breakthrough of integrated optoelectronic devices for highly secure authentication while also inspiring new applications for RTP materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isotropic Energy&#8208;Absorbing Metamaterial with Tensegrity&#8208;Inspired Architecture and Auxetic Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of tensile properties enables adjustment of the spring's stiffness coefficient, achieving overall stiffness regulation while offering self&#8208;recovery and anti&#8208;fatigue capabilities. By leveraging negative Poisson's ratio properties, the seven&#8208;cell and tetrahedral metamaterials significantly mitigate impact loads during shock testing. Additionally, the assembly strategy of unit cells is expanded to fabricate multidimensional metamaterials.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials exhibit significant potential for energy absorption applications through rational structural design. Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) metamaterials have drawn particular attention due to their unique auxetic behavior, though their limited functionality restricts energy absorption capacity. This study develops a novel metamaterial combining NPR characteristics with tensegrity structure advantages to address traditional energy&#8208;absorbing materials' limitations in durability, self&#8208;recovery, and dynamic adjustability. By reconfiguring tensegrity modules into programmable units using spring combinations and implementing directional deformation constraints through rigid sliding rod and linear slider systems, the auxetic mechanism of NPR materials is integrated with tensegrity's programmable features. Experimental results demonstrate precise control of global auxetic response and overall stiffness through spring stiffness adjustment, with the elastic element combination providing self&#8208;recovery and fatigue resistance (only 0.40% energy absorption variation after 10000 compression cycles). For structural assembly, seven&#8208;cell and tetrahedral configurations achieve peak force reductions of &#8776;75.68&#160;&#177;&#160;1.22% and 91.18&#160;&#177;&#160;0.40% respectively, under impact, demonstrating assembly strategy scalability. This research breaks through traditional single&#8208;material metamaterial limitations by integrating tensegrity structures with NPR effects, establishing a new paradigm for developing intelligent protective materials with both tunable energy absorption characteristics and enhanced durability.

         <title>Chip&#8208;Scale Graphene/IGZO Cold Source FET Array Enabling Sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 Super&#8208;Steep Subthreshold Swing</title>

         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is demonstrated in graphene/IGZO cold source transistor arrays. Linear density of states with Dirac cone in graphene suppressed the Boltzmann thermal tail, while high&#8208;k HfO2 dielectric having small body factor enhanced gating efficiency, hereby further reducing SS. An average SS of &#8776;46.4 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is achieved in the array, enabling ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronics.








Abstract
In this study, the first sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) of graphene/InGaZnO (IGZO) cold&#8208;source field&#8208;effect transistor (CSFET) arrays is demonstrated. The linear density of states of the Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;type graphene suppresses the Boltzmann thermal tail near the graphene/IGZO interface which in turn causes super&#8208;exponentially decaying electron density with increasing energy, leading to an extremely low off current and SS value. In particular, by introducing an HfO2 high&#8208;k dielectric with a low body factor, the surface potential is effectively modulated, further reducing SS by &#8776;46.4 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, highly uniform sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 SS with a yield of &#8776;89.1% is achieved in the IGZO CSFET 8 &#215; 8 array devices, with a record SS value of 23.66 mV dec&#8722;1 compared to previously reported oxide&#8208;semiconductor transistors. The proposed IGZO CSFET device is expected to drive significant advancements in high&#8208;speed and ultralow&#8208;power electronic circuits.

         <title>Chiral Nanoagonist Targeting EGFR for Nerve Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral nanoagonist is proposed to effectively activate EGFR for nerve injury repair. D&#8208;Histidine ZnO nanorods promote cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in a chirality&#8208;dependent manner through EGFR signaling networks. Further incorporated into a biodegradable bandage, enhanced nerve regeneration and function recovery are demonstrated in both peripheral and central nervous system injury models.








Abstract
Nerve injury repair is limited by the incapacity to regenerate neurons in the nervous system. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development of the nervous system, but its potential in nerve regeneration and repair has remained underappreciated. Herein, a chiral nanoagonist, D&#8208;Histidine ZnO nanorods (NRs), is reported to effectively activate EGFR and initiate multiple downstream cascade signaling pathways, promoting nerve cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in three different types of neural cells. D&#8208;Histidine ZnO NRs not only achieve more than 85% differentiation rate (with neurite length larger than 50 &#181;m), but also induce the transdifferentiating of Schwann cells into a stem&#8208;like phenotype. A biodegradable band&#8208;aid&#8208;like bandage incorporating D&#8208;Histidine ZnO NRs is developed and applied in nerve injury repair in both sciatic nerve and spinal cord injury models. The neurorestoration and functional recovery are significantly improved after 4&#8208;week therapy. This study reveals that chirality&#8208;dependent regulation of nerve cell behavior by chiral nanoagonist targeting EGFR is a pioneering and promising strategy in nerve regeneration therapies.

         <title>Origin of B&#8208;Type Blinking at 2D/3D Heterojunction Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#8209;type photoluminescence blinking is observed in WS2/Si heterojunctions, originating from the competition between two hot&#8209;carrier relaxation pathways either leading to A exciton or localized exciton formation. F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer sustains the blinking by modulating localized exciton density. This finding broadens the understanding of carrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems and help the degsin of stable optoelectronic device. 








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking is a common phenomenon that occurs across various low&#8208;dimensional materials, like 0D quantum dots or 1D nanowires. Two blinking types in 0D and 1D systems have been observed and extensively studied, revealing the mechanisms of non&#8208;equilibrium photocarrier kinetics, thereby enhancing emission stability and optimizing emitter performance. However, the origin of blinking in 2D materials is still less understood compared to those in quantum dots and single molecules and only the A&#8208;type blinking has been reported. Here, a B&#8208;type photoluminescence blinking is identified at the WS2/Si heterointerface through the statistics of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;intensity distribution. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and transient absorption spectra show that the blinking arises from the dynamic competition between two hot carrier relaxation pathways: one leading to A exciton emission and the other to localized exciton recombination. Moreover, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer modulates the localized exciton density at the heterointerface and sustains the blinking phenomenon, which is distinct from other B&#8208;type blinking. This B&#8208;type blinking broadens the understanding of photocarrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems, which will benefit the development of optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.

Moreover, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer modulates the localized exciton density at the heterointerface and sustains the blinking phenomenon, which is distinct from other B-type blinking. This B-type blinking broadens the understanding of photocarrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems, which will benefit the development of optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Michell's&#8208;Instability&#8208;Mediated Fast Reconfiguration of Hydrogel&#8208;Based Ring Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic hydrogel&#8208;based ring actuator exhibits fast reconfiguration from a saddle&#8208;shape to a figure of eight upon heating or light irradiation, resulting in varied stiffnesses of the gel and reduced critical twist of the ring for Michell's instability. Such ring actuators with fast rotational deformation are harnessed for executing specific tasks.








Abstract
Michell's instability, a classic type of mechanical instability, has received tremendous interest from different disciplines. It occurs when the pre&#8208;torsion in an elastic ring surpasses a critical value; the elastic ring spontaneously undergoes a transition from a flat or warped shape to a figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight configuration. However, such instability has rarely been exploited in designing soft actuators. Here, by employing a stimulus&#8208;triggered Michell's instability, hydrogel&#8208;based ring actuators capable of fast shape morphing are developed. Upon heating or light irradiation, the hydrogel ring transforms rapidly from the saddle&#8208;shape into the figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight configuration. Rigorous experiments and simulations reveal the underlying mechanism and attribute it to the stimuli&#8208;induced variations in bending and torsional stiffnesses of the gel string with anisotropic structure and response, which reduces the critical twist for Michell's instability of the ring actuator. Moreover, effects of light intensity, environmental temperature, ring size, and pre&#8208;torsion on reconfiguration are also investigated. The fast action of the ring actuators in aqueous conditions has been demonstrated through various tasks, such as screwing a bottle cap, kicking a ball, and triggering synergetic deformations. The design principle of soft actuators by harnessing Michell's instability should merit the development of other soft machines with fast action and large&#8208;amplitude reconfiguration.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong field&#8208;free superconducting diode effect (SDE) in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures are demonstrated and achieved by combining engineered geometric asymmetry with stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. The devices reach 54% field&#8208;free diode efficiency&#8212;the highest reported for simple, fully CMOS&#8208;compatible ferromagnet/superconductor multilayers made by standard thin&#8208;film processes.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which manifests as directional, dissipationless supercurrents, is pivotal for realizing energy&#8208;efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, a strongly enhanced, field&#8208;free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures are proposed, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field&#8208;free values in ferromagnet/superconductor multilayers. Temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity results from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz&#8208;force imbalance. These findings establish a CMOS&#8208;compatible platform for high&#8208;performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.

         <title>Trace&#8208;Level Green Bio&#8208;Derived Amino Acid Molecular Leveling Agent Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long&#8208;Lifespan Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived BICINE is introduced as a green and efficient leveling agent to regulate Zn2+ solvation structure and guide uniform Zn nucleation. It also promotes the formation of a stable organic/inorganic hybrid SEI, effectively suppressing dendrites and side reactions, achieving over 5400 h of stable cycling at 5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The poor reversibility of Zn metal anodes, caused by dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced side reactions, hinders the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). To address these issues, regulating Zn2+ solvation structure, controlling nucleation behavior, and constructing a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial. Herein, a trace&#8208;level (10&#160;mg mL&#8722;1) bio&#8208;derived surface&#8208;leveling agent, N,N&#8208;dihydroxyethyl glycine (BICINE), is introduced to tailor the interfacial environment. With multiple coordinating groups, BICINE adsorbs onto the Zn surface, homogenizes nucleation, reconstructs solvation sheath, and induces a hybrid SEI. Meanwhile, it promotes the formation of a uniform cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), stabilizing cathode morphology and preventing irreversible degradation. These synergistic effects suppress dendrite growth and parasitic reactions, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Consequently, symmetric Zn||Zn cells demonstrate remarkable stability, with the capability to operate for over 5,300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and maintain stable performance at a high depth of discharge (88.2%). Asymmetric Cu||Zn cells exhibit exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% over 1,650 cycles. Even with a low N/P ratio of 3, Zn||NH4V4O10 full cells retain 89.7% of their capacity after 250 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. The low&#8208;cost BICINE strategy holds great promise for advancing the commercialization of AZIBs.

         <title>Electrical Catalysis of Forbidden Transitions in Single&#8208;Molecule Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical reaction that is typically symmetry&#8208;forbidden (norbornadiene (NBD) to quadricyclane (QC)) is catalyzed in a single&#8208;molecule junction using a combination of nanoconfinement and electrical catalysis. It occurs when the molecular junction is sterically driven into a configuration that is far from the ground state prior to applying the activating voltage as revealed by simultaneous single&#8208;molecule break&#8208;junction and Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Molecular orbital symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining chemical reaction mechanisms. The process of changing chemical reactants into products must transition along a pathway that conserves molecular orbital symmetry to ensure continuity. This principle is so fundamental that reactions that do not conserve symmetry are typically considered &#8220;forbidden&#8221; due to the high resultant energy barriers. Here, it is demonstrated that it is possible to electrically catalyze these forbidden transitions when a single molecule is bound between two electrodes in a nanoscale junction. A cycloaddition reaction is induced in a norbornadiene (NBD) derivative, converting it to quadricyclane (QC) by utilizing nanoconfinement to place the molecule into a configuration that is far from equilibrium and applying a small voltage to the molecular junction. Traditionally, this reaction can only be induced photochemically due to orbital symmetry selection rules. By directly tracking the reaction dynamics in situ using single&#8208;molecule Raman spectroscopy, it is shown that for this reaction to be electrically catalyzed the molecule must be sterically maneuvered into a configuration near the transition state at the peak of the energy barrier prior to applying the voltage needed to successfully induce the forbidden transition is applied.

         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H+/D+) require near pristine h&#8208;BN membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge. This study reports a scalable Fe&#8208;catalyzed Machine&#8208;Learning Enabled Chemical vapor deposition process for bottom&#8208;up large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN film synthesis and demonstrate H+/D+ separation with selectivity approaching mechanically exfoliated h&#8208;BN.








Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ceramics, such as monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), present potential for disruptive advances in separations. However, sub&#8208;atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H+/D+) require near pristine 2D material membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge. Here, we&#160;report a scalable Fe&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for bottom&#8208;up synthesis of large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN films, overcoming key limitations of conventional ammonia&#8208;based routes. By leveraging mechanistic insights and higher CVD temperatures, we&#160;suppress multilayer formation and achieve uniform monolayer h&#8208;BN coverage on commercially available Fe foils. Machine learning enables systematic exploration of the complex, multi&#8208;dimensional CVD parameter space (growth time, temperature, precursor temperature, multilayer faction, coverage), providing data&#8208;driven approaches to visualize and identify process regimes facilitating predominantly monolayer h&#8208;BN growth with minimal secondary nuclei/ad&#8208;layers. The optimized Fe&#8208;catalyzed CVD h&#8208;BN membranes show high&#8208;quality as observed by proton/deuteron (H+/D+) selectivity &#8776;8.45, approaching the highest quality benchmark of mechanically exfoliated h&#8208;BN (H+/D+ selectivity &#8776;10) as well as significantly outperforming Cu&#8208;catalyzed CVD h&#8208;BN membranes (H+/D+ selectivity &#8776;3.62, control selectivity &#8776;1.7). Our work provides a scalable cost&#8208;effective route for high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN synthesis for sub&#8208;atomic scale separations (H+/D+) and demonstrates the broader potential of machine learning&#8208;guided optimization of CVD for advancing synthesis of 2D materials.

         <title>A Sono&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform Integrating STING Activation and CXCR4 Blockade for Synergistic Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;function therapeutic platform that integrates ultrasound&#8208;triggered sonodynamic therapy, STING pathway activation, and CXCR4 inhibition for synergistic immunotherapy of glioblastoma is presented. This approach not only facilitates robust innate and adaptive immune activation but also significantly inhibits tumor growth and recurrence in glioblastoma&#8208;bearing mice, offering a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppressive barriers.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor with a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment, remains a therapeutic challenge due to its resistance to conventional treatments. In this study, a novel multi&#8208;function therapeutic platform that integrates ultrasound&#8208;triggered sonodynamic therapy (SDT), STING pathway activation, and CXCR4 inhibition for synergistic immunotherapy of GBM is presented. Through systematic comparison of a series of organic molecules with subtle substituted atom alterations, a new selenium&#8208;containing compound is identified with outstanding sonodynamic properties. The high&#8208;performance sonosensitizer is co&#8208;assembled with a STING agonist prodrug, which is further cloaked with glioma cell membrane and CXCR4&#8208;targeting peptides for dual homing and immune modulation. Under ultrasound irradiation, the nanoplatform triggers robust reactive oxygen species production, in combination with the self&#8208;accelerating STING agonist release, significantly stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses while disrupting the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis to suppress immunosuppressive cell infiltration. This tripartite strategy, which integrates SDT&#8208;mediated tumor ablation, STING&#8208;induced systemic immunity, and CXCR4 blockade, synergistically suppresses primary tumor growth, prevents postoperative recurrence, and extends survival in GBM&#8208;bearing mice. This approach presents a promising sono&#8208;triggered multimodal paradigm for overcoming GBM's immunosuppressive barriers and enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Infrared and Thermo Co&#8208;Driven Catalysis for CO2 Conversion to Valuable Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome thermal bottlenecks in direct dimethyl carbonate synthesis, infrared photon energy is coupled with gentle heating on vacancy&#8208;rich CeO2. Vacancy states absorb IR and generate holes with moderate potentials, guiding selective CO2&#8211;methanol conversion, and heat expedites carrier relaxation, resulting in the DMC production rate of &#8764;30 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity, demonstrating an IR&#8211;thermo synergy for CO2 utilisation.








Abstract
Conversion of CO2 into high value chemicals presents a promising pathway for CO2 mitigation and utilisation. The direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from CO2 and methanol is one of such carbon&#8208;neutral pathways. However, thermal catalytic processes for direct dimethyl carbonate synthesis have reached a performance bottleneck at elevated temperatures. This work explores the synergy of photon and thermal energy to enhance the dimethyl carbonate production rate to 30&#160;mmol/g/h, together with 100% selectivity, thanks to a defect&#8208;modified and noble&#8208;metal free cerium oxide catalyst. Fundamentally, it is found that the defects in cerium oxide can provide energy levels that enable IR light absorption and generate holes with a moderate oxidation potential, so avoiding the unfavorable overoxidation pathway and enhancing the production rate of dimethyl carbonate. The thermal energy has been proved to remarkably facilitate the relaxation of IR&#8208;induced charge carriers and to enhance the dimethyl carbonate formation process. This work introduces a strategy of IR photons and thermo co&#8208;driven catalysis and achieves a breakthrough in dimethyl carbonate formation.

         <title>Terahertz Multi&#8208;State Reconfigurable Holographic Metasurface Based on Full&#8208;Stokes Magnetic Eigen&#8208;Modulation of Photonic Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eigen propagation states in the photonic Weyl semimetal cover the normalized full&#8208;Stokes parameter, which can be modulated by the magnetic vector at the magnetized plasma frequency, following a projection relationship. Coupled with the vectorial holography, a multi&#8208;state reconfigurable holographic metasurface is achieved, providing a new paradigm to increase the number of functional states, theoretically to infinity.








Abstract
The metasurface is limited by the fixed microstructure to integrate more reconfigurable functional states, making it indispensable to introduce active materials. Nowadays, attributing to the nontrivial topological properties, the photonic Weyl semimetal shows its potential in active polarization modulation. Here, it is demonstrated that the photonic Weyl semimetal can filter the light with arbitrary required normalized Stokes parameters selected by the magnetic field, namely full&#8208;Stokes magnetic eigen&#8208;modulation scheme, and an analytical relationship between the magnetized direction and eigen polarization state is further derived to guide the modulation scheme. The fractional bandwidth of the modulation scheme is up to 52%. Combined with vectorial holography, an 8&#8208;state reconfigurable metasurface is designed, whose imaging states can be modulated by magnetized direction and experimentally demonstrated in the frequency range from 0.6 to 0.71THz. Furthermore, a single metasurface can function as four switches of the four pairs of orthogonal polarization channels, and the largest contrast ratios of each state are over 18&#160;dB. This multi&#8208;state metasurface scheme provides a novel paradigm to increase the number of functional states, theoretically to infinity, showing promising potential in 6G THz communication and quantum technology.

In this study, a highly sodiophilic and robust Na metal host achieved by spatially confined atomically dispersed Bi sites featuring a unique N3&#8208;Bi&#8208;S1 moiety in interconnected carbon tubes (Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT) has been developed, demonstrating exceptional average Coulombic efficiency, large capacity, and long&#8208;term durability. The mechanisms behind performance enhancement are explicitly revealed by substantial experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are highly promising candidates for low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems. However, their practical deployment is challenged by uncontrolled dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. To address these issues, a highly reversible and robust Na metal host enabled by atomic Bi sites is devised, coordinated in a unique N3&#8208;Bi&#8208;S1 moiety anchored on interconnected carbon tubes (Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT). Crucially, this designed remarkably sodiophilic Bi single&#8208;atom promotes uniform Na nucleation with minimal Na+ consumption, enabling durable and highly reversible Na plating/stripping, while effectively suppressing electrolyte over&#8208;decomposition and fostering the formation of robust inorganic&#8208;rich SEI films, as supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations and experimental analyses. Consequently, Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT achieves an extraordinary average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6% over 900 cycles at 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 6 mAh cm&#8722;2, along with long&#8208;term durability of 1000&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Notably, an anode&#8208;free pouch cell paired with a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibits decent cyclability over 240 cycles at 1C while maintaining good rate capability. This work demonstrates a promising strategy to simultaneously enhance energy density and stability in AFSMBs via atomic&#8208;level sodiophilicity regulation and SEI engineering.

         <title>Highly Robust and Intrinsic Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphenylene Benzodiazole/Liquid Crystal Polyarylate Composites for Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators in Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through interface molecular engineering design, intrinsically flame&#8208;retardant and high&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on polyphenylene benzodiazole fabric reinforced liquid crystal polyarylate (PBO/LCP) composites is achieved. The TENG is expected to provide a sustainable pathway for reliable energy sources and sensing for robots in extreme environments.








Abstract
Achieving a power supply for robots operating at high temperatures or in combustion environments is crucial for human life. As an emerging energy collection technique, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) possess great sustainability, however, their electrical output performances rapidly deteriorate due to the failure of polymer based triboelectric layers in harsh environments. Herein, an outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistant and electrically stable TENG is fabricated using composites of polyphenylene benzodiazole (PBO) fiber enhanced liquid crystal polyarylate (LCP). The intrinsic inert PBO fibers are modified by aminated naphthalimide sizing to effectively improve the interfacial interactions of PBO/LCP composites in terms of high tensile strength (409.3 MPa) and storage modulus at 250 &#176;C (0.18 GPa). More importantly, besides good flexibility, high heat resistance index of 303.9&#176;C, and impressive limiting oxygen index of 36.4%, the resultant TENGs showed enhanced electrical output performance at elevated temperature. The output voltage reached 42 V at 200&#176;C, which could drive a louder buzzer compared to the reduced voltages (by 26.5%) at room temperature. Even after burning on the flame for 10 s, the output voltage is almost 100% retained. The findings demonstrate the great potential of interface molecular engineering and structure&#8208;function integrated composites for the wearable electronics of robots in extreme environments.

         <title>Adaptive Co&#8208;Crystals with Switchable Host&#8208;Guest Stoichiometry for Dynamic Regulation of Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycle&#8208;based adaptive co&#8208;crystals with switchable host&#8208;guest stoichiometry is proposed, enabling vapor&#8208;induced phase transitions, precise D/A ratio modulation, and dynamic TSCT/photoluminescence regulation. Unlike traditional systems, they access intermediate states for fine&#8208;tuned chromic behaviors in the solid state, advancing supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor materials.








Abstract
The development of photoluminescence materials with tunable properties through structural and functional modifications remains a fascinating yet challenging task. In this work, the concept of adaptive co&#8208;crystals featuring switchable host&#8208;guest stoichiometry within the realm of pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular chemistry is proposed. This strategy allows for the rational design of a diverse range of through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer co&#8208;crystals, enabling dynamic modulation of photoluminescence in the solid state. Experimental and theoretical findings unveil two distinct phases within each set of co&#8208;crystal architectures, characterized by different donor/acceptor stoichiometric ratios as well as molecular packing modes. Notably, these co&#8208;crystalline phases undergo vapor&#8208;induced stoichiometry switching and structural interconversion, resulting in unique charge&#8208;transfer transition states and enabling reversible control over photoluminescent behavior. Particularly, this dynamic modulation of the cavity apertures, driven by stoichiometric variation, facilitates highly selective capture and release of 1&#8208;bromoalkane under mild conditions. The present study highlights the potential application of vapor&#8208;mediated co&#8208;crystals with switchable stoichiometry as a supramolecular strategy for modulating the intrinsic characteristics of intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor materials.

         <title>Disorder Scattering Induced Large Room Temperature Nonlinear Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semiconductor CdGeAs2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk CdGeAs2, a well&#8208;known nonlinear optical semiconductor, exhibits an exceptionally large room&#8208;temperature nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), achieving a record&#8208;high nonlinear Hall responsivity of 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m/V. This pronounced NLHE enables broadband frequency mixing up to the megahertz regime, establishing CdGeAs2 as a promising platform for next&#8208;generation nonlinear electronic and optoelectronic technologies.








Abstract
The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) with time&#8208;reversal symmetry has emerged as a transformative phenomenon within the Hall effect family, attracting significant interest due to its profound implications for both fundamental physics and technological applications. While prior studies have predominantly focused on NLHE in 2D materials, advancements in practical applications have been constrained by low operating temperatures and limited responsivity, typically below 10&#8722;4 m/V. Achieving significant responsivity at room temperature (RT) in 3D systems has proven challenging, particularly for scattering&#8208;induced NLHE. Here, the discovery of disorder scattering&#8208;induced NLHE in chalcopyrite&#8208;type CdGeAs2 bulk single crystals is reported, demonstrating a remarkable responsivity of up to 10&#8722;3 m/V at RT. The studies reveal that NLHE not only facilitates ac&#8208;driven second harmonic and rectification Hall responses but also induces an exceptionally large anomalous Hall angle. Through band structure measurements by ARPES, DFT calculations, as well as symmetry and nonlinear Hall conductivity scaling analyses, disorder scattering is identified as the dominant mechanism for the NLHE in CdGeAs2. Leveraging the observed strong responsivity of NLHE at RT, its broadband electronic frequency mixing capability in the MHz range is further demonstrated. This work sets the foundation for integrating scattering&#8208;induced NLHE in 3D materials into very high&#8208;frequency mixing technologies.

Abstract
Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy&#8208;efficient and climate&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional vapor&#8208;compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials are minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit&#8208;cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3&#8722;Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. This approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range of 40&#8211;160 K. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

         <title>Light&#8208;Up Nanostructures with Allosterically Controlled Fluorogenic DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By customizing allosteric regulation into fluorescent DNA aptamers, switchable fluorescent nanodevices become achievable. Such a sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent engineering leads to the realization of clear&#8208;cut fluorescent ON&#8211;OFF switches alongside more advanced operations like Boolean gates and combinatorial circuits. The incorporation of allosteric aptamers with tunable fluorescent properties in DNA nanostructures points a versatile platform of DNA data storage and computing.








Abstract
In this study, a systematic approach is presented for the rational design of synthetic allosteric DNA aptamers. This methodology enables precise control over the allosteric ON&#8211;OFF transition in fluorescent DNA aptamers, allowing for the engineering of aptamers with highly tunable fluorescent properties. When combined with toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, a series of allosteric aptamers is developed in which the target sequence functions as a specific allosteric modulator. Furthermore, these aptamers are applied in synthetic DNA computing and in the construction of responsive nanostructures that light up upon activation.

This study develops a microcapsule rupture&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ polymerization strategy for mechano&#8208;responsive ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with full&#8208;color tunable emissions. This approach paves the way for the development of self&#8208;healing smart coatings capable of high&#8208;contrast damage visualization, as well as advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems featuring mechanically activated dynamic RTP responses.








Abstract
Polymer materials with mechano&#8208;responsive ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desired but challenging to achieve. Herein, a microcapsule (MC) rupture&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ polymerization strategy is proposed to achieve such RTP with full&#8208;color tunable emissions. It involves co&#8208;encapsulating organic phosphors and moisture&#8208;reactive hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) in MCs, which are dispersed into a polymer matrix. Mechanical damage ruptures MCs, releasing HDI that undergoes moisture&#8208;initiated polymerization to form a rigid cross&#8208;linked network at the damaged site. This network effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay pathways of triplet excitons, thereby activating &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; ultralong RTP signals specifically and exclusively at the damaged sites. The system achieves&#160;ultralong RTP lifetimes exceeding 1.5&#160;s and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 11.2%. Notably, these RTP systems demonstrate&#160;exceptional stability under harsh conditions, including immersing in neutral, acidic, alkaline aqueous environments and various organic solvents, as well as exposure to high temperatures. Full&#8208;color tunable afterglow emissions, ranging from blue to red, are readily achieved by employing different organic phosphors. This approach facilitates the development of self&#8208;repairing smart coatings with high&#8208;contrast damage visualization and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems featuring mechanically activated dynamic RTP responses.&#160;Furthermore, the compatibility of MCs with diverse polymer matrices expands the practical applicability of such stimuli&#8208;responsive ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Electrostatically Enhanced Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Anchoring for Scalable and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel electrostatically enhanced anchoring strategy (EEAS). This work employs sulfonamide&#8208;based post&#8208;treatments to modulate the protonation state of phosphonic acid groups in SAMs, resulting in stronger electrostatic interactions with TCO substrates and simultaneously effectively passivating buried interfacial defects, ultimately improving device performance. This scalable and generalizable strategy for advancing PSCs toward industrial standards.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have substantially advanced the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yet weak interfacial adhesion to transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates and perovskite compromises both scalability and thermal stability. Here, an electrostatically enhanced anchoring strategy (EEAS) is presented using sulfadiazine (SDZ) molecules to deprotonate phosphonic acid groups in SAMs, generating phosphate anions that strengthen electrostatic interactions with the positively charged TCO substrates. The protonated SDZ species concurrently establish strong coordination interactions with the buried perovskite interface. This approach enables the formation of uniform and robust buried interfaces while improving perovskite crystallinity and facilitating charge extraction. The resulting PSCs achieve a certified efficiency of 26.23% (steady&#8208;state 25.42%) over 1 cm2 areas. This EEAS is scalable, enabling 20.7&#8208;cm2 modules with a PCE of 24.72%. The devices demonstrate exceptional operational stability, retaining over 94% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at 65 &#176;C (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

         <title>Grain Welding Strategy Suppressing Chemomechanical Failure in Polycrystalline Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain welding strategy is presented to achieve densification of particle in polycrystalline O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode material via introducing Li2CO3 and Na2CO3 eutectics to form liquid phase sintering. The modified cathode suppresses the generation of microcracks and high&#8208;voltage phase transition, impeding chemomechanical failure and achieving high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Chemomechanical failure is critical bottleneck for Na&#8208;based layered oxides (especially polycrystalline material) to achieve the stable operating at high&#8208;voltage with fast&#8208;charging ability. Although attempts like coating and doping are presented to alleviate this issue, the inherent intergranular crevices are inevitable during the synthetic process, which facilitates the chain reaction of chemomechanical failure. Herein, a concept of grain welding strategy is presented to achieve densification of powder particle by introducing liquid phase sintering process, strengthening intergranular adhesion force. The designed polycrystalline NaLi0.05[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]0.95O2 shows dense structure attributed to the formation of eutectics which lowers the melting point with fast mass transfer. The Li doping also well manipulates the interlayer properties in unit cell, suppressing the high&#8208;voltage phase transition. Multiple characterizations like cross&#8208;sectional images and synchrotron&#8208;based full&#8208;field transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy confirm that the modified material suppresses the generation of microcracks during electrochemical cycles, impeding the chemomechanical breakdown. Consequently, it shows advanced capacity of 152.8 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent fast charging capability (121.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C, 12&#160;min), as well as long&#8208;life of 1000 cycles.

The designed polycrystalline NaLi&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;[Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows dense structure attributed to the formation of eutectics which lowers the melting point with fast mass transfer. The Li doping also well manipulates the interlayer properties in unit cell, suppressing the high-voltage phase transition. Multiple characterizations like cross-sectional images and synchrotron-based full-field transmission X-ray microscopy confirm that the modified material suppresses the generation of microcracks during electrochemical cycles, impeding the chemomechanical breakdown. Consequently, it shows advanced capacity of 152.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, excellent fast charging capability (121.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#160;C, 12&#160;min), as well as long-life of 1000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Frontal Polymerization&#8208;Enabled 3D Printing of Recyclable High&#8208;Performance Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a closed &#8208; loop manufacturing process integrating 3D printing and frontal polymerization to produce high &#8208; performance, fully recyclable carbon fiber composites. The method enables in &#8208; situ curing within seconds, drastically reducing energy consumption. These acid &#8208; degradable resins offer tensile strengths exceeding 800 MPa, while recovered fibers retain 95% of their properties, paving the way for sustainable thermoset composites.








Abstract
Thermoset composites often face a challenging trade&#8208;off between recyclability and high performance. In this study, an innovative closed&#8208;loop manufacturing approach that integrates frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) with 3D printing to produce fully recyclable carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers (c&#8208;CFRPs) is presented. A self&#8208;propagating FROMP&#8208;enabled direct ink writing (DIW) printing technology is developed, enabling in situ curing within seconds. This breakthrough eliminates the need for post&#8208;processing and reduces energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional autoclave methods. By copolymerizing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) with a commercial spiroacetal monomer&#160;(&#8804;3&#160;wt.%), acid&#8208;degradable resins that retain the tensile strength of conventional thermosets are introduced&#160;while allowing for matrix depolymerization under mild conditions. The DCPD&#8208;based c&#8208;CFRPs demonstrate remarkable tensile strengths of up to 817&#160;MPa and glass transition temperatures exceeding 160&#160;&#176;C. In a significant advancement, the recovered carbon fibers retain their pristine morphology and over 95% of their original mechanical properties, enabling repeated recycling without performance loss. Additionally, recovered oligomers can be repolymerized into new resins, further enhancing sustainability. This work presents a groundbreaking solution for high&#8208;performance composite manufacturing, addressing critical energy and waste challenges in the thermoset industry.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Design and Discovery of High&#8208;Performance Cyanine&#8208;Based Photosensitizers for Integrated Theranostic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted framework integrating quantum&#8208;chemical and RDKit descriptors enables accurate prediction and two&#8208;stage screening of cyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers. This strategy bridges computation and experiment, efficiently identifying and synthesizing high&#8208;performance theranostic agents with superior singlet oxygen generation and fluorescence properties, providing a rational and generalizable path toward next&#8208;generation PDT photosensitizer design.








Abstract
Cyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers are attractive for photodynamic therapy (PDT) owing to their excellent near&#8208;infrared absorption and fluorescence. However, the low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;) and structural optimization challenges hinder their further development. In this study, a machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted molecular design framework based on the currently available dataset of cyanine molecules is provided. By integrating RDKit structural descriptors with quantum chemical descriptors, hybrid feature&#8208;based predictive models that accurately predict the &#934;&#916; and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of cyanine derivatives (R2 &gt;0.9) have been constructed for the first time. Based on this, a two&#8208;stage virtual screening strategy is developed to efficiently identify promising cyanine derivatives from a library of 2835 candidate structures. Three representative molecules are synthesized as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept validation, confirming the predictive reliability and practical utility of the ML&#8208;guided workflow. The lead compound 1775 exhibits the highest performance (&#934;&#916; = 0.62) and performs well in cellular assays, supporting the robustness and applicability of the ML&#8208;assisted screening strategy in guiding experimental validation. This work establishes a data&#8208;driven paradigm bridging molecular modeling and experimental verification, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for the rational design and rapid evaluation of high&#8208;performance cyanine&#8208;based theranostic agents.

         <title>Akkermansia Muciniphila&#8208;Inspired Oral siRNA Delivery by Active Matrix&#8208;Penetration and Intracellular Endoplasmic Reticulum Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural oral nucleic acid delivery system inspired by Akkermansia muciniphila is developed, which efficiently penetrates the intestinal mucus by degrading mucins and targets the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via Golgi apparatus&#8211;ER transport. This enables effective PD&#8208;L1 silencing and immune checkpoint blockade therapy for colorectal cancer.









Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)&#160;is highly challenging due to the multiple barriers present in the gastrointestinal tract and within cells. Herein, inspired by intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila, the use of Akkermansia muciniphila membrane vesicles (AMVs) is introduced as an effective tool for oral delivery of siRNA. It is revealed that, distinct from common passive mucus&#8208;penetrating nanoparticles, AMVs enable active mucus penetration by degrading intestinal mucins, thereby enhancing their ability to traverse the intestinal barrier by approximately 4.6 times. Additionally, AMVs can markedly heighten siRNA penetration into tumor tissues. Once inside tumor cells, AMVs bypass the traditional endosomal&#8208;lysosomal degradation pathway typical of lipid&#8208;based delivery systems. Instead, they utilize a rapid transport expressway from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating the accumulation of siRNA within the ER and thereby markedly enhancing gene silencing efficiency. In a mouse model of colorectal cancer, this formulation effectively inhibits tumor growth by 91.6%, and it exhibits a favorable biosafety profile. Overall, this research unveils a unique and promising bioinspired platform for oral siRNA delivery, advancing the development of safe and efficient oral nucleic acid therapeutics.

         <title>Bioinspired Janus Spider&#8208;Web Nanofibrous Membranes Integrating Triboelectric Energy Harvesting, Adaptive Thermo&#8208;Moisture Regulation, and Bactericidal Activity for Multifunctional Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired Janus ferroelectric nanofibrous membrane integrates asymmetric wettability, high porosity, and robust flexibility. The membrane achieves self&#8208;powered thermo&#8208;moisture regulation, enhanced water transport, and antibacterial protection, demonstrating stable triboelectric output and multifunctional adaptability for wearable electronics, healthcare monitoring, and smart protective textiles.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional membranes integrating asymmetric wettability, breathable waterproofing, antibacterial activity, and energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities is critical for smart textiles and medical protective equipment, yet balancing robustness, environmental adaptability, and energy conversion efficiency remains challenging. Here, we engineer a bioinspired Janus nanofibrous membrane with a spider&#8208;web&#8208;like hierarchical architecture via synchronous electrospinning&#8208;electrospraying of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and polyamide 6 (PA6). This design achieves dual&#8208;scale wettability (hydrophobic/hydrophilic asymmetry), 83.6% porosity, and mechanical durability (99% structural integrity after 2000 bends). It enables intelligent environmental regulation (7.4 &#8451; thermal gradient under 1 kW/m&#178; solar irradiation), while the electric&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced design accelerates water transport by 20% vs. passive diffusion. Its triboelectric performance surpasses existing breathable membranes (177.5 V open&#8208;circuit voltage, 0.63 W/m2 power density, stable output over 10,000 cycles), enabling encrypted Morse&#8208;code communication for programmable human&#8208;machine interaction. The hierarchical structure exhibits exceptional antibacterial efficacy: 99.92% against Escherichia coli (E. coli), 100% against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 95% against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Via a scalable, low&#8208;cost process compatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing, this approach holds promise for industrial integration in next&#8208;generation wearable healthcare and protection systems.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Rivalling Large&#8208;Area Flexible Broadband Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive large&#8208;area flexible organic photodetector, based on a cyano&#8208;substituted electron acceptor, has been obtained. It is fully comparable to the commercially available silicon photodiodes in multiple aspects, including detection range, responsivity, and detectivity. The demonstration of various applications in different scenarios and the development of large&#8208;area flexible devices highlight the unique advantages and commercialization prospects of the organic photodetectors. 








Abstract
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have demonstrated significant advantages as a promising next&#8208;generation photodetection technology, especially for application in flexible and curved image sensing. However, there is still a big gap in device performance between OPDs and commercial silicon photodiodes, which hinders their practical application. Herein, using a novel near&#8208;infrared electron acceptor featuring acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor molecular skeleton and electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;substituted terminal groups, the study reports an OPD that can fully compete with the commercial silicon photodiodes. Benefiting from the strong electron push&#8208;pull effect and large molecular dipole moment, the OPD exhibits a broad detection range from 300 to 1100&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency of 70% at 940&#160;nm. Moreover, owing to the reduced energetic disorder and trap density, the OPD exhibits a picoampere&#8208;level dark current density (1.30 &#215; 10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2) at &#8211;0.1&#160;V bias. Such high responsivity and low dark current density endow the OPD with a detectivity surpassing 1013 Jones across the whole spectral range. More importantly, this superior photodetection performance can be maintained in large&#8208;area flexible device (80 mm2). These results demonstrate the huge potential of OPDs in addressing the limitations of silicon photodiodes for application in flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Concentration Antibody Formulation via Solvent&#8208;Based Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous solid antibodies are encapsulated into hydrogel microparticles through a solvent&#8208;based dehydration process. The solvent extracts water from antibody solution droplets, causing the antibody to concentrate, and precipitation of the antibody into amorphous solid is induced. The particles are resuspended into aqueous solution in which they are injectable for subcutaneous delivery at high concentrations.








Abstract
Although subcutaneous (SC) delivery is the preferred administration route for immunotherapies and other biologics for improved patient compliance and lower healthcare costs, it necessitates high&#8208;concentration antibody formulations. However, high&#8208;concentration antibody solutions face significant instabilities and prohibitively high viscosities. Other approaches for high&#8208;concentration formulations have been developed, including non&#8208;aqueous solutions, which can be irritating or painful, and antibody&#8208;laden hydrogel microparticles, which require centrifugation and are limited to concentrations &lt;300 mg&#160;mL&#8722;1. This work presents a new formulation process wherein the antibody is concentrated and encapsulated into hydrogel microparticles via solvent&#8208;based dehydration. The final dosage form is an aqueous particle suspension with a formulation concentration of 360 mg&#160;mL&#8722;1. In this process, microparticles are synthesized continuously, and antibody precipitation is realized simultaneously to dehydration, which allows for higher antibody concentrations. Antibody phase behavior and precipitation&#8211;dehydration kinetics are analyzed. The antibody is structurally and functionally stable in the microparticle post&#8208;processing and after 4 months. Injectability of the suspension meets clinical standards with glide force &lt;20 N. For the first time, an aqueous antibody formulation at high concentrations comparable to non&#8208;aqueous formulations is presented, ideal for subcutaneous administration. The process is envisioned to be generalizable as a platform for SC delivery in multiple clinical&#160;applications.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Stable NIR Nanolasing: Monolithic Integration of PbS CQDs on a Silicon Photonic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared nanolaser is experimentally demonstrated using a high&#8208;Q cavity and Zn&#8208;doped PbS cQDs. The cavity design, cQD performance, and device behavior under fs/ps pumping are systematically studied, achieving the lowest threshold and narrowest linewidth for NIR nanolasers under fs excitation. CW pumping reveals cavity&#8208;enhanced emission across E, S, C, and L telecommunication bands, exhibiting excellent thermal and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Nanolasers based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), while transformative in the visible spectrum, face critical roadblocks in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regime due to material instability under ambient conditions and ultrafast Auger recombination in large NIR CQDs. Here, these limitations are addressed through zinc&#8208;doped PbS CQDs that suppress nonradiative decay, integrated with compact high&#8208;Q silicon nanobeam cavities to leverage the Purcell effect for efficiently guiding spontaneous emission into laser modes, thereby significantly reducing the threshold power. This work demonstrates a monolithic CQD&#8208;integrated silicon photonic platform that achieves NIR lasing under pulsed optical pumping, featuring a record narrow linewidth of 0.29 nm (0.15 meV) at 1579.20 nm and an ultralow threshold of 127 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. Notably, under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pumping, the device exhibits cavity&#8208;filtered spontaneous emission with a sub&#8208;nanometer linewidth across the 1350&#8211;1600 nm spectrum. This emission showcases &lt;6% peak power decay over 15 h at 300 K, robust performance up to 360 K, and negligible degradation after 250 days of ambient storage. By monolithically integrating solution&#8208;processed CQDs with CMOS&#8208;compatible silicon photonics, this platform establishes a reliable, scalable, and low&#8208;cost route toward multiwavelength on&#8208;chip nanolaser arrays in the NIR regime, unlocking transformative potential for compact photonic technologies in imaging, sensing, and communications.

         <title>Thermodynamically Self&#8208;Limiting Presodiation Inducing Homogeneous Inorganic&#8211;Organic Polymer&#8208;Skeleton Interphases for Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamically self&#8208;limiting chemical presodiation is proposed by synergistically integrating sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), which is applicable to diverse cathodes, offering a practical route to advance sodium&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
Cathode&#8208;side chemical presodiation is a promising route to compensate for initial sodium loss in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, conventional presodiated cathodes are prone to oversodiation, structural degradation, and consequent cycling instability under excessive thermodynamic impetus, necessitating stringent control over presodiation duration and thereby limiting their universality and practicality. Here, a universal and thermodynamically self&#8208;limiting chemical presodiation is proposed by synergistically integrating sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Specifically, Na&#8208;DK enables controllable and self&#8208;limiting sodium insertion beyond the stability potential threshold of presodiated cathodes due to diminishing thermodynamic driving force, effectively preventing oversodiation while eliminating the requirement for strict presodiation time control. Simultaneously, Na&#8208;DK initiates a radical&#8208;mediated decomposition of FEC to form homogeneous inorganic&#8211;organic polymer&#8208;skeleton cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) with enhanced mechanical robustness, surpassing conventional PVDF&#8208;derived heterogeneous inorganic&#8208;rich CEIs. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments confirm that when applied to the widely used Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, this strategy delivers exceptional cycling stability, retaining 93.5% capacity after 2000 cycles (4000 h) at 1 C and 92.3% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, among the best performances. Full cells exhibit over twofold capacity enhancement and markedly extended cycle life compared to commercial counterparts. More importantly, this strategy is successfully extended to other cathode chemistries (e.g., Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7), demonstrating its broad applicability.

         <title>Selective Growth of Ferroelectric Ultrathin Nonlayered &#947;&#8208;In2Se3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precursor&#8208;guided CVD method is developed to selectively grow ultrathin &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 crystals with a nonlayered, vacancy&#8208;ordered screw form structure. &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phase In2Se3 are synthesized using different precursors. Ex situ STEM reveals a &#947;&#8208;In2Se3&#8208;to&#8208;InSe phase transition at 600&#160;&#176;C, highlighting the potential of &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 for next&#8208;generation polytypes&#8208;dependent nanoelectromechanical and memory devices.








Abstract
Indium selenide (In2Se3) has received increasing interest due to its diverse polytypes and associated polytype&#8208;dependent ferroelectric properties, making it one of the promising platforms guiding the development of ultrathin ferroelectric nanodevices. To date, &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#946;'&#8208;phase In2Se3 have been well studied, but nonlayered &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 remains underexplored because of sophisticated formation paths and minor energy differences with other phases. Therefore, understanding the growth mechanisms and electronic structures of &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 is crucial to present the full roadmap of the InxSey family. Herein, a precursor&#8208;guided chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is proposed to selectively grow ultrathin &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 crystals with a nonlayered, vacancy&#8208;ordered screw form (VOSF) structure. The sublimation temperature of precursors plays a critical role in selectively synthesizing &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phase In2Se3 using different precursors (In2Se3, In2O3, InCl3). Ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals a &#947;&#8208;In2Se3&#8208;to&#8208;InSe phase transition at 600&#160;&#176;C, consecutively triggered by interlayer bonds broken, vacancy reorganization and removal of Se atoms. Away from existing literature, only out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in &#947;&#8208;In2Se3, driven by vertical off&#8208;center displacements of Se atoms, is detected. Therefore, a full spectrum of In2Se3&#8217;s polytypes, particularly nonlayered ferroelectric &#947;&#8208;In2Se3, is selectively obtained, presenting great potential for next&#8208;generation In2Se3&#8208;based polytypes&#8208;dependent nanoelectromechanical and memory devices.

         <title>Flow&#8208;Regime&#8208;Controlled Fabrication of CNT&#8208;Bridged Vertically Aligned rGO/MXene Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Fiber Supercapacitors</title>

Carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs) are fabricated by flow&#8208;driven wet spinning strategy with precisely regulated flow regimes. The vertical aligned 2D nanosheets are interconnected by CNT, forming continuous conductive networks for fluent ion accumulation and fast electron transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the energy storage performance.








Abstract
The directional construction of electrode frameworks aligned with the transport pathways of ions/electron is critical for electrochemical processes. However, conventional fabrication strategies suffer from bottlenecks such as complex processes, and difficulty in scaling up production. In this work, a flow&#8208;driven wet&#8208;spinning strategy is developed to fabricate carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs). Enabled by precisely regulating of flow regimes, the vertical aligned rGO/MXene nanosheets and CNT&#8208;bridged structure collaboratively establish open porous channels for rapid ion transport, continuous conductive networks for efficient electron transfer, and abundant accessible active sites for enhanced charge storage. Consequently, the CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMF electrode exhibits improved ion transport, exceptional specific capacitance (740 F g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability (98% retention after 30&#160;000 cycles) in H2SO4 electrolyte. The assembled flexible asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a remarkable energy density of 224&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (at 1200&#160;W kg&#8722;1) while maintaining robust mechanical flexibility.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeting Co&#8208;Delivery of T&#8208;Cell Antigen and Camptothecin Guided by Cascade&#8208;Responsive Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly to Reshape Tumor Antigenicity for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A cascade&#8208;responsive peptide self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed for co&#8208;delivering camptothecin and T&#8208;cell antigen to tumors. The approach successfully reshapes tumor antigenicity by efficiently endowing tumor cells with exogenous peptide antigens through the intracellular class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC&#8208;I)&#8208;associated antigen presentation pathway. When combined with the adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells and immune checkpoint blockade, our strategy effectively inhibits tumor growth.








Abstract
Antigen presentation deficiency restricted by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC&#8208;I) causes low antigenicity and antigen escape in tumors, thereby limiting T&#8208;cell immunotherapy outcomes. Here, a combined tumor immunotherapy is developed, in which tumors can present exogenous non&#8208;tumor antigens, and adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells specific for these antigens are re&#8208;targeted to attack tumors. The approach leverages a cascade&#8208;responsive peptide self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;deliver suitable antigens and the chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin (CPT) to tumors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, to re&#8208;target ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;specific OT&#8208;I CD8+ T cells against tumors, PSA (Nap&#8208;GFFpYE&#8208;ss&#8208;Ag) and CPSA (CPT&#8208;GFFpYE&#8208;ss&#8208;Ag) are constructed, containing an OVA&#8208;derived epitope OVA257&#8208;264 and/or CPT. The design enables the release of a unique N&#8208;terminal extended OVA257&#8208;264 and CPT into the cytosol. As a result, the extended antigen is efficiently presented on the tumor surface by MHC&#8208;I, and CPT further enhances this presentation. When combined with adoptively transferred OT&#8208;I CD8+ T cells, the approach effectively facilitates CD8+ T cell infiltration and tumor inhibition. Additionally, CPSA treatment sensitizes immune responses to programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) blockade, allowing the approach to synergize with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody for improved tumor eradication.

         <title>Three&#8208;Phase Interfacial Force Regulated Solid&#8208;Like Liquid&#8208;Slider for Highly Efficient and Robust Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like liquid&#8208;slider triboelectric nanogenerator is proposed, which enables stable operation of patterned liquid as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical by regulating three&#8208;phase interfacial forces, demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term durability and a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%.








Abstract
Conventional sliding mode triboelectric nanogenerators convert low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy into electricity through relative motion between solid&#8208;solid tribo&#8208;layers. However, the inherent trade&#8208;off between maintaining close contact and mitigating interfacial friction hinders the device's energy conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Here, a solid&#8208;like liquid&#8208;slider triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG) is proposed, where milliliter&#8208;scale liquid motion is precisely governed by a liquid&#8208;driver consisting of a hydrophilic interface enclosed by a hydrophobic boundary. By theoretical analysis and experimental regulation of solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase interfacial forces, stable operation of the liquid&#8208;slider with a designed pattern is realized as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical.

     alt="Three-Phase Interfacial Force Regulated Solid-Like Liquid-Slider for Highly Efficient and Robust Triboelectric Nanogenerator"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid-like liquid-slider triboelectric nanogenerator is proposed, which enables stable operation of patterned liquid as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical by regulating three-phase interfacial forces, demonstrating remarkable long-term durability and a record-high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional sliding mode triboelectric nanogenerators convert low-frequency mechanical energy into electricity through relative motion between solid-solid tribo-layers. However, the inherent trade-off between maintaining close contact and mitigating interfacial friction hinders the device's energy conversion efficiency and long-term stability. Here, a solid-like liquid-slider triboelectric nanogenerator (LS-TENG) is proposed, where milliliter-scale liquid motion is precisely governed by a liquid-driver consisting of a hydrophilic interface enclosed by a hydrophobic boundary. By theoretical analysis and experimental regulation of solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three-phase interfacial forces, stable operation of the liquid-slider with a designed pattern is realized as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical. Benefiting from the shape-adaptivity and ultra-smooth properties of the liquid, a palm-sized LS-TENG outputs 2856 &#181;J of energy per cycle with an average torque of just 0.73 mN&#183;m at 30&#160;rpm, achieving a record-high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%. The optimized friction during solid-liquid dynamic interactions ensures the excellent stability of LS-TENG over six months of continuous operation. Moreover, the encapsulated LS-TENG autonomously initiates under a 1.3 m&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; breeze, powering 960 series-connected green LEDs and enabling wireless wind speed monitoring. The regulation of three-phase interfacial forces in solid-liquid TENG provides a feasible path for efficient and reliable mechanical energy harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiply Nano&#8208;Twinned Copper as a &#8220;Dual&#8208;Site Cooperative&#8221; Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study prepares Multiply Nano&#8208;Twinned Copper (MNTs&#8208;Cu) via a &#8220;dual nonequilibrium&#8221; strategy. As a &#8220;dual&#8208;site cooperative&#8221; catalyst, it enhances NIRR performance, achieving a high NH3 yield of 112.03&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.7&#160;V vs RHE, and notably, it can continuously maintain a high FENH3 of &gt;99% within the high potential range, offering insights for H*&#8208;involved reactions.








Abstract
To advance the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NIRR) to ammonia, it is essential to rationally regulate the kinetics of active hydrogen (H*). Nevertheless, an in&#8208;depth understanding of H* generation, transfer, and utilization remains elusive, which impedes exploring strategies for optimizing H* dynamics. In this study, a copper nanocrystalline is developed with a multiply nano&#8208;twinned structure (MNTs&#8208;Cu) using a &#8220;dual nonequilibrium&#8221; strategy to optimize H* dynamics and enhance NIRR performance. Experimental and theoretical studies show that MNTs&#8208;Cu functions as a &#8220;dual&#8208;site cooperative&#8221; catalyst, addressing the H* supply&#8208;consumption balance to boost ammonia electrosynthesis. Specifically, the Cu sites are responsible for the activation of nitrate, while the nano&#8208;twinned structure serves as an &#8220;active hydrogen hub&#8221; to facilitate the generation, transfer, and utilization of H*. The MNTs&#8208;Cu catalyst achieves a high NH3 yield of 112.03&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.7&#160;V vs RHE, and notably, it can continuously maintain a high FENH3 of &gt;99% within the high potential range from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;0.9&#160;V vs RHE. This work provides a novel pathway for optimizing H* behavior through structural engineering, offering insights for advancing NIRR and other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Programmable Photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Triggered by a Temperature&#8208;Adaptation Spin Polarization Electron Pump</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a temperature&#8208;adaptation spin polarization electron pump that enables directional electron transfer and suppresses charge recombination. The injected spin polarization electrons stabilize CO* intermediates and promote their hydrogenation toward CH4, achieving reversible product selectivity and enhanced CO2 photoreduction efficiency.








Abstract
Selective control of CO2 photoreduction toward CO or CH4 is essential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion. Reversible switching between these two products remains challenging because conventional photocatalysts cannot adjust charge behavior with temperature, and polar intermediates are insufficiently stabilized. A temperature&#8208;adaptation photocatalytic platform that acts as a spin polarization electron pump, delivering programmable interfacial electron injection and dynamically steering CO2 reduction pathways in real time is reported. At low temperature, adaptive modulation increases interfacial electron accumulation at the reaction interface, extending the lifetime and reactivity of deep&#8208;pathway intermediates without altering catalyst composition. Consequently, product selectivity reversibly shifts from CO at high temperature to CH4 at low temperature, enabling controlled access to either shallow or deep reduction products under reliably well&#8208;defined thermal conditions. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrate enhanced spin polarization and reduced charge recombination upon cooling, consistent with stronger interfacial electron retention. In situ infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics reveal that spin polarization&#8208;selective transfer bends CO2 and induces C&#9472;O bond asymmetry, which facilitates CHO* formation and lowers the barrier for CO* hydrogenation to CH4. Collectively, these findings establish a generalizable strategy that integrates spin polarization with temperature responsiveness to realize dynamically programmable product selectivity in solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.

         <title>Mass Diffusion&#8208;Dominated Phase Separation Enabling On&#8208;Demand and Repeatable Lifetime Programming of Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) polymer hydrogels with programmable lifetimes are designed via mass diffusion&#8208;dominated phase separation. Their lifetimes are tunable from 9.1 to 130.8 ms by varying heating time (0&#8211;60 min), and repeatable RTP is achieved under heating/cooling cycles. These hydrogels serve as rewritable spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting platforms for time&#8208;dependent information display.








Abstract
Current luminescent polymer hydrogels rely primarily on tunable emission intensities/colors. Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels with on&#8208;demand programmable lifetimes, albeit long envisaged, have never been achieved, but such RTP hydrogels will provide another lifetime dimension to enrich the family of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials for broadening their emerging applications. Herein, the mass diffusion&#8208;dominated phase separation strategy is proposed to develop the first RTP polymer hydrogels, whose lifetime can be continuously programmed from 9.1 to 130.8&#160;ms. Upon heating at 90 &#176;C, cooperative coordination and hydrophobic interactions in hydrogels induce a dense/sparse polymer phase separation, leading to controllable rubbery&#8208;to&#8208;glassy transition with 154&#8208;fold enhancement in Young's modulus, thereby efficiently restricting molecular vibrations and stabilizing triplet excitons. Note that the hydrogels&#8217; RTP performance is essentially not controlled by heat transport but is dominated by phase&#8208;separation kinetics, therefore their lifetimes can be widely programmed by merely manipulating the heating duration. Further natural cooling at 25&#160;&#176;C makes polymer phase re&#8208;fusion to recover the rubbery state, enabling the repeatable RTP lifetime programming. Based on these findings, rewritable spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved information decryption platform with time&#8208;dependent security is demonstrated. This study opens new avenues of RTP hydrogels by demonstrating the unprecedented lifetime&#8208;programming capacity and enriches the intelligence of luminescent materials.

         <title>Unique Dual&#8208;Affinity Strategy for Specific Lipopolysaccharide Clearance in Sepsis Therapy: Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Molecularly Imprinted Polymers via Emulsion Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of achieving specific LPS clearance in sepsis, a dual&#8208;affinity adsorbent (PS@PA&#8208;PHK+) is developed that converges the high binding affinity of peptides with the shape&#8208;selective recognition capability of molecularly imprinted polymers. PS@PA&#8208;PHK+ demonstrates high specificity, broad&#8208;spectrum selectivity toward diverse LPS types, and strong adsorption capacity, representing the key features of a new generation of hemoperfusion materials.








Abstract
Sepsis is an infection&#8208;induced organ dysfunction with high global morbidity and mortality. Specific clearance of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), key pathological drivers in sepsis, from the bloodstream is critical for effective therapy.

&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of achieving specific LPS clearance in sepsis, a dual-affinity adsorbent (PS@PA-P&lt;sub&gt;HK&lt;/sub&gt;+) is developed that converges the high binding affinity of peptides with the shape-selective recognition capability of molecularly imprinted polymers. PS@PA-P&lt;sub&gt;HK&lt;/sub&gt;+ demonstrates high specificity, broad-spectrum selectivity toward diverse LPS types, and strong adsorption capacity, representing the key features of a new generation of hemoperfusion materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is an infection-induced organ dysfunction with high global morbidity and mortality. Specific clearance of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), key pathological drivers in sepsis, from the bloodstream is critical for effective therapy. However, selective capture of LPS is challenging due to their structural heterogeneity, extremely low concentrations (ng&#183;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and complexity of blood components. Here, a novel dual-affinity strategy is presented for designing high-specificity LPS adsorbents. Leveraging phage display, a high-affinity peptide ligand (P-HK) targeting the LPS family is identified by screening against their conserved Kdo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Lipid A structure. Concurrently, delicate molecularly imprinted polymers (PS@PA+) with geometrically matched cavities are synthesized via emulsion interfacial polymerization, exploiting the oriented assembly of amphiphilic LPS templates at oil-water interfaces. Conjugation of the imprinted polymers with the peptide ligand produced PS@PA-P&lt;sub&gt;HK&lt;/sub&gt;+, which exhibits highly specific LPS binding and demonstrates exceptional performance, including remarkable &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; LPS clearance efficiency (99.2% in buffer; 95.4% in blood), high adsorption capacity (543 EU&#183;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), broad-spectrum clearance of diverse bacterial LPSs, robust anti-fouling properties, and satisfactory biocompatibility. Furthermore, PS@PA-P&lt;sub&gt;HK&lt;/sub&gt;+-based hemoperfusion in a septic rabbit model confirmed significant therapeutic efficacy, remarkably reducing circulating LPS levels and mitigating organ damage. This material design overcomes the challenge of specific LPS clearance, offering substantial promise for transformative sepsis therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrated Hollow Microfibers of Covalent Organic Framework on Cu Foil as a Gradient Zn Metal Anode Host for Bottom&#8208;Up Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated hollow microfibers of covalent organic framework on Cu foil (HMCOF&#8208;Cu) is designed as a gradient host for Zn metal anode. Owing to the carbonyl groups in the surface HMCOF layer and hierarchical pores, the HMCOF&#8208;Cu host presents rapid desolvation of hydrated Zn2+, fast Zn2+ ions diffusion and reduced volume change for bottom&#8208;up Zn deposition without dendrite.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising choices for future grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of cost&#8208;effectiveness, high&#8208;rate performance and safety. Nonetheless, the sluggish desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ ions usually leads to uncontrolled Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Herein, we report the formation of integrated hollow microfibers of covalent organic frameworks on Cu foil (denoted as HMCOF&#8208;Cu) as a ZMA host with gradient design. Of note, interactions between carbonyl groups of HMCOF and H2O in [Zn(H2O)6]2+ promote rapid desolvation of hydrated Zn2+. Besides, 3D&#160;HMCOF network can accelerate Zn2+ diffusion and accommodate the volumetric deformation during the deposition/stripping cycles. Moreover, the gradient design can induce bottom&#8208;up deposition for dendrite&#8208;free ZMA. As a result, the HMCOF&#8208;Cu host enables stable Zn plating/stripping processes over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cell based on HMCOF&#8208;Cu@Zn anode presents a long&#8208;term stability over 7000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Dual&#8208;B&#8208;Site Strategy Underpins Stable Unimodal Deep&#8208;Blue Emitting Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;B&#8208;Site strategy is innovatively proposed to underpin stable unimodal deep&#8208;blue perovskite emission. The new approach suppresses phase segregation and eliminates green emission in blue perovskite emitters by controlling energy transfer dynamics. This study provides the first mechanistic explanation of this process and offers a universal design rule to prevent spectral instability in single&#8208;halide blue perovskite emitters.








Abstract
The operational stability of mixed&#8208;halide blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is fundamentally constrained by intrinsic halide ion migration. Employing single&#8208;halide perovskite systems represents a viable route to circumvent this issue, yet solution&#8208;processed pure&#8208;bromide perovskites typically exhibit undesirable green emission, impeding attainment of high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue electroluminescence. Herein, this challenge is addressed through the strategic incorporation of Mg2+ into the B&#8208;site of the pure bromine&#8208;based perovskite lattice. This substitution induces a substantial spectral blueshift and promotes phase homogenization by facilitating efficient energy transfer from small&#8208;n to large&#8208;n phases. Notably, the first systematic investigation and mechanistic elucidation of the origin of bimodal emission in blue PeLEDs is presented. Consequently, the champion PeLED delivers stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 464&#160;nm with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 4.76%. This study presents a definitive paradigm for achieving spectrally stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission from single&#8208;halide perovskites. The elucidated mechanism underlying emission bimodality provides critical guidance for future development of blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Dual Vacancy&#8208;Driven &#8220;Lattice Softening&#8221; NiFeAlx LDHs for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Chloride Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mild room&#8208;temperature etching strategy, rational construction of dual&#8208;vacancy domains and multidimensional ion pathways is realized in NiFeAlx layered double hydroxide cathodes. The vacancy&#8208;rich, lattice&#8208;softened framework enables elastic strain accommodation and rapid Cl&#8722; diffusion, delivering unprecedented cycling stability and high&#8208;rate performance beyond previously reported chloride&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Defect engineering becomes an essential strategy for enhancing electrochemical performance, yet its application in anion&#8208;based systems such as chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) remains largely unexplored. Herein, a rational defect&#8208;engineering strategy is developed to overcome these bottlenecks by constructing dual&#8208;vacancy NiFeAlx layered double hydroxides (LDHs) featuring coexisting cationic and oxygen vacancies, achieved via a room&#8208;temperature alkaline etching process that selectively leaches Al3+ while retaining layered integrity. The optimized NiFeAl0.04&#8208;24h&#8208;Cl LDH exhibits unprecedented &#8220;lattice softening&#8221; behavior, enabling elastic deformation and dynamic structural reconstruction to accommodate volumetric fluctuations during Cl&#8208;intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Benefiting from this defect&#8208;induced structural flexibility, the electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 101.4 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, along with the Coulombic efficiency of 99.91%. Multiscale mechanistic analyses demonstrate that the coupled vacancies regulate local electronic distribution and coordination environments while simultaneously imparting pronounced lattice softening and structural elasticity to the NiFeAl0.04&#8208;24h&#8208;Cl LDH, thereby facilitating enhanced Cl&#8722; ion accommodation. Furthermore, the vacancies construct interconnected 3D ion highways, which dramatically accelerate Cl&#8722; diffusion, enhance interfacial adsorption kinetics, and minimize charge&#8208;transfer resistance. Such lattice&#8208;adaptive regulation resolves the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between anion&#8208;storage capacity and structural stability in LDH&#8208;based systems, offering a promising strategy for designing efficient anion&#8208;hosting electrodes for advanced CIB systems.

This study demonstrates that the in&#8208;plane crystallographic anisotropy of the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals ferroelectric semiconductor &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 is a critical determinant of ferroelectric switching dynamics and memory performance. Our results reveal orientation&#8208;dependent transport pathways, Schottky barrier modulation, and electrostatic potential energy that dictate polarization reversal and synaptic functionality.








Abstract
The ferroelectric semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (FeS&#8208;FETs) based on &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 emerge as promising non&#8208;volatile memory devices. However, the intrinsic in&#8208;plane (IP) crystallographic anisotropy of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 introduces orientation dependence, leading to pronounced variations in memory performance depending on the IP alignment of the source/drain (S/D) contacts. This study presents the first demonstration of IP anisotropy&#8208;dependent ferroelectricity in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 FeS&#8208;FETs with S/D contacts aligned along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. The AC&#8208;aligned S/D configuration achieves a ferroelectric resistance switching (FRS) ratio of 6.42, an on/off current ratio of 4.53 &#215; 104, and a normalized memory window (MW) of 59 %, whereas the ZZ&#8208;aligned counterpart exhibits an FRS ratio of 1.05, an on/off ratio of 5.25, and negligible MW. The electron transports proceed through twisted pathways along the AC direction, but proceed along a straight trajectory in the ZZ direction to avoid high&#8208;energy barrier regions due to the threefold rotational symmetric lattice. Thus, the excessive electron transmission and a reduced Schottky barrier height effectively screen the influence of ferroelectric bound charges in the ZZ&#8208;aligned S/D contacts. These findings establish clear correlations between IP anisotropy and the ferroelectric functionality of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3, offering critical guidelines for the design of FeS&#8208;FETs.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Length&#8208;Selective Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Regulation via Competitive and Cooperative Pathways in Solid&#8208;State Macrocyclic Host&#8211;Guest Systems</title>

A dual&#8208;mode macrocyclic host&#8211;guest approach enables chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective modulation of solid&#8208;state charge&#8208;transfer interactions via competitive and cooperative pathways, achieving aldehyde&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered structural reorganization, switchable vapochromic sensing, and dynamically tunable photothermal conversion efficiency in responsive organic cocrystals.








Abstract
Dynamic regulation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions in the solid state remains a key challenge in developing responsive functional materials. Herein, a dual&#8208;mode supramolecular strategy&#8212;is reported based on competitive and cooperative host&#8211;guest interactions&#8212;for constructing dynamic macrocycle&#8208;based CT complexes with tunable optical and photothermal properties in response to aliphatic aldehyde vapors. Two pillararene&#8208;derived macrocyclic hosts, EtLP6 and EtFLP6, form disordered CT assemblies with F4TCNQ via solvent&#8208;free grinding. These CT complexes exhibit chain&#8208;length&#8208;dependent vapochromic behavior governed by distinct mechanisms: guest&#8208;triggered disassembly or reassembly of D&#8211;A structures in EtLP6&#8208;F4TCNQ&#945; (competitive regulation), and aldehyde&#8208;assisted ternary CT assembly in EtFLP6&#8208;F4TCNQ&#945; (cooperative regulation). Single&#8208;crystal structures incorporating X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and spectral analyses reveal vapor&#8208;induced structural transformations that correlate directly with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption changes. Notably, such CT&#8208;state modulation enables the first vapor&#8208;regulated organic photothermal cocrystal system, with conversion efficiency tunable from non&#8208;detectable levels to over 11% under 808&#160;nm irradiation. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing solid&#8208;state supramolecular materials with multi&#8208;responsive optical and thermal functions via macrocyclic host&#8211;guest chemistry.

         <title>Topological Structure&#8208;Induced Piezoelectricity from the &#945;&#8208;Phase Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The findings reveal a meron&#8208;like topological polar structure in the ring&#8208;banded spherulites of &#945;&#8208;phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The symmetry breaking induced by strain&#8208;gradient twisted lamellae generates a net polarization, which accounts for the observed unprecedented piezoelectricity. The topology&#8208;induced polarization mechanism uncovered in this work offers a generalizable strategy for engineering diverse polar polymers with unprecedented polarization&#8208;dependent functionalities.








Abstract
Topologically polar structures offer a rich landscape for uncovering emergent phenomena inaccessible in traditional ferroelectric materials. In contrast to the numerous examples found in ferroelectric oxides, topological structures identified in ferroelectric polymers are extremely rare. Here, the creation of a meron&#8208;like topological polar structure is demonstrated in the non&#8208;polar &#945;&#8208;phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The formation of the twisted lamellae within ring&#8208;banded polymer spherulites and the resulting topological structure are revealed using combined experimental and computational methods. Non&#8208;zero polarization is demonstrated using Kelvin probe force microscopy, second harmonic generation measurement, and dielectric spectroscopy, and verify the facilitation of polarization orientation by strain in the topological &#945;&#8208;phase PVDF. Accordingly, piezoelectricity in the topological &#945;&#8208;phase PVDF is demonstrated through both direct and converse measurements and reveals a strong correlation between polarization, the piezoelectric coefficient, and the topological structure. This result offers a new perspective on creating polar topological structures and inducing formerly symmetry&#8208;forbidden properties like piezoelectricity in the non&#8208;polar phase of ferroelectric polymers.

         <title>Stopping Phase Separation Enables Durable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locking polyquaternium network strategy is proposed to suppress local electric fields that drive light&#8208;induced phase segregation. This approach enables wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite photovoltaics to achieve high efficiencies under both indoor and outdoor illumination, accompanied by extended operational stability. The findings establish a general design principle for durable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and open new opportunities for indoor energy harvesting and integration with the Internet of Things.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced halide segregation presents a fundamental barrier to the longevity of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a multifunctional ionic polymer, polyquaternium&#8208;37, is reported as an effective grain boundary passivator to inhibit the degradation pathway. This dual&#8208;interaction mechanism concertedly arrests halide migration at grain boundaries, thereby suppressing local electric&#8208;field and ultimately curbing light&#8208;induced phase separation. Consequently, the modified WBG perovskites demonstrate robust photostability under light stress. The champion inverted perovskite photovoltaic device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.86% under AM 1.5G illumination and an outstanding indoor PCE of 43.19% under 1000 lux. Remarkably, the modified device exhibits a projected T90 lifetime exceeding 10 000 h under continuous indoor light cycling. This work pioneers a facile solution to halide segregation via grain boundary engineering, paving the way for operationally stable WBG perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Close&#8208;Loop Cathode Chemistry Enables Self&#8208;Rejuvenating Aqueous Zn&#8211;Te Batteries Compromised by Non&#8208;Equilibrium Redox Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

Triethylsulfonium iodide (TESI) inhibits Te shuttling in aqueous Zn&#8208;Te batteries through three synergistic functions. TES+ forms a protective interphase on Zn, blocking shuttling and enabling uniform plating. I&#8722; catalyzes Te redox with reduced hysteresis, while generated I3&#8722; establishes closed&#8208;loop I3&#8722;/&#8722; redox to regenerate the cathode. This enables 94.3% capacity retention after 1500 cycles with a 12&#8208;hour rest.








Abstract
Tellurium (Te) emerges as an alluring cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, boasting an unrivaled six&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer capacity (1260 mAh g&#8722;1 and 7829 mAh cm&#8722;3). However, the battery performance and cycling stability are severely degraded by inherent TeOx&#183;H2O(aq) shuttle arising from proton&#8208;tunneling&#8208;induced non&#8208;equilibrium electrochemical hydrolysis, where proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dominates. In this work, a rejuvenation of dead Zn&#8211;Te batteries is demonstrated based on a close&#8208;loop chemistry via employing organic triethylsulfonium iodide (C6H15SI, TESI). The triiodide anions (I3&#8722;) are found to reduce dissolved TeOx&#183;H2O(aq.) with thermodynamic favorability to revitalize Te cathode, meanwhile, generated I2 is recycled back into the electrolyte by reacting with iodide anions. Simply left resting for 12&#160;h, a completely degraded Zn&#8211;Te cell (1500 cycles) recovered 94.3% of its initial capacity (465 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, TES+ is found to promote an anode solid electrolyte interphase via detaching ethyl. The functional layer efficaciously prevented anode passivation caused by tellurium&#8208;shuttling and facilitated efficient zinc&#8208;ion transfer to achieve dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. This loop chemistry not only extends the lifespan of batteries but also enables the reuse of materials, potentially reducing the overall cost of battery production and resource consumption.

&lt;p&gt;Triethylsulfonium iodide (TESI) inhibits Te shuttling in aqueous Zn-Te batteries through three synergistic functions. TES&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; forms a protective interphase on Zn, blocking shuttling and enabling uniform plating. I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; catalyzes Te redox with reduced hysteresis, while generated I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; establishes closed-loop I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; redox to regenerate the cathode. This enables 94.3% capacity retention after 1500 cycles with a 12-hour rest.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Observation of Atom Motion and Manipulation of Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controling focused electron beam irradiation on KTaO3 single crystal, not only atomic scale phase transformation from KTaO3 to K6Ta10.8O30 can be triggered along a specific crystalline direction, but also Ta atom migration process is directly observed. Moreover, the tetragonal tungsten bronze K6Ta10.8O30 formed here remains stable at ambient condition.








Abstract
Precisely controlling structural transformations is essential for realizing novel functionalities in crystal materials, as these transformations often result in significant changes in physical and chemical properties. However, such structural control at the atomic scale remains a formidable challenge. Here the direct observation and realization of atomic scale structural transformation is demonstrated from KTaO3 to K6Ta10.8O30 via high&#8208;energy electron beam manufacturing in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), which can finally manipulate the Ta atom movements. The K and O vacancies in KTaO3 can be introduced via the knock&#8208;on energy transferred from the controled high&#8208;dose electron beams. These vacancies can further accommodate Ta atom emerging at the interstitial sites of the TaO2 plane in KTaO3. Thus, all atom species in KTaO3 can be stimulated via electron beam and the cooperative movements of them trigger the final formation of the new K6Ta10.8O30 phase. The detailed mechanisms are revealed by low&#8208;dose, in situ, atomic scale imaging under STEM. The controllability of this electron beam manufacture process and the stability of the new K6Ta10.8O30 phase is further validated. DFT calculations rationalize the triggering steps of the manufacture process and show the transformation is energetically beneficial at the condition of K and O vacancies introduced by knock&#8208;on effect. This work not only investigates the microscopic mechanism of electron beam&#8208;induced structural transformation, but also establishes a versatile pathway for synthesizing new functional materials with tailored properties.

         <title>NH3&#8208;Guided Low&#8208;Temperature Nanostructural Refinement Boosts Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven H2O2 Synthesis in Ionic Carbon Nitrides</title>

         <dc:description>
A nanostructural refinement strategy is reported for KPHI photocatalysts using NH4Cl in a molten salt environment to induce coherent domain fragmentation and controlled cyano defect formation. This dual modification promotes n&#8594;&#960;* transitions, enhances charge separation, and accelerates ORR kinetics, yielding exceptional AQY values of 49% (410 nm) and 5% (525 nm) without cocatalysts.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven oxygen reduction on ionic carbon nitride frameworks presents a compelling strategy for sustainable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Herein, a nanostructural engineering strategy is presented to tailor the morphology and defect chemistry of potassium poly(heptazine imide) (KPHI), enabling extended solar coverage and enhance photocatalytic performance. By incorporating NH4Cl into a molten KCl/LiCl eutectic medium, simultaneous nanoscale fragmentation of KPHI crystals and controlled introduction of cyano (&#8211;C&#8801;N) defects are achieved. These molecular modifications induce n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transitions, facilitate efficient charge separation, and accelerate oxygen reduction reaction kinetics. The optimal catalyst reaches an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 49% at 410&#160;nm and 5% at 525&#160;nm without the need for cocatalysts, among the highest values reported for metal&#8208;free photocatalyst systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms preferential photoexcited electron localization at &#8211;C&#8801;N sites, highlighting their key role in enhancing the charge carrier dynamics. Crucially, autogenous NH3 pressure is harnessed from NH4Cl decomposition to unlock a low&#8208;temperature (500 &#176;C) KPHI variant that delivers analogous performance to its counterpart produced at 600&#160;&#176;C, offering a more sustainable synthetic route. This study elucidates the structure&#8208;activity relationship in ionic carbon nitrides and provides a generalizable approach for controlling their morphology and defect characteristics.

         <title>Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic WO3&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Simultaneous N2 Fixation and H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed by combining multiple doping strategies together in WO3 nanoplates. The optimized photocatalyst exbibits enhanced light absorption, hot charge carrier generation, and N2 activation. It can produce NH3 and H2O2 simultaneously. A type of floating biphasic plasmonic photocatalytic film is further fabricated to improve the efficiency and scalability of the photocatalytic process.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has recently received much attention in generating high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalysts are frontier materials that can effectively employ localized surface plasmon resonance to generate and utilize hot charge carriers. Herein, the development of a new type of Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic WO3&#8208;based photocatalyst through hydrogen doping, oxygen vacancy (OV) introduction, and metal doping is reported. Hydrogen doping and OV introduction broaden the light absorption range of the WO3&#8208;based photocatalyst, thereby enabling the generation of more hot charge carriers. Metal doping provides more catalytically active sites. More interestingly, both hot electrons and holes can be used to generate high&#8208;value&#8208;added products, i.e., ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. The optimal Mo&#8208;H0.23WO3&#8722;x photocatalyst exhibits excellent ammonia and hydrogen peroxide production rates of 187.53 and 196.25 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively. Furthermore, a biphasic photocatalytic system is designed to suppress light absorption by water and maximize sunlight utilization. This work expands the scope of plasmonic photocatalysts towards degenerately doped plasmonic metal oxide semiconductors and provides a new paradigm for the solar&#8208;driven generation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Afterglow from Luminescent Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments has been developed by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators. 








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent polymeric materials which combine afterglow emission with mechanical flexibility and adaptability to external stimuli are well&#8208;suited for dynamic optical devices, encoding, anticounterfeiting, and soft robotics. However, current systems rely on static matrices and organic phosphors, which limit their afterglow duration, flexibility, processability, and responsiveness to various stimuli. Here, an active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators is demonstrated. The resulting material exhibits ultralong emission (up to 1200 s) in the dark, enabling reprogrammable information encryption and reversible scattering&#8208;to&#8208;transparent transition upon mechanical, thermal, or light stimuli, allowing for multimodal decoding. A bicolor, spatially encoded phosphorescent soft actuator is fabricated that appears plain and unmarked under daylight, but reveals structured emission in the dark while simultaneously exhibiting shape change under heat or light. Incorporation of an additional fluorescent dye further endows the system with light&#8208;environment sensitivity, enabling luminescent rolling wheels and fiber actuators capable of self&#8208;signaling and recovery tracking. This work not only demonstrates constructing active luminescent materials but also provides valuable insights toward adaptive and interactive glowing optical devices.

         <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon&#8208;Enhanced Sum&#8208;Frequency Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear optical microscopy technique is introduced that enables rapid imaging of hexagonal boron nitride monolayers, which are usually optically invisible. The nonlinear mixing of mid&#8208;infrared and visible laser pulses enables full crystallographic imaging through phase&#8208;resolved sum&#8208;frequency generation microscopy, where the resonant excitation of a phonon provides 800&#8208;fold enhancement.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono&#8208; and few&#8208;layer samples of hBN however, remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here, phase&#8208;resolved sum&#8208;frequency microscopy is introduced as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualizing their crystal orientation. Femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses are used for sum&#8208;frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide&#8208;field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an &#8776;800&#8208;fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;&#181;m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Heterodyne detection combined with azimuthal sample rotation further provides full crystallographic information. Combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation reveals that triangular domains of CVD&#8208;grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen&#8208;terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy is an ultra&#8208;sensitive tool with the potential to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles in a wide range of van der Waals structures, where locating and identifying monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.

         <title>Creating Favorable Pt/Co Interfaces via a Two&#8208;Step Approach for Constructing Highly Durable PtCo Intermetallic Fuel Cell Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino acid&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step approach is developed to prepare L12&#8208;Pt3Co intermetallic catalyst with an increased ordering degree for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The optimal amino acids (L&#8208;Cystine) can establish a favorable Co&#8208;rich environment around fine Pt nanoparticles during thermal conversion, facilitating Co diffusion into the Pt nanoparticles. The L12&#8208;Pt3Co demonstrates compelling performance and long&#8208;term durability in MEA under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, attributed to the high degree of ordering in the Pt3Co catalyst.








Abstract
Structurally ordered PtCo intermetallics are one of the most promising oxygen&#8208;reduction catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to their intrinsically improved catalytic activity and stability relative to PtCo solid&#8208;solution alloys. However, increasing the heating temperature to achieve a desirable high degree of ordering results in severe particle agglomeration and low mass activity and stability. Herein, a two&#8208;step synthesis approach is developed to create an L12&#8208;Pt3Co intermetallic structure with an increased ordering degree and well&#8208;dispersed ultrafine particles. The first step of the synthesis yields ultrafine Pt nanoparticles that are well&#8208;dispersed on the ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon support. The second adsorption step enables us to fine&#8208;tune the Pt and Co interfaces, assisted by optimal amino acids, to establish a favorable Co&#8208;rich environment around fine Pt nanoparticles, facilitating Co diffusion into the Pt crystalline under mild thermal conditions (&lt;800 &#176;C). This two&#8208;step ordered L12&#8208;Pt3Co catalyst is systematically evaluated using membrane electrode assemblies under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle (HDV) conditions and demonstrated exceptional performance and durability, retaining 1.35 A cm&#8208;2 only a 7% loss in current density at 0.7&#160;V after an extensive accelerated stress test of 150,000 voltage cycles.

Cyclically regenerated Co atom clusters (Coac) from the heterostructured CoSe&#8208;ZnSe bimetallic selenide anode are novel, high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state bulk electrocatalysts. They significantly accelerate ZnSe anode conversion reactions for fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries, overcoming solid&#8208;state bulk catalyst design bottlenecks with high catalytic efficiency, electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;passivation in long&#8208;cycle tests, endowing the battery with excellent cycle stability and ultra&#8208;high rate performance.









Abstract
Catalysts are pivotal in enhancing reaction kinetics across various domains, including energy conversion and storage. However, their application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has been largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by solid&#8208;solid conversion reactions in bulk electrode materials, and electrochemical instability and passivation of electrocatalysts during cycling. Herein, this study presents that Co atom clusters (Coac) cyclically regenerate from a designed heterostructure of bimetallic selenides anode (CoSe&#8211;ZnSe) during electrochemical lithiation process as a novel and effective solid&#8208;state bulk&#8208;phase electrocatalyst can significantly accelerate conversion reactions of ZnSe anode for fast&#8208;charging LIBs. The propose strategy overcomes the bottlenecks in solid&#8208;state bulk&#8208;phase catalyst design, imparting Coac catalyst with high catalytic efficiency, full&#8208;voltage&#8208;range electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;passivation during long&#8208;cycling test. With catalytic effect of Coac, the batteries demonstrate fast&#8208;charging performance such as unprecedented rate capability up to 50 A g&#8722;1, as well as high&#8208;rate long cyclability (3000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Ultrahigh Cell Density 3D Bioprinting by Acoustic Fluids&#8208;mediated Stereolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic fluids&#8208;mediated stereolithography (ASL) enables ultrahigh cell density 3D bioprinting by using surface acoustic waves to assemble cells for biomimetic constructs with hierarchical architectures. Integrated with acoustic&#8208;assisted medium exchange, ASL rapidly fabricates functional liver models, advancing disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and artificial organ engineering.








Abstract
Dense cell populations and their complex structures are the essentials of physiologically functional solid organs, but their biomimetic construction is challenging. Here, an ultrahigh cell density (UHCD) bioprinting system is presented for fabricating organ&#8208;analogous intricate architectures based on an acoustic fluids&#8208;mediated stereolithography (ASL) technique. The ASL can achieve cell aggregation on a prepolymerized solid&#8211;liquid interface with densities comparable to native tissues through focused surface acoustic waves&#8208;induced vortices. Meanwhile, the ASL&#8208;based UHCD bioprinting shows reduced light scattering in each ultrathin layer printing process, reaching cell densities of 1 billion cells&#160;mL&#8722;1. Additionally, by incorporating an acoustic&#8208;assisted medium exchange system, the ASL facilitates the bioprinting of multicellular components in arbitrary architectures. Based on these features, ASL's capability in fabricating structure&#8208;mimetic liver tissue models with regenerative functionalities is demonstrated. It is believed that the ASL technique achieves breakthroughs in UHCD bioprinting, opening new avenues in the development of artificial tissue and organ engineering.

         <title>Thermoplastic Molding of Chitosan to Form Living Plastic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a thermomechanical compression technique to densify chitosan into stable, custom&#8208;shaped plastics with multifunctionality. The relatively mild processing conditions of the method allow the integration of biomolecules without the need for covalent cross&#8208;linkers to prepare bioactive materials along with the successful incorporation of pollutant&#8208;degrading microbes, resulting in &#8220;living plastics&#8221; capable of bioremediation.








Abstract
Numerous approaches for the solution&#8208;based fabrication of chitosan&#8208;based materials are reported, but most often result in materials with limitations in terms of stability in aqueous systems and mechanics unless chemical cross&#8208;linking is utilized. In the present study, a thermomechanical compression method is presented for solid&#8208;state processing of chitosan powders into dense bulk plastic&#8208;like materials where the mechanical and physical properties can be tailored. To achieve this outcome, chitosan&#8208;citrate complexes, formed through ionic cross&#8208;linking and amidation, undergo thermal fusion at high temperature and pressure to generate robust materials with retention of the inherent properties of chitosan, including biodegradability and cytocompatibility. The chitosan&#8208;based plastics can be doped with enzymes and antibiotics with retention of bioactivity and are also explored as living materials when microbial cells (e.g., Pseudomonas putida) are included in the process and subsequently shown to maintain metabolic functions to degrade organic pollutants. This thermoplastic approach for solid&#8208;state processing of chitosan enables the development of a variety of new materials and composites with embedded biomolecules for enhanced functions. This solid&#8208;state fabrication of chitosan bulk materials approach eliminates the need for conventional solution&#8208;based processing, enabling rapid material production via compression molding while reducing costs, minimizing waste, and improving overall manufacturing efficiency.

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Power Factor in an Intrinsically Large Transport&#8208;Fermi Energy Gap Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymer, P(TDPP&#8208;BT&#8208;LEG) is reported, with a record&#8208;high power factor of 397 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2. This exceptional performance is attributed to its intrinsically large transport&#8208;Fermi energy gap, enhanced doping facilitated by side chain&#8208;ionized dopant interactions, and efficient interchain coupling via BT units, offering valuable insights for the design of advanced organic thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
The conductivity of organic thermoelectric materials has seen significant improvements in the past few years, but often at the expense of the Seebeck coefficient. Consequently, the thermoelectric performance, especially for n&#8208;type materials, remains considerably lower than that of their inorganic counterparts. Herein, a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymer, P(TDPP&#8208;BT&#8208;LEG) is reported, with an unexpectedly high Seebeck coefficient and ultrahigh power factor, driven by its intrinsically large energy gap between the Fermi and transport energy levels and high charge carrier mobility. Notably, it is shown that strong electrostatic interactions induced by the ethylene glycol side chains facilitate charge transfer between the dopants and the polymer. This enables effective doping of polymers with high LUMO levels. Furthermore, efficient charge transport, arising from favorable molecular packing, allows the polymer to maintain high electrical conductivity even at low charge carrier concentrations. Ultimately, this polymer achieves a record&#8208;high n&#8208;type power factor of 397 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, with a high Seebeck coefficient of &#8722;420 &#181;V&#160;K&#8210;1. This study highlights the potential of enhancing the Seebeck coefficient through precise energy level tuning and molecular design, fundamentally advancing the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Plane Blackbody by Ultrafast Laser Induced Surface Hierarchical Structuring and Nanodefect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid micro&#8208;nano periodic structure, realized via a one&#8208;step process utilizing the mechanism of ultrafast laser multiple interaction with a silicon surface, is reported. This structure simultaneously achieves suppression of optical backscattering and energy band engineering. The fabricated surface exhibits exceptional uniformity and stability as a blackbody, thereby addressing the stability and uniformity challenges of plan blackbodies under protracted deployment.








Abstract
Blackbodies, ideal light&#8208;absorbing objects per Planck's law, do not occur in nature on Earth. Nevertheless, they are of utmost significance in applications across astronomy, optoelectronics, and thermal radiation engineering. While artificial counterparts such as cavity blackbodies and plane blackbodies can approximate ideal blackbodies to some extent, they are beset with problems, including large volume, low emissivity, narrow bandwidth, poor uniformity, and feeble adhesion. Here, a method relying on ultrafast laser direct irradiation is reported, which enables fast writing of uniform plane blackbodies with high&#8208;emissivity over 0.98 in an ultra&#8208;broadband spectrum of 3&#8211;14 &#181;m on a doped silicon surface. A phenomenon of energy negative feedback regulation in laser&#8208;material is discovered, which allows for the simultaneous implementation of hierarchical surface structuring and nanodefect&#8208;induced energy&#8208;level engineering. The resulting micro&#8208;nano hierarchical cone&#8208;array structure effectively curbs light back&#8208;scattering and intensifies nanodefect&#8208;induced absorption. Since the laser&#8208;treated surface does not entail material adhesion or injection, it exhibits superior stability in contrast to traditional black coatings. This is corroborated by high&#8208;temperature tests exceeding 900&#160;&#176;C and repeated mechanical exfoliation tests, underscoring its resilience in harsh environmental conditions.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Nanorelay Enhances Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer in Lanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks during Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; is first incorporated into a lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF), forming B12H12@Tb&#8208;based Ln&#8208;MOF, where closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; acts as an electron nanorelay to enhance ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer during photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Single&#8208;crystal, in situ, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques reveal the complete mechanistic pathway, providing guidance for the rational design of highly efficient catalysts for artificialphotosynthesis.








Abstract
Lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) exhibit potential yet limitations for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Their &#8220;potential&#8221; stems from their CO2 adsorption capability, attributed to the ligand&#8208;field effects and specialized pore microenvironments; the &#8220;limitation&#8221; is due to the inertness of ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) originating from the 4f electron shielding effect, high ionization energies, and low electron affinities. Introducing electron&#8208;rich active components, acting as nanorelays, into Ln&#8208;MOF pores offers a viable strategy to overcome these drawbacks, though the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, the mechanistic pathway underlying efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the B12H12@Tb&#8208;based MOF composite is elucidated, wherein the electron&#8208;rich closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; serves as the counteranion and functions within the pores as an electron nanorelay. The crystalline structure of this composite is revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. In situ and transient techniques, together with theoretical calculation, uncovered the serial mechanism, including how closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; nanorelay facilitates a radical&#8208;assisted electron transfer and subsequently improves LMCT within Ln&#8208;MOF, as well as how Tb3+ serves as the catalytic active center for the intermediate process pathways of CO2 molecules. These mechanistic studies not only unveil the &#8220;black box&#8221; of MOF&#8208;based composite photocatalyst, but also provide solutions for the development of efficient artificial photosynthesis catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs) exhibit potential yet limitations for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. Their &#8220;potential&#8221; stems from their CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capability, attributed to the ligand-field effects and specialized pore microenvironments; the &#8220;limitation&#8221; is due to the inertness of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) originating from the 4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; electron shielding effect, high ionization energies, and low electron affinities. Introducing electron-rich active components, acting as nanorelays, into Ln-MOF pores offers a viable strategy to overcome these drawbacks, though the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, the mechanistic pathway underlying efficient photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion in the B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;@Tb-based MOF composite is elucidated, wherein the electron-rich &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-[B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; serves as the counteranion and functions within the pores as an electron nanorelay. The crystalline structure of this composite is revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. In situ and transient techniques, together with theoretical calculation, uncovered the serial mechanism, including how &lt;i&gt;closo&lt;/i&gt;-[B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanorelay facilitates a radical-assisted electron transfer and subsequently improves LMCT within Ln-MOF, as well as how Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; serves as the catalytic active center for the intermediate process pathways of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. These mechanistic studies not only unveil the &#8220;black box&#8221; of MOF-based composite photocatalyst, but also provide solutions for the development of efficient artificial photosynthesis catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circumventing Self&#8208;Diffusion Enables High&#8208;Rate Hard Carbon Anodes</title>

         <dc:description>
This study reveals that slow sodium self&#8208;diffusion within metallic clusters in low&#8208;potential regions (&lt;0.1&#160;V) as the primary factor hindering the rate capability of hard carbon. By rationally designing a heterostructure where long&#8208;ranged anisotropic graphitic nanobelts are in situ embedded into isotropic amorphous carbon matrix, Na+ diffusion kinetics is redirected from the slow metallic&#8208;cluster self&#8208;diffusion to the rapid interlaminar pathways through the extended graphitic stacks, thereby significantly circumventing the sodium diffusion barrier in the low potential.








Abstract
Hard carbons (HCs) are promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), yet their application faces a critical challenge that sluggish kinetics in low&#8208;potential regions (&lt;0.1&#160;V) severely limit fast&#8208;charging capability, and the origin of this limitation remains unclear. Here, this study reveals slow sodium self&#8208;diffusion within metallic clusters as the fundamental barrier of hard carbons, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and in/ex situ characterizations. By rationally designing a heterostructure where long&#8208;ranged anisotropic graphitic nanobelts are in situ embedded into isotropic amorphous carbon matrix, Na+ diffusion kinetics is redirected from the slow metallic&#8208;cluster self&#8208;diffusion to the rapid interlaminar pathways through the extended graphitic stacks, thereby significantly circumventing the sodium diffusion barrier at the low potential. The optimized HCs achieve a high reversible capacity (386 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1), exceptional rate capability (312 mAh g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and robust long&#8208;term cyclic stability (98% after 1000 cycles) in a conventional ester electrolyte, with energy density and power density surpassing those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art graphite in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These findings provide fundamental insights into high&#8208;rate hard carbons for advanced SIBs.

         <title>Facile Bottom&#8208;Up Assembly of Photonic Micropatterns via Surface&#8208;Guided Colloidal Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution photonic micropatterns with vivid structural colors are fabricated through bottom&#8208;up assembly, guided by surface&#8208;dependent regioselective heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth of colloidal particles. Full&#8208;spectrum color tunability is achieved by controlling particle size and interparticle attraction, while in situ color mixing is enabled by exclusive crystallization of bidisperse particles, expanding the accessible color palette.








Abstract
Photonic micropatterns derived from colloidal self&#8208;assembly are highly sought after for next&#8208;generation optical and functional devices. However, achieving high optical quality, spatial precision, and stopband tunability with a simple fabrication process remains challenging due to the limitations of conventional top&#8208;down techniques. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is reported for fabricating high&#8208;resolution photonic micropatterns via regioselective heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization of polystyrene particles, directed by surface&#8208;dependent nucleation behavior. On strongly charged glass, nucleation is suppressed, while on weakly charged photoresist surfaces, it is promoted via depletion&#8208;mediated attraction. Photoresist micropatterns prepared by standard photolithography enable single&#8208;step, spatially localized crystal growth without physical confinement. The resulting crystalline grains exhibit uniform orientation and minimal intergrain gaps, displaying intense structural colors. By systematically tuning depletant and salt concentrations, an optimal pair potential well depth is identified that yields superior&#8208;quality photonic micropatterns. Full&#8208;spectrum color tunability is achieved by varying particle size while maintaining this optimal interaction range. Moreover, bidisperse systems show exclusive crystallization of distinct grain types within a single pattern, enabling in situ color mixing and extended color palettes. Beyond photolithography, that accessible charge&#8208;guided patterning is demonstrated using vapor&#8208;phase masking, oil stamping, and even fingerprints, highlighting the versatility and scalability of this bottom&#8208;up approach.

         <title>Trace Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality Graphene with Improved Electrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the critical role of trace oxygen in graphene synthesis. Superclean graphene films are synthesized via trace oxygen&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. Experimental and computational analyses elucidate the dual role of oxygen in etching amorphous carbon and assisting defect repair during graphene growth. This strategy substantially enhances graphene's crystallinity while simultaneously improving its electronic performance.








Abstract
Point defects and amorphous carbon contamination, which are almost inevitable during the high&#8208;temperature chemical vapor deposition growth process, are demonstrated to severely degrade the intrinsic properties of graphene films, particularly their electronic performance. This study puts forward a trace oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;quality graphene by effectively eradicating amorphous carbon contamination and then promoting the repair of underlying lattice defects. Both experimental results and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that lattice healing is inhibited when the lattice is covered by amorphous carbon but facilitated with the aid of oxygen. The high crystallinity of the synthesized graphene is evidenced by its strong resistance to electron&#8208;beam radiation and mechanical property (2D Young's modulus &#8776;355 N&#160;m&#8722;1 and fracture strength &#8776;1778 nN) comparable to that of exfoliated graphene. Furthermore, the as&#8208;obtained graphene film exhibits enhanced electronic performance, including a low sheet resistance of 174.4 &#177; 31.9 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and a high carrier mobility exceeding 15&#160;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature. This work not only elucidates the novel functions of oxygen in the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene but also offers new prospects for further enhancing the performance of graphene.

         <title>An Intelligence Programmable Intrathecal Injection System Based on Tween 80&#8208;Confined Halide Perovskite Optoelectronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative Tween 80 confinement strategy modulates Cs2AgBiBr6 crystallization by suppressing bromine vacancy (Brvac) formation, enabling the optoelectronic memristor to exhibit electronic synaptic functionality and transient photoresponse (TPR). By leveraging the multi&#8208;wavelength modulation capability of TPR, an all&#8208;optically controlled drug delivery system is demonstrated.

Lead&#8208;free inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising candidates to replace the lead&#8208;based perovskites and expedite the commercialization of optoelectronic devices, owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, tunable bandgap, and long carrier diffusion lengths. However, uncontrollable nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites pose a major challenge to device performance. Herein, a Tween 80&#8208;confined Cs2AgBiBr6&#8208;based optoelectronic memristor is presented that exhibits both electronic synaptic functionality (ESF) and transient photoresponse (TPR). The Tween 80 confinement strategy effectively suppresses bromine vacancy (Brvac) and promotes the formation of a high&#8208;quality, pinhole&#8208;free perovskite film, which endows the device with outstanding optoelectronic performance. Leveraging the ESF under electrical stimulation, the as&#8208;fabricated device achieves highly efficient pattern recognition. Under optical stimulation, it demonstrates a TPR with 20&#160;ms response time, an extended durability of 931.7&#160;s, and excellent repeatability over 1000 cycles at 5&#160;Hz. Furthermore, the device achieves all&#8208;optical writing and erasing through combined optical stimuli, enabling complex image encryption/writing tasks. Finally, an all&#8208;optically controlled intrathecal injection system is designed based on the device, incorporating six specific drug release strategies. Therefore, this work provides innovative insights into the application of optoelectronic memristors in biomedical and life sciences, paving the way for the development of smart medicine.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Compatible Solvent Bath Thermal Annealing for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells and Large&#8208;Area Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent bath thermal annealing (STA) approach is developed for efficient ambient processing of organic solar cells and modules. STA immerses the active layer in perfluorodecalin to ensure uniform heating and protection from oxygen and moisture, optimizing film crystallinity and molecular packing. The strategy yields exceptional device efficiency, stability, and scalability, significantly enhancing the prospects for large&#8208;area manufacturing.








Abstract
Thermal annealing is essential for optimizing the bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of organic solar cells (OSCs), yet traditional thermal annealing (TA) under ambient air suffers from film degradation and nonuniform heating. Here, a novel post&#8208;treatment, solvent bath thermal annealing (STA), enabling effective TA of large&#8208;area OSC active layers under ambient conditions, is introduced. In STA, the BHJ film is immersed in a perfluorodecalin (PFD) bath during heating, ensuring uniform thermal distribution and protection against oxygen and moisture. STA&#8208;treated films thus exhibit optimized vertical component distribution, enhanced crystallinity, and improved molecular packing with higher structural order, leading to efficient charge transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination regardless of the annealing atmosphere. As a result, STA&#8208;treated OSCs based on PM6/L8&#8208;BO blend deliver outstanding performance: small&#8208;area cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05%, while large&#8208;area (20.25&#160;cm2) modules attain a PCE of 17.37% (certified 16.75%), among the highest PCEs for large&#8208;area organic solar modules. It also successfully bridges the performance gap between inert and ambient processing conditions. Moreover, STA&#8208;treated devices show excellent operational stability under continuous illumination and thermal stress. This ambient&#8208;compatible annealing strategy thus provides a scalable route toward high&#8208;efficiency and stable organic solar modules for practical large&#8208;area manufacturing.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Flow Modulation of CaF2/CaAl12O19:Dy Heterojunctions for Enhanced Mechanoluminescence in Flexible Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunctions are constructed by in situ growing CaF2:Dy on the CaAl12O19:Dy particles. Compared with the single&#8208;phase materials, the constructed CaF2/ CaAl12O19:Dy heterojunction interfaces via F&#9472;Al&#9472;O and F&#9472;Ca&#9472;O bonds boost the charge flow from CA6 to CaF2, enhancing the interfacial triboelectricity and thus yielding improved mechanoluminescent performance in terms of intensity, repeatbility, and self&#8208;recoverability in flexible composites.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) flexible composites show broad application prospects in stretchable optoelectronics and wearable devices. However, challenges such as low brightness, inadequate repeatability, and restricted self&#8208;recoverability hinder their practical use. Aiming to these issues, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of the heterojunction strategy on the interfacial triboelectricity&#8208;induced ML in flexible composites. Herein, the typical interfacial triboelectricity&#8208;dependent ML material of CaF2:Dy is in situ grown on the trap&#8208;controlled ML material of CaAl12O19:Dy (CA6:Dy) because of their high crystal lattice matching ability. Compared with the single&#8208;phase materials, the CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy heterojunctions exhibit outstanding ML performance in the flexible polydimethylsiloxane matrix, which can achieve repeatable ML for over 10&#160;000 times with a self&#8208;recovery degree of ca. 91.60%. The trap&#8208;controlled mechanism and interfacial triboelectrification&#8208;induced electron bombardment model are both responsible for the ML of CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy heterojunctions. Theoretical calculation results suggest that the construction of heterojunction interfaces via F&#9472;Al&#9472;O and F&#9472;Ca&#9472;O bonds can effectively prompt the charge flow from CA6 to CaF2. This endows CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy with enhanced interfacial triboelectricity and enriched trap structure, leading to improved ML properties. This work confirms that rational heterojunction design can overcome the limitations of single&#8208;phase materials in flexible matrices, offering a robust platform for the development of high&#8208;performance and flexible ML materials.

A hybrid&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) stabilizes 4.5 V&#8208;class Li&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;nickel cathodes and Si&#8208;majority graphite anodes by forming a self&#8208;limiting inorganic interphase at the Si||electrolyte junction. The HSE enables a broad operating temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C and excellent cycling performance of 1.4 Ah pouch cells with 80% capacity retention after 1150 cycles.








Abstract
4.5&#160;V&#8208;class lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) pairing LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes with silicon&#8208;majority graphite (SmG, &gt;1500 mAh g&#8722;1) anodes can surpass 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, but their cycling stability, safety, and low&#8208;temperature operation are constrained by the difficulty in constructing stable interphase. This study reports a hybrid&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) that can survive the aggressive chemistry of high&#8208;voltage NMC811 and programs a self&#8208;limiting inorganic interphase on Si by leveraging the electron&#8208;limited onset at the Si||electrolyte junction. At first lithiation, the semiconductor characteristic and native SiOx create a space&#8208;charge (depletion) region, so the anionic&#8208;structure&#8208;like sulfonamides bias first&#8208;electron reduction, seeding lithium halide/chalcogenide inorganics that are electronically insulating yet Li+&#8208;permeable. The resulting thin, dense layer suppresses electron tunneling, dissolution, and resists crack&#8208;induced stress concentration during Si expansion&#8212;thereby self&#8208;limiting further growth. Consequently, NMC811||SmG coin cells with the HSE retain 80% capacity after 500 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and &#8776;5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and operate over a wide range of temperature from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C, markedly outperforming the carbonate electrolyte. 1.4 Ah pouch cells maintain 80.0% of initial capacity after 1150 cycles and exhibit thermal stability up to 300 &#176;C. This work establishes self&#8208;limiting interphase formation on Si as a practical electrolyte design target for high&#8208;energy LIBs.

         <title>Electron Percolating Shielded Interlayer Enabling Ultrastable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer of PTAA/SnO2 (PS) is designed at the LLZTO solid electrolyte and Li metal interface, which creates a reverse electric field to block electron leakage, significantly reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO. Li dendrite formation is greatly suppressed at the surface and bulk of LLZTO, which contributes to the outstanding electrochemical performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The electron percolation of grain boundaries in Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) induces internal lithium deposition and penetration, causing short circuits of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, which has become a significant obstacle hindering the practical application of LLZTO. In this work, an electron&#8208;percolating shielded interface constructing strategy is proposed between LLZTO and lithium metal (Li) to simultaneously suppress the Li dendrite growth at both the interface and within the LLZTO electrolyte. A Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;triMethylphenyl)aMine] (PTAA)/SnO2 (PS) bilayer is therefore designed between LLZTO and Li metal (LLZTO&#8208;PS|Li), where the hole&#8208;rich PTAA and electron&#8208;rich SnO2 generate a reverse electric field that effectively blocks the electron leakage, thereby reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO and preventing its internal dendrite formation. Furthermore, the smooth and compact PTAA/SnO2 coating significantly enhances interfacial contact and equalizes the interfacial potential to promote a uniform Li plating. As a result, the Li|LLZTO&#8208;PS|Li symmetric battery achieves stable cycling for over 5000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Li|LLZTO&#8208;PS|LiFePO4 full battery demonstrates 86.2% capacity after 2000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C. This study presents a novel interfacial engineering strategy for enhancing the performance and durability of garnet&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Deciphering Defect&#8208;Mediated Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching Multimodal Luminescence for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the multicolor SrZnP2O7:Sm3+/Dy3+/Tb3+/Tm3+ phosphors exhibiting exceptional multimodal luminescence in the 350&#8211;750 nm range with anti&#8208;thermal quenching properties. A charge compensation strategy is established to enhance the quantum efficiency, photoluminescence/radioluminescence, and X&#8208;ray afterglow duration by precise regulation of trap distribution and density. The developed phosphors demonstrate great promise for X&#8208;ray imaging and high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications.








Abstract
Multimodal luminescent materials displaying dynamically tunable multicolor emissions under diverse excitation channels are at the core of optical information encryption technologies. However, simultaneous achievement of high&#8208;performance multimodal luminescence with anti&#8208;thermal quenching (ATQ) feature remains a critical challenge. Herein, a new class of SrZnP2O7:RE (RE = Sm3+, Dy3+, Tb3+, Tm3+) phosphors is developed to fulfill these requirements through precise defect engineering. These phosphors exhibit photoluminescence (PL), radioluminescence (RL), mechanoluminescence (ML), thermoluminescence (TL), and persistent luminescence (PersL) with emission spanning 350&#8211;750&#160;nm. By strategically incorporating charge compensators (Li+, Na+, K+), precise regulation of trap distribution and density is demonstrated, yielding remarkable enhancements in PL, quantum efficiency, RL intensity, and X&#8208;ray afterglow duration. Crucially, the engineered deep traps in Sm/Dy/Tm&#8208;doped systems enable exceptional ATQ behavior. Comprehensive investigations reveal the critical role of charge compensation and defect redistribution in modulating luminescence performance. Benefiting from their superior multimodal emission properties, these phosphors demonstrate great promise for X&#8208;ray imaging and high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications. This work establishes a new paradigm in luminescent material design, providing both fundamental insights into defect&#8208;luminescence property relationships and a practical framework for constructing advanced optical materials with tailored multimodal responses through precision trap state engineering.

         <title>Unprecedented Energy Density of Polyimide Dielectrics at Elevated Temperatures Utilizing Atomic Engineering to Decouple &#960;&#8208;Conjugation</title>

This study establishes a site&#8208;specific ortho&#8208;chlorination strategy for semi&#8208;aromatic polyimides, which localizes &#960;&#8208;electrons and induces conformational distortion to disrupt intrachain &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interchain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Consequently, the Cl&#8208;PI films deliver discharged energy densities of 7.22 J cm&#8722;3 with &gt;90% efficiency at 200 &#176;C and 6.79 J cm&#8722;3 at 250 &#176;C, demonstrating excellent high&#8208;temperature dielectric performance.








Abstract
Emerging demands for polymer dielectrics in high&#8208;power electronics and harsh environments call for polymers with simultaneously high thermal stability and electrical performance. However, most polymers suffer from rapid conduction loss at elevated temperatures. Here it is shown that atomic&#8208;level backbone chlorination of polyimide (Cl&#8208;PI) imposes &#960;&#8208;electron localization and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane steric barriers that, together, suppress through&#8208;plane hopping arising from both intrachain &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interchain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, dismantling long&#8208;range conduction pathways. This cooperative mechanism markedly curtails high&#8208;temperature conduction loss and yields outstanding capacitive performance, delivering discharge energy densities (Ud) of 9.52 J cm&#8722;3 at 150 &#176;C and 7.22 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C, with efficiencies exceeding 90%. Even at 250&#176;C, an unprecedented Ud of 6.79 J cm&#8722;3 is retained, outperforming reported high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers. Moreover, Cl&#8208;PI exhibits excellent self&#8208;cleaning behavior and cycling durability, sustaining over 106 cycles at 200&#160;&#176;C and 400&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 with minimal degradation. This work underscores the potential of atomic&#8208;level backbone engineering to enable next&#8208;generation polymer dielectrics for reliable, high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage.

         <title>Holistic Recovery of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries by Flash Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and sustainable flash Joule heating chlorination&#8211;oxidation (FJH&#8211;ClO) process enables efficient recovery of lithium, cobalt, and graphite from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This scalable approach achieves high purity and yield of the separated metal and graphite while significantly reducing energy use, reagents, and operating costs compared with conventional recycling methods.








Abstract
The rising demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) highlights the urgent need for sustainable recycling technologies. Existing pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy methods can recover valuable metals but suffer from high energy costs and wastewater generation. Here, a selective flash Joule heating chlorination and oxidation (FJH&#8208;ClO) strategy is presented for the efficient separation of metals from spent batteries. In this process, cathode metals are first chlorinated for 60 s, after which the transition metal chlorides are oxidized to oxides, enabling lithium to be separated from transition metals due to their different aqueous solubility. This approach applies not only to the recovery of metals from lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode materials, but also to the anodic graphite, all from the black mass. The recovered graphite exhibits purity of &#8776;100% with a yield of 85%, Co at 99% purity and 97% yield, and Li at 99% purity with a 92% yield. Gram&#8208;scale experiments confirm the scalability of the method, maintaining high efficiency and selectivity. Life&#8208;cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis reveal that the FJH&#8208;ClO process substantially reduces energy consumption, operation time, and reagent consumption, while lowering operating costs by up to 92%, compared to conventional approaches.

In this process, cathode metals are first chlorinated for 60 s, after which the transition metal chlorides are oxidized to oxides, enabling lithium to be separated from transition metals due to their different aqueous solubility. This approach applies not only to the recovery of metals from lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode materials, but also to the anodic graphite, all from the black mass. The recovered graphite exhibits purity of &#8776;100% with a yield of 85%, Co at 99% purity and 97% yield, and Li at 99% purity with a 92% yield. Gram-scale experiments confirm the scalability of the method, maintaining high efficiency and selectivity. Life-cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis reveal that the FJH-ClO process substantially reduces energy consumption, operation time, and reagent consumption, while lowering operating costs by up to 92%, compared to conventional approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous Sodium Humate Binder Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes via Protection from Interface to Bulk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eco&#8208;friendly and water&#8208;soluble sodium humate (NaHA) working as multifunctional binder enables high&#8208;performance for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. It is found that the proposed binder simultaneously stabilizes the interphase and bulk structure in high&#8208;voltage LCO via uniform surface coating and lattice&#8208;cognate in situ trace&#8208;level Na doping in the bulk during cycles, respectively.








Abstract
Raising the charging cutoff voltage is a well&#8208;established approach to enhance the energy density of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathodes, known for their high bulk energy density, in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical implementation under high&#8208;voltage conditions remains limited by interphase instability and bulk structural degradation. Herein, an innovative application of low&#8208;cost and water&#8208;soluble sodium humate (NaHA) is proposed, traditionally employed in aquaculture and pharmaceuticals, as a multifunctional binder for high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes. Enriched with &#9472;COOH and &#9472;OH functional groups, NaHA not only forms robust hydrogen bonds with the LCO surface, enabling uniform coating on LCO particles, but also promotes a protective interphase microenvironment. More importantly, NaHA facilitates lattice&#8208;cognate in situ trace Na doping into the LCO bulk lattice during cycling, effectively enhancing its structural stability. This dual modification strategy, combining surface confinement and bulk reinforcement, endows LCO cathodes with ultra&#8208;stable electrochemical performance, retaining 95.1% capacity after 1700 cycles at 4.45&#160;V and 87.1% over 1000 cycles at 4.5&#160;V. Moreover, the water solubility of NaHA simplifies end&#8208;of&#8208;life electrode disassembly and promotes recyclability, supporting sustainable battery design. This binder&#8208;directed strategy offers a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly, and efficient binder&#8208;based stabilization route for high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy LIBs.

         <title>Synergistic Structural and Defect Engineering in MoS2 Featuring Ultra&#8208;Expanded Interlayers for Fast&#8208;Chargeable and Long&#8208;Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, guided by theoretical insights, an innovative carbon&#8208;intercalated, Se&#8208;doped MoS2 encapsulated within hollow carbon spheres as a viable anode for Na&#8208;ion batteries has been developed, yielding synchronously a large reversible capacity, high&#8208;rate capability, and long&#8208;term durability. Its origins of the performance enhancement are explicitly revealed by extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics, severe volume variation, and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Theoretically, concurrent selenium doping and carbon intercalation are revealed to effectively mitigate these challenges by improving electronic conductivity, promoting phase transition reaction kinetics, and alleviating structural deformation, thereby improving the structural flexibility of the MoS2 anode. Experimentally, a synergistic hollow carbon sphere&#8208;confined, carbon&#8208;intercalated and selenium&#8208;doped MoS2 (MoSSe@HCS) anode is rationally designed, achieving an ultra&#8208;expanded interlayer spacing (1.24&#160;nm), appropriate buffer space and robust carbon encapsulation. This design boosts charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, suppresses volume variation, and stabilizes SEI. Consequently, the MoSSe@HCS anode exhibits high capacity (441.5 mAh g&#8722;1, 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), exceptional rate capability (121.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1), and cyclability (87.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). A full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode displays high&#8208;capacity retention of 82.1% after 600 cycles at 17 C and a pouch&#8208;type full cell sustains over 2500 cycles at 10 C, demonstrating significant commercial viability. This work establishes a theory&#8208;guided design paradigm that bridges fundamental understanding and practical deployment of high&#8208;performance MoS2&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation SIBs.

         <title>Localized Electrostatic Interaction Stabilize Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a localized electrostatic interaction strategy using a tailored organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene&#8208;triammonium (IDPA3+), to enhance perovskite&#160;stability without introducing any trade&#8208;off. IDPA3+ induces perovskite lattice compression via sterically constrained localized electrostatic interactions, concurrently reinforcing structural stability while suppressing ion migration. Consequently, p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieved&#160;a champion efficiency of 25.41% for 1.00 cm2 (certified 25.28%), alongside&#160;exceptional operational stability at 85&#160;&#176;C and superior damp&#8208;heat stability.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for commercialization, yet the weak bonding nature of perovskites renders them vulnerable to external stimuli, undermining the operational longevity of PSCs. Methods aimed at strengthening bonding within perovskite constituents still failed to realize both &#8220;high efficiency&#8221; and &#8220;high stability&#8221; in single device. Herein, a localized electrostatic interaction strategy is proposed by employing an unexplored and well&#8208;designed organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene&#8208;triammonium (IDPA3+). IDPA3+ features sterically constrained multi&#8208;interaction sites that enable strong localized electrostatic interactions with [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra, inducing perovskite lattice compression. This compression improves perovskite lattice energy through strengthened chemical bonding within bulk lattice, ultimately reinforcing structural stability while simultaneously suppressing ion migration. Consequently, modified formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) devices displayed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stability, showing negligible performance loss under continuous operation at 85&#160;&#176;C and damp&#8208;heat test. Notably, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.28% for 1.00 cm2, among the highest published certified PCEs. Overall, this work presents localized electrostatic interaction engineering as a promising strategy to intrinsically stabilize perovskite microstructure, bridging the gap between electrostatic regulation and structural stability while highlighting the broader potential of other triply&#8208;charged organic molecules for advancing stable PSCs and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Spin&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme Overcomes the Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;Off for Sustainable Adhesive Production From Lignin Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multispin&#8208;state characteristics of natural laccase's multicopper centers, a 2D copper&#8208;based MOF is developed with optimal laccase&#8208;like activity, named COHBLO. This nanozyme selectively degrades lignin into uniform, hydroxyl&#8208;rich products. Through a ring&#8208;opening reaction between the hydroxyl and epoxy groups, a high&#8208;strength, eco&#8208;friendly lignin&#8208;based wood adhesive is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lignin, a major component of plant cell walls, is the most abundant source of natural aromatic polymers. Efficient production of its valuable degradation products requires highly selective catalysts. This study introduces a spin&#8208;state&#8208;modulated nanozyme system for precise lignin depolymerization into targeted biobased chemicals. Precise copper spin state control in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) copper&#8208;based metal organic framework (MOF) nanozymes, achieved via redox treatment and ligand exchange modulation, replicates natural laccase multicopper center spin synergy.

     alt="A Spin-Engineered Nanozyme Overcomes the Activity-Selectivity Trade-Off for Sustainable Adhesive Production From Lignin Biomass Conversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the multispin-state characteristics of natural laccase's multicopper centers, a 2D copper-based MOF is developed with optimal laccase-like activity, named COHBLO. This nanozyme selectively degrades lignin into uniform, hydroxyl-rich products. Through a ring-opening reaction between the hydroxyl and epoxy groups, a high-strength, eco-friendly lignin-based wood adhesive is successfully fabricated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lignin, a major component of plant cell walls, is the most abundant source of natural aromatic polymers. Efficient production of its valuable degradation products requires highly selective catalysts. This study introduces a spin-state-modulated nanozyme system for precise lignin depolymerization into targeted biobased chemicals. Precise copper spin state control in two-dimensional (2D) copper-based metal organic framework (MOF) nanozymes, achieved via redox treatment and ligand exchange modulation, replicates natural laccase multicopper center spin synergy. Integrated experiments and theory reveal a volcano-shaped spin state-activity correlation, enabling synthesis of optimized nanozyme Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC-LA-OAc (COHBLO). This material demonstrates exceptional laccase-mimicking activity, with a peak reaction rate 70 times higher than natural laccase and a 5.14-fold specific activity increase. Through laccase-like catalysis, it selectively cleaves lignin &#946;-O-4 linkages, directionally yielding fragments rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups. Their efficient reaction with epoxy groups produces a nanolignin-based epoxy adhesive. Featuring a three-dimensional cross-linked network, this adhesive delivers superior bonding under varied conditions. Its shear strength significantly surpasses commercial phenolic resins while eliminating conventional adhesive formaldehyde emissions. This study advances 2D MOF nanozyme design and establishes an integrated pathway from controlled lignin depolymerization to high-performance adhesive production, providing key theoretical and practical foundations for biomass valorization and sustainable adhesive development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Reverse Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interaction to Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;dependent universal law of electron transfer is investigated by depositing metals onto the surfaces of monolayer 1T&#8208;/2H&#8208;MoS2 hollow structures. The reverse transfer of electrons from 1T&#8208;MoS2 to metal demonstrates superior electrochemical activity and long&#8208;term stability in hydrogen evolution reactions compared to the forward transfer of electrons from metal to 2H&#8208;MoS2.








Abstract
Electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI) represents a pivotal strategy for modulating the electronic structure of supported metals and enhancing their catalytic performance. However, limited reports have been conducted on the impact of the support crystal phase on EMSI. Here, a charge transfer inversion phenomenon associated with support crystal phase regulation is systematically revealed. Specifically, subnano&#8208;sized noble metals (e.g., Pt, Rh, Ru) donate electrons to 2H&#8208;MoS2 support, whereas a reverse electron transfer direction is observed when these noble metals are supported on 1T&#8208;MoS2. Electron&#8208;enriched noble metals demonstrate significantly higher activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution compared to their electron&#8208;deficient counterparts, with 1T&#8208;MoS2@Pt achieving an exceptionally low overpotential of 18&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) incorporating 1T&#8208;MoS2@Pt as the cathode exhibits superior catalytic activity and sustained stability at ampere&#8208;level current density. This work provides novel insights into developing efficient catalysts by regulating charge transfer dependent on the support crystal phase.

         <title>Reactivity&#8208;Driven Metal&#8208;Adaptive Interphases for Dendrite&#8208;Free, High&#8208;Rate Alkali Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a universal strategy to reconstruct hierarchical, metal&#8208;adaptive SEI layers on Li/Na anodes (TC&#8208;Li/TC&#8208;Na) and address their metal&#8208;specific limitations. Guided by distinct reaction kinetics, a low&#8208;porosity, high&#8208;modulus layer is formed on TC&#8208;Li to mechanically suppress dendrites, while a highly porous network with interconnected ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles is constructed on TC&#8208;Na to accommodate volumetric strain and enhance interfacial activity. Consequently, the modified Li/Na metal pouch cells deliver improved long&#8208;term stability and rate capability, and achieve a stable operation under a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell (550.2 Wh kg&#8722;1, 11.1 Ah) and a high&#8208;rate Na metal pouch cell (0.3 C/1 C).








Abstract
Alkali metal anodes (e.g., Li and Na) require a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) customized to their physicomechanical and electrochemical demands; however, conventional SEI designs relying on generic &#8220;one&#8208;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; approaches fail to fully address the metal&#8208;specific requirements. Herein, a metal&#8208;adaptive SEI reconstruction strategy is proposed to leverage the reactivity&#8208;guided diisopropoxy&#8208;bisethylacetoacetatotitanate (DPBT) coatings on alkali metal anodes (TC&#8208;Li/TC&#8208;Na). The resulting interphases both share a hierarchical architecture with an ultrathin titanate layer and a TiO2&#8208;based inner matrix connected through compositionally graded segments (Ti&#8211;O&#8211;M, M = Li/Na/C), yet demonstrate metal&#8208;specific structural differentiation. The moderate reactivity of Li facilitates the dense packing of larger TiO2 nanoparticles, forming a low&#8208;porosity, high&#8208;modulus layer that mechanically suppresses dendrites. Conversely, the more rapid reaction of Na instantly produces abundant gas bubbles and fosters a highly porous network with interconnected ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles, integrating moderate modulus with elevated surface roughness that dynamically accommodates volumetric strain and enhances interfacial activity. Consequently, the NCM811||TC&#8208;Li pouch cell achieves high&#8208;capacity retention (89.3%, 200 cycles, 456.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) under 0.2 C/0.5 C and stable operation under high capacity and high energy density of 11.1 Ah and 550.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, while NFM||TC&#8208;Na pouch cell deliveries exceptional cycling stability at 0.3 C/1 C (79.7% retention over 200 cycles).

The fabrication of abundant bi&#8208;functional edge&#8208;doping sites on easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate hosts has been successfully realized for the first time. This breakthrough has facilitated the achievement of an ultralight, efficiently bi&#8208;functional and easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate host, enabling a pouch lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (&#8776;2 Ah) to exhibit an impressive energy density of 502 Wh kg&#8722;1 and cyclic stability.








Abstract
A promising strategy for constructing 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 cell&#8208;level rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) is developing hosts with ultralight weight to reduce nonactive mass, bi&#8208;functionality to ensure both efficient sulfur reactions and lithium plating under low N/P, and an easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate architecture for full wetting with lean electrolyte. Edge&#8208;doped carbons, combining light weight and unique bi&#8208;functionality, are rare candidates as such hosts. However, their preparation, which generally involves increasing specific surface areas or forming micropores/mesopores, impairs host&#8208;wetting under lean electrolyte. Herein, a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;induced approach is pioneered to create abundant edge&#8208;doping&#8208;sites on an easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate host of carbon nanofibers (CNF). Boron&#8208;containing carbon dots (BCDs) are elaborately utilized as heteroatom&#8208;introducing agents. Their organic nature facilitates uniform integration of graft&#8208;like BCD units, while their inorganic crystalline cores suppress graphitization of CNF precursors surrounding these graft&#8208;like units via steric&#8208;hindrance during carbonization, promoting bi&#8208;functional edge&#8208;B&#8208;doping sites formation. Such a host enables 2 Ah pouch&#8208;type LSBs to achieve an impressive energy density of 502&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with enhanced cyclic stability.

Herein, a polar ether&#8208;functionalized self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced to enhance the efficiency and durability of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs). Rational linker engineering enables dense and uniform SAM coverage, strengthens interfacial adhesion, and facilitates efficient hole extraction. As a result, inverted f&#8208;PSCs deliver 25.11% efficiency (certified 24.59%) and retain over 92% of their initial efficiency after 5000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation portable, wearable, and building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics. However, conventional self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules often exhibit weak interfacial binding and limited mechanical coupling, leading to incomplete coverage and poor contact on rough flexible substrates. Here, a molecularly tailored SAM design is presented that addresses these challenges through rational linker engineering. Replacing common alkyl chains with a polar ether linker modulates the electron density around the phosphonic acid anchoring group, while the ether oxygen atom acts as an effective&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor. This dual functionality promotes Et2OPACz to assemble into a dense, uniform layer on flexible substrates, thereby strengthening interfacial adhesion, improving perovskite film quality, and facilitating hole extraction. As a result, f&#8208;PSCs incorporating Et2OPACz SAM achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11% (certified 24.59%), among the highly reported for f&#8208;PSCs. The devices retain 94% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of continuous operation and 92.6% after 5000 bending cycles at a radius of 3&#160;mm. These results demonstrate that polar ether linker engineering provides a powerful strategy to simultaneously optimize interfacial contact, charge transport, and mechanical durability in high&#8208;performance f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Toward Standardized Evaluation of PFAS Sorbents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective highlights the need for consistent reporting standards in PFAS sorbent research. It proposes a structured framework encompassing sorbent characterization, water matrix and PFAS details, and sorption&#8211;regeneration performance (including flow&#8208;through packed&#8208;bed evaluation). The guidelines aim to improve transparency, reproducibility, and comparability, thereby accelerating the development of effective PFAS remediation technologies.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contaminants with global distribution and documented risks to human and environmental health. Sorbent&#8208;based technologies are widely explored for PFAS removal, yet the advancement of this field is impeded by inconsistent and incomplete experimental reporting, hindering reproducibility and comparative analysis.&#160;In this perspective, a structured framework is presented to guide the comprehensive characterization when reporting of new PFAS sorbents. The proposed framework defines three essential domains for experimental evaluation: i) sorbent characterization, ii) water matrix specification and PFAS details, and iii) sorption and regeneration performance, including flow&#8208;through packed&#8208;bed evaluation (both bench&#8208; and pilot&#8208;scales). General guidelines are provided for each domain to promote consistency, transparency, and comparability across studies. This Perspective aims to facilitate rigorous cross&#8208;study comparison and accelerate the development of effective PFAS sorbents.
