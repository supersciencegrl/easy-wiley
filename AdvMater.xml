      <title>Designing with Light: Advanced 2D, 3D, and 4D Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Light is a powerful stimulus, providing easy access to spatiotemporal control, and has been widely employed for material design. As such, photochemical methods empower the fabrication of sophisticated 2D, 3D, and 4D materials at lengths ranging from nano&#8208; to macroscale.








Abstract
Recent achievements and future opportunities for the design of 2D, 3D, and 4D materials using photochemical reactions are summarized. Light is an attractive stimulus for material design due to its outstanding spatiotemporal control, and its ability to mediate rapid polymerization under moderate reaction temperatures. These features have been significantly enhanced by major advances in light generation/manipulation with light&#8208;emitting diodes and optical fiber technologies which now allows for a broad range of cost&#8208;effective fabrication protocols. This combination is driving the preparation of sophisticated 2D, 3D, and 4D materials at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macrosize scales. Looking ahead, future challenges and opportunities that will significantly impact the field and help shape the future of light as a versatile and tunable design tool are highlighted.

      <title>Challenges in Fluorescence Detection of Chemical Warfare Agent Vapors Using Solid&#8208;State Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Fluorescence&#8208;based detection is a sensitive and rapid method for detecting and identifying potential threats such as nerve agents. Due to the highly toxic nature of the agents themselves, studies to develop sensors have normally involved simulants. However, care is needed when interpreting the results of studies using common simulants.








Abstract
Organophosphorus (OP)&#8208;based nerve agents are extremely toxic and potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and recent attacks involving nerve agents highlight the need for fast detection and intervention. Fluorescence&#8208;based detection, where the sensing material undergoes a chemical reaction with the agent causing a measurable change in the luminescence, is one method for sensing and identifying nerve agents. Most studies use the simulants diethylchlorophosphate and di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylfluorophosphate to evaluate the performance of sensors due to their reduced toxicity relative to OP nerve agents. While detection of nerve agent simulants in solution is relatively widely reported, there are fewer reports on vapor detection using solid&#8208;state sensors. Herein, progress in organic semiconductor sensing materials developed for solid&#8208;state detection of OP&#8208;based nerve agent vapors is reviewed. The effect of acid impurities arising from the hydrolysis of simulants and nerve agents on the efficacy and selectivity of the reported sensing materials is also discussed. Indeed, in some cases it is unclear whether it is the simulant that is detected or the acid hydrolysis products. Finally, it is highlighted that while analyte diffusion into the sensing film is critical in the design of fast, responsive sensing systems, it is an area that is currently not well studied.

Most studies use the simulants diethylchlorophosphate and di&#8208;&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;propylfluorophosphate to evaluate the performance of sensors due to their reduced toxicity relative to OP nerve agents. While detection of nerve agent simulants in solution is relatively widely reported, there are fewer reports on vapor detection using solid&#8208;state sensors. Herein, progress in organic semiconductor sensing materials developed for solid&#8208;state detection of OP&#8208;based nerve agent vapors is reviewed. The effect of acid impurities arising from the hydrolysis of simulants and nerve agents on the efficacy and selectivity of the reported sensing materials is also discussed. Indeed, in some cases it is unclear whether it is the simulant that is detected or the acid hydrolysis products. Finally, it is highlighted that while analyte diffusion into the sensing film is critical in the design of fast, responsive sensing systems, it is an area that is currently not well studied.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Polycrystalline Advanced Microporous Framework Membranes for Efficient Separation of Small Molecules and Ions</title>
      <dc:description>
Polycrystalline advanced microporous framework membranes (PMFMs) have great potential for use in industrial separation applications. Recent advances in PMFM&#8208;fabrication technologies are highlighted and their applications in gas separation, water desalination, chiral resolution, and ion separation are explored. Some perspectives on further developments and challenges in this field are also presented.








Abstract
Advanced porous framework membranes with excellent selectivity and high permeability of small molecules and ions are highly desirable for many important industrial separation applications. There has been significant progress in the fabrication of polycrystalline microporous framework membranes (PMFMs) in recent years, such as metal&#8211;organic framework and covalent organic framework membranes. These membranes possess small pore sizes, which are comparable to the kinetic diameter of small molecules and ions on the angstrom scale, very low thickness, down to tens to hundreds of nanometers, highly oriented crystalline structures, hybrid membrane structures, and specific functional groups for enhancing membrane selectivity and permeability. Recent advances in the fabrication methods of advanced PMFMs are summarized. Following this, four emerging separation applications of these advanced microporous framework membranes, including gas separation, water desalination, ion separation, and chiral separation, are highlighted and discussed in detail. Finally, a summary and some perspectives of future developments and challenges in this exciting research field are presented.

Abstract
To realize the full potential of nanocrystals in nanotechnology, it is necessary to integrate single nanocrystals into addressable structures; for example, arrays and periodic lattices.

      <title>Metal Clusters on Semiconductor Surfaces and Application in Catalysis with a Focus on Au and Ru</title>
      <dc:description>
Semiconductor surfaces can be modified by depositing metal clusters. Metal clusters have unique properties that change with the number of atoms forming the clusters. The procedures for depositing clusters onto semiconductor surfaces and the application of cluster&#8208;modified semiconductor surfaces in catalysis are addressed and experimental techniques for analyzing the surfaces are briefly reviewed.








Abstract
Metal clusters typically consist of two to a few hundred atoms and have unique properties that change with the type and number of atoms that form the cluster. Metal clusters can be generated with a precise number of atoms, and therefore have specific size, shape, and electronic structures. When metal clusters are deposited onto a substrate, their shape and electronic structure depend on the interaction with the substrate surface and thus depend on the properties of both the clusters and those of the substrate. Deposited metal clusters have discrete, individual electron energy levels that differ from the electron energy levels in the constituting individual atoms, isolated clusters, and the respective bulk material. The properties of clusters with a focus on Au and Ru, the methods to generate metal clusters, and the methods of deposition of clusters onto substrate surfaces are covered. The properties of cluster&#8208;modified surfaces are important for their application. The main application covered here is catalysis, and the methods for characterization of the cluster&#8208;modified surfaces are described.

      <title>Glycogen as a Building Block for Advanced Biological Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Glycogen is one of nature's unique biological polysaccharide nanoparticles, which holds promise as a material for biomedical, including therapeutic, applications. The recent literature on advancing glycogen as a building block for advanced biofunctional materials is reviewed.








Abstract
Biological nanoparticles found in living systems possess distinct molecular architectures and diverse functions. Glycogen is a unique biological polysaccharide nanoparticle fabricated by nature through a bottom&#8208;up approach. The biocatalytic synthesis of glycogen has evolved over time to form a nanometer&#8208;sized dendrimer&#8208;like structure (20&#8211;150 nm) with a highly branched surface and a dense core. This makes glycogen markedly different from other natural linear or branched polysaccharides and particularly attractive as a platform for biomedical applications. Glycogen is inherently biodegradable, nontoxic, and can be functionalized with diverse surface and internal motifs for enhanced biofunctional properties. Recently, there has been growing interest in glycogen as a natural alternative to synthetic polymers and nanoparticles in a range of applications. Herein, the recent literature on glycogen in the material&#8208;based sciences, including its use as a constituent in biodegradable hydrogels and fibers, drug delivery vectors, tumor targeting and penetrating nanoparticles, immunomodulators, vaccine adjuvants, and contrast agents, is reviewed. The various methods of chemical functionalization and physical assembly of glycogen nanoparticles into multicomponent nanodevices, which advance glycogen toward a functional therapeutic nanoparticle from nature and back again, are discussed in detail.

      <title>&#8220;Lattice Strain Matching&#8221;&#8208;Enabled Nanocomposite Design to Harness the Exceptional Mechanical Properties of Nanomaterials in Bulk Forms</title>
      <dc:description>
Lattice strain matching between the uniform elastic strains of nanowires and the uniform lattice&#8208;distortion strain of the martensitic transformation of the matrix in composites allows an effective load transfer from the matrix to the nanowires. This induces ultralarge elastic strains in nanowires, overcoming a long&#8208;standing challenge to harness the superior intrinsic properties of nanomaterials in bulk forms.








Abstract
Nanosized materials are known to have the ability to withstand ultralarge elastic strains (4&#8211;10%) and to have ultrahigh strengths approaching their theoretical limits. However, it is a long&#8208;standing challenge to harnessing their exceptional intrinsic mechanical properties in bulk forms. This is commonly known as &#8220;the valley of death&#8221; in nanocomposite design. In 2013, a breakthrough was made to overcome this challenge by using a martensitic phase transforming matrix to create a composite in which ultralarge elastic lattice strains up to 6.7% are achieved in Nb nanoribbons embedded in it. This breakthrough was enabled by a novel concept of phase transformation assisted lattice strain matching between the uniform ultralarge elastic strains (4&#8211;10%) of nanomaterials and the uniform crystallographic lattice distortion strains (4&#8211;10%) of the martensitic phase transformation of the matrix. This novel concept has opened new opportunities for developing materials of exceptional mechanical properties or enhanced functional properties that are not possible before. The work in progress in this research over the past six years is reported.

      <title>How Nanoparticles Transform Single Molecule Measurements into Quantitative Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
The emerging applications of nanoparticle&#8208;enabled single&#8208;molecule detection are introduced. The recent advances in the development of single&#8208;nanoparticle assays for quantitative analysis as well as multiplexed detection are summarized. The key challenges and the prospects in this exciting field of research are also highlighted.








Abstract
Single molecule measurements are revolutionizing the understanding of the stochastics of behavior of single molecules. There is a common theme referred to as a near&#8208;field approach, in how many single molecule measurements are being performed in assays. The term near field is used because the measurement volume is typically very small such that a single molecule, or a single molecule binding pair, within that volume is of an appreciable concentration. The next development in detection will be performing many single molecule measurements at one time such that single molecule measurements can be used as the basis for quantitative analysis. There have already been some notable developments in this direction. Again, all have a common theme in that nanoparticles are used to create many near&#8208;field volumes that can be measured simultaneously. Herein, the coupled developments in nanoparticles and measurement strategies that allow nanoparticles to be the backbone of the next generation of sensing technologies are discussed.

     alt="How Nanoparticles Transform Single Molecule Measurements into Quantitative Sensors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging applications of nanoparticle&#8208;enabled single&#8208;molecule detection are introduced. The recent advances in the development of single&#8208;nanoparticle assays for quantitative analysis as well as multiplexed detection are summarized. The key challenges and the prospects in this exciting field of research are also highlighted.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single molecule measurements are revolutionizing the understanding of the stochastics of behavior of single molecules. There is a common theme referred to as a near&#8208;field approach, in how many single molecule measurements are being performed in assays. The term near field is used because the measurement volume is typically very small such that a single molecule, or a single molecule binding pair, within that volume is of an appreciable concentration. The next development in detection will be performing many single molecule measurements at one time such that single molecule measurements can be used as the basis for quantitative analysis. There have already been some notable developments in this direction. Again, all have a common theme in that nanoparticles are used to create many near&#8208;field volumes that can be measured simultaneously. Herein, the coupled developments in nanoparticles and measurement strategies that allow nanoparticles to be the backbone of the next generation of sensing technologies are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding Rechargeable Battery Function Using In Operando Neutron Powder Diffraction</title>
      <dc:description>
In operando neutron powder diffraction measurements enable a unique understanding of the phase transformations and structural changes of active materials within functioning batteries to be gained. The development and use of neutron powder diffraction for in operando measurements of rechargeable batteries is summarized, including experimental methods and approaches that impact the insight into battery materials function obtained.








Abstract
The performance of rechargeable batteries is influenced by the structural and phase changes of components during cycling. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) provides unique and useful information concerning the structure&#8211;function relation of battery components and can be used to study the changes to component phase and structure during battery cycling, known as in operando measurement studies. The development and use of NPD for in operando measurements of batteries is summarized along with detailed experimental approaches that impact the insights gained by these. A summary of the information gained concerning battery function using in operando NPD measurements is provided, including the structural and phase evolution of electrode materials and charge&#8208;carrying ion diffusion pathways through these, which are critical to the development of battery technology.

      <title>Photocatalytic and Photoelectrochemical Systems: Similarities and Differences</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoactive semiconductors have been extensively used in solar energy conversion applications. They are typically employed in either photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical systems. Although some generic strategies to improve the materials have been formulated, the requirements to achieve excellent activities are different in both processes. Insightful discussions on the aspects for consideration in developing excellent photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems are provided.








Abstract
Photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical processes are two key systems in harvesting sunlight for energy and environmental applications. As both systems are employing photoactive semiconductors as the major active component, strategies have been formulated to improve the properties of the semiconductors for better performances. However, requirements to yield excellent performances are different in these two distinctive systems. Although there are universal strategies applicable to improve the performance of photoactive semiconductors, similarities and differences exist when the semiconductors are to be used differently. Here, considerations on selected typical factors governing the performances in photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems, even though the same type of semiconductor is used, are provided. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms in relation to their photoactivities is of fundamental importance for rational design of high&#8208;performing photoactive materials, which may serve as a general guideline for the fabrication of good photocatalysts or photoelectrodes toward sustainable solar fuel generation.

      <title>Design Strategies to Enable the Efficient Use of Sodium Metal Anodes in High&#8208;Energy Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
To develop better and safer Na anodes for high&#8208;energy Na&#8208;based batteries, it is essential to improve the understanding of the underlying battery chemistry and the materials applied. Challenges for using Na metal anodes are summarized and the recently developed material and design strategies to enable the efficient use of Na metal anodes are provided.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based batteries have attracted considerable attention and are recognized as ideal candidates for large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost energy storage. Sodium (Na) metal anodes are considered as one of the most promising anodes for next&#8208;generation, high&#8208;energy, Na&#8208;based batteries owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (1166 mA h g&#8722;1) and low standard electrode potential. Herein, an overview of the recent developments in Na metal anodes for high&#8208;energy batteries is provided. The high reactivity and large volume expansion of Na metal anodes during charge and discharge make the electrode/electrolyte interphase unstable, leading to the formation of Na dendrites, short cycle life, and safety issues. Design strategies to enable the efficient use of Na metal anodes are elucidated, including liquid electrolyte engineering, electrode/electrolyte interface optimization, sophisticated electrode construction, and solid electrolyte engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and future research directions are identified. It is hoped that this progress report will shape a consistent view of this field and provide inspiration for future research to improve Na metal anodes and enable the development of high&#8208;energy sodium batteries.

      <title>Advanced Actuator Materials Powered by Biomimetic Helical Fiber Topologies</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanical actuation systems in plants and animals almost always involve helical structures and studies show that a helical arrangement of fibers in a compliant matrix generates a great diversity of movements and mechanical amplifications. Opportunities are identified to develop advanced artificial muscles since only a limited number of nature's mechanisms have been recreated in biomimetic systems to date.








Abstract
Helical constructs are ubiquitous in nature at all size domains, from molecular to macroscopic. The helical topology confers unique mechanical functions that activate certain phenomena, such as twining vines and vital cellular functions like the folding and packing of DNA into chromosomes. The understanding of active mechanical processes in plants, certain musculature in animals, and some biochemical processes in cells provides insight into the versatility of the helix. Most of these natural systems consist of helically oriented filaments embedded in a compliant matrix. In some cases, the matrix can change volume and in others the filaments can contract and the matrix is passive. In both cases, the helically arranged fibers determine the overall shape change with a great variety of responses involving length contraction/elongation, twisting, bending, and coiling. Synthetic actuator materials and systems that employ helical topologies have been described recently and demonstrate many fascinating and complex shape changes. However, significant new opportunities exist to mimic some of the most remarkable actions in nature, including the Vorticella's coiling stalk and DNA's supercoils, in the quest for superior artificial muscles.

      <title>Recent Progress of In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy for Energy Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the most direct way to observe the chemical and physical nanoscale dynamics of materials for energy applications. Recent progress of in situ TEM with respect to rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis is discussed.








Abstract
In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the most powerful approaches for revealing physical and chemical process dynamics at atomic resolutions. The most recent developments for in situ TEM techniques are summarized; in particular, how they enable visualization of various events, measure properties, and solve problems in the field of energy by revealing detailed mechanisms at the nanoscale. Related applications include rechargeable batteries such as Li&#8208;ion, Na&#8208;ion, Li&#8211;O2, Na&#8211;O2, Li&#8211;S, etc., fuel cells, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. To promote various applications, the methods of introducing the in situ stimuli of heating, cooling, electrical biasing, light illumination, and liquid and gas environments are discussed. The progress of recent in situ TEM in energy applications should inspire future research on new energy materials in diverse energy&#8208;related areas.

      <title>Exosomes and Nanoengineering: A Match Made for Precision Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in research and development of aptamer&#8208;guided exosomes as a new nanoengineering strategy to achieve targeted drug delivery using bio&#8208;nanoparticles highlight a promising next generation of targeted drug delivery systems. Cross&#8208;fertilization between areas of exosomes and aptamers in both preclinical translational studies predicts a bright future for aptamer&#8208;guided exosomal delivery in precision nanomedicine.








Abstract
Targeted exosomal delivery systems for precision nanomedicine attract wide interest across areas of molecular cell biology, pharmaceutical sciences, and nanoengineering. Exosomes are naturally derived 50&#8211;150 nm nanovesicles that play important roles in cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell and/or cell&#8208;to&#8208;tissue communications and cross&#8208;species communication. Exosomes are also a promising class of novel drug delivery vehicles owing to their ability to shield their payload from chemical and enzymatic degradations as well as to evade recognition by and subsequent removal by the immune system. Combined with a new class of affinity ligands known as aptamers or chemical antibodies, molecularly targeted exosomes are poised to become the next generation of smartly engineered nanovesicles for precision medicine. Here, recent advances in targeted exosomal delivery systems engineered by aptamer for future strategies to promote human health using this class of human&#8208;derived nanovesicles are summarized.

Disruptive second&#8208;skin&#8208;like wearable biosensing technologies may enable a paradigm shift from current wearable 1.0 to future wearable 2.0 products. This may lead to ultimate biointegrated electronics transforming the healthcare industries.

Abstract
The wearable industry is on the rise, with a myriad of technical applications ranging from real&#8208;time health monitoring, the Internet of Things, and robotics, to name but a few. However, there is a saying &#8220;wearable is not wearable&#8221; because the current market&#8208;available wearable sensors are largely bulky and rigid, leading to uncomfortable wearing experience, motion artefacts, and poor data accuracy. This has aroused a world&#8208;wide intensive research quest for novel materials, with the aim of fabricating next&#8208;generation ultra&#8208;lightweight and soft wearable devices.

      <title>Liquefied Sunshine: Transforming Renewables into Fertilizers and Energy Carriers with Electromaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Australia has an enormous potential to generate renewable energy from wind and solar, vastly more than is needed for domestic use. Most of this generation capacity is in remote regions such that means of transporting and storing this energy is required. Advances in the electrochemical production of chemical energy carriers including hydrogen, reduced carbon compounds, and ammonia are discussed.








Abstract
It has become apparent that renewable energy sources are plentiful in many, often remote, parts of the world, such that storing and transporting that energy has become the key challenge. For long&#8208;distance transportation by pipeline and bulk tanker, a liquid form of energy carrier is ideal, focusing attention on liquid hydrogen and ammonia. Development of high&#8208;activity and selectivity electrocatalyst materials to produce these energy carriers by reductive electrochemistry has therefore become an important area of research. Here, recent developments and challenges in the field of electrocatalytic materials for these processes are discussed, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Some of the mis&#8208;steps currently plaguing the nitrogen reduction to ammonia field are highlighted. The rapidly growing roles that in situ/operando and quantum chemical studies can play in new electromaterials discovery are also surveyed.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Polymeric Materials through Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking has recently emerged as a promising strategy for creating high&#8208;performance polymeric materials via self&#8208;association of multiple hydrogen bonds or the addition of external cross&#8208;linkers. These polymers exhibit a unique combination of high strength, large extensibility, thermostability, and even healable capability. Such a performance portfolio enables these polymeric materials to find many potential applications in the electronics and gas&#8208;separation fields.








Abstract
It has always been critical to develop high&#8208;performance polymeric materials with exceptional mechanical strength and toughness, thermal stability, and even healable properties for meeting performance requirements in industry. Conventional chemical cross&#8208;linking leads to enhanced mechanical strength and thermostability at the expense of extensibility due to mutually exclusive mechanisms. Such major challenges have recently been addressed by using noncovalent cross&#8208;linking of reversible multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonds (H&#8208;bonds) that widely exist in biological materials, such as silk and muscle. Recent decades have witnessed the development of many tailor&#8208;made high&#8208;performance H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials. Here, recent advances in H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking strategies are reviewed for creating high&#8208;performance polymeric materials. H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking of polymers can be realized via i) self&#8208;association of interchain multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions or specific H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking motifs, such as 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidone units with self&#8208;complementary quadruple H&#8208;bonds and ii) addition of external cross&#8208;linkers, including small molecules, nanoparticles, and polymer aggregates. The resultant cross&#8208;linked polymers normally exhibit tunable high strength, large extensibility, improved thermostability, and healable capability. Such performance portfolios enable these advanced polymers to find many significant cutting&#8208;edge applications. Major challenges facing existing H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking strategies are discussed, and some promising approaches for designing H&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials in the future are also proposed.

      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the development of anticounterfeiting technologies are surveyed. It is demonstrated that lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles hold significant potential for developing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;level anticounterfeiting technologies. This is a result of synthesis scale&#8208;up, their multidimensional optical properties, and design strategies to encrypt information. Engineering compact smartphone&#8208;based decryption devices is a future trend for next&#8208;generation anticounterfeiting technologies.








Abstract
Optical nanomaterials have been widely used in anticounterfeiting applications. There have been significant developments powered by recent advances in material science, printing technologies, and the availability of smartphone&#8208;based decoding technology. Recent progress in this field is surveyed, including the availability of optical reflection, absorption, scattering, and luminescent nanoparticles. It is demonstrated that advances in the design and synthesis of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles will lead to the next generation of anticounterfeiting technologies. Their tunable optical properties and optical responses to a range of external stimuli allow high&#8208;security level information encoding. Challenges in the scale&#8208;up synthesis of nanomaterials, engineering of assessorial devices for smart&#8208;phone&#8208;based decryption, and alignment to the potential markets which will lead to new directions for research, are discussed.

      <title>Shaping the Future of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes through Computational Modeling</title>
      <dc:description>
Developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for use in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is challenging due to their low rates of diffusion compared to liquids, and complexities at the SSE/electrode interfaces. The role of theoretical simulations in dealing with these challenges is reviewed and a brief outlook about the future of simulations in studying the ASSB technology is presented.








Abstract
Advances and progress in computational research that aims to understand and improve solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are outlined. One of the main challenges in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is the design of new SSEs with high ion diffusivity that maintain chemical and phase stability and thereby provide a wide electrochemical stability window. Solving this problem requires a deep understanding of the diffusion mechanism and properties of the SSEs. A second important challenge is the development of an understanding of the interface between the SSE and the electrode. The role of molecular simulations and modeling in dealing with these challenges is discussed, with reference to examples in the literature. The methods used and issues considered in recent years are highlighted. Finally, a brief outlook about the future of modeling in studying solid&#8208;state battery technology is presented.

      <title>Microplasmas for Advanced Materials and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Microplasmas with exotic high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and nonequilibrium features are highly promising for the development of advanced materials and devices. The unique and useful properties of microplasmas, recent progress in nanomaterials production, and commercial applications are reviewed. The analysis may help guide rational synthesis of advanced functional materials and design of plasma devices in the future to meet the emerging demands in various fields.








Abstract
Microplasmas are low&#8208;temperature plasmas that feature microscale dimensions and a unique high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and a nonequilibrium reactive environment, which makes them promising for the fabrication of advanced nanomaterials and devices for diverse applications. Here, recent microplasma applications are examined, spanning from high&#8208;throughput, printing&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible synthesis of nanocrystalline particles of common materials types, to water purification and optoelectronic devices. Microplasmas combined with gaseous and/or liquid media at low temperatures and atmospheric pressure open new ways to form advanced functional materials and devices. Specific examples include gas&#8208;phase, substrate&#8208;free, plasma&#8208;liquid, and surface&#8208;supported synthesis of metallic, semiconducting, metal oxide, and carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials. Representative applications of microplasmas of particular importance to materials science and technology include light sources for multipurpose, efficient VUV/UV light sources for photochemical materials processing and spectroscopic materials analysis, surface disinfection, water purification, active electromagnetic devices based on artificial microplasma optical materials, and other devices and systems including the plasma transistor. The current limitations and future opportunities for microplasma applications in materials related fields are highlighted.

      <title>Solvation&#8208;Involved Nanoionics: New Opportunities from 2D Nanomaterial Laminar Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
Solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics is the study of ion transport and storage in nanoporous structures immersed in liquids involving various short&#8208;range atomic interactions. The fundamentals are introduced and the progress and opportunities enabled by 2D nanomaterial laminar membranes are discussed, which is of great interest for energy storage, desalination, ionic devices, and others.








Abstract
Nanoporous laminar membranes composed of multilayered 2D nanomaterials (2D&#8208;NLMs) are increasingly being exploited as a unique material platform for understanding solvated ion transport under nanoconfinement and exploring novel nanoionics&#8208;related applications, such as ion sieving, energy storage and harvesting, and in other new ionic devices. Here, the fundamentals of solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics in terms of ionic interactions and their effect on ionic transport behaviors are discussed. This is followed by a summary of key requirements for materials that are being used for solvation&#8208;involved nanoionics research, culminating in a demonstration of unique features of 2D&#8208;NLMs. Selected examples of using 2D&#8208;NLMs to address the key scientific problems related to nanoconfined ion transport and storage are then presented to demonstrate their enormous potential and capabilities for nanoionics research and applications. To conclude, a personal perspective on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field is presented.

      <title>2D Electrocatalysts for Converting Earth&#8208;Abundant Simple Molecules into Value&#8208;Added Commodity Chemicals: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in 2D electrocatalysts are reviewed for emerging applications that utilize naturally existing nitrogen, oxygen, water, seawater, and methane as feedstocks. Areas of application considered include nitrogen reduction, two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction, methane partial oxidation, and chorine evolution reactions to electrocatalytically generate ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, methanol, and chorine.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into value&#8208;added commodity chemicals can transform current chemical production regimes with enormous socioeconomic and environmental benefits. For these applications, 2D electrocatalysts have emerged as a new class of high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst with massive forward&#8208;looking potential. Recent advances in 2D electrocatalysts are reviewed for emerging applications that utilize naturally existing H2O, N2, O2, Cl&#8722; (seawater) and CH4 (natural gas) as reactants for nitrogen reduction (N2 &#8594; NH3), two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (O2 &#8594; H2O2), chlorine evolution (Cl&#8722; &#8594; Cl2), and methane partial oxidation (CH4 &#8594; CH3OH) reactions to generate NH3, H2O2, Cl2, and CH3OH. The unique 2D features and effective approaches that take advantage of such features to create high&#8208;performance 2D electrocatalysts are articulated with emphasis. To benefit the readers and expedite future progress, the challenges facing the future development of 2D electrocatalysts for each of the above reactions and the related perspectives are provided.

      <title>Nanostructured Carbon Nitrides for CO2 Capture and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanostructured carbon nitride (CN) is studied as an advantageous platform for simultaneous CO2 capture and conversion to valuable feedstock using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, with remarkable catalytic activity, long durability, and high selectivity. The progressively discovered various novel CN materials and their hybrid nanostructures for the catalytic reduction of CO2 are highlighted, along with research challenges, opportunities, and future perspectives on this topic.








Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN), a 2D material composed of only carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), which are linked by strong covalent bonds, has been used as a metal&#8208;devoid and visible&#8208;light&#8208;active photocatalyst owing to its magnificent optoelectronic and physicochemical properties including suitable bandgap, adjustable energy&#8208;band positions, tailor&#8208;made surface functionalities, low cost, metal&#8208;free nature, and high thermal, chemical, and mechanical stabilities. CN&#8208;based materials possess a lot of advantages over conventional metal&#8208;based inorganic photocatalysts including ease of synthesis and processing, versatile functionalization or doping, flexibility for surface engineering, low cost, sustainability, and recyclability without any leaching of toxic metals from photocorrosion. Carbon nitrides and their hybrid materials have emerged as attractive candidates for CO2 capture and its reduction into clean and green low&#8208;carbon fuels and valuable chemical feedstock by using sustainable and intermittent renewable energy sources of sunlight and electricity through the heterogeneous photo(electro)catalysis. Here, the latest research results in this field are summarized, including implementation of novel functionalized nanostructured CNs and their hybrid heterostructures in meeting the stringent requirements to raise the efficiency of the CO2 reduction process by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and feedstock reactions. The research in this field is primarily focused on advancement in the synthesis of nanostructured and functionalized CN&#8208;based hybrid heterostructured materials. More importantly, the recent past has seen a surge in studies focusing significantly on exploring the mechanism of their application perspectives, which include the behavior of the materials for the absorption of light, charge separation, and pathways for the transport of CO2 during the reduction process.

      <title>Role of Biomaterials and Controlled Architecture on Tendon/Ligament Repair and Regeneration</title>
      <dc:description>
Engineering synthetic tendons and ligaments (T/L) capable of both supporting appropriate tissue growth and providing biomechanical support for physiological loading is a significant challenge. Recent developments in the understanding of both material and architectural parameters that influence the repair and regeneration of T/L and advances in fabrication techniques are reviewed.








Abstract
Engineering synthetic scaffolds to repair and regenerate ruptured native tendon and ligament (T/L) tissues is a significant engineering challenge due to the need to satisfy both the unique biological and biomechanical properties of these tissues. Long&#8208;term clinical outcomes of synthetic scaffolds relying solely on high uniaxial tensile strength are poor with high rates of implant rupture and synovitis. Ideal biomaterials for T/L repair and regeneration need to possess the appropriate biological and biomechanical properties necessary for the successful repair and regeneration of ruptured tendon and ligament tissues.

      <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Separators for Ionic&#8208;Liquid Electrolytes: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Separators with different processing methods, polymers, additives, and different ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes are reviewed, specifically, separator morphology and ionic conductivity with an IL electrolyte. A compatible separator must be developed before ionic liquid electrolytes can be used in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The challenge of a suitable separator for IL electrolytes is not solved yet.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are widely studied as a safer alternative electrolyte for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The properties of IL electrolytes compared to conventional electrolytes make them more thermally stable, but they also have poor wetting with commercial separators. In a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the electrolyte should completely wet out the separator and electrodes to reduce the cell internal resistance. Investigations of cell materials with IL electrolytes have shown that the wetting issues in IL&#8211;electrolyte cells are most likely due to poor separator compatibility, not electrode compatibility. A compatible separator must be developed before IL electrolytes can be used in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, separators for IL electrolytes, including commercial and novel separators, are reviewed. Separators with different processing methods, polymers, additives, and different IL electrolytes are considered. Collated, the separator studies show a strong correlation between ionic conductivity and membrane porosity, even more than the electrolyte type. The challenge of a suitable separator for IL electrolytes is not solved yet. Herein, it is revealed that a separator for IL electrolytes will most likely require a combination of high thermal and mechanical stability polymer, ceramic additives, and an optimized manufacturing process.

Amyloidosis is a biophysical phenomenon of protein aggregation with biological and pathogenic implications. Among the various strategies developed to date, nanomaterials and multifunctional nanocomposites possessing certain structural and physicochemical traits are promising candidates for mitigating amyloidosis in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms underpinning protein aggregation and toxicity are introduced, and opportunities in materials science to drive this interdisciplinary field forward are highlighted. Advancement of this emerging frontier hinges on exploitation of protein self&#8208;assembly and interactions of amyloid proteins with nanoparticles, intracellular and extracellular proteins, chaperones, membranes, organelles, and biometals.

      <title>The Application of the Rare Earths to Magnesium and Titanium Metallurgy in Australia</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress related to research in Australia on magnesium and titanium metallurgy is reviewed, as rare earth elements (REEs) are of great interest for metallurgical applications. Several institutions are noted for extensive subject&#8208;matter expertise, while both the role of Sc and heavy lanthanides in magnesium, and the application of REEs to titanium additive manufacturing, are identified as promising research areas.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) have found application in metallurgical processes for nearly a century due to their unique chemical and physical properties but have gained increased attention in recent decades. Notably, the use of these elements may assist in the development of advanced magnesium and titanium products for applications spanning biomedicine, aerospace, and the automotive industry. To this end, current progress in this area, highlighting work done in Australian research organizations with particular academic expertise, is reviewed. Two areas that require further research are identified: the application of Sc and the heavy lanthanides to the development of novel magnesium alloys and the use of REEs as additives in the development of additive manufacturing of titanium parts.

      <title>Remedies for Polysulfide Dissolution in Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;NaS) batteries are emerging as a very competitive choice for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. The understanding of and strategies for fatal polysulfide dissolution in sulfur cathodes are of crucial importance. Effective remedies in terms of intact physical confinement, strong chemical interaction, blocking layers, and optimization of electrolytes are summarized, followed by future research directions toward practical RT&#8208;NaS batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;NaS) batteries represent one of the most attractive technologies for future stationary energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. The S cathodes can react with Na ions via two&#8208;electron conversion reactions, thus achieving ultrahigh theoretical capacity (1672 mAh g&#8722;1) and specific energy (1273 Wh kg&#8722;1). Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics of the nonconductive S, severe polysulfide dissolution, and the use of metallic Na are causing enormous challenges for the development of RT&#8208;NaS batteries. Fatal polysulfide dissolution is highlighted, important studies toward polysulfide immobilization and conversion are presented, and the reported remedies in terms of intact physical confinement, strong chemical interaction, blocking layers, and optimization of electrolytes are summarized. Future research directions toward practical RT&#8208;NaS batteries are summarized.

      <title>Toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Metal Batteries: Opportunities and Challenges for Solid Organic Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safe solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are vital to advance today's consumer electronic and automobile applications. The advances in electromaterials research at Deakin University are summarized, with a focus on alternative solid electrolyte designs, including organic ionic plastic crystals, novel polymer electrolytes, and high capacity cathodes.








Abstract
With increasing demands for safe, high capacity energy storage to support personal electronics, newer devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as the commercialization of electric vehicles, current energy storage technologies are facing increased challenges. Although alternative batteries have been intensively investigated, lithium (Li) batteries are still recognized as the preferred energy storage solution for the consumer electronics markets and next generation automobiles. However, the commercialized Li batteries still have disadvantages, such as low capacities, potential safety issues, and unfavorable cycling life. Therefore, the design and development of electromaterials toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span Li batteries with improved safety is a focus for researchers in the field of energy materials. Herein, recent advances in the development of novel organic electrolytes are summarized toward solid&#8208;state Li batteries with higher energy density and improved safety. On the basis of new insights into ionic conduction and design principles of organic&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes, specific strategies toward developing these electrolytes for Li metal anodes, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials (e.g., high voltage materials), as well as the optimization of cathode formulations are outlined. Finally, prospects for next generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes are also proposed.

      <title>2D Superlattices for Efficient Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent progress on 2D superlattices prepared by solution&#8208;phase strategies using diverse genuine unilamellar nanosheets as building blocks is summarized. A flocculation strategy is considered an efficient method for large&#8208;scale synthesis of these 2D superlattices. High&#8208;performance devices enabled by these 2D superlattices for energy storage and conversion are presented together with a discussion on challenges and perspectives.








Abstract
2D genuine unilamellar nanosheets, that are, the elementary building blocks of their layered parent crystals, have gained increasing attention, owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, and 2D features. In parallel with the great efforts to isolate these atomic&#8208;thin crystals, a unique strategy to integrate them into 2D vertically stacked heterostuctures has enabled many functional applications. In particular, such 2D heterostructures have recently exhibited numerous exciting electrochemical performances for energy storage and conversion, especially the molecular&#8208;scale heteroassembled superlattices using diverse 2D unilamellar nanosheets as building blocks. Herein, the research progress in scalable synthesis of 2D superlattices with an emphasis on a facile solution&#8208;phase flocculation method is summarized. A particular focus is brought to the advantages of these 2D superlattices in applications of supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries, and water&#8208;splitting catalysis. The challenges and perspectives on this promising field are also outlined.

      <dc:description>
Focusing on single transition metal (TM) site catalysis, a clear roadmap with the correlations between the catalytic performances in water oxidation and the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site&#8208;based structures including coordination and geometric structure, TM species, and support is provided.

Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, nonprecious transition metal (TM) catalysts toward efficient water oxidation are of critical importance to future sustainable energy technologies. The advances in structure engineering of water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) with single TM centers as active sites, for example, single metallic molecular complexes (SMMCs), supported SMMCs, and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in recent reports are examined. The efforts made on these configurations in terms of design principle, advanced characterization, performances and theoretical studies, are critically reviewed. A clear roadmap with the correlations between the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site&#8208;based structures (coordination and geometric structure, TM species, support), and the catalytic performances in water oxidation is provided. The insights bridging SMMCs with SACs are also given. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in the single&#8208;TM&#8208;site catalysis are proposed.

      <title>The Quest for Zero Loss: Unconventional Materials for Plasmonics</title>
      <dc:description>
The quest for superior plasmonic materials is discussed and the evolution of the field from the elements, through to alloys and intermetallic compounds, semiconductors, conducting oxides and, most recently, topological insulators, considered. Although both gold and silver remain very attractive choices for plasmonic devices, it is shown that there are instances where alternative materials may be a better choice.








Abstract
There has been an ongoing quest to optimize the materials used to build plasmonic devices: first the elements were investigated, then alloys and intermetallic compounds, later semiconductors were considered, and, most recently, there has been interest in using more exotic materials such as topological insulators and conducting oxides. The quality of the plasmon resonances in these materials is closely correlated with their structure and properties. In general gold and silver are the most commonly specified materials for these applications but they do have weaknesses. Here, it is shown how, in specific circumstances, the selection of certain other materials might be more useful. Candidate alternatives include TixN, VO2, Al, Cu, Al&#8208;doped ZnO, and Cu&#8211;Al alloys. The relative merits of these choices and the many pitfalls and subtle problems that arise are discussed, and a frank perspective on the field is provided.

Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the top ten leading causes of death globally and the worst killer in low&#8208;income countries. The overuse of antibiotics leads to ever&#8208;increasing antibiotic resistance, posing a severe threat to human health. Recent advances in nanotechnology provide new opportunities to address the challenges in bacterial infection by killing germs without using antibiotics. Antibiotic&#8208;free antibacterial strategies enabled by advanced nanomaterials are presented. Nanomaterials are classified on the basis of their mode of action: nanomaterials with intrinsic or light&#8208;mediated bactericidal properties and others that serve as vehicles for the delivery of natural antibacterial compounds. Specific attention is given to antibacterial mechanisms and the structure&#8211;performance relationship. Practical antibacterial applications employing these antibiotic&#8208;free strategies are also introduced.

      <title>3D Printed Mechanically Robust Graphene/CNT Electrodes for Highly Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Bioinspired electrodes of 3D printed graphene reinforced by 1D carbon nanotubes (3DP GC), which demonstrate outstanding flexural strength and hierarchical porous structure, are produced via an extrusion&#8208;based 3D printing strategy. The 3DP GC electrodes developed in this work have great potential for a variety of energy conversion and storage, environmental, and electronic applications where high flexural strength and hierarchical porous structure are in pressing demand.








Abstract
3D printing of graphene electrodes with high mechanical strength has been a growing interest in the development of advanced energy, environment, and electronic systems, yet is extremely challenging. Herein, a 3D printed bioinspired electrode of graphene reinforced with 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (3DP GC) with both high flexural strength and hierarchical porous structure is reported via a 3D printing strategy. Mechanics modeling reveals the critical role of the 1D CNTs in the enhanced flexural strength by increasing the friction and adhesion between the 2D graphene nanosheets. The 3DP GC electrodes hold distinct advantages: i) an intrinsically high flexural strength that enables their large&#8208;scale applications; and ii) a hierarchical porous structure that offers large surface area and interconnected channels, endowing fast mass and/or charge and ions transport rate, which is thus beneficial for acting as an ideal catalyst carrier. The 3DP GC electrode integrated with a NiFeP nanosheets array exhibits a voltage of 1.58 V at 30 mA cm&#8722;2 as bifunctional electrode for water splitting, which is much better than most of the reported Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208;, and Fe&#8208;based bifunctional electrocatalysts. Importantly, this study paves the way for the practical applications of 3D printed graphene electrodes in many energy conversion/storage, environmental, and electronic systems where high flexural strength is preferred.

      <title>A Rational Reconfiguration of Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8211;Chalcogen Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The rational reconfiguration of an electrolyte enabled by an in situ interfacial polymerization strategy is demonstrated. This strategy endows Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;Se batteries with high capacity, stable cycling, and excellent rate performances simultaneously, and may become a new pathway toward the large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective applications of future Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;chalcogen batteries are an appealing choice for high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage technology. However, the traditional battery that employs liquid electrolytes suffers irreversible loss and shuttle of the soluble intermediates. New batteries that adopt Li+&#8208;conductive polymer electrolytes to mitigate the shuttle problem are hindered by incomplete discharge of sulfur/selenium. To address the trade&#8208;off between energy and cycle life, a new electrolyte is proposed that reconciles the merits of liquid and polymer electrolytes while resolving each of their inferiorities. An in situ interfacial polymerization strategy is developed to create a liquid/polymer hybrid electrolyte between a LiPF6&#8208;coated separator and the cathode. A polymer&#8208;gel electrolyte in situ formed on the separator shows high Li+ transfer number to serve as a chemical barrier against the shuttle effect. Between the gel electrolyte and the cathode surface is a thin gradient solidification layer that enables transformation from gel to liquid so that the liquid electrolyte is maintained inside the cathode for rapid Li+ transport and high utilization of active materials. By addressing the dilemma between the shuttle chemistry and incomplete discharge of S/Se, the new electrolyte configuration demonstrates its feasibility to trigger higher capacity retention of the cathodes. As a result, Li&#8211;S and Li&#8211;Se cells with high energy and long cycle lives are realized, showing promise for practical use.

      <title>High Phase Stability in CsPbI3 Enabled by Pb&#8211;I Octahedra Anchors for Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
CsPbI3 inorganic perovskite exhibits some special unique properties including crystal structure distortion and quantum confinement effect, yet the poor phase stability severely hinders its application.

Abstract
CsPbI3 inorganic perovskite has exhibited some special properties particularly crystal structure distortion and quantum confinement effect, yet the poor phase stability of CsPbI3 severely hinders its applications. Herein, the nature of the photoactive CsPbI3 phase transition from the perspective of PbI6 octahedra is revealed. A facile method is also developed to stabilize the photoactive phase and to reduce the defect density of CsPbI3. CsPbI3 is decorated with multifunctional 4&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (ABA), and steric neostigmine bromide (NGBr) is subsequently used to further mediate the thin films' surface (NGBr&#8208;CsPbI3(ABA)). The ABA or NG cation adsorbed onto the grain boundaries/surface of CsPbI3 anchors the PbI6 octahedra via increasing the energy barriers of octahedral rotation, which maintains the continuous array of corner&#8208;sharing PbI6 octahedra and kinetically stabilizes the photoactive phase CsPbI3. Moreover, the added ABA and NGBr not only interact with shallow&#8208; or deep&#8208;level defects in CsPbI3 to significantly reduce defect density, but also lead to improved energy&#8208;level alignment at the interfaces between the CsPbI3 and the charge transport layers. Finally, the champion NGBr&#8208;CsPbI3(ABA)&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cell delivers 18.27% efficiency with excellent stability. Overall, this work demonstrates a promising concept to achieve highly phase&#8208;stabilized inorganic perovskite with suppressed defect density for promoting its optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Multifunctional Bio&#8208;Nanocomposite Coatings for Perishable Fruits</title>
      <dc:description>
A conformal bio&#8208;nanocomposite coating based on cellulose nanocrystals and poly(albumen) is developed that increases the shelf&#8208;life of fresh produce by retarding ripening, dehydration, and microbial attack. The coating is edible, easily washable, and made from readily available inexpensive materials, which makes it a promising solution to combat food wastage.








Abstract
Hunger and chronic undernourishment impact over 800 million people, which translates to &#8776;10.7% of the world's population. While countries are increasingly making efforts to reduce poverty and hunger by pursuing sustainable energy and agricultural practices, a third of the food produced around the globe still is wasted and never consumed. Reducing food shortages is vital in this effort and is often addressed by the development of genetically modified produce or chemical additives and inedible coatings, which create additional health and environmental concerns. Herein, a multifunctional bio&#8208;nanocomposite comprised largely of egg&#8208;derived polymers and cellulose nanomaterials as a conformal coating onto fresh produce that slows down food decay by retarding ripening, dehydration, and microbial invasion is reported. The coating is edible, washable, and made from readily available inexpensive or waste materials, which makes it a promising economic alternative to commercially available fruit coatings and a solution to combat food wastage that is rampant in the world.

      <title>Gadolinium&#8211;Rose Bengal Coordination Polymer Nanodots for MR&#8208;/Fluorescence&#8208;Image&#8208;Guided Radiation and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Gadolinium&#8211;rose bengal coordination polymer nanodots exhibit enhanced dual&#8208;modal imaging, as well as significant increase of singlet oxygen generation and radiosensitization over free rose bengal. In vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiation therapy (RT) more significantly inhibits tumor growth than monotherapies (i.e., PDT or RT).








Abstract
Combination therapy based on nanomedicine has gained momentum in oncology in recent years, offering superior safety and efficacy over monotherapies. It is critical to design theranostics that are composed of imaging and therapeutic agents already approved. Herein, gadolinium (Gd)&#8211;rose bengal coordination polymer nanodots (GRDs) are reported. The GRDs exhibit a unique absorption property and 7.7&#8208;fold luminescence enhancement, as well as a 1.9&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen generation efficiency over free rose bengal. Meanwhile, GRDs exhibit a twofold increase in r1 relaxivity over gadopentetic acid (Gd&#8208;DTPA) and have better X&#8208;ray absorption ability than rose bengal alone. These excellent properties of the GRDs are verified both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and radiation therapy (RT) more significantly inhibits tumor growth than monotherapies (i.e., PDT or RT). This work offers a new route to designing and synthesizing Gd&#8208;based nanotheranostics for image&#8208;guided cancer therapy.

      <title>Anisotropy of Charge Transport in a Uniaxially Aligned Fused Electron&#8208;Deficient Polymer Processed by Solution Shear Coating</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive charge transport characterization of two rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymers that do not contain single bonds in their backbones is presented. An extended linear backbone structure is visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy. It allows the use of simple solution&#8208;shearing to form uniaxially aligned polymer films with significant mobility anisotropy for current flow parallel and perpendicular to the chain alignment direction.








Abstract
Precise control of the microstructure in organic semiconductors (OSCs) is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic electronic devices. Here, a comprehensive charge transport characterization of two recently reported rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymers that do not contain single bonds in the main chain is reported. It is demonstrated that the molecular design of the polymer makes it possible to achieve an extended linear backbone structure, which can be directly visualized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The rigid structure of the polymers allows the formation of thin films with uniaxially aligned polymer chains by using a simple one&#8208;step solution&#8208;shear/bar coating technique. These aligned films show a high optical anisotropy with a dichroic ratio of up to a factor of 6. Transport measurements performed using top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact field&#8208;effect transistors exhibit a high saturation electron mobility of 0.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 along the alignment direction, which is more than six times higher than the value reported in the previous work. This work demonstrates that this new class of polymers is able to achieve mobility values comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type polymers and identifies an effective processing strategy for this class of rigid&#8208;rod polymer system to optimize their charge transport properties.

      <title>Sustainable Fuel Production from Ambient Moisture via Ferroelectrically Driven MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Negatively polarized BaTiO3 (BTO)@MoS2, positively polarized BTO@MoS2, and a hydrogel serve as the cathode, anode, and electrolyte for a humidity digester. The hydrogel harvests humidity from humid air and transfers the collected water to surface of the electrodes. Under the well&#8208;tuned polarization, the vector of the built&#8208;in electric field in the ferroelectric can be controlled, and therefore drive enhanced atmospheric humidity splitting for dehumidification and fuel production.








Abstract
Unlike traditional water splitting in an aqueous medium, direct decomposition of atmospheric water is a promising way to simultaneously dehumidify the living space and generate power. Here, a tailored superhygroscopic hydrogel, a catalyst, and a solar cell are integrated into a humidity digester that can break down ambient moisture into hydrogen and oxygen, creating an efficient electrochemical cell. The function of the hydrogel is to harvest moisture from ambient humidity and transfer the collected water to the catalyst. Barium titanate and vertical 2D MoS2 nanosheets are integrated as the catalyst: the negatively polarized cathode can enhance the electron transport and attract H+ to the MoS2 surface for water reduction, while water oxidation takes place at the positively polarized anode. By employing this mechanism, it is possible to maintain the relative humidity in a medium&#8208;sized room at &lt;60% without any additional energy input, and a stable current of 12.5 mA cm&#8722;2 is generated by the humidity digester when exposed to ambient light.

      <title>Tuning the Anode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface Chemistry for Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Li3PO4&#8208;infused Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 via atomic layer deposition with simple annealing is demonstrated to have excellent moisture stability and interfacial stability to a lithium anode by presenting negligible interfacial resistance (&#8776;1 &#937; cm2) and a record&#8208;high critical current density of 2.2 mA cm&#8722;2 at ambient conditions. This new surface/subsurface engineering approach stabilizes the anode&#8211;electrolyte interface for solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is a promising candidate as the anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state batteries. However, interface issues, including large interfacial resistance and the generation of Li dendrites, have always frustrated the attempt to commercialize solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (SSLBs). Here, it is reported that infusing garnet&#8208;type solid electrolytes (GSEs) with the air&#8208;stable electrolyte Li3PO4 (LPO) dramatically reduces the interfacial resistance to &#8776;1 &#937; cm2 and achieves a high critical current density of 2.2 mA cm&#8722;2 under ambient conditions due to the enhanced interfacial stability to the Li metal anode. The coated and infused LPO electrolytes not only improve the mechanical strength and Li&#8208;ion conductivity of the grain boundaries, but also form a stable Li&#8208;ion conductive but electron&#8208;insulating LPO&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase between the Li metal and the GSE. Consequently, the growth of Li dendrites is eliminated and the direct reduction of the GSE by Li metal over a long cycle life is prevented. This interface engineering approach together with grain&#8208;boundary modification on GSEs represents a promising strategy to revolutionize the anode&#8211;electrolyte interface chemistry for SSLBs and provides a new design strategy for other types of solid&#8208;state batteries.

      <title>An Ir/Ni(OH)2 Heterostructured Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Breaking the Scaling Relation, Stabilizing Iridium(V), and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly efficient Ir/Ni(OH)2 heterostructured electrocatalyst is designed for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The heterointerface not only stabilizes the metastable electrophilic Ir(V) species but also breaks the scaling relation, thereby substantially promoting the OER kinetics. The results highlight the significance of heterostructure interface engineering toward the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for the OER and beyond.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly challenging for hydrogen production from water splitting, due to the high energy barrier for O&#63743;O bond formation and the restriction of the scaling relation between the multiple reaction intermediates. In order to simultaneously address these concerns, an Ir/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces is deliberately designed as an efficient electrocatalyst system, with Ir nanoparticles (NPs) homogeneously confined on the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The strong electronic interaction and chemical bonding across the interface between the Ir and Ni(OH)2 can effectively stabilize the metastable electrophilic Ir(V) species, which is vital to boost the formation of O&#63743;O bonds. Meanwhile, the adsorption of the multiple intermediates is synergistically optimized at the heterointerface, which breaks the restrictive scaling relation and substantially accelerates the OER kinetics. In addition, the severe agglomeration of Ir species is greatly mitigated by the confinement effect, ensuring the structural integrity of the catalyst and the constant exposure of active sites. Owing to its well&#8208;defined multifunctional interfaces, the Ir/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure exhibits exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline media. The present results highlight the significance of heterostructure interface engineering toward the rational design and development of advanced electrocatalysts for the OER and beyond.

      <title>Tellurium: A High&#8208;Volumetric&#8208;Capacity Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Electrode Material</title>
      <dc:description>
Tellurium (Te) is demonstrated to be a promising electrode material for storage of K+ ions via a two&#8208;electron conversion&#8208;type reaction mechanism of 2K + Te &#8596; K2Te. A rationally designed tellurium/porous carbon composited electrode that can alleviate the volume change and shuttle effect shows a high volumetric capacity as well as high rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance.








Abstract
Currently, exploring high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;capacity electrode materials that allow for reversible (de&#8208;)insertion of large&#8208;size K+ ions remains challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode for storage of K+ ions due to its high volumetric capacity, confirmed in lithium&#8208;/sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and the intrinsic good electronic conductivity. However, the charge storage capability and mechanism of Te in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have not been unveiled until now. Here, a novel K&#8211;Te battery is constructed, and the K+&#8208;ion storage mechanism of Te is revealed to be a two&#8208;electron conversion&#8208;type reaction of 2K + Te &#8596; K2Te, resulting in a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm&#8722;3. Consequently, the rationally fabricated tellurium/porous carbon electrodes deliver an ultrahigh reversible volumetric capacity of 2493.13 mAh cm&#8722;3 at 0.5 C (based on Te), a high&#8208;rate capacity of 783.13 mAh cm&#8722;3 at 15 C, and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability for 1000 cycles at 5 C. This excellent electrochemical performance proves the feasibility of utilizing Te as a high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;capacity active material for storage of K+ ions and will advance the practical application of KIBs.

      <title>Intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; Conjugation Self&#8208;Assembly to Stabilize Surface Passivation of Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Sufficient and stable surface passivation of perovskite solar cells is realized using a novel tribenzylphosphine oxide molecule, with high cell efficiency of &gt;22% and excellent operation stability being obtained. These achievements benefit from the strong molecule&#8211;perovskite Coulomb interaction and the formation of superstructure self&#8208;assembly on the perovskite surface, enabled by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation.








Abstract
Surface passivation is an effective approach to eliminate defects and thus to achieve efficient perovskite solar cells, while the stability of the passivation effect is a new concern for device stability engineering. Herein, tribenzylphosphine oxide (TBPO) is introduced to stably passivate the perovskite surface. A high efficiency exceeding 22%, with steady&#8208;state efficiency of 21.6%, is achieved, which is among the highest performances for TiO2 planar cells, and the hysteresis is significantly suppressed. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the surface molecule superstructure induced by TBPO intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, such as the periodic interconnected structure, results in a high stability of TBPO&#8211;perovskite coordination and passivation. The passivated cell exhibits significantly improved stability, with sustaining 92% of initial efficiency after 250 h maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking. Therefore, the construction of a stabilized surface passivation in this work represents great progress in the stability engineering of perovskite solar cells.

      <title>A 2D Titanium Carbide MXene Flexible Electrode for High&#8208;Efficiency Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed transparent conducting electrode with desirable properties including high electrical conductivity (&#8776;11 668 S cm&#8722;1) and work function (&#8776;5.1 eV) is achieved by using a 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene thin film. Precise control of the surface chemical composition and a neutralized hole&#8208;injection layer prevent detrimental surface/interface oxidation of the MXene and enable a high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diode that uses the solution&#8208;processed MXene electrode.








Abstract
Although several transparent conducting materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and conducting polymers have been intensively explored as flexible electrodes in optoelectronic devices, their insufficient electrical conductivity, low work function, and complicated electrode fabrication processes have limited their practical use. Herein, a 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2) MXene film with transparent conducting electrode (TCE) properties, including high electrical conductivity (&#8776;11 670 S cm&#8722;1) and high work function (&#8776;5.1 eV), which are achieved by combining a simple solution processing with modulation of surface composition, is described. A chemical neutralization strategy of a conducting&#8208;polymer hole&#8208;injection layer is used to prevent detrimental surface oxidation and resulting degradation of the electrode film. Use of the MXene electrode in an organic light&#8208;emitting diode leads to a current efficiency of &#8776;102.0 cd A&#8722;1 and an external quantum efficiency of &#8776;28.5% ph/el, which agree well with the theoretical maximum values from optical simulations. The results demonstrate the strong potential of MXene as a solution&#8208;processable electrode in optoelectronic devices and provide a guideline for use of MXenes as TCEs in low&#8208;cost flexible optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Heavy Water Additive in Formamidinium: A Novel Approach to Enhance Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>
Deuterium oxide as a solvent additive enhances the power conversion efficiency of triple&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells. It passivates the defects, thus enhancing the charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths. Partial formamidinium deuteration also helps to stabilize the PbI6 structure. This facile approach based on selective isotope exchange could possibly be extended to other perovskite devices to improve their optoelectronic properties.








Abstract
Heavy water or deuterium oxide (D2O) comprises deuterium, a hydrogen isotope twice the mass of hydrogen. Contrary to the disadvantages of deuterated perovskites, such as shorter recombination lifetimes and lower/invariant efficiencies, the serendipitous effect of D2O as a beneficial solvent additive for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of triple&#8208;A cation (cesium (Cs)/methylammonium (MA)/formaminidium (FA)) perovskite solar cells from &#8776;19.2% (reference) to 20.8% (using 1 vol% D2O) with higher stability is reported. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy confirms passivation of trap states, increased carrier recombination lifetimes, and enhanced charge carrier diffusion lengths in the deuterated samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy validate the N&#8211;H2 group as the preferential isotope exchange site. Furthermore, the NMR results reveal the induced alteration of the FA to MA ratio due to deuteration causes a widespread alteration to several dynamic processes that influence the photophysical properties. First&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations reveal a decrease in PbI6 phonon frequencies in the deuterated perovskite lattice. This stabilizes the PbI6 structures and weakens the electron&#8211;LO phonon (Fr&#246;hlich) coupling, yielding higher electron mobility. Importantly, these findings demonstrate that selective isotope exchange potentially opens new opportunities for tuning perovskite optoelectronic properties.

Contrary to the disadvantages of deuterated perovskites, such as shorter recombination lifetimes and lower/invariant efficiencies, the serendipitous effect of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as a beneficial solvent additive for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of triple&#8208;A cation (cesium (Cs)/methylammonium (MA)/formaminidium (FA)) perovskite solar cells from &#8776;19.2% (reference) to 20.8% (using 1 vol% D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) with higher stability is reported. Ultrafast optical spectroscopy confirms passivation of trap states, increased carrier recombination lifetimes, and enhanced charge carrier diffusion lengths in the deuterated samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy validate the N&#8211;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group as the preferential isotope exchange site. Furthermore, the NMR results reveal the induced alteration of the FA to MA ratio due to deuteration causes a widespread alteration to several dynamic processes that influence the photophysical properties. First&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations reveal a decrease in PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; phonon frequencies in the deuterated perovskite lattice. This stabilizes the PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; structures and weakens the electron&#8211;LO phonon (Fr&#246;hlich) coupling, yielding higher electron mobility. Importantly, these findings demonstrate that selective isotope exchange potentially opens new opportunities for tuning perovskite optoelectronic properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Efficient Luminogens with AIE Features for Three&#8208;Photon Fluorescence Imaging of the Brain through the Intact Skull</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrabright solid&#8208;state FR/NIR luminogen with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature is reported. Its resulting AIE dots show good biocompatibility, satisfactory photostability, and a large three&#8208;photon absorption cross section. The AIE dots are reported for visualization of the cerebral thrombosis process of a mouse with intact skull, with high penetration depth and good image contrast.








Abstract
Visualization of the brain in its native environment is important for understanding common brain diseases. Herein, bright luminogens with remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics and high quantum yields of up to 42.6% in the solid state are synthesized through facile reaction routes. The synthesized molecule, namely BTF, shows ultrabright far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared emission and can be fabricated into AIE dots by a simple nanoprecipitation procedure. Due to their high brightness, large Stokes shift, good biocompatibility, satisfactory photostability, and large three&#8208;photon absorption cross section, the AIE dots can be utilized as efficient fluorescent nanoprobes for in vivo brain vascular imaging through the intact skull by a three&#8208;photon fluorescence microscopy imaging technique. This is the first example of using AIE dots for the visualization of the cerebral stroke process through the intact skull of a mouse with high penetration depth and good image contrast. Such good results are anticipated to open up a new venue in the development of efficient emitters with strong nonlinear optical effects for noninvasive bioimaging of living brain.

      <title>An Ultrastrong and Highly Stretchable Polyurethane Elastomer Enabled by a Zipper&#8208;Like Ring&#8208;Sliding Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
A molecular zipper elastomer&#8212;the combination of ring&#8208;sliding effects and dense hydrogen&#8208;bonding crystal domains in a dry polymer network&#8212;results in unexpectedly substantial improvements to the elastomer mechanical performance, including stretchability and strength. The mechanism is found to be the ring&#8208;sliding motion against hydrogen&#8208;bonding domains upon stretching, which effectively dissipates the input mechanical energy.








Abstract
Elastomers with excellent mechanical properties are in substantial demand for various applications, but there is always a tradeoff between their mechanical strength and stretchability. For example, partially replacing strong covalent crosslinking by weak sacrificial bonds can enhance the stretchability but also usually decreases the mechanical strength. To surmount this inherent tradeoff, a supramolecular strategy of introducing a zipper&#8208;like sliding&#8208;ring mechanism in a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;crosslinked polyurethane network is proposed. A very small amount (0.5 mol%) of an external additive (pseudo[2]rotaxane crosslinker) can dramatically increase both the mechanical strength and elongation of this polyurethane network by nearly one order of magnitude. Based on the investigation of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical properties, this enhancement is attributable to a unique molecular&#8208;level zipper&#8208;like ring&#8208;sliding motion, which efficiently dissipates mechanical work in the solvent&#8208;free network. This research not only provides a distinct and general strategy for the construction of high&#8208;performance elastomers but also paves the way for the practical application of artificial molecular machines toward solvent&#8208;free polyurethane networks.

      <title>Phosphonium Modification Leads to Ultrapermeable Antibacterial Polyamide Composite Membranes with Unreduced Thickness</title>
      <dc:description>
Facile modification of polyamide composite membranes by an inexpensive phosphonium monomer featuring tetrahedral geometry is found to create additional water transport channels, improving the water purification performance without reducing film thickness. Compared with cutting&#8208;edge ultrathin membranes, the modified membrane highlights good rejection, antibacterial properties, superior water permeability, and facile preparation.








Abstract
Water transport rate in network membranes is inversely correlated to thickness, thus superior permeance is achievable with ultrathin membranes prepared by complicated methods circumventing nanofilm weakness and defects. Conferring ultrahigh permeance to easily prepared thicker membranes remains challenging. Here, a tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) monomer is discovered that enables straightforward modification of polyamide composite membranes. Water permeance of the modified membrane is &#8776;6 times improved, give rising to permeability (permeance &#215; thickness) one magnitude higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer nanofiltration membranes. Meanwhile, the membrane exhibits good rejection (RNa2SO4 = 98%) and antibacterial properties under crossflow conditions. THPC modification not only improves membrane hydrophilicity, but also creates additional angstrom&#8208;scale channels in polyamide membranes for unimpeded transport of water. This unique mechanism provides a paradigm shift in facile preparation of ultrapermeable membranes with unreduced thickness for clean water and desalination.

      <title>A New Microengineered Platform for 4D Tracking of Single Cells in a Stem&#8208;Cell&#8208;Based In Vitro Morphogenesis Model</title>
      <dc:description>
Several stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based morphogenesis models mimicking embryonic development have been recently developed; however, customized cell culture platforms are needed to unleash their full potential. A new, microengineered platform for 3D suspension culture of mouse stem cell aggregates is presented; enabling microscale control of the position and orientation of elongating stem cell aggregates and real&#8208;time data acquisition at single&#8208;cell resolution.








Abstract
Recently developed stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based in vitro models of morphogenesis can help shed light on the mechanisms involved in embryonic patterning. These models are showcased using traditional cell culture platforms and materials, which allow limited control over the biological system and usually do not support high&#8208;content imaging. In contrast, using advanced microengineered tools can help in microscale control, long&#8208;term culture, and real&#8208;time data acquisition from such biological models and aid in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Here, a new culturing, manipulation and analysis platform is described to study in vitro morphogenesis using thin polycarbonate film&#8208;based microdevices. A pipeline consisting of open&#8208;source software to quantify 3D cell movement using 4D image acquisition is developed to analyze cell migration within the multicellular clusters. It is shown that the platform can be used to control and study morphogenesis in non&#8208;adherent cultures of the P19C5 mouse stem cell line and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that show symmetry breaking and axial elongation events similar to early embryonic development. Using the new platform, it is found that localized cell proliferation and coordinated cell migration result in elongation morphogenesis of the P19C5 aggregates. Further, it is found that polarization and elongation of mESC aggregates are dependent on directed cell migration.

      <title>A Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalyst of F&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon toward N2 Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A F&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon framework (F&#8208;doped carbon) is developed as a highly efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst toward N2 electroreduction. At &#8722;0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, the F&#8208;doped carbon achieves a yield rate of 197.7 &#181;gNH3 mg&#8722;1cat. h&#8722;1 for NH3, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than those of the reported metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts up to date.








Abstract
N2 electroreduction into NH3 represents an attractive prospect for N2 utilization. Nevertheless, this process suffers from low Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield rate for NH3. In this work, a highly efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst is developed by introducing F atoms into a 3D porous carbon framework (F&#8208;doped carbon) toward N2 electroreduction. At &#8722;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the F&#8208;doped carbon achieves the highest FE of 54.8% for NH3, which is 3.0 times as high as that (18.3%) of pristine carbon frameworks. Notably, at &#8722;0.3 V versus RHE, the yield rate of F&#8208;doped carbon for NH3 reaches 197.7 &#181;gNH3 mg&#8722;1cat. h&#8722;1. Such a value is more than one order of magnitude higher than those of other metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts under the near&#8208;ambient conditions for NH3 product to date. Mechanistic studies reveal that the improved performance in N2 electroreduction for F&#8208;doped carbon originates from the enhanced binding strength of N2 and the facilitated dissociation of N2 into *N2H. F bonding to C atom creates a Lewis acid site due to the different electronegativity between the F and C atoms. As such, the repulsive interaction between the Lewis acid site and proton H suppresses the activity of H2 evolution reaction, thus enhancing the selectivity of N2 electroreduction into NH3.

Notably, at &#8722;0.3 V versus RHE, the yield rate of F&#8208;doped carbon for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reaches 197.7 &#181;g&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Such a value is more than one order of magnitude higher than those of other metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts under the near&#8208;ambient conditions for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; product to date. Mechanistic studies reveal that the improved performance in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction for F&#8208;doped carbon originates from the enhanced binding strength of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the facilitated dissociation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into *N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H. F bonding to C atom creates a Lewis acid site due to the different electronegativity between the F and C atoms. As such, the repulsive interaction between the Lewis acid site and proton H suppresses the activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution reaction, thus enhancing the selectivity of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Aggregates: A New Class of Bioinspired Materials Merging an Interfacial Anchor with Antifouling</title>
      <dc:description>
Few strategies can achieve a robust antifouling coating on a surface in an easy and reliable way. The preparation of an antifouling coating by one&#8208;step aqueous amyloid&#8208;like aggregation of bovine serum albumin (PTB) is reported, showing strong stability and adhesion with the underlying substrate, as well as excellent resistance to the nonspecific adsorption of a broad&#8208;spectrum of biological contaminants.








Abstract
Surfaces that resist nonspecific protein adsorption in a complex biological milieu are required for a variety of applications. However, few strategies can achieve a robust antifouling coating on a surface in an easy and reliable way, regardless of material type, morphology, and shape. Herein, the preparation of an antifouling coating by one&#8208;step aqueous supramolecular assembly of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is reported. Based on fast amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregation through the rapid reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bonds of BSA by tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine, a dense proteinaceous nanofilm with controllable thickness (&#8776;130 nm) can be covered on virtually arbitrary material surfaces in tens of minutes by a simple dipping or spraying. The nanofilm shows strong stability and adhesion with the underlying substrate, exhibiting excellent resistance to the nonspecific adsorption of a broad&#8208;spectrum of contaminants including proteins, serum, cell lysate, cells, and microbes, etc. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that the nanofilm can prevent the adhesion of microorganisms and the formation of biofilm. Compared with native BSA, the proteinaceous nanofilm coating exposes a variety of functional groups on the surface, which have more&#8208;stable adhesion with the surface and can maintain the antifouling in harsh conditions including under ultrasound, surfactants, organic solvents, and enzymatic digestion.

      <title>Defect&#8208;Enhanced Polarization Switching in the Improper Ferroelectric LuFeO3</title>
      <dc:description>
Polarization switching in epitaxial thin films of the improper ferroelectric LuFeO3 shows that the inclusion of point defects can reduce the coercive electric field. Frequency dispersion of the switching field is larger when the thickness is reduced, suggesting that the mechanical constraint induced by the substrates may play a key role in the switching of the polarization state.








Abstract
Results of switching behavior of the improper ferroelectric LuFeO3 are presented. Using a model set of films prepared under controlled chemical and growth&#8208;rate conditions, it is shown that defects can reduce the quasi&#8208;static switching voltage by up to 40% in qualitative agreement with first&#8208;principles calculations. Switching studies show that the coercive field has a stronger frequency dispersion for the improper ferroelectrics compared to a proper ferroelectric such as PbTiO3. It is concluded that the primary structural order parameter controls the switching dynamics of such improper ferroelectrics.

      <title>A Noble&#8208;Transition Alloy Excels at Hot&#8208;Carrier Generation in the Near Infrared</title>
      <dc:description>
A noble&#8208;transition alloy, AuxPd1&#8722;x, is demonstrated to excel at generating above&#8208;equilibrium &#8220;hot&#8220; carriers under near&#8208;infrared excitation. Au50Pd50 provides a 20&#8208;fold increase in the number of &#8776;0.8 eV hot holes, compared to Au, and a threefold increase in the carrier lifetime, compared to Pd.








Abstract
Above&#8208;equilibrium &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8208;carrier generation in metals is a promising route to convert photons into electrical charge for efficient near&#8208;infrared optoelectronics. However, metals that offer both hot&#8208;carrier generation in the near&#8208;infrared and sufficient carrier lifetimes remain elusive. Alloys can offer emergent properties and new design strategies compared to pure metals. Here, it is shown that a noble&#8208;transition alloy, AuxPd1&#8722;x, outperforms its constituent metals concerning generation and lifetime of hot carriers when excited in the near&#8208;infrared. At optical fiber wavelengths (e.g., 1550 nm), Au50Pd50 provides a 20&#8208;fold increase in the number of &#8776;0.8 eV hot holes, compared to Au, and a threefold increase in the carrier lifetime, compared to Pd. The discovery that noble&#8208;transition alloys can excel at hot&#8208;carrier generation reveals a new material platform for near&#8208;infrared optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Living Bioelectrochemical Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Combining Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with the self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K leads to conductive networks that allow transfer of extracellular electron equivalents to an external gold electrode. It is shown that three&#8208;dimensional living biocomposites incorporating electrogenic bacteria and conductive gels efficiently harvest biocurrent, providing a strategy to reduce barriers to charge extraction and injection in bioelectrochemical devices.








Abstract
Composites, in which two or more material elements are combined to provide properties unattainable by single components, have a historical record dating to ancient times. Few include a living microbial community as a key design element. A logical basis for enabling bioelectronic composites stems from the phenomenon that certain microorganisms transfer electrons to external surfaces, such as an electrode. A bioelectronic composite that allows cells to be addressed beyond the confines of an electrode surface can impact bioelectrochemical technologies, including microbial fuel cells for power production and bioelectrosynthesis platforms where microbes produce desired chemicals. It is shown that the conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K functions as a conductive matrix to electronically connect a three&#8208;dimensional network of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 to a gold electrode, thereby increasing biocurrent &#8776;150&#8208;fold over control biofilms. These biocomposites spontaneously assemble from solution into an intricate arrangement of cells within a conductive polymer matrix. While increased biocurrent is due to more cells in communication with the electrode, the current extracted per cell is also enhanced, indicating efficient long&#8208;range electron transport. Further, the biocomposites show almost an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude lower charge transfer resistance than CPE&#8208;K alone, supporting the idea that the electroactive bacteria and the conjugated polyelectrolyte work synergistically toward an effective bioelectronic composite.

      <title>Metabolic Fingerprinting on Synthetic Alloys for Medulloblastoma Diagnosis and Radiotherapy Evaluation</title>
      <dc:description>
Synthetic Pd&#8211;Au alloys are developed for mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based metabolic fingerprinting and analysis, toward medulloblastoma diagnosis and radiotherapy evaluation. Optimized alloys enhance laser desorption/ionization efficacy and achieve direct detection of 100 nL of biofluids in seconds. Medulloblastoma patients are diagnosed by machine learning. Furthermore, radiotherapy is monitored and a preliminary panel of serum metabolite biomarkers is identified with gradual changes.








Abstract
Diagnostics is the key in screening and treatment of cancer. As an emerging tool in precision medicine, metabolic analysis detects end products of pathways, and thus is more distal than proteomic/genetic analysis. However, metabolic analysis is far from ideal in clinical diagnosis due to the sample complexity and metabolite abundance in patient specimens. A further challenge is real&#8208;time and accurate tracking of treatment effect, e.g., radiotherapy. Here, Pd&#8211;Au synthetic alloys are reported for mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based metabolic fingerprinting and analysis, toward medulloblastoma diagnosis and radiotherapy evaluation. A core&#8211;shell structure is designed using magnetic core particles to support Pd&#8211;Au alloys on the surface. Optimized synthetic alloys enhance the laser desorption/ionization efficacy and achieve direct detection of 100 nL of biofluids in seconds. Medulloblastoma patients are differentiated from healthy controls with average diagnostic sensitivity of 94.0%, specificity of 85.7%, and accuracy of 89.9%, by machine learning of metabolic fingerprinting. Furthermore, the radiotherapy process of patients is monitored and a preliminary panel of serum metabolite biomarkers is identified with gradual changes. This work will lead to the application&#8208;driven development of novel materials with tailored structural design and establishment of new protocols for precision medicine in near future.

      <title>A Superlattice&#8208;Stabilized Layered Oxide Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An effective strategy in layered oxides with binary transition metals (TMs), i.e., the ordered arrangement of TMs, is constructed for achieving a relatively stable electrode material, which can relieve the multiple plateaus and cation migration. The designed Na3Ni2RuO6 cathode with ordered superlattice structure delivers an ultralong potential platform, high capacity of 130 mAh g&#8722;1, and excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries are in high demand for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. Although it is the most prevalent cathode, layered oxide is associated with significant undesirable characteristics, such as multiple plateaus in the charge&#8722;discharge profiles, and cation migration during repeated cycling of Na&#8208;ions insertion and extraction, which results in sluggish kinetics, capacity loss, and structural deterioration. Here, a new strategy, i.e., the manipulation of transition&#8208;metal ordering in layered oxides, is proposed to show a prolonged charge&#8722;discharge plateau and cation&#8208;migration&#8208;free structural evolution. The results demonstrate that the transition&#8208;metal ordering with a honeycomb&#8208;type superlattice can adjust the crystal lattice and suppress cation migration by modifying the crystal strain to realize a large reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance, which are not characteristics of the widely used common layered oxides. These findings can provide new insight that can be used to improve the design of high&#8208;performance electrode materials for secondary&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Flexible Photodetectors with High Responsivity and Detectivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible photodetectors based on ultrathin graphdiyne nanosheets are constructed and applied for photoelectrochemical&#8208;type photodetection. The prepared flexible PDs show excellent photo&#8208;response behaviors after bending or twisting for 1000 cycles. In addition, following bending, the PDs exhibit pronounced long&#8208;term stability after being kept in alkaline electrolyte for more than 1 month.








Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY), a newly emerging 2D carbon allotrope, has been widely explored in various fields owing to its outstanding electronic properties such as the intrinsic bandgap and high carrier mobility. Herein, GDY&#8208;based photoelectrochemical&#8208;type photodetection is realized by spin&#8208;coating ultrathin GDY nanosheets onto flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates. The GDY&#8208;based photodetectors (PDs) demonstrate excellent photo&#8208;responsive behaviors with high photocurrent (Pph, 5.98 &#181;A cm&#8208;2), photoresponsivity (Rph, 1086.96 &#181;A W&#8208;1), detectivity (7.31 &#215; 1010 Jones), and excellent long&#8208;term stability (more than 1 month). More importantly, the PDs maintain an excellent Pph after 1000 cycles of bending (4.45 &#181;A cm&#8208;2) and twisting (3.85 &#181;A cm&#8208;2), thanks to the great flexibility of the GDY structure that is compatible with the flexible PET substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are adopted to explore the electronic characteristics of GDY, which provides evidence for the performance enhancement of GDY in alkaline electrolyte. In this way, the GDY&#8208;based flexible PDs can enrich the fundamental study of GDY and pave the way for the exploration of GDY heterojunction&#8208;based photodetection.

      <title>Structure Engineering of a Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for the Regulation of Dynamic Ranges and Sensitivities for Pheochromocytoma Diagnosis</title>
      <dc:description>
A tunable lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework biosensor for precisely quantifying small concentration changes of urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA, pheochromocytoma's early pathological signature) is designed by editing its dynamic ranges and sensitivities. By tailoring the biosensor's structure, its dynamic range is narrowed to &#8220;useful VMA window&#8221; with remarkably enhanced response slope, enabling it as a powerful signal&#8208;amplifier for discriminating positives from negatives.








Abstract
Exploring innovative technologies to precisely quantify biomolecules is crucial but remains a great challenge for disease diagnosis. Unfortunately, the humoral concentrations of most biotargets generally vary within rather limited scopes between normal and pathological states, while most literature&#8208;reported biosensors can detect large spans of targets concentrations, but are less sensitive to small concentration changes, which consequently make them mostly unsatisfactory or even unreliable in distinguishing positives from negatives. Herein, a novel strategy of precisely quantifying the small concentration changes of a certain biotarget by editing the dynamic ranges and sensitivities of a lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Eu&#8208;ZnMOF) biosensor is reported. By elaborately tailoring the biosensor's structure and surface areas, the tunable Eu&#8208;ZnMOF is developed with remarkably enhanced response slope within the &#8220;optimized useful detection window,&#8221; enabling it to serve as a powerful signal amplifier (87.2&#8208;fold increase) for discriminating the small concentration variation of urinary vanillylmandelic acid (an early pathological signature of pheochromocytoma) within only three times between healthy and diseased subjects. This study provides a facile approach to edit the biosensors' performances through structure engineering, and exhibits promising perspectives for future clinical application in the non&#8208;invasive and accurate diagnosis of severe diseases.

      <title>Shadow Epitaxy for In Situ Growth of Generic Semiconductor/Superconductor Hybrids</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel growth platform, &#8220;shadow epitaxy,&#8221; is presented, enabling growth of patterned superconductor/metal layers on semiconductor nanostructures, with generic choice of materials and a wide range of electronic device geometries. Using the platform, new hybrid materials for topological superconductivity research are evaluated, with resultant devices exhibiting high yield and electrostatic stability due to obviation of post&#8208;process damage.








Abstract
Uniform, defect&#8208;free crystal interfaces and surfaces are crucial ingredients for realizing high&#8208;performance nanoscale devices. A pertinent example is that advances in gate&#8208;tunable and topological superconductivity using semiconductor/superconductor electronic devices are currently built on the hard proximity&#8208;induced superconducting gap obtained from epitaxial indium arsenide/aluminum heterostructures. Fabrication of devices requires selective etch processes; these exist only for InAs/Al hybrids, precluding the use of other, potentially superior material combinations. This work introduces a crystal growth platform&#8212;based on 3D structuring of growth substrates&#8212;which enables synthesis of semiconductor nanowire hybrids with in situ patterned superconductor shells. The platform eliminates the need for etching, thereby enabling full freedom in the choice of hybrid constituents. All of the most frequently used superconducting hybrid device architectures are realized and characterized. These devices exhibit increased yield and electrostatic stability compared to etched devices, and evidence of ballistic superconductivity is observed. In addition to aluminum, hybrid structures based on tantalum, niobium, and vanadium are presented.

      <title>Atomic&#8208;Precision Repair of a Few&#8208;Layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2 Thin Film by Phase Transition and Recrystallization Induced by a Heterophase Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
A method to precisely repair macroscopic damage to few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films at the atomic scale is demonstrated, and its mechanism is elucidated. The repaired 2H&#8208;MoTe2 inherits the lattice orientation of the adjacent original 2H&#8208;MoTe2 and seamlessly contacts to it, thereby forming an atomically perfect lattice. In addition the repaired MoTe2 shows the same electrical quality as the original one.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have emerged as promising candidates for post&#8208;silicon nanoelectronics, owing to their unique properties and atomic thickness. However, in the handling of 2D material, various forms of macroscopic damage, such as cracks, wrinkles, and scratches, etc., are usually introduced, which cause adverse effects on the material properties and device performance. Repairing such macroscopic damage is crucial for improving device performance and reliability, especially for large&#8208;scale 2D device arrays. Here, a method is demonstrated repair damage to few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films with atomic precision, and its mechanism is elucidated. The repaired 2H&#8208;MoTe2 inherits the lattice orientation of the adjacent original 2H&#8208;MoTe2, thereby forming an atomically perfect lattice at the repaired interface. The time&#8208;evolution experiments show that the interface between the 2H&#8208; and early formed 1T'&#8208;MoTe2 plays an important role in the subsequent phase transition and recrystallization. Electrical measurements on the original MoTe2, repaired MoTe2, and cross&#8208;interface regions show unobservable differences, indicating that the repaired MoTe2 has the same electrical quality as the original one and the interface does not introduce extra scattering centers for carrier transport. The findings provide an effective strategy for macroscopic damage repair of few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2, which paves the way for its practical application in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.

Here, a method is demonstrated repair damage to few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films with atomic precision, and its mechanism is elucidated. The repaired 2H&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inherits the lattice orientation of the adjacent original 2H&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby forming an atomically perfect lattice at the repaired interface. The time&#8208;evolution experiments show that the interface between the 2H&#8208; and early formed 1T'&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plays an important role in the subsequent phase transition and recrystallization. Electrical measurements on the original MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, repaired MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and cross&#8208;interface regions show unobservable differences, indicating that the repaired MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the same electrical quality as the original one and the interface does not introduce extra scattering centers for carrier transport. The findings provide an effective strategy for macroscopic damage repair of few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which paves the way for its practical application in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reducing the Singlet&#8722;Triplet Energy Gap by End&#8208;Group &#960;&#8722;&#960; Stacking Toward High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
End&#8208;group &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking is proved to be able to effectively reduce the singlet&#8722;triplet energy difference in narrow&#8208;bandgap A&#8722;D&#8722;A acceptors, which is beneficial to simultaneously decrease the voltage loss in exciton dissociation and suppress triplet recombination. Furthermore, the absorption spectra can be broadened or redshifted, thus improving the light&#8208;harvesting efficiencies. These results pave the way toward high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
To improve the power conversion efficiencies for organic solar cells, it is necessary to enhance light absorption and reduce energy loss simultaneously. Both the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states need to energertically approach the charge&#8208;transfer state to reduce the energy loss in exciton dissociation and by triplet recombination. Meanwhile, the S1 energy needs to be decreased to broaden light absorption. Therefore, it is imperative to reduce the singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), particularly for the narrow&#8208;bandgap materials that determine the device T1 energy. Although maximizing intramolecular push&#8722;pull effect can drastically decrease &#916;EST, it inevitably results in weak oscillator strength and light absorption. Herein, large oscillator strength (&#8776;3) and a moderate &#916;EST (0.4&#8722;0.5 eV) are found for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art A&#8722;D&#8722;A small&#8208;molecule acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, and Y6) owing to modest push&#8722;pull effect. Importantly, end&#8208;group &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking commonly in the films can substantially decrease the S1 energy by nearly 0.1 eV, but the T1 energy is hardly changed. The obtained reduction of &#916;EST is crucial to effectively suppress triplet recombination and acquire small exciton dissociation driving force. Thus, end&#8208;group &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking is an effective way to achieve both small energy loss and efficient light absorption for high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.

3D porous LiFeO2&#8722;x rich with Fe(II) is prepared by reacting Fe2O3 with LiH at 550 &#176;C. With a unique staghorn&#8208;coral&#8208;like skeleton measuring &#8776;100 nm in diameter, the Fe(II)&#8208;rich LiFeO2&#8722;x delivers the presently known highest initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) value of 90.2% with 1170 mAh g&#8722;1 of discharge capacity favored by a fast conversion reaction of LiFeO2&#8722;x upon lithiation/delithiation.








Abstract
Transition metal oxides represent a promising class of anode materials for high&#8208;capacity lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE, &lt;80%) still remains a crucial challenge for practical applications. Herein, a unique 3D Fe(II)&#8208;rich porous LiFeO2&#8722;x comprising of staghorn&#8208;coral&#8208;like skeleton measuring &#8776;100 nm in diameter is demonstrated, which is readily prepared by reacting Fe2O3 with LiH at 550 &#176;C. When used as an anode material, the Fe(II)&#8208;rich LiFeO2&#8722;x delivers the presently known highest ICE value of 90.2% with 1170 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity. The high ICE value can be ascribed to a fast conversion reaction of LiFeO2&#8722;x upon lithiation/delithiation facilitated by the presence of Fe(II), which generates oxygen vacancies and makes electron transportation much easier, based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

      <title>Stacking&#8208;Order&#8208;Driven Optical Properties and Carrier Dynamics in ReS2</title>
      <dc:description>
Two stacking orders of ReS2 are identified. Stacking AA has negligible displacement across layers and stacking AB has a one&#8208;unit cell displacement along the a&#8208;axis. AB stacking has stronger interlayer coupling than AA. The cross&#8208;layer displacement in AB stacking disrupts excited&#8208;state excitons. Vibrational, optical properties and carrier dynamics in two stacking orders are drastically different.








Abstract
Two distinct stacking orders in ReS2 are identified without ambiguity and their influence on vibrational, optical properties and carrier dynamics are investigated. With atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), two stacking orders are determined as AA stacking with negligible displacement across layers, and AB stacking with about a one&#8208;unit cell displacement along the a axis. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm that these two stacking orders correspond to two local energy minima. Raman spectra inform a consistent difference of modes I &amp; III, about 13 cm&#8722;1 for AA stacking, and 20 cm&#8722;1 for AB stacking, making a simple tool for determining the stacking orders in ReS2. Polarized photoluminescence (PL) reveals that AB stacking possesses blueshifted PL peak positions, and broader peak widths, compared with AA stacking, indicating stronger interlayer interaction. Transient transmission measured with femtosecond pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy suggests exciton dynamics being more anisotropic in AB stacking, where excited state absorption related to Exc. III mode disappears when probe polarization aligns perpendicular to b axis. The findings underscore the stacking&#8208;order driven optical properties and carrier dynamics of ReS2, mediate many seemingly contradictory results in the literature, and open up an opportunity to engineer electronic devices with new functionalities by manipulating the stacking order.

Abstract
Boosting charge transfer in materials is critical for applications involving charge carriers. Engineering ionic channels in electrode materials can create a skeleton to manipulate their ion and electron behaviors with favorable parameters to promote their capacity and stability. Here, tailoring of the atomic structure in layered potassium niobate (K4Nb6O17) nanosheets and facilitating their application in lithium and potassium storage by dehydration&#8208;triggered lattice rearrangement is reported. The spectroscopy results reveal that the interatomic distances of the Nb&#63743;O coordination in the engineered K4Nb6O17 are slightly elongated with increased degrees of disorder. Specifically, the engineered K4Nb6O17 shows enhanced electrical and ionic conductivity, which can be attributed to the enlarged interlamellar spacing and subtle distortions in the fine atomic arrangements. Moreover, subsequent experimental results and calculations demonstrate that the energy barrier for Li+/K+ diffusion is significantly lower than that in pristine K4Nb6O17. Interestingly, the diffusion coefficient of K+ is one order of magnitude higher than that of Li+ , and the engineered K4Nb6O17 presents superior electrochemical performance for K+ to Li+ . This work offers an ionic engineering strategy to enable fast and durable charge transfer in materials, holding great promise for providing guidance for the material design of related energy storage systems.

Abstract

Herein, a new bimetallic and biphasic Rh&#8208;based core&#8211;shell nanosystem (Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM) is developed to address tumor hypoxia while achieving high PDT efficacy. Such porous Au@Rh core&#8211;shell nanostructures are expected to exhibit catalase&#8208;like activity to efficiently catalyze oxygen generation from endogenous hydrogen peroxide in tumors. Coating Au@Rh nanostructures with tumor cell membrane (CM) enables tumor targeting via homologous binding. As a result of the large pores of Rh shells and the trapping ability of CM, the photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) is successfully loaded and retained in the cavity of Au@Rh&#8208;CM. Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM shows good biocompatibility, high tumor accumulation, and superior fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging properties. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM is able to effectively convert endogenous hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and then elevate the production of tumor&#8208;toxic singlet oxygen to significantly enhance PDT. As noted, the mild photothermal effect of Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM also improves PDT efficacy. By integrating the superiorities of hypoxia regulation function, tumor accumulation capacity, bimodal imaging, and moderate photothermal effect into a single nanosystem, Au@Rh&#8208;ICG&#8208;CM can readily serve as a promising nanoplatform for enhanced cancer PDT.

      <title>Toward 2D Magnets in the (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3)n Bulk Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
A new magnetic state is proposed in (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3)n, in which ferro&#8208;magnetic layers are separated by a large number of non&#8208;magnetic layers. The decoupling of the magnetic layers starts to emerge from n = 2, 3, forming a column of weakly&#8208;interacting 2D magnets. The integration of the prototypical magnetic state and topological surface states may lead to exotic physical properties.








Abstract
2D magnets and their engineered magnetic heterostructures are intriguing materials for both fundamental physics and application prospects. On the basis of the recently discovered intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (MnBi2Te4)(Bi2Te3)n, here, a new type of magnet, in which the magnetic layers are separated by a large number of non&#8208;magnetic layers and become magnetically independent, is proposed. This magnet is named as a single&#8208;layer magnet, regarding the vanishing interlayer exchange coupling. Theoretical calculations and magnetization measurements indicate that, the decoupling of the magnetic layers starts to emerge from n = 2 and 3, as revealed by a unique slow&#8208;relaxation behavior below a ferromagnetic&#8208;type transition at Tc = 12&#8211;14 K. Magnetization data analysis shows that the proposed new magnetic states have a strong uniaxial anisotropy along the c&#8208;axis, forming an Ising&#8208;type magnetic structure, where Tc is the ordering temperature for each magnetic layer. The characteristic slow relaxation, which exists only along the c&#8208;axis but is absent along the ab plane, can be ascribed to interlayer coherent spin rotation and/or intralayer domain wall movement. The present results will stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations for the prototypical magnetic structures, and their combination with the topological surface states may lead to exotic physical properties.

      <title>High&#8208;Rate Printing of Micro/Nanoscale Patterns Using Interfacial Convective Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
A directed&#8208;assembly&#8208;based printing technique, interfacial convective assembly, is developed to print micro/nanoscale patterns at desired areas of substrates. Various nanoparticles are printed in patterns of different shapes with a high resolution down to 25 nm. Assembly only takes a few minutes, which is two orders of magnitude faster than the conventional convective assembly.








Abstract
Printing of electronics has been receiving increasing attention from academia and industry over the recent years. However, commonly used printing techniques have limited resolution of micro&#8208; or sub&#8208;microscale. Here, a directed&#8208;assembly&#8208;based printing technique, interfacial convective assembly, is reported, which utilizes a substrate&#8208;heating&#8208;induced solutal Marangoni convective flow to drive particles toward patterned substrates and then uses van der Waals interactions as well as geometrical confinement to trap the particles in the pattern areas. The influence of various assembly parameters including type of mixing solvent, substrate temperature, particle concentration, and assembly time is investigated. The results show successful assembly of various nanoparticles in patterns of different shapes with a high resolution down to 25 nm. In addition, the assembly only takes a few minutes, which is two orders of magnitude faster than conventional convective assembly. Small&#8208;sized (diameter below 5 nm) nanoparticles tend to coalesce during the assembly process and form sintered structures. The fabricated silver nanorods show single&#8208;crystal structure with a low resistivity of 8.58 &#215; 10&#8722;5 &#937; cm. With high versatility, high resolution, and high throughput, the interfacial convective assembly opens remarkable opportunities for printing next generation nanoelectronics and sensors.

      <title>Two Are Better Than One: A Design Principle for Ultralong&#8208;Persistent Luminescence of Pure Organics</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel approach to achieve a pure organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent material using a phosphonium salt doped with dimethylaniline is reported. The doped crystals can exhibit a green afterglow emission lasting up to 7 h after the cessation of UV excitation. The positive phosphonium salt holds and protects the separated charge to produce unprecedented afterglow duration.








Abstract
Because of their innate ability to store and then release energy, long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) materials have garnered strong research interest in a wide range of multidisciplinary fields, such as biomedical sciences, theranostics, and photonic devices. Although many inorganic LPL systems with afterglow durations of up to hours and days have been reported, organic systems have had difficulties reaching similar timescales. In this work, a design principle based on the successes of inorganic systems to produce an organic LPL (OLPL) system through the use of a strong organic electron trap is proposed. The resulting system generates detectable afterglow for up to 7 h, significantly longer than any other reported OLPL system. The design strategy demonstrates an easy methodology to develop organic long&#8208;persistent phosphors, opening the door to new OLPL materials.

      <title>Heterostructures of 2D Molybdenum Dichalcogenide on 2D Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon: Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage and Insight into Potassium Storage Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterostructures of 2D molybdenum dichalcogenide on 2D nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoS2&#8208;on&#8208;NC and MoSe2&#8208;on&#8208;NC) are designed for potassium&#8208;ion batteries with superior electrochemical performance and outstanding cycle life. The insertion&#8211;conversion mechanism of MoSe2 is revealed during the process of potassiation and depotassiation by in situ Raman spectra and ex situ high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).








Abstract
Constructing 2D heterostructure materials by stacking different 2D materials can combine the merits of the individual building blocks while eliminating their shortcomings. Dichalcogenides are attractive anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity. However, the practical application of dichalcogenide is greatly hampered by the poor electrochemical performance due to sluggish kinetics of K+ insertion and the electrode structure collapse resulting from the large K+ insertion. Herein, heterostructures of 2D molybdenum dichalcogenide on 2D nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoS2, MoSe2&#8208;on&#8208;NC) are prepared to boost their potassium storage performance. The unique 2D heterostructures possess built&#8208;in heterointerfaces, facilitating K+ diffusion. The robust chemical bonds (C&#63743;S, C&#63743;Se, C&#63743;Mo bonds) enhance the mechanical strength of electrodes, thus suppressing the volume expansion. The 2D N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets interconnected as a 3D structure offer a fast diffusion path for electrons. Benefitting from these merits, both the MoS2&#8208;on&#8208;NC and the MoSe2&#8208;on&#8208;NC exhibit unprecedented cycle life. Moreover, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MoSe2 is revealed during the process of potassiation and depotassiation.

      <title>Porous Organic Frameworks Featured by Distinct Confining Fields for the Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Ketones</title>
      <dc:description>
Converting biomass&#8208;derived substances into value&#8208;added chemicals such as single&#8208;antipode compounds is an effective strategy to reduce the rapid consumption of fossil resources. Porous organic frameworks with conjugated inner surfaces provide strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction for steric hindrance of substrate molecules around the metal active site to achieve stronger asymmetric induction.








Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived molecules for the preparation of single enantiomer compounds is an effective method to reduce the rapid consumption of fossil resources. Porous organic frameworks (POFs) with pure organic surfaces may provide unusual confinement effects for organic substrates in chiral catalysis. Here, a series of POF catalysts are designed with chiral active centers decorated into sharply defined one&#8208;dimensional channels with diameters in the range of 1.2&#8211;2.9 nm. Due to the synergistic effect originating from the conjugated inner wall, the POF material (aperture size 2.4 nm) concentrates over 90% of aromatic species into the porous architecture, and its affinity is one or two orders of magnitude higher than those of classical porous solids. As determined by PBE+D3 calculation, the phenyl fragment reveals strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction for steric hindrance around the metal active site to achieve stronger asymmetric induction. Therefore, this POF catalyst achieves high conversion (&gt;99% yield) and enantioselectivity (&gt;99% ee) for various substrates. The advantages of using the POF platform as a chiral catalyst can provide new perspectives on POF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state host&#8211;guest chemistry and asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.

      <title>Exploring Bi2Te3 Nanoplates as Versatile Catalysts for Electrochemical Reduction of Small Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Activated Bi2Te3 nanoplates are demonstrated as highly universal and robust electrocatalysts for reduction of small molecules, where they exhibit nearly 100% H2O2 selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction, 89.6% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH for the CO2 reduction reaction, and 7.9% FE of NH3 for the nitrogen reduction reaction, showing a new class of electrocatalysts for conversion of small molecules with potential practical applications.








Abstract
The electroreduction of small molecules to high value&#8208;added chemicals is considered as a promising way toward the capture and utilization of atmospheric small molecules. Discovering cheap and efficient electrocatalysts with simultaneously high activity, selectivity, durability, and even universality is desirable yet challenging. Herein, it is demonstrated that Bi2Te3 nanoplates (NPs), cheap and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts, can be adopted as highly universal and robust electrocatalysts, which can efficiently reduce small molecules (O2, CO2, and N2) into targeted products simultaneously. They can achieve excellent activity, selectivity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction with almost 100% H2O2 selectivity, the CO2 reduction reaction with up to 90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH, and the nitrogen reduction reaction with 7.9% FE of NH3. After electrochemical activation, an obvious Te dissolution happens on the Bi2Te3 NPs, creating lots of Te vacancies in the activated Bi2Te3 NPs. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Te vacancies can modulate the electronic structures of Bi and Te. Such a highly electroactive surface with a strong preference in supplying electrons for the universal reduction reactions improves the electrocatalytic performance of Bi2Te3. The work demonstrates a new class of cheap and versatile catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of small molecules with potential practical applications.

      <title>Mechanical Tolerance of Cascade Bioreactions via Adaptive Curvature Engineering for Epidermal Bioelectronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Mechanical tolerance of bioreactions is crucial for obtaining high biosensing fidelity. By combining simulations and experiments, it is found that strain&#8208;induced change in reactant flux accounts for the performance drop in flat bioelectrodes. Wavy bioelectrodes capable of curvature adaptation maintain the reactant flux and preserve biosensing performance under static strain and dynamic stretching, which are demonstrated in gesture&#8208;insensitive epidermal metabolite biosensors.








Abstract
Epidermal bioelectronics that can monitor human health status non&#8208;invasively and in real time are core to wearable healthcare equipment. Achieving mechanically tolerant surface bioreactions that convert biochemical information to detectable signals is crucial for obtaining high sensing fidelity. In this work, by combining simulations and experiments, a typical epidermal biosensor system is investigated based on a redox enzyme cascade reaction (RECR) comprising glucose oxidase/lactate oxidase enzymes and Prussian blue nanoparticles. Simulations reveal that strain&#8208;induced change in surface reactant flux is the key to the performance drop in traditional flat bioelectrodes. In contrast, wavy bioelectrodes capable of curvature adaptation maintain the reactant flux under strain, which preserves sensing fidelity. This rationale is experimentally proven by bioelectrodes with flat/wavy geometry under both static strain and dynamic stretching. When exposed to 50% strain, the signal fluctuations for wavy bioelectrodes are only 7.0% (4.9%) in detecting glucose (lactate), which are significantly lower than the 40.3% (51.8%) in flat bioelectrodes. Based on this wavy bioelectrode, a stable human epidermal metabolite biosensor insensitive to human gestures is further demonstrated. This mechanically tolerant biosensor based on adaptive curvature engineering provides a reliable bio/chemical&#8208;information monitoring platform for soft healthcare bioelectronics.

      <title>Electro&#8208;Photoluminescence Color Change for Deformable Visual Encryption</title>
      <dc:description>
An electro&#8208;photoluminescence (EPL) color&#8208;change system is presented. The chromaticity of EPL can be controlled systematically in a wide range of color variation while maintaining high luminance. The EPL color&#8208;changing device can be used in a deformable visual encryption and as a soft skin for a soft robotic rover.








Abstract
Although structural coloring and photoluminescence (PL) have been investigated for radiation&#8208;responsive color change, electroluminescence (EL) has not been used for the radiation&#8208;responsive system. An electro&#8208;photoluminescence (EPL) color change is presented here. The phosphors in the alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) act simultaneously as electro&#8208;luminophores and photo&#8208;luminophores. The EPL chromaticity is systematically investigated depending on the ACEL frequency and UV intensity. It is found that the PL variation depending on UV intensity is the mechanism of the EPL color change. It is revealed that EL and PL can be controlled independently in the low electric field so that the EPL chromaticity can be adjusted by a linear combination of the EL color and the PL color. The EPL color&#8208;changing device is used as a deformable visual encryption system and a soft skin for a soft robotic rover, imitating the concealment and signaling functions in nature.

      <title>Fabrication and Applications of 3D Nanoarchitectures for Advanced Electrocatalysts and Sensors</title>
      <dc:description>
Increased interest in human sustainability inspires technological progress in clean energy conversion and chemical/biological detection technologies. Various long&#8208;range ordered 3D nanoarchitectures are discussed with a particular emphasis on the key roles of 3D nanostructure design parameters in the performance and reliability of energy conversion systems and chemical/biomarker detection devices.








Abstract
For the last few decades, nanoscale materials and structures have been extensively studied and developed, making a huge impact on human sustainability. For example, the introduction of nanostructures has brought substantial development in electrocatalysts and optical sensing applications. However, there are still remaining challenges that need to be resolved to further improve their performance, reliability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, long&#8208;range ordered 3D nanostructures and their design principles are introduced with an emphasis on electrocatalysts for energy conversion and plasmonic nanostructures for optical sensing. Among the various fabrication techniques, sequential solvent&#8208;injection&#8208;assisted nanotransfer printing is suggested as a practical fabrication platform for tunable long&#8208;range ordered 3D nanostructures composed of ultrahigh&#8208;resolution building blocks. Furthermore, the importance of understanding and controlling the 3D design parameters is discussed to realize more efficient energy conversion as well as effective surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy analyses, suggesting new solutions for clean energy and healthcare issues.

      <title>Flexible and Self&#8208;Powered Photodetector Arrays Based on All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>
CsBr/KBr&#8208;additive&#8208;assisted all&#8208;inorganic perovskite quantum dots demonstrate reduced nonradiative recombination paths and improved carrier transport. The as&#8208;fabricated self&#8208;powered flexible photodetector arrays exhibit superior photoresponse and electrical stability under different bending conditions (60&#176; and 1600 cycles) with marginal degradation. Moreover, uniform photoresponse is achieved in photodetector arrays, promising for photosensing and imaging systems.








Abstract
Flexible devices are garnering substantial interest owing to their potential for wearable and portable applications. Here, flexible and self&#8208;powered photodetector arrays based on all&#8208;inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are reported. CsBr/KBr&#8208;mediated CsPbBr3 QDs possess improved surface morphology and crystallinity with reduced defect densities, in comparison with the pristine ones. Systematic material characterizations reveal enhanced carrier transport, photoluminescence efficiency, and carrier lifetime of the CsBr/KBr&#8208;mediated CsPbBr3 QDs. Flexible photodetector arrays fabricated with an optimum CsBr/KBr treatment demonstrate a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.3 V, responsivity of 10.1 A W&#8722;1, specific detectivity of 9.35 &#215; 1013 Jones, and on/off ratio up to &#8776;104. Particularly, such performance is achieved under the self&#8208;powered operation mode. Furthermore, outstanding flexibility and electrical stability with negligible degradation after 1600 bending cycles (up to 60&#176;) are demonstrated. More importantly, the flexible detector arrays exhibit uniform photoresponse distribution, which is of much significance for practical imaging systems, and thus promotes the practical deployment of perovskite products.

      <title>Finely Tuned Submicroporous Thin&#8208;Film Molecular Sieve Membranes for Highly Efficient Fluid Separations</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel pressure&#8208;driven thin&#8208;film composite membranes containing entrapped structural submicroporosity (pore size &lt; 4 &#197;) exhibit superb performance for removal of small solutes from aqueous or organic solutions.

Abstract
Polymeric membranes with increasingly high permselective performances are gaining a significant role in lowering the energy burden and improving the environmental sustainability of complex chemical separations. However, the commercial deployment of newly designed materials with promising intrinsic properties for fluid separations has been stalled by challenges associated with fabrication and scale up of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, defect&#8208;free thin&#8208;film composite (TFC) membranes. Here, a facile method to fabricate next&#8208;generation	 TFC membranes using a bridged&#8208;bicyclic triptycene tetra&#8208;acyl chloride (Trip) building block with a large fraction of finely tuned structural submicroporosity (pore size &lt; 4 &#197;) is demonstrated. The TFCs exhibit superb potential for removal of small (&#8776;200 g mol&#8722;1) organic microcontaminants from organic solvent streams by showing both improved rejection and permeance in organic systems compared to current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial membranes. The TFCs also display unprecedented properties for desalination applications with performance located far above the current water permeance/sodium chloride rejection trendline. The strategy of using highly contorted triptycene building blocks with well&#8208;defined interconnected internal free volume elements establishes a scalable, generalized approach to fabricate highly selective, submicroporous TFC membranes for a wide variety of challenging energy&#8208;intensive fluid separations.

      <title>Kirigami&#8208;Design&#8208;Enabled Hydrogel Multimorphs with Application as a Multistate Switch</title>
      <dc:description>
Multistable morphing configurations are obtained in one composite hydrogel with kirigami design by controlling the buckling direction of high&#8208;swelling gel strips constrained by a stiff frame. In the kirigami structure, the introduction of cutouts destroy the geometric continuity, increasing the deformation freedom of the discrete strips. A multistate switch is designed by harnessing the hydrogel multimorphs to control a set of light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Morphing materials have promising applications in soft robots, intelligent devices, and so forth. Among the various design strategies, kirigami structures are recognized as a powerful tool to obtain sophisticated 3D configurations and unprecedented properties from planar designs on common materials. Here, some kirigami designs are demonstrated for programmable, multistable 3D configurations from composite hydrogel sheets. Via photolithographic polymerization, perforated composite hydrogel sheets are fabricated, in which soft and active hydrogel strips are patterned in stiff and passive hydrogel frames. When immersed in water, the gel strips buckle out of plane due to swelling mismatch. In the kirigami structures, the geometric continuity is disrupted by the introduction of cutouts, and thus the degrees of deformation freedom increases remarkably. Multiple configurations are obtained in a single composite hydrogel by controlling the buckling direction of each strip. Multitier configurations are also obtained by using a hierarchically designed kirigami structure. A multicontact switch of an electric circuit is designed by harnessing the multitier gel configurations. Furthermore, a rotation mode is realized by introducing chirality in the kirigami design. The versatile design of the kirigami structure for programmable deformations should be applicable for other intelligent materials toward promising applications in biomedical devices and flexible electronics.

      <title>Chiral Surface Lattice Resonances</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface lattice resonances result from coupling of localized surface plasmon resonances to grazing diffraction orders. By arranging chiral nanocrescents into periodic arrays with controlled interparticle distances, chiral lattice resonances become accessible. These resonances show a selective response to the handedness of incident, circularly polarized light. Such arrays are fabricated over large areas (&gt;cm2) by self&#8208;assembly of core&#8211;shell masking particles and modified colloidal lithography.








Abstract
Collective excitation of periodic arrays of metallic nanoparticles by coupling localized surface plasmon resonances to grazing diffraction orders leads to surface lattice resonances with narrow line width. These resonances may find numerous applications in optical sensing and information processing. Here, a new degree of freedom of surface lattice resonances is experimentally investigated by demonstrating handedness&#8208;dependent excitation of surface lattice resonances in arrays of chiral plasmonic crescents. The self&#8208;assembly of particles used as mask and modified colloidal lithography is applied to produce arrays of planar and 3D gold crescents over large areas. The excitation of surface lattice resonances as a function of the interparticle distance and the degree of order within the arrays is investigated. The chirality of the individual 3D crescents leads to the formation of chiral lattice modes, that is, surface lattice resonances that exhibit optical activity.

      <title>Harnessing the Formation of Natural Killer&#8211;Tumor Cell Immunological Synapses for Enhanced Therapeutic Effect in Solid Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>
The reinforced natural killer (ReNK) cell system is designed to release drugs upon the formation of an NK&#8211;tumor cell immunological synapse. Degranulation and acidification at the synapse cleft trigger the disassembly of pH&#8208;sensitive polymeric micelles on the surface of the NK cells. Doxorubicin released from ReNK diffuses into the tumor tissue, overcoming the insufficient therapeutic effect due to restricted infiltration of NK cells.








Abstract
The formation of an immunological synapse (IS) on recognition of a cancer cell is the main mechanism underlying the natural killer (NK)&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated killing of tumor cells. Herein, an integrative strategy for cancer therapy against solid tumors is reported, in which alterations in the cleft of IS, following the secretion of acidic granular content, are utilized as a trigger for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. NK cells are decorated with the IS&#8208;environment&#8208;responsive micellar system to ensure the release of the payload when they attack cancer cells. Using this strategy, the immunological cytotoxic killing effect of NK cells against solid tumors is reinforced with the site&#8208;specific diffusion of chemotherapeutic agents. Harnessing the intrinsic mechanism for the recognition of abnormal cells and the tumor&#8208;homing effect of NK cells limit the adverse systemic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach may provide a pragmatic platform for the universal and effective utilization of IS formation.

     alt="Harnessing the Formation of Natural Killer&#8211;Tumor Cell Immunological Synapses for Enhanced Therapeutic Effect in Solid Tumors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reinforced natural killer (ReNK) cell system is designed to release drugs upon the formation of an NK&#8211;tumor cell immunological synapse. Degranulation and acidification at the synapse cleft trigger the disassembly of pH&#8208;sensitive polymeric micelles on the surface of the NK cells. Doxorubicin released from ReNK diffuses into the tumor tissue, overcoming the insufficient therapeutic effect due to restricted infiltration of NK cells.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of an immunological synapse (IS) on recognition of a cancer cell is the main mechanism underlying the natural killer (NK)&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated killing of tumor cells. Herein, an integrative strategy for cancer therapy against solid tumors is reported, in which alterations in the cleft of IS, following the secretion of acidic granular content, are utilized as a trigger for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. NK cells are decorated with the IS&#8208;environment&#8208;responsive micellar system to ensure the release of the payload when they attack cancer cells. Using this strategy, the immunological cytotoxic killing effect of NK cells against solid tumors is reinforced with the site&#8208;specific diffusion of chemotherapeutic agents. Harnessing the intrinsic mechanism for the recognition of abnormal cells and the tumor&#8208;homing effect of NK cells limit the adverse systemic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach may provide a pragmatic platform for the universal and effective utilization of IS formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memristive Behavior Enabled by Amorphous&#8211;Crystalline 2D Oxide Heterostructure</title>
      <dc:description>
The quasi&#8208;2D heterostructure of atomically thin ZnO monocrystalline nanosheet/amorphous Al2O3 enables exotic memristive behavior, which is attributed to the generation of concentrated oxygen vacancies with a high mobility in the low&#8208;resistance state. This discovery reveals a new route for tuning the electronic transport property by 2D heterostructuring.








Abstract
The emergence of memristive behavior in amorphous&#8211;crystalline 2D oxide heterostructures, which are synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a few&#8208;nanometer amorphous Al2O3 layers onto atomically thin single&#8208;crystalline ZnO nanosheets, is demonstrated. The conduction mechanism is identified based on classic oxygen vacancy conductive channels. ZnO nanosheets provide a 2D host for oxygen vacancies, while the amorphous Al2O3 facilitates the generation and stabilization of the oxygen vacancies. The conduction mechanism in the high&#8208;resistance state follows Poole&#8211;Frenkel emission, and in the the low&#8208;resistance state is fitted by the Mott&#8211;Gurney law. From the slope of the fitting curve, the mobility in the low&#8208;resistance state is estimated to be &#8776;2400 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest value reported in semiconductor oxides. When annealed at high temperature to eliminate oxygen vacancies, Al is doped into the ZnO nanosheet, and the memristive behavior disappears, further confirming the oxygen vacancies as being responsible for the memristive behavior. The 2D heterointerface offers opportunities for new design of high&#8208;performance memristor devices.

      <title>Local Photothermal Control of Phase Transitions for On&#8208;Demand Room&#8208;Temperature Rewritable Magnetic Patterning</title>
      <dc:description>
By controlling the stoichiometry in epitaxial FeRh/MgO, the transition temperature from antiferromagnet to ferromagnet is tuned such that both phases are stable at room temperature. Focused pulsed laser heating is used to write and image arbitrarily shaped ferromagnetic patterns at ultrafast speeds, which can be erased by cooling the film below room temperature.








Abstract
The ability to make controlled patterns of magnetic structures within a nonmagnetic background is essential for several types of existing and proposed technologies. Such patterns provide the foundation of magnetic memory and logic devices, allow the creation of artificial spin&#8208;ice lattices, and enable the study of magnon propagation. Here, a novel approach for magnetic patterning that allows repeated creation and erasure of arbitrary shapes of thin&#8208;film ferromagnetic structures is reported. This strategy is enabled by epitaxial Fe0.52Rh0.48 thin films designed so that both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases are bistable at room temperature. Starting with the film in a uniform antiferromagnetic state, the ability to write arbitrary patterns of the ferromagnetic phase is demonstrated by local heating with a focused laser. If desired, the results can then be erased by cooling below room temperature and the material repeatedly re&#8208;patterned.

      <title>A Ternary Hybrid&#8208;Cation Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Metal Battery and Interfacial Selection Mechanism Study</title>
      <dc:description>
A ternary hybrid&#8208;cation room&#8208;temperature liquid metal battery is developed to explore lithium ions as the cathodic charge carrier and potassium ions as the anodic charge carrier. Stable cycling and high voltage are achieved, and the interfacial chemistry that controls cation selective transportation is also modeled and characterized.








Abstract
The dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8211;potassium (Na&#8211;K) liquid alloy composed of two alkali metals is one of the ideal alternatives for Li metal as an anode material while maintaining large capacity, low potential, and high abundance. However, Na&#8208; or K&#8208;ion batteries have limited cathode materials that can deliver stably large capacity. Combining advantages of both, a hybrid&#8208;cation liquid metal battery is designed for a Li&#8208;ion&#8208;insertion&#8208;based cathode to deliver stable high capacity using a Na&#8211;K liquid anode to avoid dendrites. The mechanical property of the Na&#8211;K alloy is confirmed by simulation and experimental characterization, which leads to stable cycling performance. The charge carrier selection principle in this ternary hybrid&#8208;cation system is investigated, showing consistency with the proposed interfacial layer formation and ion distribution mechanism for the electrochemical process as well as the good stability. With Li ions contributing stable cycling as the cathode charge carrier, the K ion working as charge carrier on the anode, and Na as the medium to liquefy K metal, such a ternary hybrid battery system not only inherits the rich battery chemistry of Li&#8208;insertion cathodes but also broadens the understanding of alkali metal alloys and hybrid&#8208;ion battery chemistry.

      <dc:description>

A complete survey of most relevant literature, covering a wide range of fundamental and applicative features related to this topic: from material properties to fabrication issues is provided.








Abstract
Commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), limited by their insufficient reversible capacity, short cyclability, and high cost, are facing ever&#8208;growing requirements for further increases in power capability, energy density, lifespan, and flexibility. The presence of insulating and electrochemically inactive binders in commercial LIB electrodes causes uneven active material distribution and poor contact of these materials with substrates, reducing battery performance. Thus, nanostructured electrodes with binder&#8208;free designs are developed and have numerous advantages including large surface area, robust adhesion to substrates, high areal/specific capacity, fast electron/ion transfer, and free space for alleviating volume expansion, leading to superior battery performance. Herein, recent progress on different kinds of supporting matrixes including metals, carbonaceous materials, and polymers as well as other substrates for binder&#8208;free nanostructured electrodes in LIBs are summarized systematically. Furthermore, the potential applications of these binder&#8208;free nanostructured electrodes in practical full&#8208;cell&#8208;configuration LIBs, in particular fully flexible/stretchable LIBs, are outlined in detail. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges for such full&#8208;cell LIBs based on binder&#8208;free nanostructured electrodes are discussed.

      <dc:description>
The recent research in the field of cellulose&#8208;based materials for flexible electronic applications is reviewed, including flexible sensors, biomimetic electronic skin, portable electrochemical energy storage devices, flexible nanogenerators, flexible organic thin&#8208;film transistors, printed radio&#8208;frequency identification devices, thin&#8208;film photovoltaic devices, and miniaturized bioelectronic devices.

Abstract
There is currently enormous and growing demand for flexible electronics for personalized mobile equipment, human&#8211;machine interface units, wearable medical&#8208;healthcare systems, and bionic intelligent robots. Cellulose is a well&#8208;known natural biopolymer that has multiple advantages including low cost, renewability, easy processability, and biodegradability, as well as appealing mechanical performance, dielectricity, piezoelectricity, and convertibility. Because of its multiple merits, cellulose is frequently used as a substrate, binder, dielectric layer, gel electrolyte, and derived carbon material for flexible electronic devices. Leveraging the advantages of cellulose to design advanced functional materials will have a significant impact on portable intelligent electronics. Herein, the unique molecular structure and nanostructures (nanocrystals, nanofibers, nanosheets, etc.) of cellulose are briefly introduced, the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships of cellulosic materials summarized, and the processing technologies for fabricating cellulose&#8208;based flexible electronics considered. The focus then turns to the recent advances of cellulose&#8208;based functional materials toward emerging intelligent electronic devices including flexible sensors, optoelectronic devices, field&#8208;effect transistors, nanogenerators, electrochemical energy storage devices, biomimetic electronic skins, and biological detection devices. Finally, an outlook of the potential challenges and future prospects for developing cellulose&#8208;based wearable devices and bioelectronic systems is presented.

      <title>A Behavior&#8208;Learned Cross&#8208;Reactive Sensor Matrix for Intelligent Skin Perception</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly stretchable cross&#8208;reactive sensor matrix for electronic&#8208;skin applications is demonstrated, which can detect, classify, and discriminate various intermixed tactile and thermal stimuli based on machine learning. By adopting a learning algorithm based on the bag&#8208;of&#8208;words model, highly accurate classification of intermixed stimuli is achieved.








Abstract
Mimicking human skin sensation such as spontaneous multimodal perception and identification/discrimination of intermixed stimuli is severely hindered by the difficulty of efficient integration of complex cutaneous receptor&#8208;emulating circuitry and the lack of an appropriate protocol to discern the intermixed signals. Here, a highly stretchable cross&#8208;reactive sensor matrix is demonstrated, which can detect, classify, and discriminate various intermixed tactile and thermal stimuli using a machine&#8208;learning approach. Particularly, the multimodal perception ability is achieved by utilizing a learning algorithm based on the bag&#8208;of&#8208;words (BoW) model, where, by learning and recognizing the stimulus&#8208;dependent 2D output image patterns, the discrimination of each stimulus in various multimodal stimuli environments is possible. In addition, the single sensor device integrated in the cross&#8208;reactive sensor matrix exhibits multimodal detection of strain, flexion, pressure, and temperature. It is hoped that his proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based approach will provide a versatile route to simplify the electronic skin systems with reduced architecture complexity and adaptability to various environments beyond the limitation of conventional &#8220;lock and key&#8221; approaches.

      <title>Ultrafast and Stable Li&#8208;(De)intercalation in a Large Single Crystal H&#8208;Nb2O5 Anode via Optimizing the Homogeneity of Electron and Ion Transport</title>
      <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;sized single crystal H&#8208;Nb2O5 with an amorphous N&#8208;doped carbon shell (N&#8208;C@MSC&#8208;Nb2O5) is designed to optimize the homogeneity of electron and ion transport, which dramatically improves its electrochemical reaction kinetics and synchronism of phase change during (de)intercalation. Therefore, N&#8208;C@MSC&#8208;Nb2O5 shows a better high&#8208;rate performance than most Li4Ti5O12&#8208;based and T&#8208;Nb2O5&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Exploring anode materials with fast, safe, and stable Li&#8208;(de)intercalation is of great significance for developing next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Monoclinic H&#8208;type niobium pentoxide possesses outstanding intrinsic fast Li&#8208;(de)intercalation kinetics, high specific capacity, and safety; however, its practical rate capability and cycling stability are still limited, ascribed to the asynchronism of phase change throughout the crystals. Herein this problem is addressed by homogenizing the electron and Li&#8208;ion conductivity surrounding the crystals. An amorphous N&#8208;doped carbon layer is introduced on the micrometer single&#8208;crystal H&#8208;Nb2O5 particle to optimize the homogeneity of electron and Li&#8208;ion transport. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared H&#8208;Nb2O5 exhibits high reversible capacity (&gt;250 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 mA g&#8722;1), unprecedented high&#8208;rate performance (&#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 16.0 A g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability (&#8776;170 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.0 A g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles), which is by far the highest performance among the H&#8208;Nb2O5 materials. The inherent principle is further confirmed via operando transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A novel insight into the further development of electrode materials forlithium&#8208;ion batteries is thus provided.

      <title>Scalable Manufacturing of Free&#8208;Standing, Strong Ti3C2Tx MXene Films with Outstanding Conductivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong and highly conductive binder&#8208;free Ti3C2Tx MXene films with excellent electromagnetic interference shielding performance are fabricated by a blade&#8208;coating method using high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio MXene flakes. Achieving such a combination of properties using a scalable fabrication process enables manufacturing of MXene&#8208;based high&#8208;performance devices and new applications.








Abstract
Free&#8208;standing films that display high strength and high electrical conductivity are critical for flexible electronics, such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding coatings and current collectors for batteries and supercapacitors. 2D Ti3C2Tx flakes are ideal candidates for making conductive films due to their high strength and metallic conductivity. It is, however, challenging to transfer those outstanding properties of single MXene flakes to macroscale films as a result of the small flake size and relatively poor flake alignment that occurs during solution&#8208;based processing. Here, a scalable method is shown for the fabrication of strong and highly conducting pure MXene films containing highly aligned large MXene flakes. These films demonstrate record tensile strength up to &#8776;570 MPa for a 940 nm thick film and electrical conductivity of &#8776;15 100 S cm&#8722;1 for a 214 nm thick film, which are both the highest values compared to previously reported pure Ti3C2Tx films. These films also exhibit outstanding EMI shielding performance (&#8776;50 dB for a 940 nm thick film) that exceeds other synthetic materials with comparable thickness. MXene films with aligned flakes provide an effective route for producing large&#8208;area, high&#8208;strength, and high&#8208;electrical&#8208;conductivity MXene&#8208;based films for future electronic applications.

      <title>Electrochemical Methods for Lithium Recovery: A Comprehensive and Critical Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Due to the ubiquitous presence of Li&#8208;ion batteries, the future availability of Li is under debate. Li utilization will depend on an increase in production. However, the main Li&#8208;extraction method requires years. The most attracting alternative, electrochemical Li recovery, is analyzed, with the employed methodology, materials, and reactors being scrutinized from a critical perspective.








Abstract
Due to the ubiquitous presence of lithium&#8208;ion batteries in portable applications, and their implementation in the transportation and large&#8208;scale energy sectors, the future cost and availability of lithium is currently under debate. Lithium demand is expected to grow in the near future, up to 900 ktons per year in 2025. Lithium utilization would depend on a strong increase in production. However, the currently most extended lithium extraction method, the lime&#8208;soda evaporation process, requires a period of time in the range of 1&#8211;2 years and depends on weather conditions. The actual global production of lithium by this technology will soon be far exceeded by market demand. Alternative production methods have recently attracted great attention. Among them, electrochemical lithium recovery, based on electrochemical ion&#8208;pumping technology, offers higher capacity production, it does not require the use of chemicals for the regeneration of the materials, reduces the consumption of water and the production of chemical wastes, and allows the production rate to be controlled, attending to the market demand. Here, this technology is analyzed with a special focus on the methodology, materials employed, and reactor designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art is reevaluated from a critical perspective and the viability of the different proposed methodologies analyzed.

     alt="Electrochemical Methods for Lithium Recovery: A Comprehensive and Critical Review"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the ubiquitous presence of Li&#8208;ion batteries, the future availability of Li is under debate. Li utilization will depend on an increase in production. However, the main Li&#8208;extraction method requires years. The most attracting alternative, electrochemical Li recovery, is analyzed, with the employed methodology, materials, and reactors being scrutinized from a critical perspective.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the ubiquitous presence of lithium&#8208;ion batteries in portable applications, and their implementation in the transportation and large&#8208;scale energy sectors, the future cost and availability of lithium is currently under debate. Lithium demand is expected to grow in the near future, up to 900 ktons per year in 2025. Lithium utilization would depend on a strong increase in production. However, the currently most extended lithium extraction method, the lime&#8208;soda evaporation process, requires a period of time in the range of 1&#8211;2 years and depends on weather conditions. The actual global production of lithium by this technology will soon be far exceeded by market demand. Alternative production methods have recently attracted great attention. Among them, electrochemical lithium recovery, based on electrochemical ion&#8208;pumping technology, offers higher capacity production, it does not require the use of chemicals for the regeneration of the materials, reduces the consumption of water and the production of chemical wastes, and allows the production rate to be controlled, attending to the market demand. Here, this technology is analyzed with a special focus on the methodology, materials employed, and reactor designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art is reevaluated from a critical perspective and the viability of the different proposed methodologies analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Battery with High Energy Efficiency and Long Life Enabled by a Highly Water&#8208;Retentive Gel Electrolyte with Reaction Modifier</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrolytes play a significant role in the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. A developed KI&#8211;PVAA&#8211;GO hydrogel electrolyte enables zinc&#8211;air batteries that exhibit low charge potential of 1.69 V, long working life of 200 h, high energy efficiency of 73%, and excellent practicability for flexible power sources.








Abstract
Tremendous effort have recently been made in optimizing the air catalysts of flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Unfortunately, the bottleneck factors in electrolytes that largely limit the working life and energy efficiency of ZABs have long been relatively neglected. Herein, an alkaline gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is fabricated through multiple crosslinking reactions among poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(acrylic acid), and graphene oxide followed by intense uptake of an alkali and the KI reaction modifier. The prepared GPE exhibits essentially improved properties compared to traditional PVA gel electrolyte in terms of mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capability. In addition, the introduced reaction modifier I&#8722; in the GPE changes the path of the conventional oxygen evolution reaction, leading to a more thermodynamically favorable path. The optimized GPE enables flexible ZABs exhibiting an exceptionally low charge potential of 1.69 V, a long cycling time of 200 h, a high energy efficiency of 73%, and rugged reliability under different extreme working conditions. Moreover, the successful integration of ZABs in a variety of real wearable electronic devices demonstrates their excellent practicability as flexible power sources.

      <title>Flexible Porous Organic Polymer Membranes for Protonic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
A thiourea&#8208;based porous organic polymer membrane is readily prepared through an atom&#8208;economic thiourea&#8208;formation condensation reaction, and it can serve as an effective proton&#8208;conductive material for protonic field&#8208;effect transistors. The material shows high proton conductivity. The flow of protonic currents can be controlled and monitored by the electrostatic potential applied to the gate electrodes.








Abstract
Artificial transistors represent an ideal means for meeting the requirements in interfacing with biological systems. It is pivotal to develop new proton&#8208;conductive materials for the transduction between biochemical events and electronic signals. Herein, the first demonstration of a porous organic polymer membrane (POPM) as a proton&#8208;conductive material for protonic field&#8208;effect transistors is presented. The POPM is readily prepared through a thiourea&#8208;formation condensation reaction. Under hydrated conditions and at room temperature, the POPM delivers a proton mobility of 5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1; the charge carrier densities are successfully modulated from 4.3 &#215; 1017 to 14.1 &#215; 1017 cm&#8722;3 by the gate voltage. This study provides a type of promising modular proton&#8208;conductive materials for bioelectronics application.
