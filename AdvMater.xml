         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metastable Hidden Skyrmion Phase in the Mott Insulator Cu2OSeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The article reports the discovery of a novel long&#8208;lived metastable skyrmion phase in the multiferroic insulator Cu2OSeO3 visualized with Lorentz transmission electron microscopy for magnetic fields below the equilibrium skyrmion pocket. This phase can be accessed by exciting the sample non&#8208;adiabatically with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser pulses and can not be reached by any conventional field cooling protocol referred as a hidden phase. From the strong wavelength dependence of the photocreation process and via spin dynamics simulations, the magnetoelastic effect is identified as the most likely photocreation mechanism. This effect results in a transient modification of the magnetic free energy landscape extending the equilibrium skyrmion pocket to lower magnetic fields. We&#160;monitored the evolution of the photoinduced phase for over 15 minutes and found no decay. Because such a time is much longer than the duration of any transient effect induced by a laser pulse in a material, we&#160;assume that the new skyrmion state we&#160;discovered is stable for practical purposes, thus breaking ground for a novel approach to control magnetic state on demand at ultrafast timescales and drastically reducing heat dissipation relevant for next generation spintronic devices.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Greatly Suppressed Residual Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reconstruction strategy is employed to achieve a strain&#8208;free perovskite film with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration, and improved energy level alignment. The resultant monolithic perovskite/black&#8208;silicon tandem realizes a certified stabilized efficiency &#8776;29.0%, which is among the best performances for perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts.








Abstract
Despite the swift rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to more than 32%, the instability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is still one of the key obstacles to practical application and is closely related to the residual strain of perovskite films. Herein, a simple surface reconstruction strategy is developed to achieve a global incorporation of butylammonium cations at both surface and bulk grain boundaries by post&#8208;treating perovskite films with a mixture of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and n&#8208;butylammonium iodide in isopropanol solvent, enabling strain&#8208;free perovskite films with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration, and improved energy level alignment. As a result, the corresponding single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells yield a champion PCE of 21.8%, while maintaining 100% and 81% of their initial PCEs without encapsulation after storage for over 2500&#160;h in N2 and 1800&#160;h in air, respectively. Remarkably, a certified stabilized PCE of 29.0% for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts is further demonstrated. The unencapsulated tandem device retains 86.6% of its initial performance after 306 h at maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous xenon&#8208;lamp illumination without filtering ultraviolet light (in air, 20&#8211;35 &#176;C, 25&#8211;75%RH, most often &#8776;60%RH).

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Hitchhiking Drug Delivery to Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes Precisely Boosts Tumor&#8208;Specific Immunity through Autophagy Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle POR/DT is established by self&#8208;assembly of tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug (POR) and lipophilized trehalose prodrug (DT). POR prodrug can cause tumor cells&#8217; immunogenic death and antigen release, while lipophilic modification enhances autophagy inducer's binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLN&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates autophagy&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation in DCs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are the first sites where tumor components reach and dendritic cells (DCs) present tumor&#8208;associated antigens to T cells. DCs rely on autophagy to process tumor antigens into epitope peptides to form epitope&#8208;MHC complexes. Selective delivery of autophagy&#8208;stimulating drugs to TDLNs may be a precise strategy to boost chemotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immunity. Here, a multistage stimulating strategy is proposed to activate the antitumor immunity cascade by inducing immunogenic death of tumor cells and elevating antigen presentation of DCs in TDLNs. A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle is established by self&#8208;assembling tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug and lipophilized trehalose prodrug. This demonstrates that lipophilic modification of trehalose with a DSPE tail and the precise exposure in the tumor site enhances its binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLNs&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates antigen processing and presentation of DCs. This study introduces an approach for targeted delivery to TDLNs and provides insights into mechanisms of autophagy in tumor&#8208;specific immunity.

         <title>Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with an Ultralarge Discharge Capacity per Cycle and an Ultralong Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;electrode rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (T&#8208;RZABs) have a hydrophobic discharge cathode, a hydrophilic charge cathode, and a zinc&#8208;free anode. The decoupled cathodes enable fast ORR/OER kinetics and avoid oxidization of the ORR catalyst. The zinc&#8208;free anode suppresses hydrogen evolution and prevents Zn dendrites. The T&#8208;RZABs have an energy density of 151.8 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a cost of 46.7 US dollars kWh&#8722;1.








Abstract
A conventional two&#8208;electrode rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery (RZAB) has two major problems: 1) opposing requirements for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions from the catalyst at the air cathode; and 2) zinc&#8208;dendrite formation, hydrogen generation, and zinc corrosion at the zinc anode. To tackle these problems, a three&#8208;electrode RZAB (T&#8208;RZAB) including a hydrophobic discharge cathode, a hydrophilic charge cathode, and a zinc&#8208;free anode is developed. The decoupled cathodes enable fast ORR and OER kinetics, and avoid oxidization of the ORR catalyst. The zinc&#8208;free anode using tin&#8208;coated copper foam that induces the growth of (002)Zn planes, suppresses hydrogen evolution, and prevents Zn corrosion. As a result, the T&#8208;RZABs have a high discharge capacity per cycle of 800 mAh cm&#8722;2, a low voltage gap between the discharge/charge platforms of 0.66&#160;V, and an ultralong cycle life of 5220 h at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. A large T&#8208;RZAB with a discharge capacity of 10 Ah per cycle with no obvious degradation after cycling for 1000 h is developed. Finally, a T&#8208;RZAB pack that has an energy density of 151.8 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a low cost of 46.7 US dollars kWh&#8722;1&#160;is assembled.

Atomically dispersed Ce on CoO is prepared as a model to identify the active sites of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based transition metal oxides toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the corresponding catalytic mechanism is elucidated. The Ce&#63743;O&#63743;Co unit site is identified as the active center. The enhanced OER performance is ascribed to reinforce Co&#63743;O covalency through Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) gradient orbital coupling.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth (RE)&#8208;based transition metal oxides (TMO) are emerging as a frontier toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet the knowledge regarding their electrocatalytic mechanism and active sites is very limited. In this work, atomically dispersed Ce on CoO is successfully designed and synthesized by an effective plasma (P)&#8208;assisted strategy as a model (P&#8208;Ce SAs@CoO) to investigate the origin of OER performance in RE&#8211;TMO systems. The P&#8208;Ce SAs@CoO exhibits favorable performance with an overpotential of only 261&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and robust electrochemical stability, superior to individual CoO. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that the Ce&#8208;induced electron redistribution inhibits Co&#63743;O bond breakage in the Co&#63743;O&#63743;Ce unit site. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the gradient orbital coupling reinforces the Co&#63743;O covalency of the Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) unit active site with an optimized Co&#8208;3d&#8208;eg occupancy, which can balance the adsorption strength of intermediates and in turn reach the apex of the theoretical OER maximum, in excellent agreement with experimental observations. It is believed that the establishment of this Ce&#8211;CoO model can set a basis for the mechanistic understanding and structural design of high&#8208;performance RE&#8211;TMO catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Bioavailability of Fertilizer through an Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible and biodegradable protein coating can enhance droplet deposition and adhesion on superhydrophobic plant leaves. This coating packaging with fertilizers through electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions affords a top&#8208;level retention capability for fertilizers, which could further improve the bioavailability of fertilizers and reduce at least 30% fertilizer use in scale&#8208;up applications in agriculture.








Abstract
Foliar fertilization acts as a ubiquitous component of conventional crop production, which brings considerable economic and ecological costs. Due to droplets rebounding and splashing during spraying and rain erosion, low bioavailability of fertilizer results in severe environmental pollution. Contrary to conventional fertilizer formulations with polymers, surfactants, and organic reagents, a method of improving fertilizer bioavailability based on a biocompatible protein coating is presented herein. In this system, whey protein concentrate (WPC) can undergo amyloid&#8208;like aggregation after the reduction of its disulfide bond by the reducing agent tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). Such aggregation affords a fast formation of the optically transparent and colorless phase&#8208;transitioned WPC (PTW) coating at the solid/water interface, with robust interfacial adhesion stability. Upon packaging with fertilizers through electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, such reliable interfacial adhesion thereby facilitates the effective deposition of fertilizers on superhydrophobic and hydrophobic leaf surfaces, with excellent adhesion stability. Based on practical farmland test, this work demonstrates that the application of PTW can significantly boost the bioavailability of fertilizers and decrease at least 30% fertilizer use in large&#8208;scale crop planting. This innovative strategy has the great potential to offer a transformative step forward in managing fertilizer contamination and overuse in future agriculture.

         <title>Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Fabrication via a Unique Chemical Bonding Interface Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2Ti3O7 microspheres with unique chemically bonded interfaces that demonstrate unparalleled cycling stability over the entire temperature range are fabricated as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), highlighting the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.








Abstract
Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H&#8208;NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H&#8208;NTO anode to stably operate for 80&#160;000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H&#8208;NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation behavior in ether&#8208;based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long&#8208;cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter Fusing Indolocarbazole Donors for BT. 2020 Red Electroluminescence and Ultralong Operation Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pure&#8208;red multi&#8208;resonance emitter fused with indolocarbazole segments is developed, simultaneously redshifting and narrowing the emission color. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode realizes BT.2020 red coordinates of (0.708, 0.292), also achieving an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.4% and an ultralong LT95 of over 10&#160;000&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Polycyclic heteroaromatics with multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics are attractive materials for narrowband emitters in wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, MR emitters with pure&#8208;red colors are still rare and usually exhibit problematic spectral broadening when redshifting emission. Here, a narrowband pure&#8208;red MR emitter is reported by fusing indolocarbazole segments into a boron/oxygen&#8208;embedded skeleton, realizing BT.2020 red electroluminescence for the first time together with a high efficiency and an ultralong lifetime. The rigid indolocarbazole segment possesses a strong electron&#8208;donating ability due to its para&#8208;positioned nitrogen&#8211;&#960;&#8211;nitrogen backbone and also enlarges the &#960;&#8208;extension of the MR skeleton to suppress structural displacement during radiation, achieving concurrently redshifted and narrowed emission spectrum. An emission maximum at 637 nm with a full width at half&#8208;maxima of merely 32&#160;nm (0.097&#160;eV) is recorded in toluene. The corresponding device simultaneously exhibits CIE coordinates of (0.708, 0.292) precisely matching the BT.2020 red point, a high external quantum efficiency of 34.4% with low roll&#8208;off and an ultralong LT95 (time to 95% of the initial luminance) of &gt;10&#160;000&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. These performance characteristics are superior even to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite and quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based devices for this specific color, paving the way toward practical applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;gate in&#8208;transistor readout of current superposition and collapse utilizing quantum tunneling and ferroelectric switching</title>

Abstract
In nanostructure assemblies, the superposition of current paths forms microscopic electric circuits, and different circuit networks produce varying results, particularly when utilized as transistor channels for computing applications. However, the intricate nature of assembly networks and the winding paths of commensurate currents hinder standard circuit modeling. Inspired by the quantum collapse of superposition states for information decoding in quantum circuits, the implementation of analogous current path collapse to facilitate the detection of microscopic circuits by modifying their network topology is explored. Here, the superposition and collapse of current paths in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to enrich the computational resources within transistors by engineering the channel length and quantity. Switching the ferroelectric polarization of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 gate dielectric, which drives these transistors out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, decodes the output polymorphism through circuit topological modifications. Furthermore, a protocol for the single&#8208;electron readout of ferroelectric polarization is presented with tailoring the channel coherence. The introduction of lateral path superposition results into intriguing metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions due to transient behavior of ferroelectric switching. This ability to adjust the current networks within transistors and their interaction with ferroelectric polarization in polycrystalline nanostructures lays the groundwork for generating diverse current characteristics as potential physical databases for optimization&#8208;based computing.

Switching the ferroelectric polarization of Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gate dielectric, which drives these transistors out-of-equilibrium, decodes the output polymorphism through circuit topological modifications. Furthermore, a protocol for the single-electron readout of ferroelectric polarization is presented with tailoring the channel coherence. The introduction of lateral path superposition results into intriguing metal-to-insulator transitions due to transient behavior of ferroelectric switching. This ability to adjust the current networks within transistors and their interaction with ferroelectric polarization in polycrystalline nanostructures lays the groundwork for generating diverse current characteristics as potential physical databases for optimization-based computing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Brightened Bicomponent Perovskite Nanocomposite Based on F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Micro&#8208;LED Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicomponent perovskite nanocomposite based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer realizes near 100% quantum yield under excitation of 460 nm blue light. Color gamut of 135.90% NTSC and 101.47% BT.2020 is achieved when the bicomponent perovskite nanocomposites, as color conversion materials, combine with a GaN micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode (micro&#8208;LED) array.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are&#160;making their way toward next&#8208;generation display applications, such as serving as color conversion layers in micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode (micro&#8208;LED)&#160;arrays. Red PQDs containing iodine exhibit weaker brightness compared with their green counterpart when employed as color conversion layers. Therefore, PQDs with enhanced brightness are highly favorable for micro/mini&#8208;LED displays. A universal strategy of bicomponent perovskite nanocomposite (BPNC) with significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity is proposed through the built&#8208;in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the core CsPbBr3 to the shell &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3, and it is confirmed that it is through a pair of combined quasi&#8208;degenerate energy levels in the blue spectra region that the FRET is conducted, resulting in a high excitation wavelength selectivity. Owing to the highly efficient energy transition route from blue excitation to red emission established by the FRET, the BPNC exhibits the brightest single&#8208;peak red photoluminescence with near 100% quantum yield. The BPNC with FRET is further proven to be adaptable to a wide range of emission wavelengths. The BPNCs in a blue micro&#8208;LED array are employed as color downconversion layers, and excellent color conversion properties and high color gamut are demonstrated. This strategy of BPNC paves a road to the full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED&#160;displays.

         <title>Activatable Sonoafterglow Nanoprobes for T&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encompassing sonosensitizers, substrates, and quenchers, an ultrasound&#8208;induced afterglow imaging nanoprobe that can emit afterglow in deep&#8208;seated organs is presented. Only in response to granzyme B that is overexpressed by cytotoxic T cells, such a nanoprobe can be activated to emit sonoafterglow, permitting in vivo longitudinal monitoring of T&#8208;cell dysfunction in deep&#8208;seated autoimmune hepatitis after intravenous injection.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of immune systems benefits early diagnosis of disease and precision immunotherapy; however, most existing imaging probes either have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals with poor correlation to immune responses, or rely on light excitation with limited imaging depth. In this work, an ultrasound&#8208;induced afterglow (sonoafterglow) nanoprobe is developed to specifically detect granzyme B for accurate imaging of T&#8208;cell immunoactivation in vivo. The sonoafterglow nanoprobe (Q&#8208;SNAP) consists of sonosensitizers, afterglow substrates, and quenchers. Upon ultrasound irradiation, sonosensitizers generate singlet oxygen, which converts substrates to high&#8208;energy dioxetane intermediates that slowly release energy after ultrasound cessation. Due to the proximity, energy from substrates can be transferred to quenchers, leading to afterglow quenching. Only in the presence of granzyme B,&#160;quenchers are liberated from Q&#8208;SNAP, resulting in bright afterglow emission with a limit of detection (LOD, 2.1&#160;nm) much lower than most existing fluorescent probes. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating ultrasound, sonoafterglow can be induced through a tissue of 4&#160;cm thickness. Based on the correlation between sonoafterglow and granzyme B, Q&#8208;SNAP not only distinguishes autoimmune hepatitis from healthy liver as early as 4 h after probe injection, but also effectively monitors the cyclosporin&#8208;A&#8208;mediated reversal of T&#8208;cell hyperactivation. Q&#8208;SNAP thus offers the possibilities of dynamic monitoring of T&#8208;cell dysfunction and evaluation of prophylactic immunotherapy in deep&#8208;seated lesions.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Masked Resiquimod Activated by Hypoxia for Selective Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel azide&#8208;masked resiquimod prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) is designed to block its active amino group, which can be selectively activated in hypoxic tumors. The combination of R848&#8208;N3 and polymer vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) results in higher tumor selectivity than the intratumor (i.t.) injection of R848 and combination with anti&#8208;PD1 can achieve 40% tumor cure rate without obvious side effects.








Abstract
Resiquimod (R848) is an immunomodulator that causes a severe systemic inflammatory reaction due to low tumor selectivity, thus hindering its use in cancer therapy. Therefore, an azide&#8208;masked prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) of R848 is developed, which is selectively activated to R848 in hypoxic tumors. R848&#8208;N3 significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in treated mice to 1/12 compared to R848 at the same dose. In addition, combretastatin A4 nanoparticles (CA4&#8208;NPs) are used to enhance the tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3 by elevating the level of tumor hypoxia. R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs has higher tumor selectivity than the intratumoral injection of R848 at 1&#160;h after administration. The concentration of the active R848 in the tumor is 21.45&#8208;fold that in the heart. Benefiting from the high tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3, R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs+anti&#8208;PD1 exerted 94.1% tumor suppression and 40.0% tumor cure. Therefore, this work highlights the potential of azide&#8208;masking strategy in the development of tumor&#8208;selective prodrugs with reduced toxicity.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Mie Resonator Arrays for Broadband Light Trapping in Ultrathin c&#8208;Si Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanophotonic design strategy to realize Mie&#8208;resonator arrays that can combine antireflection and light&#8208;trapping functions in a single, thin layer is discussed. The proposed light&#8208;trapping antireflection coating is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cell, resulting in a 48% enhancement in the short&#8208;circuit current as compared to a planar cell and an absolute efficiency of 11.2%.








Abstract
Effective photon management is critical to realize high power conversion efficiencies for thin crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells. Standard few&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick bulk cells achieve light trapping with macroscopic surface textures covered by thin, continuous antireflection coatings. Such sizeable textures are challenging to implement on ultrathin cells. Here, it is illustrated how nanoscale Mie&#8208;resonator&#8208;arrays with a bimodal size distribution support multiple resonances that can work in concert to achieve simultaneous antireflection and light&#8208;trapping across the broad solar spectrum. The effectiveness of these light&#8208;trapping antireflection coatings is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick c&#8208;Si solar cell. The measured short&#8208;circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.

Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based electrocatalysts possess high water electrolysis activity and are essential components for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A major challenge, however, is how to break the cost&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off. Here, a novel defect engineering strategy is presented to construct a nanoporous (FeCoNiB0.75)97Pt3 (atomic %) high&#8208;entropy metallic glass (HEMG) with a nanocrystalline surface structure that contains large amounts of lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance using only 3 at.% of Pt. The defect&#8208;rich HEMG achieves ultralow overpotentials at ampere&#8208;level current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER (104&#160;mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (301&#160;mV) under alkaline conditions, while retains a long&#8208;term durability exceeding 200&#160;h at 100&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it only requires 81&#160;mV and 122&#160;mV to drive the current densities of 1000 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively. Modelling results reveal that lattice distortion and stacking fault defects help to optimize atomic configuration and modulate electronic interaction, while the surface nanoporous architecture provides abundant active sites, thus synergistically contributing to the reduced energy barrier for water electrolysis. This defect engineering approach combined with a HEMG design strategy is expected to be widely applicable for development of high&#8208;performance alloy catalysts.

         <title>A&#160;Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Molecular Pro&#8208;Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic and Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;)&#8208;activatable pro&#8208;theranostic probe&#160;(FMP) has&#160;activated fluorescence and photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy immunotherapy for the simultaneous killing of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells. FMP&#8208;mediated immunotherapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity, but also exhaust CAFs, promote cytotoxic T lymphocytes and aPD&#8208;L1 to enter the CAF&#8208;rich tumors, thus strengthening the synergistic antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components of the tumor&#8208;associated matrix and play an important role in tumor progression and immunosuppression. Therefore, precise theranostics of CAFs are beneficial for CAFs&#8208;targeted therapies. However, imaging agents enabling precise theranostics of CAFs have been rarely exploited. To tackle this issue, a molecular pro&#8208;theranostic probe (FMP) with activatable fluorescence, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is developed in response to fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) overexpressed in &gt;90% types of CAFs and some tumor cells. Attributed to efficient activatable phototoxicity toward CAFs and tumor cells, together with activated immunogenic cell death (ICD), complete tumor regression of primary tumors and abscopal effect of distant tumors are observed in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model. By integration with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, enhanced systemic immune responses are evoked to obtain long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression of both primary and distant tumors as well as arrest systemic cancer metastasis in living mice.

         <title>Low&#8208;Grade Waste Heat Enables Over 80&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 Interfacial Steam Generation Based on 3D Superhydrophilic Foam</title>

An LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system based on 3D superhydrophilic foam offers a record&#8208;high steam generation for clean water production and salt recovery from high salinity water (seawater or wastewater)








Abstract
Clean water scarcity and energy shortage have become urgent global problems due to population growth and human industrial development. Low&#8208;grade waste heat (LGWH) is a widely available and ubiquitous byproduct of human activities worldwide, which can provide effective power to address the fresh water crisis without additional energy consumption and carbon emissions. In this regard, 3D superhydrophilic polyurethane/sodium alginate (PU/SA) foam and LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation systems are developed, which can precipitate over 80&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 steam generation from seawater and has favorable durability for purification of high salinity wastewater. The excellent water absorption ability, unobstructed water transport, and uniform thin water layer formed on 3D skeletons of PU/SA foam ensure the strong heat exchange between LGWH and fluidic water. As a result, the heat&#8208;localized PU/SA foam enables the efficient energy utilization and ultrafast water evaporation once LGWH is introduced into PU/SA foam as heat flow. In addition, the precipitated salt on PU/SA foam can be easily removed by mechanical compression, and almost no decrease in water evaporation rate after salt precipitation and removal for many times. Meanwhile, the collected clean water has high rejection of ions of 99.6%, which meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of drinking water. Above all, this LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system presents a promising and easily accessible solution for clean water production and water&#8211;salt separation without additional energy burden for the society.

         <title>Interface Modification for Efficient and Stable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Due to their excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgap, metal halide inorganic perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure are considered as an excellent choice for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted inorganic PSCs still lags far behind that of conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs due to interfacial energy level mismatch and high nonradiative charge recombination. Herein, the performance of inverted PSCs was significantly improved by interfacial engineering of CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx films with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI). It is found that the mercapto group can preferably react with the undercoordinated Pb2+ from perovskite by forming Pb&#8208;S bonds, which appreciably reduces the surface trap density. Moreover, MMI modification results in a better energy level alignment with the electron transporting material, promoting carrier transfer and reducing voltage deficit. The above combination results in an open circuit voltage enhancement by 120&#160;mV, yielding a champion PCE of 20.6% for 0.09 cm2 area and 17.3% for 1 cm2 area. Furthermore, the ambient, operational and heat stabilities of inorganic PSCs with MMI modification are also greatly improved. Our work demonstrates a simple but effective approach for fabricating highly efficient and stable inverted inorganic PSCs.

         <title>Supramolecular Photothermal Cascade Nano&#8208;Reactor Enables Photothermal Effect, Cascade Reaction, and In Situ Hydrogelation for Biofilm&#8208;Associated Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>

Abstract
Due to the emergence of drug resistance in bacteria and biofilm protection, achieving a satisfactory therapeutic effect for bacteria&#8208;infected open wounds with conventional measures is problematic. Here, we construct a photothermal cascade nano&#8208;reactor (CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+) through a supramolecular strategy through hydrogen bonding and coordination interactions between chitosan&#8208;modified palladium nano&#8208;cube (CPNC), glucose oxidase (GOx), and ferrous iron (Fe2+). CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+ exhibits excellent photothermal effect and powers the GOx&#8208;assisted cascade reaction to generate hydroxyl radicals, enabling photothermal and chemodynamic combination therapy against bacteria and biofilms. Further proteomics, metabolomics, and all&#8208;atom simulation results indicate that the damage of hydroxyl radical to the function and structure of the cell membrane and the thermal effect enhances the fluidity and inhomogeneity of the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in the synergistic anti&#8208;bacterial effect. In the biofilm&#8208;associated tooth extraction wound model, hydroxyl radical generated from the cascade reaction process could initiate the radical polymerization process to form a hydrogel in situ for wound protection. In vivo experiments confirm synergistic anti&#8208;bacterial and wound protection can accelerate the healing of infected tooth&#8208;extraction wounds without affecting the oral commensal microbiota. This study provides a way to propose a multifunctional supramolecular system for the treatment of open wound infection.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Uniform and Functionalized Nano&#8208;Ion Divider for Regulating Ion Distribution toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Ionic dividers with uniform pores and functionalized surfaces display significant potential for solving Li dendrite issues in Li metal bstteries. In this study, we designed and fabricated single metal and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;sandwiched MXene (M&#8208;NC@MXene) nanosheets that possess highly ordered nanochannels with a diameter of &#8764;10&#160;nm. The experiments and computational calculations verified that the M&#8208;NC@MXene nanosheets eliminate Li dendrites in several ways: (1) redistributing the Li&#8208;ion flux via the highly ordered ion channels, (2) selectively conducting Li ions and anchoring anions by heteroatom doping to extend the nucleation time for Li dendrite, and (3) tightly staggering on a routine polypropylene (PP) separator to obstruct the growth path of Li dendrites. With a Zn&#8208;NC@MXene&#8208;coated PP divider, the assembled Li||Li symmetric battery showed an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of &#8764;25&#160;mV and a cycle life of 1500&#160;h at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, the life of the Li||Ni83 pouch cell with an energy density of 305&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 was improved by five&#8208;fold. Moreover, the remarkable performance of Li||Li, Li||LiFePO4, and Li||Sulfur batteries revealed the significant potential of the well&#8208;designed multifunctional ion divider for further practical applications.

         <title>Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental composition provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is a most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in the uncontrollable structure, poor stability and scarce active sites. Here, we&#160;present a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow us&#160;to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5 m2 g&#8211;1. The current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 is achieved in 1&#160;M KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV. And after 1000 hours operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high&#8208;entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.

         <title>Additive manufacturing of liquid crystal elastomer actuators based on knitting technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) exhibits large and reversible deformability originating from the alignment of liquid crystal mesogens. Additive manufacturing provides high controllability in the alignment and shaping process of LCE actuators. However, it still remains a challenge to customize LCE actuators with both diverse three&#8208;dimensional deformability and recyclability. In this work, a new strategy is developed to exploit knitting technique to additively manufacture LCE actuators. The obtained LCE actuators are fabric&#8208;structured with designed geometry and deformability. By accurately adjusting the parameters of the knitting patterns as modules, diverse geometry is pixel&#8208;wise designed, and complex three&#8208;dimensional deformations including bending, twisting and folding are quantitatively controlled. In addition, the fabric&#8208;structured LCE actuators can be threaded, stitched, and reknitted to achieve advanced geometry, integrated multi&#8208;functions and efficient recyclability. This approach allows the fabrication of versatile LCE actuators with potential applications in smart textiles and soft robots.

         <title>Controllable Synthesis of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 Lateral Heterostructures and Their Tunable Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Constructing heterostructures and doping are valid ways to improve the optoelectronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and optimize the performance of TMDs&#8208;based photodetectors. Compared with transfer techniques, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has higher efficiency in preparing heterostructures. As for the one&#8208;step CVD growth of heterostructures, cross&#8208;contamination between the two materials may occur during the growth process, which may provide the possibility of one&#8208;step simultaneous realization of controllable doping and formation of alloy&#8208;based heterostructures by finely tuning the growth dynamics. Here, 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 alloy&#8208;to&#8208;alloy lateral heterostructures are synthesized through this one&#8208;step CVD growth method, utilizing the cross&#8208;contamination and different growth temperatures of the two alloys. Due to the doping of a small amount of Re atoms in 2H MoS2, 2H MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 has a high response rejection ratio in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV) region and exhibits a positive photoconductive (PPC) effect. While the 1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2 formed by heavily doping Mo atoms into 1T' ReS2 will produce a negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect under ultraviolet (UV) laser irradiation. The optoelectronic property of 2H&#8208;1T&#8242; MoxRe(1&#8208;x)S2&#8208;based heterostructures can be modulated by gate voltage. These findings are expected to expand the functionality of traditional optoelectronic devices and have potential applications in optoelectronic logic devices.

         <title>High Mass Loading Li&#8208;S Batteries Catalytically Activated by Cerium Oxide: Performance and Failure Analysis under Lean Electrolyte Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Increasing sulfur mass loading and minimizing electrolyte amount remains a major challenge for the development of high energy density Li&#8208;S batteries, which needs to be tackled with combined efforts of materials development and mechanistic analysis. In this work, following our most recent identification of the potential&#8208;limiting step of Li&#8208;S batteries under lean electrolyte conditions, we seek to advance the understanding by extending it to a new catalyst and into the region of high sulfur mass loading. We integrate CeOx nanostructures into cotton&#8208;derived carbon to develop a multifunctional 3D network that can host a large amount of active material, facilitate electron transport, and catalyze the sulfur lithiation reaction. The resulting S/CeOx/C electrode can deliver a stable areal capacity of 9 mAh cm&#8722;2 with a high sulfur loading of 14&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#160;&#956;L mg&#8722;1. We discover that Li||S/CeOx/C cells usually fail during a charging step at high current density, as a consequence of local short circuiting caused by electrochemically deposited Li dendrites penetrating through the separator, a previously overlooked failure pattern distinctive to cells operating under lean electrolyte conditions. This work highlights the importance of developing new material structures and analyzing failure mechanisms in the advancement of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Flowthrough Capture of Microplastics through Polyphenol&#8208;mediated Interfacial Interactions on Wood Sawdust</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nano&#8208;/microplastics accumulate in aquatic bodies and raise increasing threats to ecosystems and human health. The limitation of existing water cleanup strategies, especially in the context of nano&#8208;/microplastics, primarily arises from their complexity (morphological, compositional, and dimensional). Here, we report highly efficient and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) to remove a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water: polyethylene terephthalate (anionic, irregular shape), polyethylene (net neutral, irregular shape), polystyrene (anionic and cationic, spherical shape), and other anionic and spherical shaped particles (polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride). We demonstrate highly efficient bioCap systems that adsorb the ubiquitous particles released from beverage bags. As evidence of removal from drinking water, we profile the in vivo biodistribution of nano&#8208;/microplastics, confirming a significant reduction of particle accumulation in main organs. The unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions is employed in sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and facile strategies based on wood sawdust support for the removal of challenging nano&#8208;/microplastics pollutions.

         <title>Dynamical Behaviors of Oscillating Metallosurfactant Coacervate Microdroplets under Redox Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic coacervation is presented from redox&#8208;active metallosurfactants as a model system to study non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena in life. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles sustaining both in solution and at colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport and passing through nanosized channels.








Abstract
Living systems create complex structures and functions by mastering self&#8208;organization in a variety of equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium states. Mimicking the dynamical phenomena with synthetic cell&#8208;like entities (protocells) under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions offers an important step toward the representation of minimum life. Here, the cell&#8208;sized coacervate microdroplets assembled from associative metallosurfactant coacervation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibits non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors are reported. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles with external redox stress. The collective oscillation of abiotic metallosurfactant microdroplets can sustain both in solution and at the colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport, and passing through nanosized channels, reminiscent of red blood cells&#160;that can deform and squeeze through narrow capillaries. The design of self&#8208;oscillating cell&#8208;sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life&#8208;like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.

         <title>Active Thermal Metasurfaces for Remote Heating/Cooling by Mimicking Negative Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;focus thermal lens with equivalent negative thermal conductivity is designed and experimentally realized to achieve a remote heating/cooling effect. The thermal lens consists of active thermal metasurfaces, which are constructed by p/n&#8208;type semiconductor pairs driven by a DC power supply. The proposed method can also achieve other novel thermal effects, such as thermal superlens and thermal tunneling effects.








Abstract
Remote temperature control can be obtained by a long&#8208;focus thermal lens that can focus heat fluxes into a spot far from the back surface of the lens and create a virtual thermal source/sink in the background material, around which the temperature field distribution can be remotely controlled by varying the parameters of the thermal lens. However, because of the lack of negative thermal conductivity, existing thermal lenses have extremely short focal lengths and cannot be used to remotely control the temperature field around the virtual thermal source/sink. In this study, a general approach is proposed to equivalently realize materials with negative thermal conductivity using elaborately distributed active thermal metasurfaces (ATMSs). Subsequently, the proposed ATMS is used to implement a novel thermal lens with a long focal length designed using transformation thermodynamics, and finally realize the ATMS with realistic materials and experimentally verify the performance of the designed long&#8208;focus thermal lens (measured focal length of 19.8&#160;mm) for remote heating/cooling. The proposed method expands the scope of the thermal conductivity and provides new pathways to realize unprecedented thermal effects with effective negative thermal conductivity, such as &#8220;thermal surface plasmon polaritons,&#8221; a thermal superlens, the thermal tunneling effect, and the thermal invisible gateway.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Size&#8208;Transformable and Bioactivity&#8208;Switchable Self&#8208;Assembling Chimeric Peptide Nanoassemblies for Combating Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chimeric peptide nanoassembly consisting of a 14&#8208;carbon alkyl chain unit, a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#160;and pH&#8208;responsive unit, a P. aeruginosa target recognition unit, and a hydrophilic unit is developed. The nanoassemblies exhibit good bactericidal ability in acidic environments and are able to penetrate mature biofilms and kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. These results provide a reference for the development of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections are prominent problems in the field of antibacterial medicine, seriously affecting human and animal health. Despite the great potential of nanomaterials in the antibacterial field, overcoming the paradox of size and charge, efficient penetration, and retention within biofilms remain a formidable challenge. Here, self&#8208;assembling chimeric peptide nanoassemblies composed of multiple functional fragments are designed for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Notably, the chimeric peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers at pH 7.4 and is transformable into nanoparticles in the acidic biofilm&#8208;infected microenvironment at pH 5.0, and thus achieves a size reduction and charge increase, improving the penetration into the bacterial biofilms and killing drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by a mechanism dominated by membrane cleavage. In vivo mouse and piglet infection models confirm the ability of chimeric peptide nanoassemblies to reduce bacterial load within biofilms. Collectively, this research on pathological&#8208;environment&#8208;driven nanostructural transformations may provide a theoretical basis for designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial nanomaterials and advance the application of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in medicine and animal husbandry.

Abstract
The emergence of plastic electronics satisfies the increasing demand for flexible electronics. However, it has caused severe ecological problems. Flexible electronics based on natural materials are increasing to hopefully realize the &#8220;green&#8221; and eco&#8208;friendly concept. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of green flexible electronics are reviewed. First, this review comprehensively introduces various natural materials and derivatives, focusing particularly on fibroin and silk, wood and paper, plants, and biomass. Second, fabrication techniques for modifying natural materials, including physical and chemical methods, are presented, after which their merits and demerits are thoroughly discussed. Green flexible electronics based on natural materials, comprising electrical wires/electrodes, antennas, thermal management devices, transistors, memristors, sensors, energy&#8208;harvesting devices, energy&#8208;storage devices, displays, actuators, electromagnetic shielding, and integration systems, are described in detail. Finally, perspectives on the existing challenges and opportunities to employ natural materials in green flexible electronics are presented.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Macro&#8211;Mesoporous Electrocatalyst with Hydrophilic Surface for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt supported on carbon electrocatalyst with hollow&#8208;wall and 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous structures and hydrophilic surface is successfully prepared, showing high electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer versatile templates/precursors to prepare supported metal catalysts. However, the afforded catalysts usually exhibit microporous structures and unsuitable wettability, which will restrict the accessibility of active sites in liquid&#8208;phase reactions. Herein, an etching&#8211;functionalization strategy is developed for the construction of a tannic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized MOF with a unique hollow&#8208;wall and 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous (H&#8208;3DOM) structure.

The H&#8208;3DOM structure can improve the external surface area to maximize the exposure of active sites. Moreover, the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can enhance the surface wettability to guarantee the external active sites to be more electrochemically accessible in aqueous electrolyte. Benefitting from these outstanding characteristics, H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/ONC exhibits high electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction, superior to its counterparts without the hierarchically ordered structure and surface functionalization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer versatile templates/precursors to prepare supported metal catalysts. However, the afforded catalysts usually exhibit microporous structures and unsuitable wettability, which will restrict the accessibility of active sites in liquid-phase reactions. Herein, an etching&#8211;functionalization strategy is developed for the construction of a tannic-acid-functionalized MOF with a unique hollow-wall and 3D-ordered macroporous (H-3DOM) structure. The functional MOF can be further employed as an ideal precursor for the synthesis of cobalt supported on oxygen/nitrogen-co-doped carbon composites with H-3DOM structures, and hydrophilic surface. The H-3DOM structure can improve the external surface area to maximize the exposure of active sites. Moreover, the oxygen-containing functional groups can enhance the surface wettability to guarantee the external active sites to be more electrochemically accessible in aqueous electrolyte. Benefitting from these outstanding characteristics, H-3DOM-Co/ONC exhibits high electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction, superior to its counterparts without the hierarchically ordered structure and surface functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Channel&#8208;Restructured Zwitterionic Covalent Organic Framework Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A zwitterionic covalent organic framework (Zwitt&#8208;COF) is developed as a solid electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. The Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte exhibits a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity with a wide electrochemical window, leading to superior long&#8208;term cycle performance in the battery. Theoretical simulations reveal that Zwitt&#8208;COF promotes the dissociation of Li&#8208;ion pairs and provides ion channels for effective Li+ transport.








Abstract
Organic solid electrolytes offer an effective route for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries. However, it remains a challenge to devise a new strategy to promote the dissociation of strong ion pairs and the transport of ionic components in organic solid electrolytes. Herein, a zwitterionic covalent organic framework (Zwitt&#8208;COF) with well&#8208;defined chemical and pore structures is prepared as a solid electrolyte capable of accelerating the dissociation and transport of Li ions. The Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte exhibits a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.65&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a wide electrochemical stability window. Besides, the Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte displays stable Li plating/stripping behavior via effective inhibition of the formation of Li dendrites and dead Li, leading to superior long&#8208;term cycle performance with retention of 99% discharge capacity and 98% Coulombic efficiency in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery. Theoretical simulations reveal that the incorporation of zwitterionic groups into COF can facilitate the dissociation of strong ion pairs and reconstruct the AA&#8208;stacking configuration by dissociative adsorption of Li+ ions on Zwitt&#8208;COF producing linear hexagonal ion channels in the Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte. This strategy based on Zwitt&#8208;COF can provide an alternative way to construct various solid&#8208;state Li batteries.

         <title>Selective Potassium Deposition Enables Dendrite&#8208;Resistant Anodes for Ultrastable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
K@Bi80/NrGO anode is successfully designed as a dendrite&#8208;resistant anode. The K@Bi80/NrGO||K@Bi80/NrGO symmetric cell achieves an ultrastable reversible cycle up to 3000 h at a current density of 0.2 mA cm&#8211;2. The newly designed anode is expected to provide a fresh impetus to advance the development of potassium&#8208;metal anodes and beyond.








Abstract
Instability at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and uncontrollable growth of potassium dendrites have been pressing issues for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a self&#8208;supporting electrode composed of bismuth and nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (Bi80/NrGO) is designed as an anode host for potassium&#8208;metal batteries. Following the molten potassium diffusion into Bi80/NrGO, the resulting K@Bi80/NrGO exhibits unique hollow pores that provide K+&#8208;diffusion channels and deposition space to buffer volume expansion, thus maintaining the electrode structure and SEI stability. The K@Bi80/NrGO also provides a controlled electric field that promotes uniform K+ flux, abundant potassiophilic N sites, and Bi alloying active sites, collectively enabling precise nucleation and selective deposition of potassium to achieve dendrite&#8208;resistant anodes. With the K@Bi80/NrGO&#8208;based optimized electrodes, the assembled K@Bi80/NrGO symmetrical cells can sustain stable cycling over 3000&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Full cells with a&#160;Prussian blue cathode and K@Bi80/NrGO anode exhibit high stability (with no degradation for 1960 cycles at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1) with 99% Coulombic efficiency. This work may lead to the design of anodes with the triple attributes of precise nucleation, smooth diffusion, and dendrite inhibition, ideal for developing stable potassium&#8208;metal anodes and beyond.

A novel H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT composite of hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 and hollow halloysite nanotube is employed as an electrolyte in lithium&#8208;ion conduction in solid&#8208;state batteries, presenting excellent comprehensive electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a promising rechargeable electrochemical energy storage material have emerged in the field of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, low ionic conductivity and high interfacial impedance still severely hamper the application of MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE). In this work, a novel hierarchical porous H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) material is harvested through the in situ growth of zinc nitrate hydroxide nanosheets, expressing excellent ion conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and Li+&#8208;transference number of 0.71. Moreover, the morphology and structure of H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 is further optimized to obtain a composite H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT by decorating halloysite nanotubes (HNT). Notably, functionalized H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT as an electrolyte presents obvious enhancement on electrochemical properties: higher ionic conductivity of 7.74 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, better single&#8208;ion transmittability (tLi+${t}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^{+}}$ = 0.84), good interfacial compatibility as well as excellent rate performance. More importantly, the Li/LiFePO4 battery equipped with H&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8/HNT SSE has efficient lithium&#8208;dendrite suppression and up to 84% capacity retention (104.16&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1) after 200 times galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. This work enriches the solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion composite electrolyte materials, opening an entirely new way for enhancing electrochemical performance.

         <title>Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction by Inducing Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization in a Metal Phthalocyanine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical effect of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization on O2 adsorption is demonstrated by the structurally defined Gr&#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MPPc catalysts. The catalyst holding &#8208;V&#8208;O&#8208;Fe&#8208; axial coordination stands out with the highest O2 adsorption energy and delivers a remarkable ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.925&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and kinetic current density of 26.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Metal phthalocyanine (MPc) material with a well&#8208;defined MN4 moiety offers a platform for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the practical performance is often limited by the insufficient O2 adsorption due to the planar MN4 configuration. Here, a design (called Gr&#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MPPc) is proposed, where the metal of MPc (MP) is axially coordinated to a single metal atom in graphene (Gr&#8208;MG) through a bridge&#8208;bonded oxygen atom (O), introducing effective out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization to promote O2 adsorption on MPc. Manipulating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization charge by varying types of MP and MG (MP&#160;=&#160;Fe/Co/Ni, MG&#160;=&#160;Ti/V/Cr/Mn/Fe/Co/Ni) in the axial coordination zone of &#8208;MG&#8208;O&#8208;MP&#8208; are examined by density functional theory simulations. Among them, the catalyst of Gr&#8208;V&#8208;O&#8208;FePc stands out with the highest calculated O2 adsorption energy, which is synthesized successfully and verified by systemic X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements.

&lt;p&gt;The critical effect of out-of-plane polarization on O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption is demonstrated by the structurally defined Gr-M&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;-O-M&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;Pc catalysts. The catalyst holding -V-O-Fe- axial coordination stands out with the highest O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption energy and delivers a remarkable ORR performance with half-wave potential of 0.925&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and kinetic current density of 26.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal phthalocyanine (MPc) material with a well-defined MN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; moiety offers a platform for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the practical performance is often limited by the insufficient O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption due to the planar MN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; configuration. Here, a design (called Gr-M&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;-O-M&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;Pc) is proposed, where the metal of MPc (M&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) is axially coordinated to a single metal atom in graphene (Gr-M&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;) through a bridge-bonded oxygen atom (O), introducing effective out-of-plane polarization to promote O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption on MPc. Manipulating the out-of-plane polarization charge by varying types of M&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; (M&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;Fe/Co/Ni, M&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;Ti/V/Cr/Mn/Fe/Co/Ni) in the axial coordination zone of -M&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;-O-M&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;- are examined by density functional theory simulations. Among them, the catalyst of Gr-V-O-FePc stands out with the highest calculated O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption energy, which is synthesized successfully and verified by systemic X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. Importantly, it delivers a remarkable ORR performance with half-wave potential of 0.925&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) and kinetic current density of 26.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Biodegradable NIR&#8208;II Pseudo Conjugate Polymeric Nanoparticles Amplify Photodynamic Immunotherapy via Alleviation of Tumor Hypoxia and Tumor&#8208;associated Macrophage Reprogramming</title>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has achieved great success in cancer treatment. Despite its great promise, the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy could be limited by the hypoxia in solid tumors which is closely related to the abnormal tumor vasculature. These abnormal vasculatures are a hallmark of most solid tumors and facilitate immune evasion. Therefore, tumor vascular normalization was developed as a promising strategy to overcome tumor hypoxia, resulting in improved cancer therapy. Here, a NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;degradable pseudo&#8208;conjugate polymer (PSP)&#8208;based photodynamic polymer was designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg). NP&#8208;PDT@Reg under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L) can efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP&#8208;PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. Moreover, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L could further result in generation of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eradicate tumor cells while inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In addition, Reg could reprogram TAM from a pro&#8208;tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor&#8208;killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the current study provides an innovative perspective on the development of novel nanomaterials to overcome the limitations in photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Diatomite&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Doped MoS2/Carbon Composites to Boost Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrodes for energy conversion/storage because of the layered structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency. However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here an ingenious diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C) composites toward the high&#8208;performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium&#8208;ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (&#8764;604.0 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 A g&#8211;1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density function theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of synthesizing SACs on 2D TMDCs, but also provides a crucial step toward the practical sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping in Ordered and Disordered Domains of Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel organic bioelectronic technologies rely on the efficient electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers. In this work, it is investigated how the doping process can be controlled by the co&#8208;existence of ordered and disordered domains in polymeric films. It is shown that both domains are doped trough different mechanisms and extents, and that optimal conductivity can be achieved by modulating film order.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in electrochemical applications for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and energy harvesting. The design of efficient electrochemical devices relies on large modulations of the polymer conductivity, fast doping/dedoping kinetics, and high ionic uptake. In this work, structure&#8211;property relations are established and control of these parameters by the co&#8208;existence of order and disorder in the phase morphology is demonstrated. Using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman, and terahertz (THz) conductivity measurements, the electrochemical doping in the different morphological domains of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is investigated. The main finding is that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favored. On the other hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct regions. A significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity is evident when bipolarons start forming in the disordered regions, while the presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. This study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced increase in conductivity.

         <title>Optical Switching of Hole Transfer in Double&#8208;Perovskite/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer across heterostructure interfaces crucially determines device applications, including light sensing. In this work, an optical switching of the hole&#8208;transfer direction and efficiency across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene heterostructures by tuning the excitation wavelength is reported. This provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a semiconductor/graphene heterojunction.








Abstract
Synergically combining their respective ultrahigh charge mobility and strong light absorption, graphene (Gr)/semiconductor heterostructures are promising building blocks for efficient optoelectronics, particularly photodetectors. Charge transfer (CT) across the heterostructure interface crucially determines device efficiency and functionality. Here, it is reported that hole&#8208;transfer processes dominate the ultrafast CT across strongly coupled double&#8208;perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6/graphene (DP/Gr) heterostructures following optical excitation. While holes are the primary charges flowing across interfaces, their transfer direction, as well as efficiency, show a remarkable dependence on the excitation wavelength. For excitation with photon energies below the bandgap of DPs, the photoexcited hot holes in Gr can compete with the thermalization process and inject into in&#8208;gap defect states in DPs. In contrast, above&#8208;bandgap excitation of DP reverses the hole&#8208;transfer direction, leading to hole transfer from the valence band of DPs to Gr. Experimental evidence that increasing the excitation photon energy enhances CT efficiency for both below&#8208; and above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation regimes is further provided, unveiling the positive role of excess energy in enhancing interfacial CT. The possibility of switching the hole&#8208;transfer direction and thus the interfacial photogating field by tuning the excitation wavelength, provides a novel way to control the interfacial charge flow across a DP/Gr heterojunction.

         <title>A Sodium Alginate&#8208;Based Multifunctional Nanoplatform for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sodium alginate (ALG)&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatform is developed by using constant &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannuronic acid (M) units and modulated &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;guluronic acid (G) units in the ALG structure for synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which not only integrates the natural immunity of ALG and the immunogenic cell death (ICD) triggering function of DOX, but also shows dual targeting properties to HCC cells.








Abstract
Efficient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains a significant challenge due to&#160;the inherent limitations of traditional strategies. The exploration of polysaccharides&#8217; natural immunity for HCC immunotherapy is rarely explored. For this purpose, facile construction of a multifunctional nanoplatform, biotinylated aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle (BEA&#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743;DOX&#63743;M) is reported in this study for synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by using constant &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannuronic acid (M) units and modulated &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;guluronic acid (G) units in the alginate (ALG) structure. The M units show natural immunity and specific binding ability with mannose receptors (MRs) via strong receptor&#8208;ligand interactions, and the G units serve as highly reactive conjugation sites for biotin (Bio) and DOX. Therefore, this formulation not only integrates the natural immunity of ALG and the immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#160;triggering function of DOX, but also shows dual targeting properties to HCC cells via MRs and Bio receptors (BRs)&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Notably, BEA&#63743;C&#63742;N&#63743;DOX&#63743;M mediates a tumor inhibitory efficiency 12.10% and 4.70% higher than free DOX and single targeting aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle controls, respectively, at an equivalent DOX dose of 3 mg kg&#8722;1 in Hepa1&#8208;6 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study reports the first example of integrating the natural immunity of ALG and the ICD effect of anticancer drugs&#160;for enhanced chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of HCC.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Nanozyme&#8208;Armed Bacteriophages Efficiently Combat Bacterial Infection</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative nanozyme&#8208;armed phage system is fabricated for combating bacterial infection. The phage@Pd preserves the phages' capacity toward precise recognition and adhesion to the host. The Pd nanozymes with pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like activity can generate toxic hydroxyl radical in the acidic and H2O2&#8208;overexpressed infection microenvironment, thusrealizing&#160;noteworthy elimination of bacteria at infected site.








Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the greatest challenges to public health, requiring new therapeutic methods. Herein, an innovative nanozyme&#8208;armed phage (phage@palladium (Pd)) system is fabricated for combating bacterial infection. The proposed phage@Pd preserves the function of the phages to achieve precise recognition and adhesion to the host Escherichia coli. In aid of the phages, the ultrasmall Pd nanozymes equipped with conspicuous pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like activity can generate toxic hydroxyl radical around the bacteria in acidic and hydrogen&#8208;peroxide&#8208;overexpressed infection microenvironment while remaining inert in physiological conditions, thus realizing the noteworthy elimination of bacteria at infected sites, and in the meantime ensuring the biological safety of phage@Pd in healthy tissues. In addition, the filamentous structure of phage@Pd can also enhance its bactericidal efficiency toward nonhost bacteria by randomly entangling on them, indicating possible broad&#8208;spectrum germicidal efficacy. Notably, phage@Pd can not only eradicate planktonic bacteria, but also kill the bacteria inside the biofilm in vitro. For both in vivo models of acute bacterial pneumonia or subcutaneous abscess, phage@Pd shows significant activity in eliminating infection and promoting tissue recovery. These results demonstrate that the phage@Pd nanohybrid is a safe and effective antimicrobial agent, providing a new insight into development of advanced antibacterial materials.

         <title>Stabilizing Supersaturation with Extreme Grain Refinement in Spinodal Aluminum Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Supersaturated solid solutions can be formed in alloys from various non&#8208;equilibrium processes, but stabilizing the metastable phases against decomposition is challenging, particularly the spinodal decomposition which occurs via chemical fluctuations without energy barriers to nucleation. Herein, we found that spinodal decomposition in supersaturated Al(Zn) solid solutions can be inhibited with straining&#8208;induced extreme grain refinement. For the refined supersaturated grains in the nano&#8208;scale, their spinodal decomposition is obviously resisted by the relaxed grain boundaries and reduced lattice defects. As grains are refined below 10&#160;nm the decomposition is completely inhibited, in which atomic diffusion are blocked by the stable Schwarz crystal structure with vacancy&#8208;free grains. The extreme grain refinement offers a general approach to stabilize supersaturated phases with broadened compositional windows for property modulation of alloys.

         <title>Symmetry Control of Unconventional Spin&#8208;Orbit Torques in IrO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torques generated by a spin current are key to magnetic switching in spintronic applications. The polarization of the spin current dictates the direction of switching required for energy&#8208;efficient devices. Conventionally, the polarizations of these spin currents are restricted to be along a certain direction due to the symmetry of the material allowing only for efficient in&#8208;plane magnetic switching. Unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torques arising from novel spin current polarizations, however, have the potential to switch other magnetization orientations such as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy which is desired for higher density spintronic&#8208;based memory devices. Here, we demonstrate that low crystalline symmetry is not required for unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torques and can be generated in a non&#8208;magnetic high symmetry material, iridium dioxide (IrO2), using epitaxial design. We show by reducing the relative crystalline symmetry with respect to the growth direction we can generate large unconventional spin currents and hence spin&#8208;orbit torques. Furthermore, we compare the spin polarizations detected in (001), (110), and (111) oriented IrO2 thin films to show which crystal symmetries restrict unconventional spin transport. Understanding and tuning unconventional spin transport generation in high symmetry materials can provide a new route towards energy&#8208;efficient magnetic switching in spintronic devices.

         <title>Switching chirality in arrays of shape&#8208;reconfigurable spindle microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Giant circular photo&#8208;galvanic effect has been realized in chiral metals when illuminated by the circularly polarized light. However, the structure itself is not switchable nor is the crystal chirality in the adjacent chiral domains. Here w e synthesize spindle&#8208;shaped liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) microparticles that can switch from prolate to spherical to oblate reversibly upon heating above the nematic to isotropic transition temperature. When arranged in a honeycomb lattice, the continuous shape change of the microparticles leads to lattice reconfiguration, from a right&#8208;handed chiral state to achiral one, then to a left&#8208;handed chiral state, without breaking the translational symmetry. Accordingly, the sign of rotation of the polarized light passing through the lattices changes as measured by time&#8208;domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Further, w e can locally alter the chirality in the adjacent domains using near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light illumination. The reconfigurable chiral microarrays will allow us to explore non&#8208;trivial symmetry protected transport modes of topological lattices at the light&#8208;matter interface. Specifically, the ability to controllably create chiral states at the boundary of the achiral/chiral domains will lead to rich structures emerging from the interplay of symmetry and topology.

         <title>Unique Tridentate Coordination Tailored Solvation Sheath Towards Highly Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrolyte optimization by solvent molecule design has been recognized as an effective approach for stabilizing lithium (Li) metal batteries. However, the coordination pattern of Li+ with solvent molecules has been sparsely considered. Here, we report an electrolyte design strategy based on bi/tridentate chelation of Li+ and solvent to tune the solvation structure. As a proof of concept, a novel solvent with multi oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anion&#8208;aggregated solvation shell, enhancing the interfacial stability and de&#8208;solvation kinetics. As a result, the as&#8208;developed electrolyte exhibits ultra&#8208;stable cycling over 1400&#160;h in symmetric cells with 50&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thin Li foils. When paired with high&#8208;loading LiFePO4, full cells maintain 92% capacity over 500 cycles and deliver improved electrochemical performances over a wide temperature range from &#8208;10 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C. Furthermore, the concept is validated in a pouch cell (570 mAh), achieving a capacity retention of 99.5% after 100 cycles. This brand&#8208;new insight on electrolyte engineering provides guidelines for practical high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolyte optimization by solvent molecule design has been recognized as an effective approach for stabilizing lithium (Li) metal batteries. However, the coordination pattern of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with solvent molecules has been sparsely considered. Here, we report an electrolyte design strategy based on bi/tridentate chelation of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and solvent to tune the solvation structure. As a proof of concept, a novel solvent with multi oxygen coordination sites is demonstrated to facilitate the formation of an anion-aggregated solvation shell, enhancing the interfacial stability and de-solvation kinetics. As a result, the as-developed electrolyte exhibits ultra-stable cycling over 1400&#160;h in symmetric cells with 50&#160;&#956;m-thin Li foils. When paired with high-loading LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, full cells maintain 92% capacity over 500 cycles and deliver improved electrochemical performances over a wide temperature range from -10 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C. Furthermore, the concept is validated in a pouch cell (570 mAh), achieving a capacity retention of 99.5% after 100 cycles. This brand-new insight on electrolyte engineering provides guidelines for practical high-performance Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ferroelectric Modulation in Flexible Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Schottky Direct&#8208;Current Nanogenerator for Capsule&#8208;Like Magnetic Suspension Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG), a promising semiconductor energy technology, displays outstanding advantages such as low matching impedance and continuous direct&#8208;current output. However, the lack of controllable and stable performance modulation strategies is still a major bottleneck that impedes further practical applications of TVNG. Herein, by leveraging the ferroelectricity&#8208;enhanced mechanism and the control of interfacial energy band bending, we&#160;construct a lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;based [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CuCl4 ((DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4)/Al Schottky junction TVNG. The multiaxial ferroelectricity of (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 enables an excellent surface charge modulating capacity, realizing a high work function regulation of &#8764; 0.7&#160;eV and over 15&#8208;fold current regulation (from 6&#160;&#956;A to 93&#160;&#956;A) via an electrical poling control. The controllable electrical poling leads to elevated work function difference between Al electrode and (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 compared to traditional semiconductors and halide perovskites, which creates a stronger built&#8208;in electric field at the Schottky interface to enhance the electrical output. This TVNG device exhibits outstanding flexibility and long&#8208;term stability (&gt; 20000 cycles) that can endure extreme mechanical deformations, and can also be used in a capsule&#8208;like magnetic suspension device capable of detecting vibration and weights of different objects as well as harvesting energy from human motions and water waves.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Derived Bismuth with I&#8722; and Cs+ Dual Modification for High&#8208;Efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electrosynthesis and Al&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>

Abstract
Bi&#8208;based materials are one of the most promising candidates for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate, however, the majority of them still suffer from low current density and stability that essentially constrain their potential applications at the industrial scale. Surface modification represents an effective approach to modulate the electrode microenvironment and the relative binding strength of key intermediates, thereby significantly impacting the electrocatalytic performances. Herein, we&#160;demonstrate that the surface co&#8208;modification with halides and alkali metal ions from the conversion of bismuth halide perovskite nanocrystals is a viable strategy to boost the CO2RR performance of bismuth for formate electrosynthesis. As a proof of concept, Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are prepared by a hot&#8208;injection method. The as&#8208;prepared products feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal shape and uniform size distribution. When used as the precatalyst, Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are converted to Cs+ and I&#8722; co&#8208;modified Bi. The resultant catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency close to 100%, and remarkable partial current density up to 44&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;0.92&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) in an H&#8208;cell and up to 276&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;0.75&#160;V (versus RHE) in a flow cell as well as great stability. Those performance metrics exceed most of its competitors under similar conditions. Moreover, Cs3Bi2I9 is used as the cathode catalyst and paired with an Al anode in an Al&#8208;CO2 battery for simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation. A peak power density of 7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 is measured at room temperature.

         <title>Oxidation of Hydrogen Sulfide to Polysulfide and Thiosulfate by a Carbon Nanozyme: Therapeutic Implications with an Emphasis on Down Syndrome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a noxious, potentially poisonous, but necessary gas produced from sulfur metabolism in humans. In Down Syndrome (DS), the production of H2S is elevated and associated with degraded mitochondrial function. Therefore, removing H2S from the body as a stable oxide could be an approach to reducing the deleterious effects of H2S in DS. In this report we describe the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to polysulfides (HS2+n&#8722;) and thiosulfate (S2O32&#8722;) by poly(ethylene glycol) hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) and poly(ethylene glycol) oxidized activated charcoal (PEG&#8208;OACs), examples of oxidized carbon nanozymes (OCNs). We show that OCNs oxidize H2S to polysulfides and thiosulfate in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. The reaction is dependent on oxygen and the presence of quinone groups on the OCNs. In DS donor lymphocytes we found that OCNs increased polysulfide production, proliferation, and afforded protection against additional toxic levels of H2S compared to untreated DS lymphocytes. Finally, in Dp16 and Ts65DN murine models of DS, we found that OCNs restored osteoclast differentiation. This new action suggests potential facile translation into the clinic for conditions involving excess H2S exemplified by DS.

         <title>New Function of Metal&#8722;Organic Framework: Structurally Ordered Metal Promoter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The remarkable roles of metal promoters have been known for nearly a century, but it is still a challenge to find a suitable structure model to reveal the action mechanism behind metal promoters. Herein, w e developed a new function of metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) as ideal model to construct structurally ordered metal promoters by a targeted post&#8208;modification strategy. MOFs as model not only favor clearing the real action mechanism behind metal promoters, but also can anchor one or multiple kinds of metal promoters especially noble metal promoters. Typically, the as&#8208;prepared Pd/bpy&#8208;UiO&#8208;Cu catalysts show high selectivity (&gt;99%) toward 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane in 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation, mainly due to the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and MOF carriers induced by Cu promoters, thus inhibiting the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane. This strategy with flexibility and universality will open up a new route to synthesize efficient catalysts with structurally ordered metal promoters.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Dermal Fibroblasts Attenuate Inflammation in a Murine Model of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs) derived from adult dermal fibroblasts show enhanced intrapulmonary targeting and retention and can effectively deliver therapeutic cargo to the inflamed lung to reduce inflammation, mediate tissue repair, and drive metabolic changes that favor further activation of anti&#8208;inflammatory pathways. These eEVs could potentially represent a powerful tool for the treatment of acute lung injury.








Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant burden to the healthcare system, with &#8776;200&#160;000 cases diagnosed annually in the USA. ARDS patients suffer from severe refractory hypoxemia, alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired surfactant function, and abnormal upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospitalization, and increased disability&#8208;adjusted life years. Currently, there is no cure or FDA&#8208;approved therapy for ARDS. This work describes the implementation of engineered extracellular vesicle (eEV)&#8208;based nanocarriers for targeted nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory payloads to the inflamed/injured lung. The results show the ability of surfactant protein A (SPA)&#8208;functionalized IL&#8208;4&#8208; and IL&#8208;10&#8208;loaded eEVs to promote intrapulmonary retention and reduce inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. Significant attenuation is observed in tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, macrophage activation, influx of protein&#8208;rich fluid, and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space as early as 6 h post&#8208;eEVs treatment. Additionally, metabolomics analyses show that eEV treatment causes significant changes in the metabolic profile of inflamed lungs, driving the secretion of key anti&#8208;inflammatory metabolites. Altogether, these results establish the potential of eEVs derived from dermal fibroblasts to reduce inflammation, tissue damage, and the prevalence/progression of injury during ARDS via nonviral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes/transcripts.

&lt;p&gt;Engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs) derived from adult dermal fibroblasts show enhanced intrapulmonary targeting and retention and can effectively deliver therapeutic cargo to the inflamed lung to reduce inflammation, mediate tissue repair, and drive metabolic changes that favor further activation of anti-inflammatory pathways. These eEVs could potentially represent a powerful tool for the treatment of acute lung injury.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant burden to the healthcare system, with &#8776;200&#160;000 cases diagnosed annually in the USA. ARDS patients suffer from severe refractory hypoxemia, alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired surfactant function, and abnormal upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospitalization, and increased disability-adjusted life years. Currently, there is no cure or FDA-approved therapy for ARDS. This work describes the implementation of engineered extracellular vesicle (eEV)-based nanocarriers for targeted nonviral delivery of anti-inflammatory payloads to the inflamed/injured lung. The results show the ability of surfactant protein A (SPA)-functionalized &lt;i&gt;IL-4&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt;-loaded eEVs to promote intrapulmonary retention and reduce inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. Significant attenuation is observed in tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, macrophage activation, influx of protein-rich fluid, and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space as early as 6 h post-eEVs treatment. Additionally, metabolomics analyses show that eEV treatment causes significant changes in the metabolic profile of inflamed lungs, driving the secretion of key anti-inflammatory metabolites. Altogether, these results establish the potential of eEVs derived from dermal fibroblasts to reduce inflammation, tissue damage, and the prevalence/progression of injury during ARDS via nonviral delivery of anti-inflammatory genes/transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solar Biomass Reforming and Hydrogen Production with Earth&#8208;Abundant Si&#8208;Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, stable, and non&#8208;toxic photocatalysts for biomass photo&#8208;reforming, which can simultaneously produce hydrogen and valuable chemicals under mild conditions, have garnered great attention. In this study, a Si&#8208;based hybrid photocatalyst enables record&#8208;high hydrogen productivity and concurrent selective production of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass under simulated sunlight, without any buffering agent or sacrificial electron donors.








Abstract
Efficient electrochemical hydrogen production and biomass refinery are crucial for the decarbonization of various sectors. However, their energy&#8208;intensive nature and low efficiency have hindered their practical application. In this study, earth&#8208;abundant and non&#8208;toxic photocatalysts that can produce hydrogen and reform biomass efficiently, utilizing unlimited solar energy, are presented. The approach involves using low&#8208;bandgap Si flakes (SiF) for efficient light&#8208;harvesting, followed by modification with Ni&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (Ni&#8208;NGQDs) to enable efficient and stable light&#8208;driven biomass reforming and hydrogen production. When using kraft lignin as a model biomass, SiF/Ni&#8208;NQGDs facilitate record&#8208;high hydrogen productivity at 14.2&#160;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and vanillin yield of 147.1&#160;mg&#160;glignin&#8722;1 under simulated sunlight without any buffering agent and sacrificial electron donors. SiF/Ni&#8208;NQGDs can be readily recycled without any noticeable performance degradation owing to the prevention of deactivation of Si via oxidation. This strategy provides valuable insights into the efficient utilization of solar energy and practical applications of electro&#8208;synthesis and biomass refinement.

         <title>Video&#8208;rate Switching Of High&#8208;Reflectivity Hybrid Cavities Spanning All Primary Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dynamically&#8208;tunable reflective structural colors are attractive for reflective displays (electronic paper). However, it has been challenging to tune a thin layer of structural color across the full red&#8208;green&#8208;blue (RGB) basis set of colors at video rates and with long&#8208;term stability. Here, this is achieved through a hybrid cavity built from metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) &#8220;nano&#8208;caves&#8221; and an electrochromic polymer (PProDOTMe2). The reflective colors are modulated by electrochemically doping/dedoping the polymer. Compared with traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems, this hybrid structure provides high reflectivity (&gt;&#160;40%) due to its &#8220;monopixel&#8221; nature, and switches at video rates. The polymer bistability helps deliver ultralow power consumption (&#8764;2.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) for video display applications and negligible values (&#8764;3 &#956;W cm&#8722;2) for static images, compatible with fully&#8208;photovoltaic powering. In addition, the color uniformity of the hybrid material is excellent (over cm&#8722;2) and the scalable fabrication enables large&#8208;area production

         <title>Hydroiodic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Initiated Dense yet Porous Ti3C2Tx MXene Monoliths toward Superhigh Areal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gelation&#8211;densification approach of MXenes to produce thick and dense electrodes with superhigh areal capacitance is proposed. Hydroiodide acids can not only serve as initiators to trigger the gelation of MXenes and construct stable 3D&#160;networks, but also leave highly shrinking porous structures by application of capillary forces during their controlled removal.








Abstract
The assembly of 3D&#160;structured materials from 2D&#160;units paves a royal road for building thick and dense electrodes, which are long sought after for practical energy&#8208;storage devices. 2D transitional metal carbides (MXene) are promising for this due to their capabilities of solution&#8208;based assembly and intrinsic high density, yet face huge challenges in yielding high areal capacitance electrodes owing to the absence of porous ion&#8208;transport paths. Here, a gelation&#8211;densification process initiated by hydroiodide acids (HI) is proposed, where the protons break the electrostatic balance of MXene nanosheets to trigger gelation, while HI serves as a spacer to prevent nanosheets from restacking during capillary shrinkage. More promising, the controlled evaporation of reductive HI leaves superiorly shrinking yet porous network for ion transport, and the produced monoliths exhibit a high density of 2.74&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and an unprecedented areal capacitance of 18.6 F cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Third Component with Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Electrostatic Dipole for Realizing High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaic Donor Terpolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PM6&#8208;based terpolymers containing a saddle&#8208;shaped group with a double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) as the third component designed for fabrication of polymer solar cells feature strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole for optimizing blend morphology and improving the photovoltaic performances, thus achieving 19.13% efficiency.








Abstract
Terpolymer fabrication is an effective methodology for molecular engineering and generating high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic materials to construct highly efficient polymer solar cells. Modification of the polymer PM6 by incorporating a third component resulting in the formation of a ternary copolymer is reported to outperform PM6 in achieving enhanced device performances. However, one of the major challenges in constructing high&#8208;performance terpolymers is to counter the molecular disorder caused by the backbone entropy induced by the third moiety. In this work, double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) is used as the third component, which possesses a&#160;strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole owing to the saddle&#8208;shaped B&#8592;N fused ring structure. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dipole moment introduced in the modified PM6 terpolymer can be used as a means for tuning and optimizing the nanostructures of the blended films. The prepared PM6&#8208;BNBP&#8208;4 blend polymer with 4% of the benzodithiophene dione monomers replaced by BNBP results in excellent power conversion efficiency of 19.13%. This work demonstrates that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic dipole moment in saddle&#8208;shaped molecules is valuable for achieving high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic donor materials.

         <title>Giant Electrostrain in Lead&#8208;Free Textured Piezoceramics by Defect Dipole Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant electrostrain value as high as 1.6% with low hysteresis and excellent fatigue resistance is achieved in textured BNT&#8208;based lead&#8208;free ceramics through the synergistic contributions of the reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and, foremost, defect dipole engineering.









Abstract
By converting electrical signal into mechanical displacement, piezoelectric actuators are widely used in many applications due to their precise displacement, fast response, and small size. The unipolar electrostrain values larger than 1% reported so far are from lead&#8208;based single crystals or ceramics, which brings environmental concerns. Herein, a giant unipolar electrostrain of 1.6% with good fatigue resistance and low hysteresis in Sr/Nb&#8208;doped Bi0.5(Na0.82K0.18)0.5TiO3 lead&#8208;free textured piezoceramics by defect dipole design is reported, which is comparable to or even higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;based piezoelectric single crystals. The engineered defect dipoles in ergodic relaxor ferroelectrics can introduce a large internal bias field along the poling direction, where the &#12296;111&#12297;&#8208;oriented defect dipoles with large polarizability aligning along the &#12296;111&#12297;&#8208;oriented spontaneous polarizations of the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced ferroelectric phase greatly benefit the reversible phase&#8208;transition process of the &#12296;00l&#12297;&#8208;textured ceramic. In&#8208;depth microstructural studies reveal that the greatly enhanced electrostrain is realized by the synergistic contributions from the reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced phase transition, grain orientation engineering, and most importantly, defect dipole engineering. The present research provides a general strategy for the design of piezoceramics with high electrostrain, which is expected to be promising alternative to lead&#8208;based piezoelectric actuators.

         <title>Amorphous MoOx with High Oxophilicity Interfaced with PtMo Alloy Nanoparticles Boosts Anti&#8208;CO Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of amorphous MoOx with high oxophilicity interfaced with PtMo alloy for efficient hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction is reported. It is demonstrated that the weakened Had binding energy and moderate hydroxyl adsorption energy can optimize the absorption behavior of key intermediates, jointly contributing to enhanced hydrogen electrocatalysis performance.








Abstract
Advancing electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) is essential for anion exchange membrane&#8208;based devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR suffer from low intrinsic activities and severe CO poisoning due to the challenge of simultaneously optimizing surface adsorption toward different adsorbates. Herein, this challenge is overcome by tuning an atomic MoOx layer with high oxophilicity onto PtMo nanoparticles (NPs) with optimized Had, OHad, and COad adsorption for boosting anti&#8208;CO&#8208;poisoning hydrogen&#8208;cycle electrocatalysis in alkaline media. For alkaline HOR, this catalyst exhibits high kinetics and an exchange current density of 3.19&#160;mA&#160;&#181;gPt&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cmPt&#8722;2, 10.3&#8208; and 3.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. For alkaline HER, it achieves an unprecedented overpotential of 37&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the orchestrated electronic and oxophilic regulation of the PtMo/MoOx interface NPs simultaneously optimizes Had and OHad adsorption for boosting alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, whereas reactive oxygen from the amorphous MoOx atomic layer lowers the CO oxidation reaction barrier, leading to superior anti&#8208;poisoning ability even at 100&#160;ppm CO.

         <title>Mechanical Signal&#8208;Tailored Hydrogel Microspheres Recruit and Train Stem Cells for Precise Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed an enhanced endogenous regeneration strategy to direct stem cell differentiation via mechanotransduction. Microfluidic hydrogel microspheres with the independently tunable elastic modulus and ECM ligand density are fabricated and demonstrated to recruit intervertebral disc progenitor/stem cells and train them to differentiate into nucleus pulposus&#8208;like cells for repairing intervertebral disc degeneration.








Abstract
The aberrant mechanical microenvironment in degenerated tissues induces misdirection of cell fate, making it challenging to achieve efficient endogenous regeneration. Herein, a hydrogel microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with integrated cell recruitment and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction is constructed . Through the incorporation of microfluidics and photo&#8208;polymerization strategies, fibronectin (Fn) modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) microspheres are prepared with the independently tunable elastic modulus (1&#8211;10Kpa) and ligand density (2 and 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1), allowing a wide range of cytoskeleton modulation to trigger the corresponding mechanobiological signaling. The combination of the soft matrix (2Kpa) and low ligand density (2&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1) can support the nucleus pulposus (NP)&#8208;like differentiation of intervertebral disc (IVD) progenitor/stem cells by translocating Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP), without the addition of inducible biochemical factors. Meanwhile, platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) is loaded onto Fn&#8208;GelMA microspheres (PDGF@Fn&#8208;GelMA) via the heparin&#8208;binding domain of Fn to initiate endogenous cell recruitment. In in vivo experiments, hydrogel microsphere&#8208;niche maintained the IVD structure and stimulated matrix synthesis. Overall, this synthetic niche with cell recruiting and mechanical training capabilities offered a promising strategy for endogenous tissue regeneration.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Peroxynitrite Overproduction Disrupts Metabolic Homeostasis for Sensitizing Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple melanoma&#8208;characteristic stimuli&#8208;triggered tumor&#8208;specific ONOO&#8722; nanogenerator with high biocompatibility is presented, serving as a potent metabolic regulator with irreversible metabolic homeostasis disruption performances of tumor cells through the S&#8208;nitrosylation modification of key metabolic enzymes for the immunosuppressive TME reversion and ICB therapy sensitization of melanoma.








Abstract
Tumor cells elicit metabolic reprogramming to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for escaping from immunosurveillance. Therefore, interrupting the metabolic adaptation of tumor cells may be a promising strategy for TME immunomodulation, favoring immunotherapy. In this work, a tumor&#8208;specific peroxynitrite nanogenerator APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO is constructed that can selectively disrupt metabolic homeostasis in melanoma cells. Stimulated by melanoma&#8208;characteristic acid, glutathione, and tyrosinase, APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO can efficiently generate peroxynitrite through the in situ coupling of the produced superoxide anion and released nitric oxide. Metabolomics profiling reveals that the accumulated peroxynitrite induces a great decrease in metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Meanwhile, the glycolysis&#8208;produced lactate drops sharply both intracellularly and extracellularly under peroxynitrite stress. Mechanistically, peroxynitrite impairs the activity of glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase in glucose metabolism through S&#8208;nitrosylation. The metabolic alterations effectively reverse the immunosuppressive TME to evoke potent antitumor immune responses, including polarization of M2&#8208;like macrophages to M1phenotype, reduction of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and restoration of CD8+ T cell infiltration. Combining APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 achieves a significant inhibition against both primary and metastatic melanomas without systemic toxicities. Collectively, a tumor&#8208;specific peroxynitrite overproduction approach is developed and the possible mechanism of peroxynitrite&#8208;mediated TME immunomodulation is explored, providing a new strategy for facilitating immunotherapy sensitivity.

         <title>A Functionalized Heterogeneous Catalyst from Atomically Precise Pd1Au8 Clusters Facilitates Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bond Construction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized by exchanging Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters into the resin, realizing time&#8208;on&#8208;stream performance for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Due to the defined coordination geometry and composition and ligand of this Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ catalyst, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship can be achieved.








Abstract
It has become possible to establish a connection between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with atomically precise metal clusters. Due to their defined coordination geometry, in this work, atomically precise Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters are exploited to identify the crucial factor that can impact the catalytic efficiency for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process and further gain valuable insight into the exclusive cooperative effect of the central Pd atom and the peripheral Au atoms of the Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ cluster on controlling the cross&#8208;coupling reaction. Specifically, a heterogeneous catalyst, namely Pd1Au8@Resin, is designed by exchanging positively charged Pd1Au8(PPh3)82+ clusters into the porous resin, thereby not only facilitating catalyst recyclability when performed in a batch reactor, but also realizing time&#8208;on&#8208;stream performance for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction carried out in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor. The integrated advantages of homogeneous complexes and heterogeneous catalysts are expected to advance the usability of atomically precise metal clusters as heterogeneous catalysts for important bond constructions in homogeneous systems.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Aqueous Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Cost Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water molecules trapped in carcerand&#8208;like networks lead to quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes, which are compatible with alkali metals with no gas evolution, high Coulombic efficiency of over 99%, and low cost. This work paves innovative ways for water&#8208;based, low&#8208;cost, sustainable batteries, and beyond.









Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes are highly important for batteries due to their sustainability, greenness, and low cost. However, the free water molecules react violently with alkali metals, rendering the high&#8208;capacity of alkali&#8208;metal anodes unusable. Here, water molecules are confined in a carcerand&#8208;like network to build quasi&#8208;solid aqueous electrolytes (QAEs) with reduced water molecules' freedom and matched with the low&#8208;cost chloride salts. The formed QAEs possess substantially different properties than liquid water molecules, including stable operation with alkali&#8208;metal anodes without gas evolution. Specifically, the alkali&#8208;metal anodes can directly cycle in a water&#8208;based environment with suppressed growth of dendrites, electrode dissolution, and polysulfide shuttle. Li&#8208;metal symmetric cells achieved long&#8208;term cycling over 7000&#160;h (and over 5000/4000&#160;h for Na/K symmetric cells), and all the Cu&#8208;based alkali&#8208;metal cells exhibited a Coulombic efficiency of over 99%. Full metal batteries, such as Li||S batteries, attained high Coulombic efficiency, long life (over 4000 cycles), and unprecedented energy density among water&#8208;based rechargeable batteries.

Abstract
With the promotion of nanochemistry research, large numbers of nanomaterials have been applied in vivo to produce desirable cytotoxic substances in response to endogenous or exogenous stimuli for achieving disease&#8208;specific therapy. However, the performance of nanomaterials is a critical issue that is difficult to improve and optimize under biological conditions. The defective engineered nanoparticles have become the most researched hot materials in biomedical applications recently due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as optical properties and redox reaction capabilities. Importantly, the properties of nanomaterials can be easily adjusted by regulating the type and concentration of defects in the nanoparticles without requiring other complex designs. Therefore, this tutorial review focuses on biomedical defect engineering and briefly discusses defect classification, introduction strategies, and characterization techniques. Several representative defective nanomaterials are especially discussed in order to reveal the relationship between defects and properties. A series of disease treatment strategies based on defective engineered nanomaterials are summarized. By summarizing the design and application of defective engineered nanomaterials, we hope to provide a simple but effective methodology for researchers to design and improve the therapeutic effects of nanomaterial&#8208;based therapeutic platforms from a materials science perspective.

         <title>Shaping Synthetic Multicellular and Complex Multimaterial Tissues via Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing of Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro&#8208; and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck towards creating physiologically&#8208;relevant models. Addressing this limitation, we introduced a novel technique, termed Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion&#8208;bioprinting and layer&#8208;less, ultra&#8208;fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing to spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light&#8208;responsive microgels were developed for the first time as bioresins (&#956;Resins) for light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self&#8208;organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin&#8208;based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. &#956;Resins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimetre&#8208;scale, granular hydrogel&#8208;based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EmVP was applied to create complex synthetic biology&#8208;inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic&#8208;engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with biological functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.

         <title>Engineering the Structural Uniformity of Gel Polymer Electrolytes via Pattern&#8208;guided Alignment for Durable, Safe Solid&#8208;state Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultrathin and super&#8208;toughness gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are the key enabling technology for durable, safe, and high&#8208;energy density solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) but extremely challenging. However, GPEs with limited uniformity and continuity exhibit an uneven Li+ flux distribution, leading to nonuniform deposition. Herein, a fiber patterning strategy for developing and engineering ultrathin (16&#160;&#956;m) fibrous GPEs with high ionic conductivity (&#8764; 0.4 mS cm&#8722;1) and superior mechanical toughness (&#8764; 613%) for durable and safe SSLMBs was proposed. The special patterned structure provides fast Li+ transport channels and tailoring solvation structure of traditional LiPF6&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and uniform Li+ flux, and boosting stability against Li anodes, thus realizing ultralong Li platting/stripping in the symmetrical cell over 3000&#160;h at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the SSLMBs with high LiFePO4 loading of 10.58&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 deliver ultralong stable cycling life over 1570 cycles at 1.0 C with 92.5% capacity retention and excellent rate capacity of 129.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.2&#160;V (100% DOD). Patterned GPEs systems are powerful strategies for producing durable and safe SSLMBs.

         <title>Magnetically Actuated Fiber&#8208;Based Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Broad adoption of magnetic soft robotics is hampered by the sophisticated field paradigms for their manipulation and the complexities in controlling multiple devices. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput fabrication of such devices across spatial scales remains challenging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broad adoption of magnetic soft robotics is hampered by the sophisticated field paradigms for their manipulation and the complexities in controlling multiple devices. Furthermore, high-throughput fabrication of such devices across spatial scales remains challenging. Here advances in fiber-based actuators and magnetic elastomer composites are leveraged to create three-dimensional magnetic soft robots controlled by unidirectional fields. Thermally drawn elastomeric fibers are instrumented with a magnetic composite synthesized to withstand strains exceeding 600%. A combination of strain and magnetization engineering in these fibers enables programming of three-dimensional robots capable of crawling or walking in magnetic fields orthogonal to the plane of motion. Magnetic robots act as cargo carriers, and multiple robots can be controlled simultaneously and in opposing directions using a single stationary electromagnet. The scalable approach to fabrication and control of magnetic soft robots invites their future applications in constrained environments where complex fields cannot be readily deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dendritic Solid Polymer Electrolytes: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;ions battery has been widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve the energy density. Therefore, Li&#8208;ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in the battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. At the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.

         <title>Enhanced free radical generation on MoS2/Pt by light and water vapor co&#8208;activation for selective CO detection with high sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;based gas sensors hold great promise for effective CO detection. However, boosting sensor response and selectivity remains a key priority in moist conditions. In this study, w e developed a composite material, Pt quantum dots (QDs) decorated MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2/Pt), as a highly sensitive material for CO detection when facilitated with visible light. The MoS2/Pt sensor showed significantly improved response (87.4%) with impressive response/recovery kinetics (20 s/17 s), long&#8208;term stability (60 days), and good selectivity to CO at high humidity (&#8764;60%). It has been confirmed both experimentally and theoretically that the MoS2/Pt surface lowers the activation energy to convert CO to CO2 via the free radicals induced by the synergy of photochemical effects and water vapor. As a result, the MoS2/Pt surface promotes both CO response and selectivity, providing fundamental clues to improve room temperature semiconductor&#8208;based sensors for gas detection under extreme conditions.

         <title>Chiral MOF derived wearable logic sensor for intuitive discrimination of physiologically active enantiomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chiral sensors have attracted growing interests due to their potential application in health monitoring. However, rational design of wearable logic chiral sensors remains a great challenge. In this work, a dual responsive chiral sensor RT@CDMOF is prepared through in situ self&#8208;assembly of chiral &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework (CDMOF), rhodamine 6G hydrazide (RGH) and tetracyanovinylindane (TCN). The embedded RGH and TCN inherit the chirality of host CDMOF, producing dual stimuli&#8208;responsive changes both in fluorescence and reflectance. RT@CDMOF is explored as a dual channel sensor for chiral discrimination of lactate enantiomers visually. Time&#8208;dependent in situ FTIR, QCM and DFT calculations reveal the chiral H&#8208;bonding recognition process, and the subsequent carboxylate dissociation is confirmed by EIS, solid&#8208;state and solution 1H NMR. A flexible membrane sensor is successfully fabricated based on RT@CDMOF for wearable health monitoring. On&#8208;body practical evaluation confirms the promising potential of fabricated membrane sensor in point&#8208;of&#8208;care health monitoring by indexing the exercise intensity. Based on the chiral sensing features, a chiral IMPLICATION logic unit could be successfully achieved, demonstrating the promising potential of RT@CDMOF in design and assembly of novel smart devices. This work may open a new avenue to the rational design of logic chiral sensors for wearable health monitoring applications.

         <title>Polarization Switching and Correlated Phase Transitions in Fluorite&#8208;Structure ZrO2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) enables visualization of oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among multiple metastable phases in ZrO2 nanocrystals. Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions among O/M/T phases.








Abstract
Unconventional ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structure oxides enables tremendous opportunities in nanoelectronics owing to their superior scalability and silicon compatibility. However, their polarization order and switching process remain elusive due to the challenges of visualizing oxygen ions in nanocrystalline films. In this work, the oxygen shifting during polarization switching and correlated polar&#8211;nonpolar phase transitions are directly captured among multiple metastable phases in freestanding ZrO2 thin films by low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM). Bidirectional transitions between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric orders and interfacial polarization relaxation are clarified at unit&#8208;cell scale. Meanwhile, polarization switching is strongly correlated with Zr&#8211;O displacement in reversible martensitic transformation between monoclinic and orthorhombic phases and two&#8208;step tetrahedral&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition. These findings provide atomic insights into the transition pathways between metastable polymorphs and unravel the evolution of polarization orders in (anti)ferroelectric fluorite oxides.

         <title>Synchronous Interventions of Glucose and Mitochondrial Metabolisms for Antitumor Bioenergetic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycopolymer containing a caged hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen peroxide dual&#8208;donor is synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase for synchronous interventions of glucose and mitochondrial metabolisms of tumors.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;based mitochondrial bioenergetic intervention is an attractive therapeutic modality. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited owing to metabolic plasticity, which allows tumors to shift their metabolic phenotype between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis for energy compensation. To overcome this flexibility, a glycopolymer containing a caged H2S and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dual&#8208;donor (1&#8208;thio&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose [thioglucose]) is synthesized to wrap glucose oxidase (GOx) for complete depletion of tumorigenic energy sources. The loaded GOx catalyzes the glutathione&#8208;activated thioglucose to generate cytotoxic H2S/H2O2, which further induces synergistic defects in mitochondrial function by suppressing cytochrome&#160;c oxidase expression and damaging the mitochondrial membrane potential. GOx also blocks glycolysis by depleting endogenous glucose. This synchronous intervention strategy exhibits good anticancer performance, broadening the horizon of antitumor bioenergetic therapy.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Depolymerizable &#948;&#8208;Lactone Based Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerizable vitrimers are developed through a one&#8208;pot synthesis approach. The low&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature polymer from the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the biobased &#948;&#8208;lactone is cross&#8208;linked with dynamic acetal linkages. The cross&#8208;linked vitrimer allows reprocessing and healing and can easily depolymerize back to monomers for closed&#8208;loop recycling. These vitrimers exhibit excellent properties, making them a biobased and sustainable replacement for conventional soft elastomers.








Abstract
A depolymerizable vitrimer that allows both reprocessability and monomer recovery by a simple and scalable one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step synthesis of vitrimers from cyclic lactones is reported. Biobased &#948;&#8208;valerolactone with alkyl substituents (&#948;&#8208;lactone) has low ceiling temperature; thus, their ring&#8208;opening&#8208;polymerized aliphatic polyesters are capable of depolymerizing back to monomers. In this work, the amorphous poly(&#948;&#8208;lactone) is solidified into an elastomer (i.e., &#948;&#8208;lactone vitrimer) by a vinyl ether cross&#8208;linker with dynamic acetal linkages, giving the merits of reprocessing and healing. Thermolysis of the bulk &#948;&#8208;lactone vitrimer at 200&#160;&#176;C can recover 85&#8211;90&#160;wt% of the material, allowing reuse without losing value and achieving a successful closed&#8208;loop life cycle. It further demonstrates that the new vitrimer has excellent properties, with the potential to serve as a biobased and sustainable replacement of conventional soft elastomers for various applications such as lenses, mold materials, soft robots, and microfluidic devices.

         <title>Quantum Dots Facilitate 3D Two&#8208;Photon Laser Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D two&#8208;photon laser lithography is considered a disruptive nanostructuring technology in many fields. However, enhancing the printing resolution and developing new printing materials are still in much demand. In this work, a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this situation, by incorporating chemically modified quantum dots, is presented, showing superb performance improvement. The resolution enhancement mechanism is then further elucidated.








Abstract
In the past two decades, direct laser writing (DLW) technologies have seen tremendous growth. However, strategies that enhance the printing resolution and the development of printing material with assorted functionalities are still sparser than expected. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective method to tackle this bottleneck is presented. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are selected to carry out this task, most importantly via surface chemistry modification to enable their copolymerization with themonomers, resulting in transparent composites. The evaluations indicate that the QDs show great colloidal stability and their photoluminescent properties are well&#8208;preserved. This allows further exploration of the printing characteristics of such composite material. It is shown that in the presence of the QDs, the material provides a much lower polymerization threshold with faster linewidth growth, indicating that the QDs form a synergetic relationship with the monomer and the photoinitiator, widening the dynamic range of the material and thus increasing the writing efficiency for broader fields of applications. Lowering the polymerization threshold reduces the minimum achievable feature size by &#8776;32%, which is well&#8208;matched with STED&#8208;based (i.e., stimulated&#8208;emission depletion microscopy) methods in writing 3D structures. The study further elucidates the mechanism of the synergetic behavior, further guiding the future development of functional materials for DLW&#8208;related printing technologies.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Multiplexed Meta&#8208;Differentiator for Tri&#8208;Mode Surface Morphology Observation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optical multiplexed differentiator with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures is reported. Experiments with Gaussian beams and biological specimens showcase its excellent computation performance and versatility of simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning. The approach provides a new route toward ultra&#8208;integration and multifunctionality of all&#8208;optical computing devices and the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator can find applications in various real&#8208;world scenarios.








Abstract
Current optical differentiators are generally limited to realizing a single differential function once fabricated. Herein, a minimalist strategy in designing multiplexed differentiators (1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations), implemented with a Malus metasurface consisting of single&#8208;sized nanostructures is proposed, thus improving the functionality of optical computing devices without the cost of complex design and nanofabrication. It is found that the proposed meta&#8208;differentiator exhibits excellent differential&#8208;computation performance and can be used for simultaneous outline detection and edge positioning of objects, corresponding to the functions of the 1st&#8208; and 2nd&#8208;order differentiations respectively. Experiments with biological specimens showcase that boundaries of biological tissues can not only be identified, but also the edge information for realizing high&#8208;precision edge positioning is highlighted. The study provides a paradigm in designing all&#8208;optical multiplexed computing meta&#8208;devices, and initiates tri&#8208;mode surface morphology observation by combining meta&#8208;differentiator with optical microscopes, which can find their applications in advanced biological imaging, large&#8208;scale defect detection, and high&#8208;speed pattern recognition, etc.

         <title>Remote Water&#8208;to&#8208;Air Eavesdropping with a Phase&#8208;Engineered Impedance Matching Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;engineered impedance matching metasurface is designed and experimentally demonstrated that serves as an &#8220;acoustic bridge&#8221; linking water and air nearly perfectly and enables remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping with extreme enhancement in sensitivity. This metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness opens an avenue to communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces.








Abstract
Efficiently receiving underwater sound remotely from air is a long&#8208;standing challenge in acoustics hindered by the large impedance mismatch at the water&#8211;air interface. Here, a phase&#8208;engineered water&#8211;air impedance matching metasurface is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for remote and efficient water&#8208;to&#8208;air eavesdropping. The judiciously designed metasurface with near&#8208;unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness is capable of making the water&#8211;air interface acoustically transparent and, at the same time, freewheelingly patterning the transmitted wavefront. This enables efficient control over the effective spatial location of a distant airborne sensor such that it can measure underwater signals with large signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios as if placed close to the physical underwater source. Such airborne eavesdropping of underwater sound is experimentally demonstrated with a measured sensitivity enhancement of nearly 104 at 8&#160;kHz, far from achievable with the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. Moreover, the opportunities of using the proposed metasurface for cross&#8208;media orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum&#8208;multiplexed communication and underwater acoustic window are also demonstrated. This metasurface opens new avenues for communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces, which may be translated to nano&#8208;optics and radio frequencies.

         <title>Bioadhesives with Antimicrobial Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties enable easier and safer treatment of wounds as compared to the traditional methods such as suturing and stapling on a variety of medical conditions. Composed of natural or synthetic polymers, these bioadhesives seal wounds and facilitate healing while preventing infections through the activity of locally released antimicrobial drugs, nanocomponents or inherently antimicrobial polymers. Although many different materials and strategies are employed to develop antimicrobial bioadhesives, the design of these biomaterials necessitates a prudent approach as achieving all the required properties including optimal adhesive and cohesive properties, biocompatibility, and antimicrobial activity can be challenging. Designing antimicrobial bioadhesives with tunable physical, chemical and biological properties will shed light on the path for future advancement of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties. In this review, we discuss the requirements and commonly used strategies for developing bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties. In particular, we will summarize different methods for their synthesis and will review their experimental and clinical applications on a variety of organs. Advances in the design of bioadhesives with antimicrobial properties will pave the way for a better management of wounds to increase positive medical outcomes.

         <title>Multistable Metafluid Based Energy Harvesting and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The thermodynamic properties of fluids play a crucial role in many engineering applications, particularly in the context of energy. Fluids with multistable thermodynamic properties may offer new paths for harvesting and storing energy via transitions between equilibria states. Such artificial multistable fluids can be created using the approach employed in metamaterials, which controls macro&#8208;properties through micro&#8208;structure composition. In this work, the dynamics of such &#8216;metafluids&#8217; is examined for a configuration of calorically&#8208;perfect compressible gas contained within multistable elastic capsules flowing in a fluid&#8208;filled tube. We&#160;study both analytically and experimentally the velocity&#8208;, pressure&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;fields of multistable compressible metafluids, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. We&#160;first examine the dynamics of a single capsule, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces. We&#160;then study the interaction and motion of multiple capsules within a fluid&#8208;filled tube. We&#160;show that such a system can be used to harvest energy from external temperature variations in either time or space. Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.

Fluids with multistable thermodynamic properties may offer new paths for harvesting and storing energy via transitions between equilibria states. Such artificial multistable fluids can be created using the approach employed in metamaterials, which controls macro-properties through micro-structure composition. In this work, the dynamics of such &#8216;metafluids&#8217; is examined for a configuration of calorically-perfect compressible gas contained within multistable elastic capsules flowing in a fluid-filled tube. We&#160;study both analytically and experimentally the velocity-, pressure-, and temperature-fields of multistable compressible metafluids, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. We&#160;first examine the dynamics of a single capsule, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The founding objective of structural DNA nanoscience is demonstrated by using self&#8208;assembled DNA scaffolds for the structure determination of biomolecules by X&#8208;ray diffraction. A structural library of 32 metal&#8208;mediated DNA base pairs (mmDNA) with Ag+, Hg2+, and Au+is assembled and the fundamental design rules for an expanded mmDNA coding system further elucidated, toward the development of molecular electronics and designer nanomaterials.








Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs are constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials is impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination is explored. The tensegrity triangle is employed to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. Two binding modes are uncovered: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations show additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive and Mechano&#8208;Actuated Biomimetic Membrane Nanopores Self&#8208;Assembled from DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic nanopores of complex function&#160;are built with DNA nanotechnology. The pores undergo dynamic changes in shape and can be locked in an open state by specific binding of DNA and protein stimuli, and close at high transmembrane potentials. The pores may be used in biosensing and synthetic biology.








Abstract
In bioinspired design, biological templates are mimicked in structure and function by highly controllable synthetic means. Of interest are static barrel&#8208;like nanopores that enable molecular transport across membranes for use in biosensing, sequencing, and biotechnology. However, biological ion channels offer additional functions such as dynamic changes of the entire pore shape between open and closed states, and triggering of dynamic processes with biochemical and physical stimuli. To better capture this complexity, this report presents multi&#8208;stimuli and mechano&#8208;responsive biomimetic nanopores which are created with DNA nanotechnology. The nanopores switch between open and closed states, whereby specific binding of DNA and protein molecules as stimuli locks the pores in the open state. Furthermore, the physical stimulus of high transmembrane voltage switches the pores into a closed state. In addition, the pore diameters are larger and more tunable than those of natural templates. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive and mechanically actuated nanopores mimic several aspects of complex biological channels yet offer easier control over pore size, shape and stimulus response. The designer pores are expected to be applied in biosensing and synthetic biology.

         <title>Shift&#8208;Current Photovoltaics Based on a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Phase in In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectric SnS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;centrosymmetric layer stacking phase of 2D tin sulfide (SnS) is successfully achieved on van der Waals substrates and the shift current in SnS is demonstrated. Following the PFM observation that reveals the existence of ferroelectric domains, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary is proposed.








Abstract
The shift&#8208;current photovoltaics of group&#8208;IV monochalcogenides has been predicted to be comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si&#8208;based solar cells. However, its exploration has been prevented from the centrosymmetric layer stacking in the thermodynamically stable bulk crystal. Herein, the non&#8208;centrosymmetric layer stacking of tin sulfide (SnS) is stabilized in the bottom regions of SnS crystals grown on a van der Waals substrate by physical vapor deposition and the shift current of SnS, by combining the polarization angle dependence and circular photogalvanic effect, is demonstrated. Furthermore, 180&#176; ferroelectric domains in SnS are verified through both piezoresponse force microscopy and shift&#8208;current mapping techniques. Based on these results, an atomic model of the ferroelectric domain boundary is proposed. The direct observation of shift current and ferroelectric domains reported herein paves a new path for future studies on shift&#8208;current photovoltaics.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping of Halide Perovskites by Noble Metal Interstitial Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over doping of novel halide perovskite semiconductors has been a challenging research area, mainly due to the inability to directly measure and characterize defects. In this work, experimental and theoretical methods are combined to make a compelling case for the controlled, electrochemical formation of noble metal interstitial defects in halide perovskite materials, and their impact on n&#8208;type doping and optoelectronic properties is demonstrated.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are an attractive class of semiconductors, but it has proven difficult to control their electronic doping by conventional strategies due to screening and compensation by mobile ions or ionic defects. Noble&#8208;metal interstitials represent an under&#8208;studied class of extrinsic defects that plausibly influence many perovskite&#8208;based devices. In this work, doping of metal halide perovskites is studied by electrochemically formed Au+ interstitial ions, combining experimental data on devices with a computational analysis of Au+ interstitial defects based on density functional theory (DFT). Analysis suggests that Au+ cations can be easily formed and migrate through the perovskite bulk via the same sites as iodine interstitials (Ii+). However, whereas Ii+ compensates n&#8208;type doping by electron capture, the noble&#8208;metal interstitials act as quasi&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Experimentally, voltage&#8208;dependent, dynamic doping by current density&#8211;time (J&#8211;t), electrochemical impedance, and photoluminescence measurements are characterized. These results provide deeper insight into the potential beneficial and detrimental impacts of metal electrode reactions on long&#8208;term performance of perovskite photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diodes, as well as offer an alternative doping explanation for the valence switching mechanism of halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based neuromorphic and memristive devices.

In this work, an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is engineered to obtain the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY), combining with a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor to form a gas/phototheranostics. This gas/phototheranostics that combines gas therapy with low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy executes the therapeutic mechanism of enhanced cell apoptosis for osteosarcoma, simultaneously, achieving an atraumatic therapeutic process.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has received increasing interest in cancer therapeutics owing to its excellent efficacy and controllability. However, there are two major limitations in PTT applications, which are the tissue penetration depth of lasers within the absorption range of photothermal agents and the unavoidable tissue empyrosis induced by high&#8208;energy lasers. Herein, a gas/phototheranostic nanocomposite (NA1020&#8208;NO@PLX) is engineered that integrates the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY,NA1020) with the thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine, SNAP). An enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is proposed to achieve the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak absorbance (&#955;max = 1020&#160;nm) on NA1020, thereby obtaining its deep tissue penetration depth. The NA1020 exhibits a remarkable photothermal conversion, making it feasible for the deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy and providing favorable NIR&#8208;II emission to precisely pinpoint the tumor for a visible PTT process. The simultaneously investigated atraumatic therapeutic process with an enhanced cell apoptosis mechanism indicates the feasibility of the synergistic NO/low&#8208;temperature PTT for osteosarcoma. Herein, this gas/phototheranostic strategy optimizes the existing PTT to present a repeatable and atraumatic photothermal therapeutic process for deep&#8208;tissue tumors, validating its potential clinical applications.

         <title>Mobile Kink Solitons in a Van der Waals Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Wave Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mobile solitons are discovered in a van der Waals material as kinks and antikinks along domain walls in the 2D layer with spontaneously broken symmetry. The mobility, electronic states, and topology of kink solitons are elucidated, which makes the application of solitons in van der Waals electronic materials promising.








Abstract
Kinks, point&#8208;like geometrical defects along dislocations, domain walls, and DNA, are stable and mobile, as solutions of a sine&#8208;Gordon wave equation. While they are widely investigated for crystal deformations and domain wall motions, electronic properties of individual kinks have received little attention. In this work, electronically and topologically distinct kinks are discovered along electronic domain walls in a correlated van der Waals insulator of 1T&#8208;TaS2. Mobile kinks and antikinks are identified as trapped by pinning defects and imaged in scanning tunneling microscopy. Their atomic structures and in&#8208;gap electronic states are unveiled, which are mapped approximately into Su&#8211;Schrieffer&#8211;Heeger solitons. The twelvefold degeneracy of the domain walls in the present system guarantees an extraordinarily large number of distinct kinks and antikinks to emerge. Such large degeneracy together with the robust geometrical nature may be useful for handling multilevel information in van der Waals materials&#160;architectures.

         <title>Interfacial Passivation Enormously Enhances Electroluminescence of Triphenylphosphine Cu4I4 Cube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Defect is one of the key factors limiting optoelectronic performances of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems. Although high&#8208;efficiency bidentate ligands based electroluminescent (EL) clusters reported, until present, only few EL clusters based on monodentate ligands were realized, since their structural unstability induces more surface/interface defects. Herein, this bottleneck is firstly overcome in virtue of interfacial passivation by electron transporting layers (ETL). Through using TmPyPB with meta&#8208;linked pyridines as ETL, photoluminescent (PL) and EL quantum efficiencies of the simplest monophosphine Cu4I4 cube [TPP]4Cu4I4 are greatly improved by &#8764;2 and 23 folds, respectively, as well as about 200 folds increased luminance, corresponding to a huge leap from nearly unlighted (&lt; 20 nits) to highly bright (&gt; 3000 nits). The passivation effect of TmPyPB on surface defects of cluster layer is embodied as preventing interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation.

         <title>Engineering Functionalized 2D Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks Nanosheets with Fast Li+ Conduction for Advanced Solid Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries can ensure high energy density and safety in lithium metal batteries, while polymer electrolytes are plagued by slow ion kinetics and low selective transport of Li+. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as emerging fillers for solid&#8208;state poly(ethyleneoxide)(PEO) electrolytes, however, developing functionalized MOFs and understanding their roles on ion transfer has proven challenging. Herein, combining computional and experimental results, we revealed functional group regulation in MOFs can effectively change surfacial charge distribution and limit anion movement, providing a potential solution to these issues. Specificlly, functionalized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOF sheets have been designed through molecular engineering to construct high&#8208;performance composite electrolytes, where the electron&#8208;donating effect of substituents in 2D&#8208;MOFs effectively limits the movement of ClO4&#8722; and promotes mechanical properties and ion migration numbers (0.36 up to 0.64) of PEO. As a result, Li/Li cells with composite electrolyte exhibit superior cyclability for 1000&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the solid LiFePO4/Li battery delivers highly reversible capacities of 148.8 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles. These findings highlight a new approach for anion confinement through the use of functional group electronic effects, leading to enhanced ionic conductivity and a feasible direction for high performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Robust sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film for molecular electronics and plasmonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In miniaturized electronic and optoelectronic circuits, molecular tunnel junctions have attracted enormous research interest due to their small footprint, low power consumption, and rich molecular functions. However, the most popular building blocks used in contemporary molecular tunnel junctions are thiol molecules, which attach to electrode surfaces via a metal&#8208;thiolate (M&#8208;S) bond, showing low stability and usually quick degradation within several days. To pave the way for more widely applicable and stable molecular tunnel junctions, there is a need to develop new molecular anchoring groups. Here, we&#160;demonstrate robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunnelling barrier, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#8208;C bond. The bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions exhibit high thermal stability against heating up to 200&#176;C and long storage lifetime over 5 months in an ambient environment. Both electrical and optical performance of these bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular junctions were&#160;characterized systematically, showing similar behaviours to thiol&#8208;based junctions as well as largely improved emission stability. This research highlights the excellent performance of bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions, which could&#160;be useful for applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.

However, the most popular building blocks used in contemporary molecular tunnel junctions are thiol molecules, which attach to electrode surfaces via a metal-thiolate (M-S) bond, showing low stability and usually quick degradation within several days. To pave the way for more widely applicable and stable molecular tunnel junctions, there is a need to develop new molecular anchoring groups. Here, we&#160;demonstrate robust and air-stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub-5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)-based thin film as the tunnelling barrier, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au-C bond. The bis(diarylcarbene)-based molecular tunnel junctions exhibit high thermal stability against heating up to 200&#176;C and long storage lifetime over 5 months in an ambient environment.

         <title>Epitaxy of Monocrystalline CsPbBr3&#8208;SrTiO3 Halide&#8208;oxide Perovskite p&#8208;n Heterojunction with High Stability for Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion. Here we epitaxially deposited p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 on n&#8208;type Nb: SrTiO3 (STO) to construct a functional perovskite heterojunction with high stability. The lattice match allowed the epitaxial growth of CsPbBr3 to occur over large scale, resulting in a monocrystalline thin film with excellent crystallinity and uniformity. The highly stable STO prevented the anion migration frequently happening in halide perovskites, forming a sharp interface of two perovskite with opposite conduction type, with which a diode was fabricated and a current rectification ratio of 374 was obtained.

Owing to the all&#8208;inorganic architecture, effective photodetection at temperature as high as 150 &#176;C was guaranteed with D* of &#8764;1.52 &#215; 1013 Jones. Combining the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and the rigidity of oxide perovskite, the epitaxy of CsPbBr3 on Nb: STO opened up a new method to construct functional perovskite heterojunction for optoelectronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion. Here we epitaxially deposited p-type CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on n-type Nb: SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO) to construct a functional perovskite heterojunction with high stability. The lattice match allowed the epitaxial growth of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to occur over large scale, resulting in a monocrystalline thin film with excellent crystallinity and uniformity. The highly stable STO prevented the anion migration frequently happening in halide perovskites, forming a sharp interface of two perovskite with opposite conduction type, with which a diode was fabricated and a current rectification ratio of 374 was obtained. The diode is able to work as a photodiode-type photodetector with low dark current of 2.01 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt; A at &#8722;1&#160;V and high responsivity (R) of 8.26 A/W, rendering a detectivity (D*) of 2.98 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones.

         <title>Isotope Exchange Raman Spectroscopy (IERS): A Novel Technique to Probe Physicochemical Processes in situ</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We&#160;have developed a novel in situ methodology for the direct study of mass transport properties in oxides with spatial and unprecedented time resolution, based on Raman spectroscopy coupled to isothermal isotope exchanges. Changes in the isotope concentration, resulting in a Raman frequency shift, can be followed in real time, not accessible by conventional methods, enabling complementary insights for the study of ion transport properties of electrode and electrolyte materials for advanced solid&#8208;state electrochemical devices.
The proof of concept and strengths of isotope exchange Raman spectroscopy (IERS) are demonstrated by studying the oxygen isotope back&#8208;exchange in gadolinium&#8208;doped ceria (CGO) thin films. Resulting oxygen self&#8208;diffusion and surface exchange coefficients are compared to conventional time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) characterisation and literature values, showing good agreement, while at the same time providing additional insight, challenging established assumptions. IERS captivates through its rapidity, simple setup, non&#8208;destructive nature, cost effectiveness and versatile fields of application and thus can readily be integrated as new standard tool for in situ and operando characterization in many laboratories worldwide. The applicability of this method is expected to consolidate our&#160;understanding of elementary physicochemical processes and impact various emerging fields including solid oxide cells, battery research and&#160;beyond.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Aerogels with Exceptional Mechanical Performance for Thermal Superinsulation at Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogels featuring a &#8220;porous brick and fiber&#8221; architecture are fabricated via in situ nanoscale hetero&#8208;assembly and ambient pressure drying, in which mesoporous minerals are generated in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network. The aerogels integrate challenging requirements of thermal superinsulation, excellent compressive stiffness, superelasticity, high bending flexibility, good impact resistance, and easy scalability for robust thermal management under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Thermal protection under extreme conditions requires materials with excellent thermal insulation properties and exceptional mechanical properties to withstand a variety of complex external stresses. Mesoporous silica aerogels are the most widely used insulation materials due to their ultralow thermal conductivity. However, they still suffer from mechanical fragility and structural instability in practical applications. Herein, a nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite aerogel, synthesized via in situ growth of inorganic minerals in a lamellar cellulose nanofibrous network, is reported. The multiscale structural adaptation of the inorganic&#8211;organic components endows nanocomposite aerogels with rapid configuration recovery during ambient pressure drying. The resulting aerogels show ultralow thermal conductivities (17.4&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 1.0 atm). These aerogels also integrate challenging mechanical properties, including high compressive stiffness to resist deformation under the pressure of an adult, superelasticity to prevent static and dynamic stress cracking even under the crushing of a vehicle (1.6 t), and high bending flexibility to adapt to any surface. Moreover, they exhibit excellent structural stability under fatigue stress/strain cycles over a wide temperature range (&#8722;196 to 200&#160;&#176;C). The combination of high thermal insulation performance and excellent mechanical properties offers a potential material system for robust thermal superinsulation under extreme conditions, especially for aerospace applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich Piezoelectric BiO2&#8722;x Nanosheets for Augmented Piezocatalytic, Sonothermal, and Enzymatic Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheet is developed by a defect engineering strategy to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by lowering the energy gap, and is applied for the synergistic piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies. Density functional theory calculations show that the oxygen vacancies are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic therapy is a new&#8208;emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;enabled therapeutic strategy that relies on built&#8208;in electric field and energy&#8208;band bending of piezoelectric materials activated by ultrasound (US) irradiation. Despite becoming a hot topic, material development and mechanism exploration are still underway. Herein, as&#8208;synthesized oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;x nanosheets (NSs) demonstrate outstanding piezoelectric properties. Under US, a piezo&#8208;potential of 0.25&#160;V for BiO2&#8722;x NSs is sufficient to tilt the conduction band to be more negative than the redox potentials of O2/&#8226;O2&#8722;, &#8226;O2&#8722;/H2O2, and H2O2/&#8226;OH, which initiates a cascade reaction for ROS generation. Moreover, the BiO2&#8722;x NSs exhibit peroxidase and oxidase&#8208;like activities to augment ROS production, especially in the H2O2&#8208;overexpressed tumor microenvironment. Density functional theory calculations show that the generated oxygen vacancies in BiO2&#8722;x NSs are favorable for H2O2&#160;adsorption and increasing the carrier density to produce ROS. Furthermore, the quick movement of electrons enables an excellent sonothermal effect, for example, rapid rise in temperature to nearly 65&#160;&#176;C upon US with low power (1.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and short time (96&#160;s). Therefore, this system realizes a multimode synergistic combination of piezocatalytic, enzymatic, and sonothermal therapies, providing a new direction for defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezoelectric materials for tumor therapy.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Perovskite toward Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Flat&#8208;Panel Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable mechanochemical approach is developed for synthesizing stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite. This method has been utilized to create FAMACs thick&#8208;film&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPD, which boosts exceptional sensitivity, ultralow detection limits, remarkable spatial resolution and superior thermal robustness. This significant advancement has the potential to accelerate the progress of next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors.








Abstract
Perovskites are attracting attention for optoelectronic devices. Despite their promise, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of perovskite materials with exact stoichiometry, especially high&#8208;entropy perovskites, has been a major challenge. Moreover, the difficulty in stoichiometry control also hinders the development of perovskite X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detectors. Previous reports all employed simple MAPbI3 as the active layer, while the performance still falls short of optimized single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based single&#8208;pixel detectors. Herein, a scalable and universal strategy of a mechanochemical method is adopted to synthesize stoichiometric high&#8208;entropy perovskite powders with high quality and high quantity (&gt;1&#160;kg per batch). By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, the first FA0.9MA0.05Cs0.05Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray flat&#8208;panel detector with low trap density and large mobility&#8211;lifetime product (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) is reported. The assembled panel detector exhibits close&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and&#160;ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGyair s&#8722;1), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards. The high performance in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite&#8208;based X&#8208;ray FPDs has the potential to facilitate the development of new&#8208;generation&#160;X&#8208;ray&#8208;detection systems.

&lt;p&gt;Perovskites are attracting attention for optoelectronic devices. Despite their promise, the large-scale synthesis of perovskite materials with exact stoichiometry, especially high-entropy perovskites, has been a major challenge. Moreover, the difficulty in stoichiometry control also hinders the development of perovskite X-ray flat-panel detectors. Previous reports all employed simple MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the active layer, while the performance still falls short of optimized single-crystal-based single-pixel detectors. Herein, a scalable and universal strategy of a mechanochemical method is adopted to synthesize stoichiometric high-entropy perovskite powders with high quality and high quantity (&amp;gt;1&#160;kg per batch). By utilizing these stoichiometric perovskites, the first FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(I&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based X-ray flat-panel detector with low trap density and large mobility&#8211;lifetime product (7.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is reported. The assembled panel detector exhibits close-to-single-crystal performance (high sensitivity of 2.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and&#160;ultralow detection limit of 1.25 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high spatial resolution of 0.46 lp/pixel, as well as excellent thermal robustness under industrial standards. The high performance in the high-entropy perovskite-based X-ray FPDs has the potential to facilitate the development of new-generation&#160;X-ray-detection systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Molecular Fingerprint Retrieval Using Strongly Detuned Overcoupled Plasmonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel modulation&#8208;free plasmonic nanoantenna design strategy based on loss engineering is proposed. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. With the aid of machine learning, the absorption fingerprints of various molecules are successfully detected and distinguished.








Abstract
Tailoring light&#8208;matter interactions via plasmonic nanoantennas (PNAs) has emerged as a breakthrough technology for spectroscopic applications. The detuning between molecular vibrations and plasmonic resonances, as a fundamental and inevitable optical phenomenon in light&#8208;matter interactions, reduces the interaction efficiency, resulting in a weak molecule sensing signal at the strong detuning state. Here, it is demonstrated that the low interaction efficiency from detuning can be tackled by overcoupled PNAs (OC&#8208;PNAs) with a high ratio of the radiative to intrinsic loss rates, which can be used for ultrasensitive spectroscopy at strong plasmonic&#8208;molecular detuning. In OC&#8208;PNAs, the ultrasensitive molecule signals are achieved within a wavelength detuning range of 248&#160;cm&#8722;1, which is 173&#160;cm&#8722;1 wider than previous works. Meanwhile, the OC&#8208;PNAs are immune to the distortion of molecular signals and maintain a lineshape consistent with the molecular signature fingerprint. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, 13 kinds of molecules with some vibration fingerprints strongly detuning by the OC&#8208;PNAs are identified with 100% accuracy with the assistance of machine&#8208;learning algorithms. This work gains new insights into detuning&#8208;state nanophotonics for potential applications including spectroscopy and sensors.

         <title>Modulating Oxygen Vacancies in Lead Chromate for&#160;Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using lead chromate (PbCrO4) as a prototype, oxygen vacancies are found to introduce shallow energy levels, and deep energy levels are identified. More surface oxygen vacancies induces the formation of deeper surface trapped states to enhance charge separation and introduce more low&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated Cr centers to boost water oxidation activity.








Abstract
Although modulating oxygen vacancies in semiconductors has attracted broad interest in photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, identifying the intrinsic roles of oxygen vacancies on photoelectrocatalytic properties is often elusive. In this work, the oxygen vacancies in a typical semiconductor lead chromate (PbCrO4) are regulated via controlling the oxygen chemical potentials of O&#8208;poor and O&#8208;rich post&#8208;annealing atmospheres. Oxygen vacancies identified in PbCrO4 can introduce electronically shallow energy levels and deep energy levels owing to the symmetry difference of oxygen atoms in the structure. A higher population of deep energy levels created under O&#8208;poor atmosphere induces the formation of more surface trapped states, resulting in a higher photovoltage for charge separation. Meanwhile, the existence of surface trapped states can significantly improve the charge injection efficiency of the PbCrO4 photoanode and enhance the water oxidation activity. By modulating oxygen vacancies in the PbCrO4 photoanode, a photocurrent density of 3.43&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated AM1.5G is acheived. Further passivation of surface trapped states and introducing the water oxidation cocatalyst CoPi lead to a record applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 1.12%. This work provides a guide to understand the mechanism of oxygen vacancies in oxide&#8208;based semiconductor photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis.

         <title>Design of Fluoro&#8208;Free Surfaces Super&#8208;Repellent to Low&#8208;Surface&#8208;Tension Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widespread use of perfluoroalkyls for super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces is environmentally unsustainable, motivating the exploration of fluoro&#8208;free alternatives. In this work, the concept of liquid&#8208;centric design and the revised limits for using fluoro&#8208;free materials (hydrocarbons and silicones) in achieving super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids is demonstrated. Scale bar in image: 1 mm. 








Abstract
Super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces feature high liquid contact angles and low sliding angles find key applications in anti&#8208;fouling and self&#8208;cleaning. While repellency for water is easily achieved with hydrocarbon functionalities, repellency for many low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (down to 30 mN&#160;m&#8722;1) still requires perfluoroalkyls (a persistent environmental pollutant and bioaccumulation hazard). Here, the scalable room&#8208;temperature synthesis of stochastic nanoparticle surfaces with fluoro&#8208;free moieties is investigated. Silicone (dimethyl and monomethyl) and hydrocarbon surface chemistries are benchmarked against perfluoroalkyls, assessed using model low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (ethanol&#8211;water mixtures). It is discovered that both hydrocarbon&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;silicone&#8208;based functionalization can achieve super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency down to 40&#8211;41 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 and 32&#8211;33 mN&#160;m&#8722;1, respectively (vs&#160;27&#8211;32 mN&#160;m&#8722;1 for perfluoroalkyls). The dimethyl silicone variant demonstrates superior fluoro&#8208;free liquid repellency likely due to its denser dimethyl molecular configuration. It is shown that perfluoroalkyls are not necessary for many real&#8208;world scenarios requiring super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency. Effective super&#8208;repellency of different surface chemistries against different liquids can be adequately predicted using empirically verified phase diagrams. These findings encourage a liquid&#8208;centric design, i.e., tailoring surfaces for target liquid properties. Herein, key guidelines are provided for achieving functional yet sustainably designed super&#8208;liquid&#8208;repellency.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Energy Transfer between Dye&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles: Observation and Amplified Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operating range of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5 nm. A study of dye&#8208;loaded fluorescent polymeric nanoparticles connected by DNA duplexes of different lengths reveals efficient energy transfer far beyond the F&#246;rster radius, following a power&#8208;four distance dependence. This phenomenon is applied for amplified detection of a target nucleic acid with attomole sensitivity.








Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is essential in optical materials for light&#8208;harvesting, photovoltaics, and biosensing, but its operating range is fundamentally limited by the F&#246;rster radius of &#8776;5&#160;nm. In this work, FRET between fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) is studied in order to break this limit. The donor and acceptor NPs are built from charged hydrophobic polymers loaded with cationic dyes and bulky hydrophobic counterions. Their surface is functionalized with DNA in order to control surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface distance. It is found that the FRET efficiency does not follow the canonic F&#246;rster law, reaching 0.70 and 0.45 values for NP&#8211;NP distances&#160;of 15 and 20&#160;nm, respectively. This corresponds to the FRET efficiency decay as power four of the surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface NP&#8211;NP distance. Based on this long&#8208;distance FRET, a DNA nanoprobe is developed, where a target DNA fragment, encoding the cancer marker survivin, bringing together donor and acceptor NPs at &#8776;15&#160;nm distance. In this nanoprobe, a single&#8208;molecular recognition results in unprecedented color switch for &gt;5000 dyes, yielding a simple and fast assay with 18 attomoles limit of detection. Breaking the F&#246;rster distance limit for ultrabright NPs opens the route to advanced optical nanomaterials for amplified FRET&#8208;based biosensing.

         <title>From Nanoalloy to Nano&#8208;Laminated Interfaces for Highly Stable Alkali&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces is proposed for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes, tailoring the compositions from nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure. The required thicknesses for nanoalloy interfaces differ from Li&#8208; to Na&#8208;metal anodes, and the mechanical stabilities of the interfaces affect electrochemical performances.









Abstract
Metal anodes are considered the holy grail for next&#8208;generation batteries because of their high gravimetric/volumetric specific capacity and low electrochemical potential. However, several unsolved challenges have impeded their practical applications, such as dendrite growth, interfacial side reactions, dead layer formation, and volume change. An electrochemically, chemically, and mechanically stable artificial solid electrolyte interphase&#160;is key to addressing the aforementioned issue with metal anodes. This study demonstrates a new concept of organic and inorganic hybrid interfaces for both Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes. Through tailoring the compositions of the hybrid interfaces, a nanoalloy structure to nano&#8208;laminated structure is realized. As a result, the nanoalloy interface (1Al2O3&#8211;1alucone or 2Al2O3&#8211;2alucone) presents the most stable electrochemical performances for both Li&#8208;and Na&#8208;metal anodes. The optimized thicknesses required for the nanoalloy interfaces for Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;metal anodes are different. A cohesive zone model is applied to interpret the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the influence of the mechanical stabilities of the different interfaces on the electrochemical performances is investigated experimentally and theoretically. This approach provides a fundamental understanding and establishes the bridge between mechanical properties and electrochemical performance for alkali&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Organic Sonodynamic Materials for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has been a promising non&#8208;invasive therapeutic modality to treat deep&#8208;seated tumors owing to the good tissue penetration ability and spatiotemporal controllability of ultrasound (US); however, the low sonodynamic activity and potential side effects greatly limit its clinical translation. Cancer immunotherapy that leverages the immune system to fight against cancer has great potential to synergize with SDT for the treatment of cancer with high efficiency and safety. In this review, we discuss the convergence of SDT with cancer immunotherapy to exert their merits and break through the limitations of combination cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy. We focus on the development and construction of organic materials with high sonodynamic activity and immunotherapeutic efficiency. These organic materials not only induce immunogenic cell death to improve tumor immunogenicity via SDT but also activate antitumor immunity via immuno&#8208;oncology drug&#8208;mediated immune pathway modulation. The combination of various immuno&#8208;oncology drugs with organic sonosensitizers is categorized and discussed along with the prospects and challenges for clinical translation.

         <title>Short&#8208;wavelength Infrared Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes from A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8208;A type Small Molecules with Emission Beyond 1100&#160;nm</title>

Abstract
Short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, infrared lighting, optical communication, environmental monitoring and surveillance. Due to an intrinsic limitation posed by the energy&#8208;gap law, achieving high&#8208;brightness in SWIR OLEDs remains a challenge. Herein, we report the use of novel A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8208;A type small molecules NTQ and BTQ for high&#8208;performance SWIR OLEDs. Benefiting from multiple D&#8208;A effect in conjugated skeleton, the small molecules NTQ and BTQ exhibit narrow optical gaps of 1.23&#160;eV and 1.13&#160;eV, respectively. We achieved SWIR electroluminescence (EL) emission from OLEDs based on NTQ and BTQ, with emission peaks at 1140&#160;nm and 1175&#160;nm, respectively. Not only owing to a negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off across the full range of applied current density but also the ability to afford a high operation current density of 5200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ exhibit a maximal radiant exitance of &#8764;1.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the NTQ&#8208;based OLEDs also possess sub&#8208;gap turn&#8208;on voltage of 0.85&#160;V, which is close to the physical limits derived from the generalized Kirchhoff and Planck equation. Our work demonstrates that A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D&#8208;A type small molecules offer significant promise for NIR/SWIR emitting material innovations.

         <title>Targeted Reprogramming of Vitamin B3 Metabolism as a Nanotherapeutic Strategy towards Chemoresistant Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer stem cell (CSC)&#8208;mediated chemoresistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, direct depletion of CAFs may increase cancer invasiveness and metastasis. As a generalized strategy against chemoresistant cancers, we design Gemini&#8208;like homotypic targeting nanoparticles (NPs) for two&#8208;pronged CAF transformation and cancer cell elimination. The CAF&#8208;targeted NPs couple vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming to epigenetic modulation of secreted pro&#8208;stemness and immunosuppressive factors, thereby diminishing CSC and suppressive immune cell populations to enhance cancer cell drug susceptibility and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. In mouse models of breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers that are resistant to their respective first&#8208;line chemotherapeutics, a single dose of hydrogel co&#8208;delivering the Gemini&#8208;like NPs can rehabilitate chemosensitivity, induce immune activation, and achieve tumor regression. Moreover, it stimulates robust T cell memory for long&#8208;term protection against tumor rechallenge. Our study thus represents an innovative approach with broad applicability for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.

         <title>Biofilm Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly Nanoreactors for All&#8208;stage Biofilm Associated Infection through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;like Death and Macrophage Re&#8208;rousing.</title>

Abstract
Bacterial biofilm&#8208;associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H2O2&#8208;rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, we propose a BME&#8208;responsive copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu&#8208;POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re&#8208;rousing for BAI eradication at all stages. The self&#8208;assembly of Cu&#8208;POM in BME converted endogenous H2O2 to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generated a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu&#8208;POM flux. Metabolomics revealed that intracellular Cu&#8208;POM overload restricted the TCA cycle and peroxide accumulation, promoting bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. CDT re&#8208;rousing macrophages scavenge planktonic bacteria escaping biofilm disintegration through enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Overall, BME&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;POM promoted bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death via metabolic interference, while also re&#8208;rousing macrophage immune response for further planktonic bacteria elimination, resulting in all&#8208;stage BAI clearance and providing a new reference for future clinical application.

         <title>Seeded Synthesis of Hollow PdSn Intermetallic Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intermetallic nanomaterials have shown promising potentials as high&#8208;performance catalysts in various catalytic reactions due to their unconventional crystal phases with ordered atomic arrangements. However, controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with tunable crystal phases and unique hollow morphologies remains a challenge. Here, a seeded method is developed to synthesize hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with two different intermetallic phases, i.e., orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2. Benefiting from the rational regulation of the crystal phase and morphology, the obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs deliver excellent electrocatalytic performance towards glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), outperforming solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs, hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 NPs, and commercial Pd/C, which places it among the best reported Pd&#8208;based GOR electrocatalysts. The reaction mechanism of GOR using the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn as the catalyst is investigated by operando infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, which reveals that the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn catalyst cleaves the C&#8208;C bond more easily compared to the commercial Pd/C. Our work could pave an appealing route to the controlled synthesis of diverse novel intermetallic nanomaterials with hollow morphology for various promising applications.

         <title>Unconventional Giant &#8220;Magnetoresistance&#8221; in Bosonic Semiconducting Diamond Nanorings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale &#8220;diamond rings&#8221; provide unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; for the development of new quantum devices. The unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; caused by the trapping of Cooper pairs within the heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond nanorings, distinguishes itself from the conventional giant magnetoresistance originating from spin&#8208;dependent scattering of single electrons in layered magnetic materials.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in doped insulators such as cuprates and pnictides coincides with their doping&#8208;driven insulator&#8211;metal transitions. Above the critical doping threshold, a metallic state sets in at high temperatures, while superconductivity sets in at low temperatures. An unanswered question is whether the formation of Cooper pairsin a well&#8208;established metal will inevitably transform the host material into a superconductor, as manifested by a resistance drop. Here, this question is addressed by investigating the electrical transport in nanoscale rings (full loops) and half loops manufactured from heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond. It is shown that in contrast to the diamond half&#8208;loops (DHLs) exhibiting a metal&#8211;superconductor transition, the diamond nanorings (DNRs) demonstrate a sharp resistance increase up to 430% and a giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; below the superconducting transition temperature of the starting material. The finding of the unconventional giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221;, as distinct from existing categories of magnetoresistance, that is, the conventional giant magnetoresistance&#160;in magnetic multilayers, the colossal magnetoresistance&#160;in perovskites, and the geometric magnetoresistance in semiconductor&#8211;metal hybrids, reveals the transformation of the DNRs from metals to bosonic semiconductors upon the formation of Cooper pairs. DNRs like these could be used to manipulate Cooper pairs in superconducting quantum devices.

         <title>Expanding Embedded 3D Bioprinting Capability for Engineering Complex Organs with Freeform Vascular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro replication of the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures simultaneously remains one of the greatest challenges in the biofabrication field. This study introduces a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT) to address this limitation. Moreover, the SPIRIT technique significantly reduces the printing time compared to conventional bioprinting strategies.








Abstract
Creating functional tissues and organs in vitro on demand is a major goal in biofabrication, but the ability to replicate the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures such as blood vessels simultaneously remains one of the greatest impediments. Here, this limitation is addressed by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). It is demonstrated that this microgel&#8208;based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing behavior. When encapsulating human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cells, the MB bioink is 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enables the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. This SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which will accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.

         <title>Stacking Faults Inducing Oxygen Anion Activities in Li2MnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking faults can promote the properties of materials in Li2MnO3. In this paper, the role and reasons for stacking faults in Li2MnO3&#160;are explored, revealing the importance of the O local environment. It is found that the longer Li&#63743;O bonds and smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles induced by stacking faults promote O activities and Li ion migration.








Abstract
Controllable anionic redox for a transformational increase in the energy density is the pursuit of next generation Li&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Its activation mechanism is coupled with the local coordination environment around O, which posts experimental challenges for control. Here, the tuning capability of anionic redox is shown by varying O local environment via experimentally controlling the density of stacking faults in Li2MnO3, the parent compound of Li&#8208;rich oxides. By combining computational analysis and spectroscopic study, it is quantitatively revealed that more stacking faults can trigger smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles and larger Li&#63743;O bond distance in local Li&#8208;rich environments and subsequently activate oxygen redox reactivity, which in turn enhances the reactivity of Mn upon the following reduction process. This study highlights the critical role of local structure environment in tuning the anionic reactivity, which provides guidance in designing high&#8208;capacity layered cathodes by appropriately adjusting stacking faults.

         <title>Ablation of Gap Junction Protein Improves the Efficiency of Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Catalytic/Starvation/Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
FePGOGA&#160;nanozymes are constructed by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization, and co&#8208;loaded with GOx and Cx43 blockade peptides GAP19. The FePGOGAs exhibit excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently generate ROS and prevent ROS efflux through Cx43 degradation. The good synergistic effects of the catalytic/starvation/mildPTT therapies are confirmed in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor catalytic therapy is typically hindered by gap junction proteins that form cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell channels to remove cytotoxic ROS, thereby protecting tumor cells from oxidative damage. In this work, a multifunctional nanozyme, FePGOGA, is designed and prepared by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization (FeP), followed by glucose oxidase (GOx) and GAP19 peptides co&#8208;loading through electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The FePGOGA nanozyme exhibits excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and glutathione&#8208;oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently catalyze hydrogen peroxide conversion to hydroxyl radicals and convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide. The loaded GOx starves the tumors and aggravates tumor oxidative stress through glucose decomposition, while GAP19 peptides block the hemichannels by inducing degradation of Cx43, thus increasing the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and decreasing the transport of intracellular glucose. Furthermore, the ROS reacts with primary amines of heat shock proteins to destroy their structure and function, enabling tumor photothermal therapy at the widely sought&#8208;after mild temperature (mildPTT, &#8804;45&#160;&#176;C). In vivo experiments demonstrate the significant antitumor effectof FePGOGA on cal27 xenograft tumors under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. This study demonstrates the successful ablation of gap junction proteins to overcome resistance to ROS&#8208;mediated therapy, providing a regulator to suppress tumor self&#8208;preservation during tumor starvation, catalytic therapy, and mildPTT.

The good synergistic effects of the catalytic/starvation/mildPTT therapies are confirmed in vitro and in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated tumor catalytic therapy is typically hindered by gap junction proteins that form cell-to-cell channels to remove cytotoxic ROS, thereby protecting tumor cells from oxidative damage. In this work, a multifunctional nanozyme, FePGOGA, is designed and prepared by Fe(III)-mediated oxidative polymerization (FeP), followed by glucose oxidase (GOx) and GAP19 peptides co-loading through electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The FePGOGA nanozyme exhibits excellent cascade peroxidase- and glutathione-oxidase-like activities that efficiently catalyze hydrogen peroxide conversion to hydroxyl radicals and convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide. The loaded GOx starves the tumors and aggravates tumor oxidative stress through glucose decomposition, while GAP19 peptides block the hemichannels by inducing degradation of Cx43, thus increasing the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and decreasing the transport of intracellular glucose. Furthermore, the ROS reacts with primary amines of heat shock proteins to destroy their structure and function, enabling tumor photothermal therapy at the widely sought-after mild temperature (mildPTT, &#8804;45&#160;&#176;C). In vivo experiments demonstrate the significant antitumor effectof FePGOGA on cal27 xenograft tumors under near-infrared light irradiation. This study demonstrates the successful ablation of gap junction proteins to overcome resistance to ROS-mediated therapy, providing a regulator to suppress tumor self-preservation during tumor starvation, catalytic therapy, and mildPTT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Tailored 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskites for Reconfigurable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive mechanistic study of reconfigurable optoelectronic properties based on a nontrivial library of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites with diamino group ligands by exposing/removing moisture is presented. The key to the moisture&#8208;controlled reconfigurable properties lies in the formation of hydrogen bonding between the diamino group and water molecules, preventing their escape.








Abstract
Humidity&#8208; and moisture&#8208;induced degradation has been a longstanding problem in perovskite materials, affecting their long&#8208;term stability during applications. Counterintuitively, the moisture is leveraged to tailor the reversible hydrochromic behaviors of a new series of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites for reconfigurable optoelectronics. In particular, the hydrogen bonds between organic cations and water molecules can be dynamically modulated via moisture removal/exposure. Remarkably, such modulation confines the movement of the organic cations close to the original position, preventing their escape from crystal lattices. Furthermore, this mechanism is elucidated by theoretical analysis using first&#8208;principles calculations and confirmed with the experimental characterizations. The reversible fluorescent transition 2D DJ perovskites show excellent cyclical properties, presenting untapped opportunities for reconfigurable optoelectronic applications. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting display is shown based on patterned reversible 2D DJ perovskites. The results represent a new avenue of reconfigurable optoelectronic application with 2D DJ perovskites for humidity detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and other emerging photoelectric intelligent technologies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Thin Lithium Silicide Interlayer for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous lithium silicide&#8208;based interlayer, acting as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor, is proposed for high energy and safe all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries using lithium anode. The interlayer not only regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping but also serves as a 3D scaffold for Li ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at solid&#8208;state electrolyte/LiBCC interface.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with metallic lithium (LiBCC) anode and solid electrolyte (SE) are under active development. However, an unstable SE/LiBCC interface due to electrochemical and mechanical instabilities hinders their operation. Herein, an ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC) interlayer (&#8776;3.25 &#181;m), which regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping, serving as a 3D scaffold for Li0 ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at SE/LiBCC interface is demonstrated. Consisting of lithium silicide and carbon nanotubes, the MIEC interlayer is thermodynamically stable against LiBCC and highly lithiophilic. Moreover, its nanopores (&lt;100 nm) confine the deposited LiBCC to the size regime where LiBCC exhibits &#8220;smaller is much softer&#8221; size&#8208;dependent plasticity governed by diffusive deformation mechanisms. The LiBCC thus remains soft enough not to mechanically penetrate SE in contact. Upon further plating, LiBCC grows in between the current collector and the MIEC interlayer, not directly contacting the SE. As a result, a full&#8208;cell having Li3.75Si&#8208;CNT/LiBCC foil as an anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a cathode displays a high specific capacity of 207.8 mAh g&#8722;1, 92.0% initial Coulombic efficiency, 88.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles (Coulombic efficiency reaches 99.9% after tens of cycles), and excellent rate capability (76% at 5 C).

         <title>Monolayer Superconductivity and Tunable Topological Electronic Structure at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45 is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity but the inhomogeneity from doping raises doubts about the existence of Majorana modes. This work explores thin films of FeTe1&#8208;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 that reveal superconductivity at the monolayer limit. Control over the interfacial electronic structure is demonstrated to maintain the spin&#8208;momentum locking necessary for topological superconductivity with significantly less doping.








Abstract
The interface between 2D topological Dirac states and an s&#8208;wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana&#8208;bound states (MBS) that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin&#8208;orbit coupling to achieve spin&#8208;momentum&#8208;locked topological interface states (TIS) which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of MBS have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping make these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here superconductivity is reported in monolayer (ML) FeTe1&#8211;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) directly resolve the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. For y&#160;= 0.25, the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure is found to overlap with the Bi2Te3 TIS and the desired spin&#8208;momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for y&#160;= 0.1, reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin&#8208;momentum locking in the topological states are found. Hence, it is demonstrated that the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing MBS where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

         <title>Controlled Interfacial Polymer Self&#8208;Assembly Coordinates Ultrahigh Drug Loading and Zero&#8208;Order Release in Particles Prepared under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled interfacial polymer self&#8208;assembly enables the engineering of a microparticle that simultaneously features efficient protein and peptide encapsulation (up to 99.9%), ultrahigh mass fraction of therapeutics (up to 49.9%), and zero&#8208;order release of payloads. The developed strategy sets a new paradigm to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological performances of water&#8208;soluble therapeutics.








Abstract
Microparticles are successfully engineered through controlled interfacial self&#8208;assembly of polymers to harmonize ultrahigh drug loading with zero&#8208;order release of protein payloads. To address their poor miscibility with carrier materials, protein molecules are transformed into nanoparticles, whose surfaces are covered with polymer molecules. This polymer layer hinders the transfer of cargo nanoparticles from oil to water, achieving superior encapsulation efficiency (up to 99.9%). To control payload release, the polymer density at the oil&#8211;water interface is enhanced, forming a compact shell for microparticles. The resultant microparticles can harvest up to 49.9% mass fraction of proteins with zero&#8208;order release kinetics in vivo, enabling an efficient glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the precise control of engineering process offered through continuous flow results in high batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and, ultimately, excellent scale&#8208;up feasibility.

&lt;p&gt;A controlled interfacial polymer self-assembly enables the engineering of a microparticle that simultaneously features efficient protein and peptide encapsulation (up to 99.9%), ultrahigh mass fraction of therapeutics (up to 49.9%), and zero-order release of payloads. The developed strategy sets a new paradigm to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological performances of water-soluble therapeutics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microparticles are successfully engineered through controlled interfacial self-assembly of polymers to harmonize ultrahigh drug loading with zero-order release of protein payloads. To address their poor miscibility with carrier materials, protein molecules are transformed into nanoparticles, whose surfaces are covered with polymer molecules. This polymer layer hinders the transfer of cargo nanoparticles from oil to water, achieving superior encapsulation efficiency (up to 99.9%). To control payload release, the polymer density at the oil&#8211;water interface is enhanced, forming a compact shell for microparticles. The resultant microparticles can harvest up to 49.9% mass fraction of proteins with zero-order release kinetics in vivo, enabling an efficient glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the precise control of engineering process offered through continuous flow results in high batch-to-batch reproducibility and, ultimately, excellent scale-up feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orbital Symmetry Engineering in Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics toward Extremely Narrowband Green Emissions with an FWHM of 13&#160;nm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular orbital interactions are demonstrated to be crucial to the energy gap and spectral bandwidth of multi&#8208;resonance emitters. Correspondingly, the first indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole embedded green fluorophore is developed with the smallest full width at half maximum of 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV), accompanied by high external quantum efficiency of 30.9% and significantly alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR) molecules generally face spectral broadening issues with redshifted emissions. Thus, green emitters with full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of &lt;20&#160;nm are rarely reported, despite being highly desired. Herein, by properly fusing indolo(3,2,1&#8208;jk)carbazole (ICZ) and naphthalene moieties, green MR emitters are reported, which have FWHMs of merely 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV) and 14&#160;nm (0.069&#160;eV) in dichloromethane, accompanied by high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;95%, which represent not only the smallest FWHMs among all green MR emitters but also the first green emitters based on ICZ MR derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that the orbital interactions between the antisymmetric sites of the segments play an important role in extending the conjugation length in the fusion architectures while simultaneously maintaining a small FWHM. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit green emission peaks at 508&#8211;509&#160;nm and the first green electroluminescence FWHM of &lt;20&#160;nm ever reported. Benefiting from the preferential horizontal dipole orientation, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 30.9% is obtained, which remains at 28.9% and 23.2% under luminances of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming most reported green devices based on narrowband emitters.

         <title>Hygrothermic Wood Actuated Robotic Hand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity is developed, which generates stretching and bending responses to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. Multiple advantages are realized, including good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility. A robotic hand and grippers are designed for dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions and fire rescue scenarios.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8211;responsive actuators play a vital role in the new generation of intelligent systems. However, poor mechanical performance, complicated fabrication processes, and the inability to complex deformation limit their practical applications. Herein, these challenges are overcome via designing a strong hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity. The actuator is readily constructed by sandwiching polypyrrole&#8208;coated wood with a Ni complex hygroscopic gel top layer for moisture absorption and a polyimide bottom layer as the water barrier. The resulting hygrothermic wood spontaneously stretches and bends itself in response to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. A robotic hand and a series of grippers made of hygrothermic wood demonstrate dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions during grasping and holding, while the reversible hygrothermic property allows the actuator to be potentially applied in fire rescue scenarios to rescue trapped objects. A combination of good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility are simultaneously realized by one device. It is thus believed that such a strong wood actuator will open up a new avenue for building intelligent robotic hand systems.

         <title>Efficient Inorganic Vapor&#8208;Assisted Defects Passivation for Perovskite Solar Module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CS2 vapor passivation strategy is proposed to reduce defects in FAPbI3 films. It is revealed that the CS2 can strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to facilitate the carrier transport, resulting in remarkably enhance efficiency of the devices (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2).








Abstract
Surface trap as intrinsic defects&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative charge recombination is a major obstacle to achieving the reliable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics. Here a CS2 vapor&#8208;assisted passivation strategy is proposed for perovskite solar module, aiming to passivate the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ caused by ion migration. Significantly, this method can avoid the disadvantages of inhomogeneity film caused by spin&#8208;coating&#8208;assisted passivation and reconstruction of perovskite surface from solvent. The CS2 vapor passivated perovskite device presents a higher defect formation energy (0.54&#160;eV) of iodine vacancy than the pristine (0.37&#160;eV), while uncoordinated Pb2+ is bonded with CS2. The shallow level defect passivation of iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ has obviously enhanced the device efficiencies (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2) and the stability, exhibiting an average T80&#8208;lifetime of 1040&#160;h working at the maximum power point, and maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h at RH&#160;=&#160;30% and 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Humidity Range Applicable, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Healable Zwitterionic Hydrogels for Ion&#8208;Leakage&#8208;Free Iontronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solketal, outperforming the commonly used solvent glycerol, endows healable zwitterionic hydrogels with wide&#8208;humidity range applicability and freeze resistance. The optimized zwitterionic hydrogel satisfactorily serves as a dielectric layer to construct iontronic sensors with no ionic leakage, high sensitivity, and environmental stability. A whole&#8208;body healable, stretchable, and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor based on the zwitterionic hydrogels and composites is demonstrated.








Abstract
Hydrogels have entered the spotlight for applications in soft electronics. It is essential and challenging to obtain hydrogels that can function properly under varying environmental circumstances, that is, 30&#8211;90% relative humidity (RH) and &#8722;20 to 40&#160;&#176;C due to their intrinsic nature to lose and absorb water upon variations in humidity and temperature. In this work, a green solvent, solketal, is introduced into poly 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208;enoyloxy)ethyl azaniumyl propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (poly(DMAPS)) zwitterionic hydrogels. Compared to glycerol, solketal endows hydrogels with greater possibility for further modification as well as improved water content and mechanical performance consistency over 30&#8211;90% RH. Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non&#8208;leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&#8722;1), wide humidity, and temperature range applicability. A wide&#8208;humidity range healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag paste. A&#160;full&#8208;device healable and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor is developed. This study is a pioneering work that tackles the broad humidity range applicability issue of hydrogels, and demonstrates the ion&#8208;leakage&#8208;free ionic skins with zwitterionic dielectrics. The outcomes of the study will considerably promote advancements in the fields of hydrogel electronics and iontronic sensors.

Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non-leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), wide humidity, and temperature range applicability. A wide-humidity range healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag paste. A&#160;full-device healable and highly-sensitive sensor is developed. This study is a pioneering work that tackles the broad humidity range applicability issue of hydrogels, and demonstrates the ion-leakage-free ionic skins with zwitterionic dielectrics. The outcomes of the study will considerably promote advancements in the fields of hydrogel electronics and iontronic sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extremely Tough, Stretchable Gel Electrolytes with Strong Interpolymer Hydrogen Bonding Prepared Using Concentrated Electrolytes to Stabilize Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes are prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used as an artificial protective layer for lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel&#8208;coated Li&#8208;metal anode considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell as well as a Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NMC622) full cell.








Abstract
Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes, which can be prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated lithium (Li)&#8208;salt electrolytes, are reported. These electrolytes can be realized by optimizing the competitive hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between polymer chains, solvent molecules, Li cations, and counteranions. Free polar solvent molecules, which typically impede interpolymer hydrogen bonding, are scarce in concentrated electrolytes; this feature can be exploited to prepare hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel electrolytes with unprecedented toughness. In contrast, free solvent molecules are abundant in electrolytes with typical concentrations, yielding considerably weaker gel electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used an artificial protective layer for Li&#8208;metal anodes, as it considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell through uniform Li deposition/dissolution. Additionally, employing the gel electrolyte as the protecting layer significantly improves the cycling performance of the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 full cell.

         <title>Ti3C2Tx MXene van der Waals Gate Contact for GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as gate contacts, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The Schottky gate GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Gate controllability is a key factor that determines the performance of GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). However, at the traditional metal&#8208;GaN interface, direct chemical interaction between metal and GaN can result in fixed charges and traps, which can significantly deteriorate the gate controllability. In this study, Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN HEMTs as the gate contact, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit an extremely low off&#8208;state current (IOFF) of 10&#8722;7 mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 (which is six orders of magnitude higher than conventional Ni/Au contact), a high off&#8208;state drain breakdown voltage of 1085&#160;V, and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work shows the great potential of MXene films as gate electrodes in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor devices.

         <title>Unusual Temperature Dependence of Water Sorption in Semicrystalline Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials typically lose their water sorption capability with increasing temperature. Can this temperature effect be reversed? By leveraging the phase transformation of semicrystalline hydrogels, an unusual water sorption behavior is demonstrated where the water uptake can be doubled with an increased temperature of 25&#160;&#176;C. This finding will enable a new degree of freedom to harness moisture and heat.








Abstract
Water vapor sorption is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and plays an important role in various applications, including humidity regulation, energy storage, thermal management, and water harvesting. In particular, capturing moisture at elevated temperatures is highly desirable to prevent dehydration and to enlarge the tunability of water uptake. However, owing to the thermodynamic limit of conventional materials, sorbents inevitably tend to capture less water vapor at higher temperatures, impeding their broad applications. Here, an inverse temperature dependence of water sorption in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, where their water uptake can be doubled with increasing temperature from 25 to 50&#160;&#176;C, is reported. With mechanistic modeling of water&#8211;polymer interactions, this unusual water sorption is attributed to the first&#8208;order phase transformation of PEG structures, and the key parameters for a more generalized strategy in materials development are identified. This work elucidates a new regime of water sorption with an unusual temperature dependence, enabling a promising engineering space for harnessing moisture and heat.

         <title>Artificial Tendrils Mimicking Plant Movements by Mismatching Modulus and Strain in Core and Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological principles of tendril movement and coiling in plants are studied and used as design criteria to implement coiling movements in an artificial multimaterial fiber (MMFs) system. The MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core and an elastic shell, such that the core enables the implementation of strain displacement in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible coiling movement.








Abstract
Motile organs have evolved in climbing plants enabling them to find a support and, after secure attachment, to reach for sunlight without investing in a self&#8208;supporting stem. Searching movements, the twining of stems, and the coiling of tendrils are involved in successful plant attachment. Such coiling movements have great potential in robotic applications, especially if they are reversible. Here, the underlying mechanism of tendril movement based on contractile fibers is reported, as illustrated by a function&#8211;morphological analysis of tendrils in several liana species and the encoding of such a principle in a core&#8211;shell multimaterial fiber (MMF) system. MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core fiber (SMCF) and an elastic shell. The shape&#8208;memory effect of the core fibers enables the implementation of strain mismatch in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible motion. The produced MMFs show coiling and/or uncoiling behavior, with a high reversible actuation magnitude of &#8776;400%, which is almost 20 times higher compared with similar stimuli for sensitive soft actuators. The movements in these MMFs rely on the crystallization/melting behavior of oriented macromolecules of SMCF.

         <title>Diagnosing and Correcting the Failure of the Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte for Enhancing Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; polysulfides on the electrode interface in a diffusion&#8208;restricted solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) is identified as a critical failure cause of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries, which can be addressed by applying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis to tailor the chemical environment in the SPE.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attract great interest in developing high&#8208;performance yet reliable solid&#8208;state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of the SPE and SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation is identified as a critical failure cause of SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8211;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8211;S redox in solid&#8208;state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion&#8208;restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8211;S redox failure in the SPE. It enables Ah&#8208;level solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom&#8208;up improvement of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Graphene Biointerface for Cardiac Arrhythmia Diagnosis and Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of graphene biointerfaces for cardiac electrophysiology is presented. The devices feature effective electrochemical properties: low impedance and high charge storage and injection capacities. The transparency of graphene allows for simultaneous optical mapping and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. This report indicates that graphene biointerfaces are fundamental for future diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
Heart rhythm disorders, known as arrhythmias, cause significant morbidity and are one of the leading causes of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are frequently treated by implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, or by ablation therapy guided by electroanatomical mapping. Both implantable and ablation therapies require sophisticated biointerfaces for electrophysiological measurements of electrograms and delivery of therapeutic stimulation or ablation energy. In this work, a graphene biointerface for in vivo cardiac electrophysiology is reported for the first time. Leveraging sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thick tissue&#8208;conformable graphene arrays, sensing and stimulation of the open mammalian heart are demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the graphene biointerface treatment of atrioventricular block (the kind of arrhythmia where the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is interrupted) is demonstrated. The graphene arrays show effective electrochemical properties, namely interface impedance down to 40&#160;&#937;&#8201;cm2 at 1&#160;kHz, charge storage capacity up to 63.7&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2, and charge injection capacity up to 704&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2. Transparency of the graphene structures allows for simultaneous optical mapping of cardiac action potentials, calcium transients, and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. The report presents evidence of the significant potential of graphene biointerfaces for advanced cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia therapy.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Stable Hyperfluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Improved Color Purities and Ultrahigh Power Efficiencies Based on Low&#8208;Polar Sensitizing Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is created, based on which low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems with small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are achieved for hyperfluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high color purity, record&#8208;high electroluminescence efficiencies and long operational lifetime.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;definition displays because of their narrow emission spectra. However, the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and spectra of MR&#8208;TADF molecules are highly sensitive to hosts and sensitizers when applied to organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the highly polar environments in devices often lead to significantly broadened EL spectra. In this study, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF sensitizer (BTDMAC&#8208;XT) with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is constructed, which acts as a good emitter in doped and non&#8208;doped OLEDs with high external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 26.7% and 29.3%, respectively. By combining BTDMAC&#8208;XT with conventional low&#8208;polarity hosts, low&#8208;polarity sensitizing systems with a small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are constructed for the MR&#8208;TADF molecule BN2. Hyperfluorescence (HF) OLEDs employing the low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems successfully improve the color quality of BN2 and afford an excellent &#951;ext of 34.4%, a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 166.3&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and a long operational lifetime (LT50&#160;=&#160;40309&#160;h) at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. These results provide instructive guidance for the sensitizer design and device optimization for energy&#8208;efficient and stable HF&#8208;OLEDs with high&#8208;quality light.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multilevel Optical PUF by Spatiotemporally Programmed Crystallization of Supersaturated Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of reconfigurable multilevel optical physical unclonable function (PUF) based on the stochastic crystallization of supersaturated solution, intended for a hierarchical identification process with recyclable tokens, is presented. The global parameters introduced in this study act as prefixes to classify PUFs into subgroups, which allows for a fast authentication process.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are&#160;emerging as an alternative to information security by providing an advanced level of cryptographic keys with non&#8208;replicable characteristics, yet the cryptographic keys of conventional PUFs are not reconfigurable from the ones assigned at the manufacturing stage and the overall authentication process slows down as the number of entities in the dataset or the length of cryptographic key increases. Herein, a supersaturated solution&#8208;based PUF (S&#8208;PUF) is presented that utilizes stochastic crystallization of a supersaturated sodium acetate solution to allow a time&#8208;efficient, hierarchical authentication process together with on&#8208;demand rewritability of cryptographic keys. By controlling the orientation and the average grain size of the sodium acetate crystals via a spatiotemporally programmed temperature profile, the S&#8208;PUF now includes two global parameters, that is, angle of rotation and divergence of the diffracted beam, in addition to the speckle pattern to produce multilevel cryptographic keys, and these parameters function as prefixes for the classification of each entity for a fast authentication process. At the same time, the reversible phase change of sodium acetate enables repeated reconfiguration of the cryptographic key, which is expected to offer new possibilities for a next&#8208;generation, recyclable anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.

         <title>Vertical Array of Graphite Oxide Liquid Crystal by Microwire Shearing for Highly Thermally Conductive Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) is realized by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a record high through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 15% higher than that of pure Indium foil (81.8&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1).








Abstract

         <title>Novel Organic Superbase Dopants for Ultraefficient N&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of two organic superbase dopants as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the dopants lead to record&#8208;high conductivity in doped N2200 and PC61BM films, and exhibit particularly high polaron generation efficiency and doping efficiency. A possible deprotonation&#8208;induced nucleophilic&#8208;attack n&#8208;doping mechanism is suggested for the organic superbase dopants.








Abstract
Doping is a powerful technique for engineering the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs), yet efficient n&#8208;doping of OSCs remains a central challenge. Herein, the discovery of two organic superbase dopants, namely P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu and P4&#8208;t&#8208;Bu as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. Typical n&#8208;type semiconductors such as N2200 and PC61BM are shown to experience a significant increase of conductivity upon doping by the two dopants. In particular, the optimized electrical conductivity of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped PC61BM reaches a record&#8208;high value of 2.64&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The polaron generation efficiency of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped in PC61BM is found to be over 35%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of benchmark n&#8208;dopant N&#8208;DMBI. In addition, a deprotonation&#8208;initiated, nucleophilic&#8208;attack&#8208;based n&#8208;doping mechanism is proposed for the organic superbases, which involves the deprotonation of OSC molecules, the nucleophilic attack of the resulting carbanions on the OSC's &#960;&#8208;bonds, and the subsequent n&#8208;doping through single electron transfer process between the anionized and neutral OSCs. This work highlights organic superbases as promising n&#8208;dopants for OSCs and opens up opportunities to explore and develop highly efficient n&#8208;dopants.

         <title>Achieving High Quantum Efficiency Broadband NIR Mg4Ta2O9:Cr3+ Phosphor Through Lithium&#8208;Ion Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped&#160;Mg4Ta2O9phosphor is explored, and 61.25% of the record EQE detected at 450&#160;nm excitation&#160;is&#160;achieved through lithium&#8208;ion compensation. As a key and efficient broadband NIR transmitter, it can achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. It provides a new option&#160;for the next&#8208;generation&#160;compact NIR light source and can be utilized to improve the current detection sensitivity based on intelligent NIR spectroscopy technology.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;efficient broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) are urgently needed to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution of current smart NIR spectroscopy&#8208;based techniques. Nonetheless, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LED has severely limited owing to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) bottleneck of NIR light&#8208;emitting materials. Herein, a blue LED excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped tetramagnesium ditantalate (Mg4Ta2O9, MT) phosphor is advantageously modified through lithium ion as a key efficient broadband NIR emitter to achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. The emission spectrum encompasses the 700&#8211;1300&#160;nm electromagnetic spectrum of first biological window (&#955;max&#160;= 842&#160;nm) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of &#8776;2280 cm&#8722;1 (&#8776;167&#160;nm), and achieves a record EQE of 61.25% detected at 450&#160;nm excitation through Li&#8208;ion compensation. A prototype NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with MT:Cr3+, Li+ to evaluate its potential practical application, which reveals an NIR output power of 53.22&#160;mW at a driving current of 100&#160;mA, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 25.09% at 10&#160;mA. This work provides an ultra&#8208;efficient broadband NIR luminescent material, which shows great promise in practical applications and presents a novel option for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power compact NIR light sources.

         <title>Two Functions from a Single Photoresist: Tuning Microstructure Degradability from Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one photoresist for 3D direct laser writing applications is introduced, which allows the degradation properties of the printed structure to be carefully tuned by simply altering the laser intensity during the fabrication process. The unique ability to fabricate 3D microstructures consisting of both degradable and nondegradable segments from a single photoresist is a critical advancement in photoresist technology.








Abstract
A photoresist&#8212;based on a light&#8208;stabilized dynamic material driven by an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium photo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of triazolinediones with naphthalenes&#8212;whose ability to intrinsically degrade postprinting can be tuned by a simple adjustment of laser intensity during 3D laser lithography is introduced. The resist's ability to form stable networks under green light irradiation that degrade in the dark is transformed into a tunable degradable 3D printing material platform. In&#8208;depth characterization of the printed microstructures via atomic force microscopy before and during degradation reveals the high dependency of the final structures&#8217; properties on the writing parameters. Upon identifying the ideal writing parameters and their effect on the network structure, it is possible to selectively toggle between stable and fully degradable structures. This simplifies the direct laser writing manufacturing process of multifunctional materials significantly, which typically requires the use of separate resists and consecutive writing efforts to achieve degradable and nondegradable material sections.

         <title>A Scalable Platform for Fabricating Biodegradable Microparticles with Pulsatile Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is a high&#8208;throughput method for fabricating biodegradable microparticles that release drug in a discrete pulse after a tunable delay. The PULSED encapsulation technique is compatible with crystalline and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers, and is gentle enough to preserve the bioactivity of proteins.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is a high-throughput method for fabricating biodegradable microparticles that release drug in a discrete pulse after a tunable delay. The PULSED encapsulation technique is compatible with crystalline and semi-crystalline polymers, and is gentle enough to preserve the bioactivity of proteins.

         <title>High Energy Harvesting Performances Silicone Elastomer via Filling Soft Dielectric with Stretching Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft dielectric with good interfacial interaction, dielectric enhancement, and deformability is developed and used as novel filler for dielectric elastomer, significantly improving the stretched breakdown strength of nanocomposite under 800% plane strain. Dielectric elastomer generator based on this soft filler shows high power generation energy density (130.5 mJ g&#8722;1) and record electromechanical conversion efficiency (44.5%).








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) with high generated energy density and high conversion efficiency are of great interest. Among several dielectric elastomers (DEs), silicone elastomer filled with ceramic fillers have been extensively studied for their high elasticity, insulation, and permittivity. However, the stretched breakdown strength (Ebs) of such composites decreases significantly under large strain, thus sharply reduces its energy harvesting performances. In this study, a polar rubber&#8208;based dielectric (GNBR) is synthetized and creatively used as &#8220;soft filler&#8221; for silicone elastomer. Benefiting from the deformability under stretching and its inherent strong interface bonding with silicone elastomer, this soft filler effectively avoids the formation of weak interface under large strain and reduces the local field strength of interface area. As expected, the composite filled with soft filler (GNBR/PMVS) shows enhanced Ebs of 2.8 times that of composite with traditional hard filler (TiO2/PMVS) under equibiaxial strain of 200%. As a result, GNBR/PMVS composite exhibits maximum energy density of 130.5 mJ g&#8722;1 with up&#8208;to&#8208;date highest power conversion efficiency of reported DEG (44.5%). The findings will provide new insights in the rational design of DE composites characterized by high stretched breakdown strength for advanced energy harvesting system.

         <title>Launching and Manipulation of Higher&#8208;Order In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Low&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly confined, directionally dependent in&#8208;plane hyperbolic light propagation is demonstrated in a heterostructure composed of a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire on &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flake. Such low&#8208;dimensional heterostructure showcases the efficient and precise manipulation of the extremely anisotropic light&#8208;matter interactions at the deeply subwavelength scale, opening opportunities for a wide range of IR applications.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) are stimulated by coupling infrared (IR) photons with the polar lattice vibrations. Such HPhPs offer low&#8208;loss, highly confined light propagation at subwavelength scales with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or in&#8208;plane hyperbolic wavefronts. For HPhPs, while a hyperbolic dispersion implies multiple propagating modes with a distribution of wavevectors at a given frequency, so far it has been challenging to experimentally launch and probe the higher&#8208;order modes that offer stronger wavelength compression, especially for in&#8208;plane HPhPs. In this work, the experimental observation of higher&#8208;order in&#8208;plane HPhP modes stimulated on a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire (NW)/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is reported where leveraging both the low&#8208;dimensionality and low&#8208;loss nature of the polar NWs, higher&#8208;order HPhPs modes within 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal are launched by the 1D 3C&#8208;SiC NW. The launching mechanism is further studied and the requirements for efficiently launching of such higher&#8208;order modes are determined. In addition, by altering the geometric orientation between the 3C&#8208;SiC NW and &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal, the manipulation of higher&#8208;order HPhP dispersions as a method of tuning is demonstrated. This work illustrates an extremely anisotropic low dimensional heterostructure platform to confine and configure electromagnetic waves at the deep&#8208;subwavelength scales for a range of IR applications including sensing, nano&#8208;imaging, and on&#8208;chip photonics.

         <title>Improved Carrier Management via a Multifunctional Modifier for High&#8208;Quality Low&#8208;Bandgap Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites and Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and excellent contacts at the perovskite/C60 interface are developed by introducing a one&#8208;in&#8208;all modifier. The introduction of cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) to Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites restrains non&#8208;radiative recombination and facilitates electron transfer. Consequently, the CysHCl&#8208;processed devices achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.15% for low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) and 26.16% for all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) hold great promise in terms of ultrahigh efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility, stepping forward to the next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. However, their further development is hampered by the relatively low performance of low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Improving the carrier management, including suppressing trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination and promoting carrier transfer, is of great significance to enhance the performance of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. Herein, a carrier management strategy is reported for using cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) simultaneously as a bulky passivator and a surface anchoring agent for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite. CysHCl processing effectively reduces trap density and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, enabling the growth of high&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite with greatly improved carrier diffusion length of &gt;8&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the electron transfer at the perovskite/C60 interface is accelerated due to the formation of surface dipoles and favorable energy band bending. As a result, these advances enable the demonstration of champion efficiency of 22.15% for CysHCl&#8208;processed LBG Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with remarkable enhancement in both open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor. When paired with a wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite subcell, a certified 25.7%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem device is further demonstrated.

Multifunction&#8208;integrated semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (STOPVs), with high power generation, colorful transmittance/reflectance, excellent&#160;ultraviolet (UV) protection, and thermal insulation, are fully in line with the concept of architectural aesthetics and photoprotection characteristics for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic&#8208;window. For the indelible rainbow color photovoltaic window, one crucial issue is to realize the integration of these photons&#8208; and photoelectric&#8208;related multifunction. Herein, dynamic transmissive and reflective structural color controllable filters, with asymmetrical metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) configurations (20&#160;nm&#8208;Ag&#8208;HATCN&#8208;30&#160;nm&#8208;Ag) through machine learning, are deliberately designed for colorful STOPV devices. This endows the resultant integrated devices with &#8776;5% enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the bare&#8208;STOPVs, gifted UV (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) blocking rates as high as 93.5, 94.1, 90.2, and 94.5%, as well as a superior&#160;infrared radiation (IR) (700&#8208;1400&#160;nm) rejection approaching 100% for transparent purple&#8208;, blue&#8208;, green&#8208; and red&#8208;STOPV cells, respectively. Most importantly, benefiting from the photonic recycling effect beyond microcavity resonance wavelength, a reported quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) as high as 80%, is first presented for the transparent&#8208;green&#8208;STOPVs with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV. These asymmetrical Febry&#8208;P&#233;rot transmissive and reflective structural color filters can also be extended to silicon&#8208; and perovskite&#8208;based optoelectric devices and make it possible to integrate additional target optical functions for multi&#8208;purpose optoelectric devices.

         <title>Superlattice Nanofilm on a Touchscreen for Photoexcited Bacteria and Virus Killing by Tuning Electronic Defects in the Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering electronic defects in ZnO&#8211;Fe2O3 superlattice heterointerfaces is applied for smartphone&#8208;/solar&#8208;triggered bactericidal and virucidal touchscreens, even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen exhibits excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.








Abstract
Currently, the global COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has significantly increased the public attention toward the spread of pathogenic viruses and bacteria on various high&#8208;frequency touch surfaces. Developing a self&#8208;disinfecting coating on a touchscreen is an urgent and meaningful task. Superlattice materials are among the most promising photocatalysts owing to their efficient charge transfer in abundant heterointerfaces. However, excess electronic defects at the heterointerfaces result in the loss of substantial amounts of photogenerated charge carrier. In this study, a ZnO&#63743;Fe2O3 superlattice nanofilm is designed via atomic layer deposition for photocatalytic bactericidal and virucidal touchscreen. Additionally, electronic defects in the superlattice heterointerface are engineered. Photogenerated electrons and holes will be rapidly separated and transferred into ZnO and Fe2O3 across the heterointerfaces owing to the formation of Zn&#63743;O, Fe&#63743;O, and Zn&#63743;Fe covalent bonds at the heterointerfaces, where ZnO and Fe2O3 function as electronic donors and receptors, respectively. The high generation capacity of reactive oxygen species results in a high antibacterial and antiviral efficacy (&gt;90%) even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen shows excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.

         <title>Move Aside Pentacene: Diazapentacene&#8208;Doped para&#8208;Terphenyl, a Zero&#8208;Field Room&#8208;Temperature Maser with Strong Coupling for Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl is discovered to act as a maser, the microwave analogue of lasers. As&#160;only the second material ever discovered to mase at room&#8208;temperature and zero external magnetic&#8208;field,&#160;optical and paramagnetic characterizations of this new material, to spearhead studies of maser materials for quantum sensors, magnetic spintronics, and tailored organic materials in optoelectronics, are presented.








Abstract
Masers can deliver ultralow&#8208;noise amplification of microwave signals in medical imaging and deep&#8208;space communication, with recent research being rekindled through the discovery of gain media operating at room&#8208;temperature, eschewing bulky cryogenics that hindered their use. This work shows the discovery of 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl (DAP:PTP) as a maser gain medium that can operate at room&#8208;temperature, without an external magnetic field. With a maser output power of &#8722;10 dBm, it is on par with pentacene&#8208;doped para&#8208;terphenyl in masing power, while possessing compelling advantages such as faster amplification startup times, being pumped by longer wavelength light at 620 nm and greater chemical stability from nitrogen groups. Furthermore, the maser bursts from DAP:PTP allow one to reach the strong coupling regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics, with a high&#160;cooperativity of 182. The optical and microwave spin dynamics of DAP:PTP are studied in order to evaluate its capabilities as a maser gain medium, where it features fast intersystem crossing and an advantageously higher triplet quantum yield. The results pave the way for the future discovery of similar maser materials and help designate them as promising candidates for quantum sensors, optoelectronic devices and the study of cavity quantum electrodynamic effects at&#160;room&#8208;temperature.

         <title>Achieving Ferroelectricity in a Centrosymmetric High&#8208;Performance Semiconductor by Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>In a high&#8208;performance semiconductor Bi2O2Se, a strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric transition is demonstrated by the appearance of butterfly loops and 180&#176; phase switching in the piezoelectric force microscopy measurements, together with the evolution of optical second&#8208;harmonic generation. Materials with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and ferroelectrics under strain are rare.








Abstract
Phase engineering by strain in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for a variety of applications. Here, a study of the strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric (FE) transition in bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se) films, a high&#8208;performance (HP) semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, is presented. Bi2O2Se is not FE at ambient pressure. At a loading force of &#8819;400 nN, the piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops in magnitude and 180&#176; phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors, these features are attributed to a transition to the FE phase. The transition is further supported by the appearance of a sharp peak in optical second&#8208;harmonic generation under uniaxial strain. In general, solids with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and FE under strain are rare. The FE transition is discussed using first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts and serves as the basis for a memristor with a huge on/off current ratio of 106. This work adds a new degree of freedom to HP electronic/optoelectronic semiconductors, and the integration of FE and HP semiconductivity paves the way for many exciting functionalities, including HP neuromorphic computing and bulk&#160;piezophotovoltaics.

An ultrathin crystalline ferroelectric polymer based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) is developed on AlOX to realize negative&#8208;capacitance metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MOSFETs) with a MoS2 channel. Systematic adjustment of the thickness ratio between the polymer and dielectric AlOX achieves a hysteresis&#8208;free FET with a minimum subthreshold swing of 28 mV dec&#8722;1, operating at less than 2 V.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics (FE), which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer is developed based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) to achieve the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of NC&#8208;FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8211;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) is prepared on AlOX by a newly developed brush method, which enables an FE/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC&#8208;FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at a thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis&#8208;free operation with an SS of 28&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 at &#8776;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. This P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC&#8208;FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low&#8208;power devices.

         <title>Ultrafast, High&#8208;Strain, and Strong Uniaxial Hydrogel Actuators from Recyclable Nanofibril Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators benefit from high actuation strain and mechanical properties that mimic biological tissues but suffer from low actuation rates and limited controllability. It is shown that the performance of hydrogel actuators can be improved by orders of magnitude using uniaxial fibrillar hydrogels that focus the entire swelling in the actuation direction&#8211;a significant advancement toward hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.








Abstract
Polymer hydrogels mimic biological tissues and are suitable for future lifelike machines. However, their actuation is isotropic, so they must be crosslinked or placed in a turgor membrane to achieve high actuation pressures, severely impeding their performance. Here, it is shown that organizing cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) in anisotropic hydrogel sheets leads to mechanical in&#8208;plane reinforcement that generates a uniaxial, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane strain with performance far surpassing polymer hydrogels. These fibrillar hydrogel actuators expand uniaxially by 250 times with an initial rate of 100&#8211;130%&#160;s&#8722;1, compared to &lt;10 times and &lt;1%&#160;s&#8722;1 in directional strain rate for isotropic hydrogels, respectively. The blocking pressure reaches 0.9&#160;MPa, similar to turgor actuators, while the time to reach 90% of the maximum&#160;pressure is 1&#8211;2&#160;min, compared to 10&#160;min to hours for polymer hydrogel actuators. Uniaxial actuators that lift objects 120&#160;000 times their weight and soft grippers are showcased. In addition, the hydrogels can be recycled without a loss in performance. The uniaxial swelling allows adding channels through the gel for local solvent delivery, further increasing the actuation rate and cyclability. Thus, fibrillar networks can overcome the major drawbacks of hydrogel actuators and is a significant advancement towards hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Electrochemical Catalysts for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular design and crystal engineering strategy are applied to construct thiol&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). This MOF platform is successfully decorated with&#160;nickel&#8211;sulfur links cooperating in the network. The prepared 2D MOF with enhanced electro&#8208;conductivity and modified electronic structure demonstrates superior activity and robust stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which paves the way to design MOFs at a molecular level.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, a molecularly engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan&#8211;metal links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF) is designed. The crystal structure is solved from microcrystals by a continuous&#8208;rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique. Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF due to the Ni&#8211;S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand for enhancing electroconductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that (DMBD)&#8208;MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over non&#8208;thiol (e.g., 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog (BDC)&#8208;MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate&#8208;limiting *O intermediate formation step. Iron&#8208;substituted NiFe(DMBD)&#8208;MOF achieves a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at a small overpotential of 280&#160;mV, indicating a new MOF platform for efficient OER catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Membranes Enabled High Energy Density in PEI&#8208;Based Composites for High&#8208;Temperature Electrostatic Capacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
The sandwich structured BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT)/polyetherimide&#8211;boron nitride composites are prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique with water&#8208;dissolvent transfer method and hot&#8208;pressing process. By inserting the single&#8208;crystalline BZT membranes as the inner layer, the composites exhibit good dielectric&#8208;temperature stability and ultra&#8208;high energy&#8208;density. This study paves a scalable way to develop novel high&#8208;temperature dielectric materials and capacitors with superior energy storage performance.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are promising for high power energy storage, but their breakdown strength (Eb) and energy density (Ue) usually degrade rapidly at high temperatures. Adding boron nitride (BN) nanosheets can improve the Eb and high&#8208;temperature endurance but with a limited Ue due to its low dielectric constant. Here, freestanding single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT) membranes with high dielectric constant are fabricated, and introduced into BN doped polyetherimide (PEI) to obtain laminated PEI&#8211;BN/BZT/PEI&#8211;BN composites. At room temperature, the composite shows a maximum Ue of 17.94&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at 730&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1, which is more than two times the pure PEI. Particularly, the composites exhibit excellent dielectric&#8208;temperature stability between 25&#160;and 150&#160;&#176;C. An outstanding Ue&#160;=&#160;7.90&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;is obtained at a relatively large electric field of 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;under 150&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to the most high&#8208;temperature dielectric capacitors reported so far. Phase&#8208;field simulation reveals that the depolarization electric field generated at the BZT/PEI&#8211;BN interfaces can effectively reduce carrier mobility, leading to the remarkable enhancement of the Eb and Ue over a wide temperature range. This work provides a promising and scalable route to develop sandwich&#8208;structured composites with prominent energy storage performances for high&#8208;temperature capacitive applications.

&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;7.90&#160;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;is obtained at a relatively large electric field of 650&#160;MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;under 150&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to the most high-temperature dielectric capacitors reported so far. Phase-field simulation reveals that the depolarization electric field generated at the BZT/PEI&#8211;BN interfaces can effectively reduce carrier mobility, leading to the remarkable enhancement of the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; over a wide temperature range. This work provides a promising and scalable route to develop sandwich-structured composites with prominent energy storage performances for high-temperature capacitive applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Microbial Community Cultured in Gradient Hydrogel for Investigating Gut Microbiome&#8208;Drug Interaction and Guiding Therapeutic Decisions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient hydrogel&#8208;based microbial community is presented to simulate the real intestinal microbiome for bridging microbiome&#8208;drug interaction research and treatment decision. This model reveals three mechanisms of drug&#8208;microbiota interaction: immunological effect, bio&#8208;accumulation, and drug metabolism, which provide innovative regulatory approaches for improving the anti&#8208;cancer effect of drugs.








Abstract
Despite the recognition that the gut microbiota acts a clinically significant role in cancer chemotherapy, both mechanistic understanding and translational research are still limited. Maximizing drug efficacy requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the microbiota contributes to therapeutic responses, while microbiota modulation is hindered by the complexity of the human body. To address this issue, a 3D experimental model named engineered microbiota (EM) is reported for bridging microbiota&#8208;drug interaction research and therapeutic decision&#8208;making. EM can be manipulated in vitro and faithfully recapitulate the human gut microbiota at the genus/species level while allowing co&#8208;culture with cells, organoids, and isolated tissues for testing drug responses. Examination of various clinical and experimental drugs by EM reveales that the gut microbiota affects drug efficacy through three pathways: immunological effects, bioaccumulation, and drug metabolism. Guided by discovered mechanisms, custom&#8208;tailored strategies are adopted to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of drugs on orthotopic tumor models with patient&#8208;derived gut microbiota. These strategies include immune synergy, nanoparticle encapsulation, and host&#8211;guest complex formation, respectively. Given the important role of the gut microbiota in influencing drug efficacy, EM will likely become an indispensable tool to guide drug translation and clinical decision&#8208;making.

         <title>A Sulfur Heterocyclic Quinone Cathode Towards&#160;High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>

A fully composited benzo[b]naphtho[2',3':5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone/reduced graphene oxide (BNDTH/RGO)&#160;is designed to simultaneously conquer the low utilization of active sites, intrinsic poor conductivity, and strong solubility of organic electrode materials, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with record&#8208;high cycling stability. This work brings new opportunities for the exploration of ultra&#8208;stable organic cathode materials for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Organic materials have attracted much attention in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their sustainability and structure&#8208;designable, but their further development is hindered by the high solubility, poor conductivity, and low utilization of active groups, resulting in poor cycling stability, terrible rate capability, and low capacity. In order to solve these three major obstacles, a novel organic host, benzo[b]naphtho[2&#8217;,3&#8217;:5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone (BNDTH), with abundant electroactive groups and stable extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure is synthesized and composited with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a solvent exchange composition method to act as the cathode material for AZIBs. The well&#8208;designed BNDTH/RGO composite exhibits a high capacity of 296&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (nearly a full utilization of the active groups), superior rate capability of 120&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a long lifetime of 58&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 65% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the ingenious structural design of the active molecule, as well as the unique solvent exchange composition strategy that enables effective dispersion of excess charge on the active molecule during discharge/charge process. This work provides important insights for the rational design of organic cathode materials and has significant guidance for realizing ideal high performance in AZIBs.

         <title>Tuning 2D Magnetism in Cobalt Monoxide Nanosheets Via In Situ Nickel&#8208;Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide (Ni&#8208;doped CoO) nanosheets with a high substitution doping concentration is proposed for the first time. 2D Ni&#8208;doped CoO exhibits obvious ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K, in sharp contrast to the pristine non&#8208;ferromagnetic 2D CoO, opening up a prospective way for tuning the magnetism of 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.








Abstract
Element doping has become an effective strategy to engineer the magnetic properties of two&#8208;dimensional&#160;(2D) materials and is widely explored in van der Waals layered transition metal dichalcogenides. However, the high&#8208;concentration substitution doping of 2D nonlayered metal oxides, which can preserve the original crystal texture and guarantee the homogeneity of doping distribution, is still a critical challenge due to the isotropic bonding of closed&#8208;packed structures. In this work, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D nonlayered nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide nanosheets via in situ atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition method is reported. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that nickel atoms are doped at the intrinsic cobalt atom sites. The nickel doping concentration is stable at &#8776;15%, superior to most magnetic dopants doping in 2D materials and metal oxides. Magnetic measurements showed that pristine cobalt monoxide is nonferromagnetic, whereas nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide exhibits robust ferromagnetic behavior with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that nickel atoms can improve the internal ferromagnetic correlation, giving rise to significant ferromagnetic performance of cobalt monoxide nanosheets. These results provide a valuable case for tuning the competing correlated states and magnetic ordering by substitution doping in 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Maximum Emission Peak Over 1500&#160;nm of Organic Assembly for Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing NIR&#8208;IIb Phototheranostics of Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic assembly with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm is prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 for blood&#8211;brain barrier&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic glioblastoma.








Abstract
The development of blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing phototheranostic agents in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), especially in the range of 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), affords great opportunities for glioblastoma (GBM) management. Herein, an organic assembly (denoted as LET&#8208;12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 is designed and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogs. The LET&#8208;12 can effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline&#8208;like receptors&#8208;mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8776;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue signal ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively). Owing to its good photothermal conversion ability, the LET&#8208;12 also can serve as a photothermal conversion agent, achieving obvious tumor repression of orthotopic murine GBM model after once treatment. The findings indicate that the LET&#8208;12 holds great potential for BBB&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic GBM. This self&#8208;assembly strategy of organic small molecules opens a new avenue for the construction of NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics.

Herein, an organic assembly (denoted as LET-12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self-assembly of organic small molecule IR-1064 is designed and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogs. The LET-12 can effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline-like receptors-mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8776;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor-to-normal tissue signal ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively). Owing to its good photothermal conversion ability, the LET-12 also can serve as a photothermal conversion agent, achieving obvious tumor repression of orthotopic murine GBM model after once treatment. The findings indicate that the LET-12 holds great potential for BBB-crossing NIR-IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic GBM. This self-assembly strategy of organic small molecules opens a new avenue for the construction of NIR-IIb phototheranostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Determination of the Global Zero&#8208;Temperature Phase Diagram of Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining crystal graph attention networks with a newly created dataset, a compound space spanning 1 billion materials is scanned for new stable materials. As a result, the number of known theoretically synthesizable materials is increased by 30%. The resulting materials are then studied for extreme values of several properties.








Abstract
Crystal&#8208;graph attention neural networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools for the prediction of thermodynamic stability. The efficacy of their learning capabilities and their reliability is however subject to the quantity and quality of the data they are fed. Previous networks exhibit strong biases due to the inhomogeneity of the training data. Here a high&#8208;quality dataset is engineered to provide a better balance across chemical and crystal&#8208;symmetry space. Crystal&#8208;graph neural networks trained with this dataset show unprecedented generalization accuracy. Such networks are applied to perform machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput searches of stable materials, spanning 1 billion candidates. In this way, the number of vertices of the global T&#160;= 0&#160;K phase diagram is increased by 30% and find more than &#8776;150&#160;000 compounds with a distance to the convex hull of stability of less than 50&#160;meV&#160;atom&#8722;1. The discovered materials are then accessed for applications, identifying compounds with extreme values of a few properties, such as superconductivity, superhardness, and giant gap&#8208;deformation potentials.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Wall Engineering Enables Thermal Modulation in PMN&#8211;PT Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity modulation in PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals is demonstrated with a maximum enhancement of more than 20% at the intermediate poling state (intermediate d33). The enhancement is attributed to the reduction in domain wall density due to alternating current poling. The thermal conductivity decreases at optimized poling (maximum d33) due to increasing domain size inhomogeneity.








Abstract
Acting like thermal resistances, ferroelectric domain walls can be manipulated to realize dynamic modulation of thermal conductivity (k), which is essential for developing novel phononic circuits. Despite the interest, little attention has been paid to achieving room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in bulk materials due to challenges in obtaining a high thermal conductivity switching ratio (khigh/klow), particularly in commercially viable materials. Here, room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in 2.5&#160;mm&#8208;thick Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;xPbTiO3 (PMN&#8211;xPT) single crystals is demonstrated. With the use of advanced poling conditions, assisted by the systematic study on composition and orientation dependence of PMN&#8211;xPT, a range of thermal conductivity switching ratios with a maximum of &#8776;1.27 is observed. Simultaneous measurements of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) to characterize the poling state, domain wall density using polarized light microscopy (PLM), and birefringence change using quantitative PLM&#160;reveal that compared to the unpoled state, the domain wall density at intermediate poling states (0&lt; d33&lt;d33,max) is lower due to the enlargement in domain size. At optimized poling conditions (d33,max), the domain sizes show increased inhomogeneity that leads to enhancement in the domain wall density. This work highlights the potential of commercially available PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals among other relaxor&#8208;ferroelectrics for achieving temperature control in solid&#8208;state devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 at 4.7&#160;V by Interface Stabilization and Band Structure Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modified&#160;LCO has a gradient doping of Mg, uniform doping of Ni in Li layers, and uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating. The doping and coating simultaneously modify the band structure to improve the oxygen redox reversibility during cycles. Therefore, the modified LCO shows excellent cycling performance both at 4.6 V and 4.7 V.








Abstract
Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) is widely used in Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric energy density, which is generally charged to 4.3 V. Lifting the cut&#8208;off voltage of LCO from 4.3 V to 4.7 V will increase the specific capacity from 150 to 230 mAh g&#8208;1 with a significant improvement of 53%. However, LCO suffers serious problems of H1&#8208;3/O1 phase transformation, unstable interface between cathode and electrolyte, and irreversible oxygen redox reaction at 4.7 V. Herein, interface stabilization and band structure modification are proposed to strengthen the crystal structure of LCO for stable cycling of LCO at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.7 V. Gradient distribution of magnesium and uniform doping of nickel in Li layers inhibit the harmful phase transitions of LCO, while uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating stabilizes the LCO&#8208;electrolyte interface during cycles. Moreover, the modified band structure improves the oxygen redox reaction reversibility and electrochemical performance of the modified LCO. As a result, the modified LCO has a high capacity retention of 78% after 200 cycles at 4.7 V in the half cell and 63% after 500 cycles at 4.6 V in the full cell. This work makes the capacity of LCO one step closer to its theoretical specific capacity.

         <title>Walking Ferroelectric Liquid Droplets with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of ferroelectric liquid dropletson a ferroelectric solid substrate is controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on which side of the ferroelectric substrate is exposed to light. Moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate.








Abstract
The motion of ferroelectric liquid sessile droplets deposited on a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal, in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate. This behavior is understood as due to the coupling between the polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

         <title>Cuproptosis Induced by ROS Responsive Nanoparticles with Elesclomol and Copper Combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2212267, Nianzeng Xing, Haihua Xiao, and co&#8208;workers provides a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by ROS&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new cell death that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells, which induces cell death. However, existing Cu ionophores are small molecules with a short blood half&#8208;life making it hard to transport enough Cu into cancer cells. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer (PHPM) is designed, which is used to co&#8208;encapsulate elesclomol (ES) and Cu to form nanoparticles (NP@ESCu). After entering cancer cells, ES and Cu, triggered by excessive intracellular ROS, are readily released. ES and Cu work in a concerted way to not only kill cancer cells by cuproptosis, but also induce immune responses. In vitro, the ability of NP@ESCu to efficiently transport Cu and induce cuproptosis is investigated. In addition, the change in the transcriptomes of cancer cells treated with NP@ESCu is explored by RNA&#8208;Seq. In vivo, NP@ESCu is found to induce cuproptosis in the mice model with subcutaneous bladder cancer, reprograming the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, NP@ESCu is further combined with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand&#8208;1&#160;antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). This study provides the first report of combining nanomedicine that can induce cuproptosis with &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#160;for enhanced cancer therapy, thereby providing a novel strategy for future cancer therapy.

Immunotherapy
In article 2212267, Haihua Xiao, Nianzeng Xing, and co&#8208;workers present a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.

Perovskite Solar Modules
In article number 2211593, Yang Wang, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy of vapor&#8208;assisted defect passivation to manage defects in perovskite solar modules. CS2 can strongly coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, resulting in remarkable enhancement of the device efficiency (25.20% for 0.08 cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6 cm2).

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, proteins perform various recognition&#8208;mediated molecular functions relying on the principle of molecular complementarity. This review introduces how diverse synthesizable and modifiable materials with elaborate structural and molecular designs can achieve the molecular complementarity in mediating complex protein&#8208;like functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions, expanding the landscape of their proteomimetic applications.








Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique 3D structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on the understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of nanogap electrode fabrication protocols according to new classification principles is provided. How to integrate molecules into nanogap electrodes to form molecular junctions and highlight recent efforts toward the commercialization of molecular circuits are summarized, eventually overcoming the Achilles&#8217; heel of molecular electronics as a whole.








Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with the desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing, and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit are comprehensively grouped into three categories: 1) directly bridging one&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode component with another electrode, 2) physically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components, and 3) chemically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components. Finally, the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization is discussed and perspectives are provided, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulations in superconductors are summarized comprehensively, which includes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and those established methods. The significance of modulations in exploring the superconductivity is highlighted by applications into several newly discovered superconductors. Three directions for development of modulations are also outlined.








Abstract
The importance of modulations is elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, have been utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which can stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations toward a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <title>Ferroelectric Transistors for Memory and Neuromorphic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and their applications are comprehensively reviewed, with an in&#8208;depth analysis of ferroelectric transistors and their array structures. The relevant technological issues and their solutions are also discussed. This review provides a roadmap for the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memory and neuromorphic devices based on ferroelectric transistors.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials have been intensively investigated for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory devices in the past decades, owing to their nonvolatile polarization characteristics. Ferroelectric memory devices are expected to exhibit lower power consumption and higher speed than conventional memory devices. However, non&#8208;complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and degradation due to fatigue of traditional perovskite&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have hindered the development of high&#8208;density and high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memories in the past. The recently developed hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have attracted immense attention in the development of advanced semiconductor devices. Because hafnia is typically used in CMOS processes, it can be directly incorporated into current semiconductor technologies. Additionally, hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectrics show high scalability and large coercive fields that are advantageous for high&#8208;density memory devices. This review summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectric devices, especially ferroelectric transistors, for next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications. First, the types of ferroelectric memories and their operation mechanisms are reviewed. Then, issues limiting the realization of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric transistors and possible solutions are discussed. The experimental demonstration of ferroelectric transistor arrays, including 3D ferroelectric NAND and its operation characteristics, are also reviewed. Finally, challenges and strategies toward the development of next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications based on ferroelectric transistors are outlined.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of proton exchange membrane based electrolyzers is highly dependent on the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. The recent progress on the design of acidic OER electrocatalysts is reviewed, along with theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, some unresolved but urgent questions and the perspectives regarding future research for acidic OER electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency, and higher gas purity. However, PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized, classified, and discussed. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. Some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.

         <title>Paper&#8208;based Laser&#8208;pyrolyzed Electrofluidics: An Electrochemical Platform for Capillary&#8208;driven Diagnostic Bioassays</title>

Abstract
Microfluidic paper&#8208;based analytical devices (&#956;PADs) are indispensable tools for disease diagnostics. The integration of electronic components into &#956;PADs enables new device functionalities and facilitates the development of complex quantitative assays. Unfortunately, current electrode fabrication methods often hinder capillary flow, considerably restricting &#956;PAD design architectures. Here, we present laser&#8208;induced graphenization as an approach to fabricate porous electrodes embedded into cellulose paper. The resulting electrodes not only have high conductivity and electrochemical activity, but also retain wetting properties for capillary transport. We demonstrate paper&#8208;based electrofluidics, including (i) a lateral flow device for injection analysis of alkaline phosphatase in serum and (ii) a vertical flow device for quantitative detection of HPV16 with a CRISPR&#8208;based assay. We expect that this platform will streamline the development of diagnostic devices that combine the operational simplicity of colorimetric lateral flow tests with the added benefits and possibilities offered by electronic signaling.

         <title>The importance of effective ligand concentration to direct epithelial cell polarity in dynamic hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Epithelial cysts and organoids are multicellular hollow structures formed by correctly polarized epithelial cells. Important in steering these cysts from single cells is the dynamic regulation of extracellular matrix presented ligands, and matrix dynamics. Here, we&#160;introduce control over the effective ligand concentration, decoupled from bulk and local mechanical properties, in synthetic dynamic supramolecular hydrogels formed through non&#8208;covalent crosslinking of supramolecular fibers. Control over the effective ligand concentration is realized by (1) keeping the ligand concentration constant, but changing the concentration of non&#8208;functionalized molecules or by (2) varying the ligand concentration, while keeping the concentration of non&#8208;functionalized molecules constant. Our&#160;results show that in 2D, the effective ligand concentration within our&#160;supramolecular fibers rather than gel stiffness (from 0.1 to 8&#160;kPa) regulates epithelial polarity. In 3D, increasing the effective ligand concentration from 0.5 to 2&#160;mM strengthens the effect of increased gel stiffness from 0.1 to 2&#160;kPa, to synergistically yield more correctly polarized cysts. Through integrin manipulation, we&#160;show that epithelial polarity is regulated by tension&#8208;based homeostasis between cells and matrix. Our&#160;results reveal the effective ligand concentration as influential factor in regulating epithelial polarity and provide insights on engineering of synthetic biomaterials for cell and organoid culture.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics: Combination of diagnosis, therapy, and regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The journey of ceramics in medicine has been synchronized with an evolution from the first generation (bioinert, white in color)&#8212;bulk materials like alumina and zirconia to the third (white in color)&#8212;3D scaffolds capable of driving tissue regeneration. However, most of those bioceramics are limited to dental restoration and bone tissue regeneration. There is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming member called oxygen&#8208;deficient or colored bioceramics&#8212;yellow, green, blue, grey, black, etc.&#8212;found recently their way through biomedical applications. The oxygen vacancy steers the light absorption toward visible and NIR regions making the colored bioceramics multifunctional&#8212;therapeutic, and diagnostic while preserving the regenerative properties. Oxygen deficient bioceramics are capable of turning light into heat and reactive oxygen species for photothermal and photodynamic therapies respectively, and concomitantly yield infrared and photoacoustic images. Different types of oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics have been recently developed through various synthesis routes. Some of them like TiO2&#8208;x, MoO3&#8208;x, and WOx have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest has yet to scrutinize. In this timely review, the fourth generation of bioceramics is introduced and their compositions, synthesis routes, and diverse biomedical applications are summarized and discussed in detail. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure through easy procedures making them stand out in the biomaterial's family. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review, but these problems come from ceramics generally not the colored ones like brittleness, optimizing porosity versus mechanical properties during the processing, etc. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.

         <title>Bioinspired Processing: Complex Coacervates as Versatile Inks for 3D Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printable complex coacervate biomaterial inks composed of hyaluronic acid and chitosan are developed. Fine&#8208;tuning of the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the polymers results in inks that are printable both in air and in water without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Produced cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability.








Abstract
3D bioprinting is a powerful fabrication technique in biomedical engineering, which is currently limited by the number of available materials that meet all physicochemical and cytocompatibility requirements for biomaterial inks. Inspired by the key role of coacervation in the extrusion and spinning of many natural materials, hyaluronic acid&#8211;chitosan complex coacervates are proposed here as tunable biomaterial inks. Complex coacervates are obtained through an associative liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation driven by electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged macromolecules. They offer bioactive properties and facile modulation of their mechanical properties through mild physicochemical changes in the environment, making them attractive for 3D bioprinting. Fine&#8208;tuning the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the constituent polymers results in biomaterial inks that are printable in air and water. The biomaterial ink, initially a viscoelastic fluid, transitions into a viscoelastic solid upon printing due to dehydration (for printing in air) or due to a change in pH and ionic composition (for printing in solution). Consequently, scaffolds printed using the complex coacervate inks are stable without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Fabricated cell culture scaffolds are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability. These results pave the way to a new class of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle tunable biomaterials for biofabrication.

         <title>Ultrafast Superfilling Construction of a Metal Artificial Interface for Long&#8208;Term Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superfilling strategy using thiourea molecules for kinetic regulation is demonstrated as an effective approach for constructing metal artificial interfaces. Owing to the coordination of thiourea molecules with metal ions, instantaneous nucleation of Sn is regulated into progressive nucleation. The constructed Sn@Zn anode is conducive to uniform nucleation and 2D&#160;diffusion growth of zinc during the battery cycling.








Abstract
Zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anodes are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale, highly safe energy&#8208;storage systems. However, their cycling life is associated with instability issues such as dendritic growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. Introducing an artificial metal interface is expected to help overcome this challenge owing to the optimization of the absorption, nucleation, and growth of Zn2+.

     alt="Ultrafast Superfilling Construction of a Metal Artificial Interface for Long-Term Stable Zinc Anodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A superfilling strategy using thiourea molecules for kinetic regulation is demonstrated as an effective approach for constructing metal artificial interfaces. Owing to the coordination of thiourea molecules with metal ions, instantaneous nucleation of Sn is regulated into progressive nucleation. The constructed Sn@Zn anode is conducive to uniform nucleation and 2D&#160;diffusion growth of zinc during the battery cycling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc (Zn)-metal anodes are promising candidates for large-scale, highly safe energy-storage systems. However, their cycling life is associated with instability issues such as dendritic growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. Introducing an artificial metal interface is expected to help overcome this challenge owing to the optimization of the absorption, nucleation, and growth of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this study, an ultrafast, universal, and cost-effective superfilling approach is developed to construct a metal artificial interface decorated Zn anode in situ. Most zincophilic metals, including Sn, Cu, and Ag, can be used to construct a homogenous interface without any restrictions on the size, morphology, or curvature of the substrates. With Sn as a proof-of-concept demonstration, the as-obtained Sn@Zn anode is conducive for the homogenous Zn nuclei and 2D&#160;diffusion of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Symmetric cells with Sn@Zn electrodes can be operated for over 900&#160;h at different current densities. This superior performance contributes to the attractive electrochemical characteristics of both coin and scaled-up Sn@Zn//&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells. Given the facile and cost-effective fabrication and recyclability of the cells, this work enables the efficient design and exploration of Zn anodes for research, industrialization, and commercialization purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Host Materials for Both D&#8211;A&#8208;Type and Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters toward Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs with Nearly 30% EQE</title>

A feasible molecular&#8208;design strategy of versatile hosts, featuring a twisted 3D&#160;structure, for both donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type and multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters is proposed, which enables highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with external quantum efficiencies nearly 30%.








Abstract
Fabricating solution&#8208;processible host material for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter remains a formidable challenge for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, two new host materials, namely 3CzAcPy and 9CzAcPy, are found to exhibit high triplet energy levels, high thermal stability, and excellent film morphology from a solution process. An in&#8208;depth analysis on the photophysical data and device performance reveals the isomeric effect of the host materials has a significant impact not only on the host properties, but also on the host&#8211;dopant interactions and thus the performance of the resulting solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. Impressively, the new hosts are proven to be suitable for both donor&#8211;acceptor type and multi&#8208;resonance TADF emitters, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance. By using the new host 9CzAcPy, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on a donor&#8211;acceptor TADF emitter of DPAC&#8208;PCN, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29.5% is achieved, and solution&#8208;processed narrowband OLED based on a multiple&#8208;resonance TADF emitter of BN&#8208;CP1 acquires a maximum EQE of 26.6%. These efficiencies represent the highest values among the solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs. This study highlights the significance of host&#8211;dopant interactions in modulating the electroluminescence performance of TADF emitters, and provides an effective design principle for solution&#8208;processible host materials.

         <title>Rapid and Scalable Transfer of Large&#8208;Area Graphene Wafers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the engineering of interfacial forces during the transfer process, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized, which is compatible with batch production of graphene wafers on target substrates.








Abstract
Recently, scalable production of large&#8208;area graphene films on metal foils with promising qualities is successfully achieved by eliminating grain boundaries, wrinkles, and adlayers. The transfer of graphene from growth metal substrates onto functional substrates remains one inescapable obstacle on the road to the real commercial applications of chemical vaport deposition (CVD) graphene films. Current transfer methods still require time&#8208;consuming chemical reactions, which hinders its mass production, and produces cracks and contamination that strongly impede performance reproducibility. Therefore, graphene transfer techniques with fine intactness and cleanness of transferred graphene, and improved production efficiency would be ideal for the mass production of graphene films on destination substrates. Herein, through the engineering of interfacial forces enabled by sophisticated design of transfer medium, the crack&#8208;free and clean transfer of 4&#8208;inch&#8208;sized graphene wafers onto silicon wafers within only 15&#160;min is realized. The reported transfer method is an important leap over the long&#8208;lasting obstacle of the batch&#8208;scale graphene transfer without degrading the quality of graphene, bringing the graphene products close to the real applications.

         <title>Achieving Superior Tensile Performance in Individual Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rapid advances in the engineering application prospects of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) materials necessitate an urgent in&#8208;depth understanding of their mechanical properties. We demonstrate unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni&#8208;TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength&#8208;to&#8208;Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8764;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first&#8208;principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. Our investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nano&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical devices.

         <title>A Photopatternable Conjugated Polymer with Thermal&#8208;Annealing&#8208;Promoted Interchain Stacking for Highly Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photoresponsive polymers can be conveniently used to fabricate anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials through photopatterning. However, an unsolved problem is that ambient light and heat can damage anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns on photoresponsive polymers. Herein, we develop photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials by photopatterning and thermal annealing of a photoresponsive conjugated polymer (MC&#8208;Azo). MC&#8208;Azo contains alternating azobenzene and fluorene units in the polymer backbone. To prepare an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material, an MC&#8208;Azo film is irradiated with polarized blue light through a photomask, and then thermally annealed under the pressure of a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200 &#176;C. A key for the stability is that thermal annealing promotes interchain stacking, which converts photoresponsive MC&#8208;Azo to a photostable material. Another key for the stability is that the conjugated structure endows MC&#8208;Azo with desirable thermal properties. This study shows that the design of photopatternable conjugated polymers with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking provides a new strategy for the development of highly stable and secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Reactive Deposition Versus Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA): A Key to Highly Active Single Atom co&#8208;Catalysts in Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, the use of single atoms (SAs) has become of a rapidly increasing significance in photocatalytic H2 generation; here SA noble metals (mainly Pt SAs) can act as highly effective co&#8208;catalysts. The classic strategy to decorate oxide semiconductor surfaces with maximally dispersed SAs relies on &#8220;strong electrostatic adsorption&#8221; (SEA) of suitable noble metal complexes. In the case of TiO2 &#8211; the classic benchmark photocatalyst &#8211; SEA calls for an adsorption of cationic Pt complexes such as [(NH3)4Pt]2+ which then are thermally reacted to surface bound SAs. While SEA is widely used in literature, in the present work we show by a direct comparison that reactive attachment based on the reductive anchoring of SAs, e.g. from hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid (H2PtCl6) leads directly to SAs in a configuration with a significantly higher specific activity than SAs deposited with SEA &#8211; and this at a significantly lower Pt loading and without any thermal post&#8208;deposition treatments. Overall, the work demonstrates that the reactive deposition strategy is superior to the classic SEA concept as it provides a direct electronically well&#8208;connected SA&#8208;anchoring and thus leads to highly active single&#8208;atom sites in photocatalysis.

In the case of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; the classic benchmark photocatalyst &#8211; SEA calls for an adsorption of cationic Pt complexes such as [(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pt]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; which then are thermally reacted to surface bound SAs. While SEA is widely used in literature, in the present work we show by a direct comparison that reactive attachment based on the reductive anchoring of SAs, e.g. from hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) leads directly to SAs in a configuration with a significantly higher specific activity than SAs deposited with SEA &#8211; and this at a significantly lower Pt loading and without any thermal post-deposition treatments. Overall, the work demonstrates that the reactive deposition strategy is superior to the classic SEA concept as it provides a direct electronically well-connected SA-anchoring and thus leads to highly active single-atom sites in photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and severe shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides seriously hinder the development of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Heterostructures, due to unique properties, have congenital advantages that are difficult to be achieved by single&#8208;component materials in regulating lithium polysulfides by efficient catalysis and strong adsorption to solve the problems of poor reaction kinetics and serious shuttling effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this review, the principles of heterostructures expediting lithium polysulfides conversion and anchoring lithium polysulfides are detailly analyzed, and the application of heterostructures as sulfur host, interlayer, and separator modifier to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are systematically reviewed. Finally, the problems that need to be solved in the future study and application of heterostructures in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are prospected. This review will provide a valuable reference for the development of heterostructures in advanced lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrical Pulse Synthesis of Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level Hydrogen Gas Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The high reliability and proven ultra&#8208;longevity make aqueous hydrogen gas (H2) batteries ideal for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the low alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) activities of expensive platinum catalyst severely hampered its widespread applications in the H2 batteries. Here, cost&#8208;effective, highly active electrocatalysts, with a model of ruthenium&#8208;nickel alloy nanoparticles in &#8764;3&#160;nm anchored on carbon black (RuNi/C) as an example, are developed by an ultrafast electrical pulse approach for beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level nickel&#8208;hydrogen gas (Ni&#8211;H2) batteries. Having a competitive low cost of about one fifth of Pt/C benchmark, this ultrafine RuNi/C catalyst displays an ultrahigh HOR mass activity of 2.34 A mg&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV (versus RHE) and an ultralow HER overpotential of 19.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. As a result, the advanced Ni&#8211;H2 (RuNi) battery can efficiently operate under all&#8208;climate conditions (from &#8208;25 to +50 &#176;C). In addition, this battery shows an excellent durability with negligible capacity and efficiency decay over 1500 cycles at various current densities from 5 to 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Notably, the Ni&#8211;H2 (RuNi) battery achieves an cell&#8208;level energy density up to 183&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 under an ultrahigh cathode Ni(OH)2 loading of 280&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (60 mAh cm&#8722;2) and a low anode Ru loading of &#8764;62.5&#160;&#956;g cm&#8722;2, thereby reaching an estimated cost of the cell stack as low as &#8764;$49.1 kWh&#8722;1, much superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8211;H2 batteries and lithium iron phosphate batteries. The advanced beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level hydrogen gas batteries provide great opportunities for practical grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>A personalized cancer vaccine that induces synergistic innate and adaptive immune responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient&#8208;specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, we present&#160;extracellular nanovesicles&#160;derived from&#160;alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC)&#160;as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient&#8208;specific neoantigens. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination directly engaged with and activated both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;leukemic immune memory. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC sufficiently served as an antigen&#8208;presenting platform that could directly activate antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multi&#8208;faceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination resulted in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia&#8208;free survivors among cytarabine&#8208;treated hosts with AML. Human AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs activated iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML&#8208;specific long&#8208;term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.

         <title>Fundamentals of Skin Bioimpedances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The bioimpedances of tissues beyond the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, contain crucial clinical information. Nevertheless, bioimpedance measurements of both the viable skin and the adipose tissue, though easy and innocuous, are not widely used, mainly because of the complex multi&#8208;layered skin structure and of the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum. Here, first, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the impedances of multi&#8208;layered tissues and apply it to skin. Afterwards, we determine strategies for the system&#8208;level design of electrodes and electronics which minimize 4&#8208;wire (or tetrapolar) measurement errors even in presence of a top insulating tissue, thus enabling non&#8208;invasive characterizations of tissues beyond the stratum corneum. As an example, we demonstrate non&#8208;invasive measurements of bioimpedances of living tissues which are beyond orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude (e.g., up to 350 times) higher stratum corneum impedances independently on extreme variations of the barrier (tape stripping) or of the skin&#8208;electrodes contact impedances (sweat). Our results can advance the development of bioimpedance systems enabling the characterization of viable skin and adipose tissues for several applications, including transdermal drug delivery and the assessment of skin cancer, obesity, dehydration, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk and multipotent adult stem cells.

         <title>Aqueous Organic Batteries Using Proton as Charge Carrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Benefiting from the merits of low cost, non&#8208;flammability and high operational safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries have emerged as promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. Among various metal&#8208;ion/non&#8208;metallic charge carriers, proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses numerous unique properties such as a fast proton diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass and a small hydrated ion radius, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. In addition, redox&#8208;active organic molecules, with the advantages of structural diversity, rich proton&#8208;storage sites and abundant resources, are considered as attractive electrode materials for APBs. However, as far as application is concerned, the charge storage and transport mechanisms of organic electrodes in APBs is still in infancy. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials and uncovering the H+ storage mechanisms are significant for the applications of organic materials in APBs. Herein, the latest research progresses on organic materials such as small molecules and polymers for APBs are reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is provided, especially on their low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;power performances, along with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes.

Among various metal-ion/non-metallic charge carriers, proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as a charge carrier possesses numerous unique properties such as a fast proton diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass and a small hydrated ion radius, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long-term life span and an excellent low-temperature electrochemical performance. In addition, redox-active organic molecules, with the advantages of structural diversity, rich proton-storage sites and abundant resources, are considered as attractive electrode materials for APBs. However, as far as application is concerned, the charge storage and transport mechanisms of organic electrodes in APBs is still in infancy. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials and uncovering the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage mechanisms are significant for the applications of organic materials in APBs. Herein, the latest research progresses on organic materials such as small molecules and polymers for APBs are reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is provided, especially on their low-temperature and high-power performances, along with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Precise Strain Tuning Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strain engineering has been utilized as an effective approach to regulate the binding of reaction intermediates and modify catalytic behavior on noble metal nanocatalysts. However, the continuous, precise control of strain for a depiction of strain&#8208;activity correlation remains a challenge. Herein, Pd&#8208;based nanooctahedrons coated with two Ir overlayers are constructed, and subject to different post&#8208;synthetic treatments to alter the amount of H intercalated into Pd core for achieving three different surface strains (o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.2%, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7%, and o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;2.1% NPs). We demonstrate that the catalytic performances on o&#8208;Pd/Ir NPs display a volcano&#8208;shaped curve against strains towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7% NPs exhibit superior catalytic performance with a mass activity of 9.38 A mgIr&#8211;1 at &#8211;0.02&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), 10.8&#8208; and 18.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C, respectively, making it one of the most active HER electrocatalysts reported to date. Density function theory (DFT) calculations verify that the moderate tensile strain on Ir(111) surfaces plays a pivotal role in optimizing the H binding energy. This work highlights a new strategy for the precise control over surface strain of nanocrystal for more efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics on Perovskite Oxides via Oxygen Vacancies for Low&#8208;Temperature and Knittable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High kinetics oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts under low temperature are critical and highly desired for temperature&#8208;tolerant energy conversion and storage devices, but remain insufficiently investigated. Herein, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite oxide (CaMnO3) nanofibers coated with reduced graphene oxide coating (V&#8208;CMO/rGO) are developed as the air electrode catalyst for low&#8208;temperature and knittable Zn&#8208;air batteries. V&#8208;CMO/rGO exhibits top&#8208;level ORR activity among perovskite oxides and shows impressive kinetics under low temperature. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the synergistic effect between metal atoms and oxygen vacancies, as well as the accelerated kinetics, enhanced electric conductivity and mass transfer over the rGO coated nanofiber 3D network contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The desorption of ORR intermediate is promoted by the regulated electron filling. The V&#8208;CMO/rGO drives knittable and flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries under a low temperature of &#8208;40 &#176;C with high peak power density of 56 mW cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of over 80 h. This study provides insight of kinetically active catalyst and facilitates the ZABs application in harsh environment.

         <title>Efficient Narrow&#8208;bandgap Mixed Tin&#8208;lead Perovskite Solar Cells via Natural Tin Oxide Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin/lead&#8208;based (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention for use in tandem solar cells. However, they are still plagued by serious carrier recombination due to inferior film properties resulting from the alloying of Sn with Pb elements, which leads to p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping behaviors. Herein, we report an effective tin oxide (SnOx) doping strategy to produce high&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films for utilization in efficient single&#8208;junction and tandem PSCs. SnOx can be naturally oxidized from tin diiodide raw powders and successfully incorporated into Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. Consequently, Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibited dramatically improved morphology, crystallization, absorption, and more interestingly, upward&#8208;shifted Fermi levels. The resulting narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with natural SnOx doping had considerably reduced carrier recombination, therefore delivering a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16% for single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable PCE of 26.01% (with a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 25.33%) for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells. This work introduces a facile doping strategy for the manufacture of efficient single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap PSCs and their tandem solar cells.

         <title>Specific Clearance of Lipopolysaccharide from Blood Based on Peptide Bottlebrush Polymer for Sepsis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary bacterial toxin that is vital to the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis associated with extremely high morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood is highly challenging because of the structural complexity and its variation between/within bacterial species. Herein, we propose a robust strategy based on phage display screening and hemocompatible peptide bottlebrush polymer design for specific clearance of targeted LPS from circulating blood. Using LPS extracted from E. coli as an example, we discover a novel peptide (HWKAVNWLKPWT) with high affinity (KD &lt; 1.0 n&#1084;), specificity, and neutralization activity (95.9 &#177; 0.1%) against the targeted LPS via iterative affinity selection coupled with endotoxin detoxification&#160;screening. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing the short peptide [poly(PEGMEA&#8208;co&#8208;PEP&#8208;1)] exhibits high LPS selectivity to reduce circulating LPS level from 2.63 &#177; 0.01 to 0.78 &#177; 0.05 EU/mL in sepsis rabbits via extracorporeal hemoperfusion (LPS clearrance ratio &gt; 70%), reversing the LPS&#8208;induced leukocytopenia and multiple organ damages significantly. This work provides a universal paradigm for developing a highly selective hemoadsorbent library fully covering the LPS family, which is promising to create a new era of precision medicine in sepsis therapy.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with an External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are strong candidates for next&#8208;generation display and lighting technologies due to their high color purity and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. However, PeLEDs are not superior to commercial organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) in efficiency, as some key parameters affecting their efficiency, such as the charge carrier transport and light outcoupling efficiency, are usually overlooked and not well optimized. Here, we report ultrahigh&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs with quantum efficiencies surpassing a milestone of 30% by regulating the charge carrier transport and near&#8208;field light distribution to reduce electron leakage and achieve a high light outcoupling efficiency of 41.82%. We apply Ni0.9Mg0.1Ox films with a high refractive index and increased hole carrier mobility as the hole injection layer to balance the charge carrier injection and insert the polyethylene glycol layer between the hole transport layer and the perovskite emissive layer to block the electron leakage and reduce the photon loss. Therefore, with the modified structure, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art green PeLEDs achieve a world&#8208;record external quantum efficiency of 30.84% (average&#8201; = &#8201;29.05 &#177; 0.77%) at a luminance of 6514&#160;cd/m2. This work provides an interesting idea to construct super high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs by balancing the electron&#8208;hole recombination and enhancing the light outcoupling.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoribbons with Enhanced Edge Nonlinear Response and Photoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
MoS2 nanoribbons have attracted an increased interest due to their properties, which can be tailored by tuning their dimensions. Herein, we demonstrate the growth of MoS2 nanoribbons and 3D triangular crystals formed by the reaction between ultra&#8208;thin films of MoO3 grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition and NaF in a sulfur&#8208;rich environment. The multilayer nanoribbons can reach up to 10&#160;&#956;m in length, and feature single&#8208;layer edges, forming a monolayer&#8208;multilayer MoS2 junction enabled by the lateral modulation in thickness. The single&#8208;layer edges of the nanoribbons show a pronounced second harmonic generation due to the symmetry breaking, in contrast to the centrosymmetric multilayer structure, which is unsusceptible to the second&#8208;order nonlinear process. A pronounced splitting of the Raman spectra was observed in MoS2 nanoribbons arising from distinct contributions from the monolayer edges and multilayer core. Nanoscale imaging reveals a blue&#8208;shifted exciton emission of the monolayer edge compared to the triangular MoS2 monolayers due to built&#8208;in local strain and disorder. We further report on an ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single MoS2 nanoribbon with a responsivity of 8.72&#215;102 A/W at 532&#160;nm, among the highest reported up&#8208;to&#8208;date for single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors. Our findings can inspire the design of MoS2 semiconductors with tunable geometries for efficient optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Se Nano&#8208;Powder Conversion into Lubricious 2D Selenide Layers by Tribochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) coatings have attracted enormous scientific and industrial interest due to their outstanding tribological behavior. The paradigmatic example is MoS2, even though selenides and tellurides have demonstrated superior tribological properties. Here, we describe an innovative in&#8208;operando conversion of Se nano&#8208;powders into lubricious 2D selenides by sprinkling them onto sliding metallic surfaces coated with Mo and W thin films. Advanced material characterization confirms the tribochemical formation of a thin tribofilm containing selenides, reducing the coefficient of friction down to below 0.1 in ambient air, levels typically reached using fully formulated oils. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations under tribological conditions reveal the atomistic mechanisms that result in shear&#8208;induced synthesis of selenide monolayers from nano&#8208;powders. The use of Se nano&#8208;powder provides thermal stability and prevents outgassing in vacuum environments. Additionally, the high reactivity of the Se nano&#8208;powder with the transition metal coating in the conditions prevailing in the contact interface yields highly reproducible results, making it particularly suitable for the replenishment of sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the long&#8208;lasting problem of TMD&#8208;lubricity degradation caused by environmental molecules. The suggested straightforward approach demonstrates an unconventional and smart way to synthesize TMDs in&#8208;operando and exploit their friction&#8208; and wear reducing impact.

In&#8208;situ Activation of Snap&#8208;through Instability in Multi&#8208;response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post&#8208;fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on&#8208;the&#8208;fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in&#8208;situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.S1 S2S3S4S5S6S7S8

&lt;p&gt;Snap-through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non-monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform.
