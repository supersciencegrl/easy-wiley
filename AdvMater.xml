         <title>Organic Semiconductors with Halogenated Quinoid Terminals for Sensitive Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible molecular engineering strategy that synergistically suppresses high&#8208;frequency molecular vibrations while enhancing intramolecular charge transfer is achieved through the introduction of highly&#8208;electronegative halogenated quinoid terminals. Consequently, low&#8208;energy&#8208;disordered organic semiconductors with photoresponse &gt;1.6 &#181;m are developed, which enable a record&#8208;high specific detectivity among organic photodetectors operating beyond 1.4 &#181;m and are employed to demonstrate an advanced SWIR active&#8208;matrix imaging system.








ABSTRACT
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) detection and imaging is vital for optoelectronics, and solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductors pave the way for developing large&#8208;area, cost&#8208;effective SWIR sensor arrays compatible with readout integrated circuits through facile pattern&#8208;free processing. However, limited by the energy gap law, molecular skeleton vibrations, especially high&#8208;frequency stretching modes like C&#9472;H bonds, induce accelerated non&#8208;radiative decay in SWIR molecules, making the performance of SWIR organic photodetectors (OPDs), particularly in the long&#8208;wavelength region, still lag behind that of commercial inorganic counterparts. Here we develop an efficient molecular engineering strategy to construct vibration&#8208;suppressed SWIR molecules by employing halogenated quinoid terminals. Relative to their analogs with H atoms, halogenated semiconductors show attenuated exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, decreased conformation and energy disorder, as well as enhanced intramolecular charge transfer, resulting in nearly doubled exciton lifetimes and reduced energy disorder from 103 to 66&#8211;83 meV, accompanied by 0.1&#8211;0.15&#160;eV optical bandgap narrowing. The optimized SWIR OPDs achieve broadband photoresponse (0.3&#8211;1.6&#160;&#181;m) and high specific detectivities up to 2.11 &#215; 1011 Jones at 1.03&#160;&#181;m, overwhelming all reported OPDs with &gt;1.4&#160;&#181;m response and comparable to Ge photodetectors in 0.9&#8211;1.4&#160;&#181;m range. Furthermore, we demonstrate an advanced active&#8208;matrix OPD&#8208;based SWIR imaging system prototype, showcasing applicability in diverse SWIR scenarios.

         <title>Ligand Engineering of Ultrasmall CsPbI3 Quantum Dots via In Situ SN2 Substitution Enables Bright Rec. 2020 Pure&#8208;Red Perovskite LEDs with Exceptional Current Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkyl iodide&#8208;assisted SN2 ligand substitution strategy was developed for the synthesis of ultrasmall&#8208;sized CsPbI3 quantum dots with exceptional optoelectronic properties. The resultant spectrally stable Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red perovskite LEDs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of over 20%, a maximum luminance of 13,132 cd m&#8722;2, and a high current efficiency of over 20&#160;cd A&#8722;1.








ABSTRACT
Ultrasmall&#8208;sized cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for achieving spectrally stable pure&#8208;red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) meeting Rec. 2020 standards. However, the corresponding devices hardly achieve satisfactory external quantum efficiency (EQE), current efficiency (CE), and luminance simultaneously because of the use of largely excessive insulating long&#8208;chain ligands and additional difficulties in the defect control of ultrasmall CsPbI3 QDs. Herein, we develop an alkyl iodide&#8208;assisted ligand modulation strategy for CsPbI3 QDs toward high&#8208;efficiency and bright pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. We elucidate an in&#8208;situ nucleophilic bimolecular (SN2) substitution reaction between the oleylamine and additionally incorporated short&#8208;chain 1&#8208;iodooctane (IO) molecules during the materials synthesis. The reaction&#8208;generated hydriodic acid (HI) induces non&#8208;destructive surface etching of QDs, enabling exceptional luminescent properties of the strongly confined products. In addition, the SN2 reaction&#8208;derived secondary amine strongly adsorbs at the surface of QDs, which stabilizes the products with a reduced ligand density, simultaneously enhancing photoluminescence stability and electrical properties of the assembled emissive layers. The resultant devices emitting at 632&#160;nm demonstrate a peak EQE of 21.56%, an impressive luminance of 13,132&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and an exceptional CE of 20.73&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which outperforms state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Rec. 2020 pure&#8208;red PeLEDs utilizing ultrasmall&#8208;sized colloidal CsPbI3 QDs.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Solid Ionic Liquid&#8208;Polymer Hybrid Electrolyte for Shuttle&#8208;Free and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc&#9472;Bromine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid ionic liquid&#8208;polymer hybrid electrolyte is proposed to achieve shuttle&#8208;free and dendrite&#8208;free aqueous Zn&#9472;Br batteries. Synergetic effects between Zn2+ selective conduction of polyanionic network and polybromide complexing additive suppress the shuttle effect and improve Zn reversibility. Therefore, a 120 mAh Zn&#9472;Br pouch cell delivers an excellent lifespan of 1500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of over 99.0%.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous static zinc&#9472;bromine (Zn&#9472;Br) batteries hold promise for grid&#8208;scale energy storage but still suffer from severe polybromide shuttling and poor Zn reversibility. Here, we develop a quasi&#8208;solid ionic liquid&#8208;polymer hybrid electrolyte by integrating a sulfonated polymer matrix with anchored 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (BMI+) cations. The fixed &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups construct highly Zn2+ selective conduction channels, while BMI+ forms strong electrostatic interactions with the polymer, generating immobilized ionic&#8208;liquid domains that effectively capture polybromides. This hybrid design transforms BMI+ from a soluble additive into a structural component of the quasi&#8208;solid framework, thereby enabling simultaneous dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping and shuttle suppression. With this multifunctional regulation, the Zn&#9472;Br batteries achieve a high initial capacity of 162.7 mAh g&#8722;1, a discharge plateau of &#8764;1.78&#160;V, and 25&#160;000&#8208;cycle durability at 20&#160;C. Moreover, the pouch cell with high&#8208;loading Br cathodes (&#8764;14 mgKBr cm&#8722;2) retains 90.9% capacity after 1500 cycles. This work demonstrates that quasi&#8208;solid ionic liquid&#8208;polymer hybrid electrolytes can deliver shuttle&#8208;free, long&#8208;lasting Zn&#9472;Br batteries, pointing to a promising pathway for scalable and reliable aqueous energy storage.

         <title>Effective Manipulation of Skyrmions via Strain Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a flexible wrinkled Pt/Co/Ta multilayer film with non&#8208;uniform strain distribution, the density (&#951;sk) and size (Rsk) of skyrmions were significantly manipulated by the in&#8208;plane strain gradient, demonstrating strain gradient as an efficient tool for manipulating topological spin textures.








ABSTRACT
Skyrmion&#8208;based devices hold considerable potential for memory, logic, and sensing applications, where precise control over skyrmion density and size is essential. While strain engineering offers an energy&#8208;efficient route to tune these properties, excessive strain can induce plastic deformation in magnetic films or lead to cracking, compromising the reliability of strain&#8208;mediated skyrmion control. Here, we demonstrate strain gradients as an effective additional control parameter in magnetic multilayers. By introducing microscale periodic wrinkled structures in sputtered Pt/Co/Ta multilayers, strain gradients with varying magnitudes and directions are generated. Magnetic force microscopy reveals that both skyrmion density and size vary synchronously with the in&#8208;plane strain gradient, enabling broader tunability than uniform strain approaches. Micromagnetic simulations confirm that these effects arise from strain and strain gradient modulation of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction and magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, this control strategy is reversible, cyclable, and transferable across different magnetic multilayers, providing a practical avenue for precise skyrmion engineering. This approach offers significant promise for advancing flexible spintronics, skyrmion&#8208;based memory, and neuromorphic computing architectures.

Micromagnetic simulations confirm that these effects arise from strain and strain gradient modulation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and magnetic anisotropy. Moreover, this control strategy is reversible, cyclable, and transferable across different magnetic multilayers, providing a practical avenue for precise skyrmion engineering. This approach offers significant promise for advancing flexible spintronics, skyrmion-based memory, and neuromorphic computing architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Site&#8208;Directed Unidirectional Epitaxy of Large&#8208;Scale 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an effective strategy for unidirectional epitaxial growth of 2D materials by creating single active sites on flat terraces. Using MoSe2/Au(111) as a model system, we combine MBE and first&#8208;principles calculations to reveal how these localized sites serve as symmetry&#8208;breaking nucleation centers that enforce uniform domain orientation, enabling large&#8208;scale single crystals.








ABSTRACT
Large&#8208;scale synthesis of van der Waals (vdW) layered 2D materials remain a major challenge for their integration into high&#8208;performance electronics and optoelectronics. Although the multi&#8208;grain coalescence method provides a promising route to large&#8208;area growth, its success critically depends on achieving uniform crystallographic orientation across all nucleated domains, a challenge that has not yet been fully resolved. Here, we present an effective strategy for realizing unidirectional epitaxial growth of 2D materials by controllably introducing single active sites on flat terraces. Using the heteroepitaxy of MoSe2 on Au(111) as a model system, we combine molecular beam epitaxy with first&#8208;principles calculations to validate this mechanism. We show that Se adsorption disrupts the intrinsic herringbone reconstruction of Au(111), releasing surface Au atoms that aggregate into stable dimers. These dimers act as symmetry&#8208;breaking nucleation centers, guiding the unidirectional alignment of MoSe2 domains. From the perspective of interfacial interactions, we further clarify how substrate surface activation enhances the epitaxial quality of 2D materials. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D films and provides a conceptual framework for advancing the epitaxial growth of 2D materials.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free SERS Fingerprinting of Neuroprotein Conformational Dynamics in Human Saliva</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galvanic molecular entrapment (GME) is a label&#8208;free method for detecting and quantifying neuroprotein conformational states. This technique enables direct surface binding and in situ hotspot generation around molecules, effectively overcoming challenges related to target localization and mismatched hotspot geometries. GME demonstrates enhanced SERS performance and strong quantification capability for analyzing conformational dynamics, offering promising potential for diagnostic applications in neurological disorders.








Abstract
Conformational transitions of neuroproteins are closely associated with neurological disorders and represent key biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. A reliable and label&#8208;free method for detecting and tracking these structural changes is critical for effective clinical application. In this work, a galvanic molecular entrapment (GME) strategy is presented to combine with surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for localization and label&#8208;free detection of neuroproteins. This approach integrates galvanic replacement with in situ Au surface growth to enable precise molecular entrapment and plasmonic hotspot formation directly around target analytes. Such spatial confinement optimizes analyte positioning within the electromagnetic field, thereby enhancing SERS signal intensity and overcoming geometric mismatches that typically limit sensitivity. The GME method successfully profiled neuroprotein conformational states and demonstrated strong potential for proteomic analysis. A logistic regression model applied to the spectral dataset enabled accurate classification of saliva samples from individuals with epilepsy, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and healthy controls, achieving high sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy. This integrated platform offers a non&#8208;invasive tool for neurological diagnostics and holds significant promise for advancing personalized healthcare in the management of neurological disorders.

         <title>Engineering Electronic Radial Effects for Fast Li+ Transport in Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropy&#8208;derived descriptor (Sd) captures relativistic d&#8208;orbital delocalization to screen &gt;10&#160;000 compounds, identifying monoclinic HfO2 as a fast&#8208;ion host. Flash&#8208;Joule&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;crystal HfO2 enables an ultrathin, thermally stable composite electrolyte (1.23 mS cm&#8722;1), realizing 472 Wh kg&#8722;1 in practical Ah&#8208;level NCM90&#8741;Li pouch cells.








ABSTRACT
Achieving high Li+ conductivity, near&#8208;unity transference numbers, and stable interfaces in solid&#8208;state electrolytes remains a major challenge for lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here we introduce a radial&#8208;effect design principle: relativistic expansion and spin&#8211;orbit coupling of 5d orbitals enhance s&#8211;d/p&#8211;d hybridization, weaken Li&#8211;anion interactions, and lower migration barriers. An entropy&#8208;based descriptor, Sd, trained and validated with machine learning across &gt;10,000 oxides, sulfides, and halides captures this effect. Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;guided high&#8208;throughput screening flags monoclinic HfO2, whose 5d2 radial expansion lowers migration barriers by &#8764;45% vs Sc2O3 or Y2O3. Guided by this insight, we employ millisecond flash&#8208;Joule heating to convert HfO2 into nanosized single crystals, then embed them in a Li&#8208;conductive binder to create sc&#8208;HfO2@LCB, whose radial coupling yields interconnected Li+ pathways (1.23 mS cm&#8722;1, 30&#176;C; tLi + = 0.82, 25&#176;C) and a 4.8&#160;V electrochemical window. Operando Raman/XANES confirms faster Li+ transport. Consequently, 2 Ah LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2&#8214;Li pouch cells deliver &#8764;472&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (stack&#8208;level), maintain superior rate capability over hundreds of cycles, and survive 150&#176;C hot&#8208;plate tests. These results establish radial&#8208;effect engineering as a sophisticated strategy for high&#8208;performance, thermally resilient solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Reconfigurable Vertical Schottky Photodiodes Based on Ferroelectric 2D Semiconductors for Perceptual&#8208;Precision, Context&#8208;Aware Neuromorphic Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable ferroelectric photodiodes based on &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 enable analog and polarity&#8208;tunable photoresponsivity through gradual modulation of built&#8208;in fields at dual Schottky junctions. Furthermore, based on the high&#8208;density spatial integration capability, the system adaptively configures its spatial support to prioritize either suppressing environmental noise for robust feature extraction or preserving fine&#8208;grained details for precise classification, depending on the task requirements.








ABSTRACT
To realize in&#8208;memory sensing and computing platforms, it is essential to integrate sensing, computation, and memory functionalities within a single device, enabling energy&#8208; and time&#8208;efficient vision systems with high perceptual precision. However, achieving such multi&#8208;functional processing capability within a compact device structure remains a major challenge. Here, a reconfigurable vertical photodiode based on &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 is presented, a ferroelectric 2D semiconductor. Gradual and reversible modulation of built&#8208;in electric fields at the top and bottom Schottky junctions is achieved through partial out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization switching of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3, enabling multi&#8208;level, non&#8208;volatile, and polarity&#8208;tunable photoresponsivity. This allows analog programmability with a high degree of freedom in processing within a two&#8208;terminal metal&#8208;ferroelectric semiconductor&#8208;metal (MFsM) structure, effectively resolving trade&#8208;off between structural compactness and computing versatility. Leveraging these intrinsic characteristics, we demonstrate a versatile sensor&#8208;level perceptual processing framework using a reconfigurable photodiode crossbar array. By exploiting the high&#8208;density spatial integration capability, the system adaptively configures its spatial support to prioritize either suppressing environmental noise for robust feature extraction or preserving fine&#8208;grained details for precise classification, depending on the task requirements. These results lay the foundation for highly scalable and energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic vision system with high perceptual precision.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Flexible Glass&#8208;Like Antibacterial Nanocomposite Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid precursor is designed to create a multifunctional protective nanocomposite coating with Ag nanoparticles covalently embedded in the silica network for electronic displays. The solution is spray&#8208;coated and converted under mild conditions into a transparent, flexible shield. This coating integrates robust mechanical protection with potent, durable antibacterial activity, addressing a key challenge in creating safe, high&#8208;performance surfaces.








ABSTRACT
High&#8208;touch electronic displays represent a significant source of pathogenic contamination, creating an urgent need for protective coatings that combine antibacterial efficacy and mechanical robustness. However, developing protective coatings for emerging flexible displays faces a formidable challenge, as they must simultaneously satisfy a series of often&#8208;conflicting property requirements: potent antibacterial activity, high biocompatibility, excellent transparency, robust mechanical durability, as well as intrinsic flexibility. Developing a single coating that integrates all the required functionalities therefore remains a highly anticipated goal. Herein, we resolve this challenge through an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; precursor strategy involving the incorporation of the bifunctional coupling agent, 3&#8208;mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, into a perhydropolysilazane&#8208;Ag+ system. This multicomponent design enables a synergistic chemical cascade that controls the in situ formation, stabilization, and subsequent covalent anchoring of silver nanoparticles within a dense SiOx matrix during a mild curing process. The resulting coating demonstrates a seamless integration of multiple high&#8208;performance properties: potent and durable antibacterial activity (&gt;99.99%), excellent biocompatibility, polymer&#8208;like flexibility, glass&#8208;like damage tolerance, and high transparency. This work provides a reliable and scalable approach for fabricating robust, multifunctional protective surfaces, making it highly promising for next&#8208;generation flexible electronics where both durability and hygiene are paramount.

         <title>In Situ Photoelectrochemical Chelation Programs Defect&#8208;Resilient Coordination Microenvironments for Enhanced Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoelectrochemical chelation strategy is developed to dynamically passivate deep&#8208;level defects and reconstruct active sites on ZnIn2S4 photoanodes. The in situ formed Zn&#8211;O&#8211;P motifs not only suppress carrier recombination but also facilitate charge transfer, significantly enhancing oxygen evolution reaction kinetics and reducing the overpotential through optimized *OOH intermediate stabilization.








ABSTRACT
Deep&#8208;level defects function as non&#8208;radiative recombination centers that throttle oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Conventionally, static and pre&#8208;deposited passivation layers often fail during operation, disconnecting defect suppression from the creation and sustained maintenance of catalytically competent sites. Here, we address this limitation with a photoelectrochemically&#8208;driven microenvironment strategy that selectively manipulates the first coordination shell of surface Zn on ZnIn2S4. Under the in situ photoelectrochemical chelation process, hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid writes robust Zn&#8211;O&#8211;P motifs that subtly distort the Zn&#8211;S framework and convert deep traps into shallow states, thereby accelerating charge transfer while suppressing recombination. Density functional theory suggests that Zn&#8211;O&#8211;P lowers the OER overpotential and switches the rate&#8208;determining step from O*&#8594;OOH* to OOH*&#8594;O2 via stabilized *OOH intermediates. The optimized photoanode delivers a photocurrent density of 5.38&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 VRHE, surpassing previously reported ZnIn2S4&#8208;based photoanodes. By unifying in situ deep&#8208;trap management and active site construction along a single chemical pathway, this work establishes a modular and general route for dynamic defect engineering and active site reconfiguration, advancing defect&#8208;tolerant innovations in energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Mechanical and Optical Properties of Nanocluster&#8208;Silica Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;photon lithography photoresist is developed for fabricating mechanically robust and optically active metamaterials. The photoresist contains silver nanoclusters that act as photoinitiators in a polyhedraloligomeric silsequioxane polymer. The energy absorption of the printed nanolattices is among the highest for lightweight nanoporous materials. The printed metal&#8211;polymers can be converted to metal&#8208;embedded glass. Metal&#8208;embedded glass gyroid nanolattices are plasmonic and have left/right&#8208;handed transmission spectra.








ABSTRACT
Nanostructured metamaterials with complex 3D geometries can be fabricated using two&#8208;photon lithography but are typically limited to specific materials by the available photoresists. Here, we develop a two&#8208;photon lithography photoresist for fabricating mechanically robust and optically active metamaterials. This photoresist consists of silver nanocluster photointiators in a polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (POSS) polymer matrix. Printed nanocomposites show a 216% increase in elastic modulus and 166% increase in energy absorption compared to structures made of POSS, while retaining 96% elastic recovery. Nanocomposite gyroid nanolattices reach 80% strain at failure. The nanolattice energy absorption is among the highest for lightweight nanoporous materials. Thermal annealing is used to convert the printed nanocomposites to nanoparticle&#8208;embedded glass with 54% higher energy absorption than fused silica. The annealed gyroid nanolattices contain silver nanoparticles and exhibit plasmonic activity. Right and left&#8208;handed chiral nanolattices result in different transmission spectra under linearly polarized&#160;light.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Free Corrosion&#8208;Resistant Electrolyte Design for Enhanced Stability in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li metal batteries (LMBs) face limitations due to dense, costly, and corrosive fluorinated diluents in conventional LHCEs. By combining BME with benzene, we form a micelle&#8208;like solvation structure in which benzene functions as a corrosion&#8208;resistive diluent. This fluorine&#8208;free design yields an economical electrolyte that enhances both cycle and calendar life with strong industrial potential.








ABSTRACT
Advancing liquid electrolyte design is crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of current battery technologies and enabling next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Among recent developments, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) have demonstrated remarkable cycling stability. However, their reliance on fluorinated diluents, which are highly reactive with lithium metal, inevitably leads to severe spontaneous corrosion. This study introduces a fluorine&#8208;free, corrosion&#8208;resistant diluent (CRD) strategy, employing benzene as the CRD in combination with amphiphilic butyl methyl ether as the primary solvent. This electrolyte design simultaneously extends both cycle and calendar life by promoting an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure, while the diluent effectively suppresses lithium metal corrosion. As a result, the CRD&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits outstanding durability and stability compared to conventional LHCEs. Moreover, the fluorine&#8208;free and cost&#8208;effective electrolyte&#8211;diluent system offers strong advantages for practical applications. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of the CRD strategy to achieve stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces and provides broader insights for diverse battery chemistries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Ruthenium Complexes With Sonobleaching Ligand for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Immunogenic Sonotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasound&#8208;activated Ru(II) complex self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles for tumor accumulation. Ultrasound&#8208;triggered fragmentation and charge&#8208;reversal enhance deep penetration and uptake, releasing singlet oxygen and monocationic Ru complexes to potentiate immunogenic cell death and tumor inhibition.








ABSTRACT
Ruthenium complexes, which can be activated with precise light&#8208;induced spatiotemporal control, are recognized as promising candidates for cancer therapy. However, the inadequate tumor penetration and their dependence on light activation present challenges to deeper clinical application. Herein, we introduce a charge&#8208;reversal strategy to enhance tumor penetration and cellular uptake of RuIR783, a self&#8208;assembled metalloprodrug activated by ultrasound, thereby enabling deep tissue penetration. RuIR783 is synthesized by coordinating a Ru(II) polypyridyl complex with a heptamethine cyanine dye bearing two hydrophilic sulfonic groups. The cyanine dye component serves as both the ultrasound antenna and the self&#8208;assembly motif. RuIR783 self&#8208;assembles into large nanoparticles with negatively charged surfaces, facilitating their circulation in the bloodstream and accumulation at tumor sites. Upon ultrasound irradiation, the cyanine scaffold within the accumulated RuIR783 nanoparticles undergoes rapid sonobleaching, resulting in their transformation into smaller nanofragments with cationic surface charges. This transformation enhanced tumor penetration by 6.5&#8208;fold and cellular internalization by 4.2&#8208;fold. The generation of singlet oxygen and monocationic anticancer Ru complexes enhances the efficacy of immunogenic cell death through mitochondrial damage, achieving a 90.5% tumor inhibition rate. This study demonstrates the first ultrasound&#8208;mediated activation of metalloprodrugs for immunogenic tumor treatment through morphological transformation and charge reversal.

Herein, we introduce a charge-reversal strategy to enhance tumor penetration and cellular uptake of RuIR783, a self-assembled metalloprodrug activated by ultrasound, thereby enabling deep tissue penetration. RuIR783 is synthesized by coordinating a Ru(II) polypyridyl complex with a heptamethine cyanine dye bearing two hydrophilic sulfonic groups. The cyanine dye component serves as both the ultrasound antenna and the self-assembly motif. RuIR783 self-assembles into large nanoparticles with negatively charged surfaces, facilitating their circulation in the bloodstream and accumulation at tumor sites. Upon ultrasound irradiation, the cyanine scaffold within the accumulated RuIR783 nanoparticles undergoes rapid sonobleaching, resulting in their transformation into smaller nanofragments with cationic surface charges. This transformation enhanced tumor penetration by 6.5-fold and cellular internalization by 4.2-fold. The generation of singlet oxygen and monocationic anticancer Ru complexes enhances the efficacy of immunogenic cell death through mitochondrial damage, achieving a 90.5% tumor inhibition rate. This study demonstrates the first ultrasound-mediated activation of metalloprodrugs for immunogenic tumor treatment through morphological transformation and charge reversal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Destructive Laser Nanopatterning of Superconducting Heterostructures in Topological Sn Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate successful fabrication of high&#8208;quality &#945;&#8208;Sn/&#946;&#8208;Sn planar nanostructures with arbitrary shapes by focused laser irradiation on topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn thin films. The irradiated regions transform into atomically smooth, superconducting &#946;&#8208;Sn with a critical temperature of 3.7 K. Patterned &#946;&#8208;Sn nanowires exhibit a pronounced superconducting diode effect. This non&#8208;destructive and scalable method enables precise nanofabrication of superconducting/topological heterostructures for quantum device applications.








ABSTRACT
Heterostructures composed of superconductors and topological materials have emerged as compelling platforms for realizing topological superconductivity and fault&#8208;tolerant quantum computation. A critical bottleneck, however, lies in achieving atomically clean and structurally coherent interfaces between dissimilar materials. Here, we report the fabrication of high&#8208;quality planar heterostructures composed of the topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) &#945;&#8208;Sn and the superconducting &#946;&#8208;Sn phase, achieved by focused laser irradiation on &#945;&#8208;Sn thin films. The irradiated regions undergo a phase transition from &#945;&#8208;Sn to &#946;&#8208;Sn, exhibiting atomically smooth surfaces with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of just 0.75&#160;nm. The laser&#8208;induced &#946;&#8208;Sn demonstrates superconductivity with a critical temperature of 3.7 K and a Ginzburg&#8211;Landau coherence length (&#958;GL) of 68.2&#160;nm. Notably, &#946;&#8208;Sn nanowires patterned through this method exhibit a pronounced superconducting diode effect, reaching a maximum rectification ratio (&#951;) of 10.8%. These findings establish laser irradiation as a versatile, non&#8208;destructive, and scalable approach for fabricating high&#8208;quality &#945;&#8208;Sn/&#946;&#8208;Sn heterostructures, offering a promising route toward next&#8208;generation superconducting quantum devices.

         <title>Generative Design for Alloys: Harnessing Generative Models for Faster Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generative models are transforming alloy design by moving beyond property prediction toward the autonomous creation of compositions, processing, microstructures, and architectures. By learning probability distributions across composition, processing, and structure, these methods address combinatorial complexity, local optimization, and one&#8208;to&#8208;many design challenges. This review categorizes tasks into property optimization, inverse design, and architecture generation, outlining a future vision for integrated infrastructures that accelerate closed&#8208;loop discovery.








ABSTRACT
Generative models are redefining alloy design by moving beyond property prediction toward the autonomous creation of new compositions, processing parameters, microstructures, and architectures. Unlike conventional machine learning methods that map material descriptors to properties, generative frameworks learn the underlying probability distributions across composition, processing, and microstructure. This capability enables efficient exploration of vast design spaces while reducing the risk of local optimization. This review establishes a unified framework linking metallurgical objectives with generative modeling tasks, encompassing property optimization, inverse design for target properties, and microstructure or architecture generation. We detail how generative models address these tasks by outlining methodological foundations, highlighting representative case studies, and assessing both their strengths and limitations. Key challenges, including data scarcity, experimental uncertainty, and limited interpretability, are discussed alongside emerging opportunities in optimization&#8208;driven workflows, active learning, and automated experimentation. Together, these advances position generative modeling as a cornerstone of accelerated and autonomous alloy&#160;discovery.

         <title>Interlayer Coupling in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Heterostructures via Interfacial F&#183;&#183;&#183;S Interactions for Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection and Real&#8208;Time Motion Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer coupling in van der Waals organic&#8211;inorganic heterostructures presents a significant challenge due to inherent material discrepancies such as lattice mismatch and stacking disorder. Herein, a molecular engineering strategy is proposed to construct interlayer&#8208;coupled organic&#8211;inorganic van der Waals heterostructures through thermally&#8208;activated interfacial F&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions. This approach enables near&#8208;infrared photodetection as well as real&#8208;time motion detection and recognition.








ABSTRACT
Interlayer coupling serves as a powerful strategy for manipulating the optoelectronic characteristics of van der Waals heterostructures. Although the combination of organic and inorganic semiconductors has enabled versatile optoelectronic applications, interlayer coupling in organic&#8211;inorganic heterostructures is still limited by inherent material discrepancies such as lattice matching and stacking order. Herein, we demonstrate an interlayer&#8211;coupled organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunction achieved by interfacial noncovalent F&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions, which is composed of molecular 5,5''&#8208;bis(2&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;2,2':5',2''&#8208;terthiophene (oF&#8208;PTTTP) and 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). By leveraging the conformational flexibility afforded by the full C&#9472;C single bonds in its backbone, the oF&#8208;PTTTP molecules can self&#8208;adjust their conformations upon thermal activation. The fluorine atoms on the side chains of oF&#8208;PTTTP engage in noncovalent interactions with the sulfur atoms of MoS2 at the heterointerface, inducing a pronounced interlayer coupling effect accompanied by lattice strain. This coupling enables near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetection in a spectral range inaccessible to each individual component, yielding a specific detectivity of 1.8 &#215; 1014 Jones at 808&#160;nm, which is one of the highest values reported for organic&#8211;inorganic heterostructures. Furthermore, the device exhibits gate&#8208;tunable positive and negative photoresponses at 808&#160;nm, allowing real&#8208;time motion imaging in the NIR spectrum.

         <title>A Monolithic Ferroelectric&#8208;Ionic Duality for Stochastic&#8208;Neuromorphic Core Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferro&#8208;ionic duality FET harnessing coupled ferroelectric polarization switching and oxygen&#8208;vacancy migration enables tunable stochastic current fluctuations and reliable synaptic plasticity. These hybrid ferro&#8208;ionic dynamics are converted into Poisson spike trains for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic encoding, yielding noise&#8208;robust spiking convolutional neural networks implemented on a hafnia&#8208;based CMOS&#8208;compatible platform.








ABSTRACT
Learning under uncertainty has become increasingly critical in data&#8208;intensive artificial intelligence applications, requiring computing systems that unify deterministic and probabilistic functions. Hardware that combines stable memory with tunable stochasticity is essential for such systems, but achieving this integration within a miniaturized architecture remains significantly challenging due to intrinsic conflicts between precise memory retention and controllable stochastic variability. Here we demonstrate a hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric&#8208;ionic duality that integrates stochastic encoding and synaptic memory within a single device. By deliberately engineering the ferroelectric interface to repurpose oxygen vacancies&#8212;traditionally regarded as defects that degrade reliability in hafnia ferroelectrics&#8212;we exploit these vacancies as functional ionic components that dynamically modulate device behavior. The resulting ferroelectric&#8208;ionic dual&#8208;mode switching introduces voltage&#8208;tunable stochasticity and enhances synaptic behavior within a single device architecture. Crucially, this ferroelectric&#8208;ionic duality exhibits full complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and scalability to very&#8208;large scale integration (VLSI) system, enabled by wafer&#8208;scale atomic layer deposition&#8208;based growth of hafnia. These results establish a novel device paradigm that unifies memory, randomness, and learning capabilities within a single ferroelectric platform.

         <title>Reversible Metal Coordination Switch Enables Activatable Sonodynamic Therapy via Dual&#8208;Death and Immune Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;polymer coordination strategy was developed to construct tumor&#8208;activatable semiconductor polymer sonosensitizers. Copper coordination suppresses sonodynamic ROS generation in circulation while enabling selective reactivation in the glutathione&#8208;rich tumor microenvironment. Upon ultrasound irradiation, SPCu induces synergistic cuproptosis and PANoptosis, amplifies antitumor immunity, and achieves efficient tumor suppression with high biosafety.








ABSTRACT
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) holds great potential for disease treatment, yet its efficacy is limited by constitutive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and poor selectivity. Herein, we report a generalizable strategy using reversible metal&#8208;ion coordination to regulate the sonodynamic activity of semiconducting polymers (SPs). A diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer (SPC) serves as the coordination scaffold, where binding with transition metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Fe3+) redistributes electron density and increases the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), thereby effectively suppressing ROS generation. Among them, Cu2+ is selected as a model ion due to its reductive responsiveness to glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This enables SPCu to remain inactive during systemic circulation and become selectively reactivated within the TME. Released copper further induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cuproptosis, synergizing with ultrasound&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;driven PANoptosis. Together, this dual&#8208;death mechanism elicits robust tumor ablation, immunogenic cell death, and immune cell activation, leading to systemic antitumor immunity. Collectively, this study presents a reversible, metal coordination&#8211;based platform for constructing activatable organic sonosensitizers, offering precise SDT with immuno&#8208;therapeutic synergy.

&lt;p&gt;A redox-responsive metal&#8211;polymer coordination strategy was developed to construct tumor-activatable semiconductor polymer sonosensitizers. Copper coordination suppresses sonodynamic ROS generation in circulation while enabling selective reactivation in the glutathione-rich tumor microenvironment. Upon ultrasound irradiation, SPCu induces synergistic cuproptosis and PANoptosis, amplifies antitumor immunity, and achieves efficient tumor suppression with high biosafety.

         <title>Sub&#8208;5&#8208;Min Ultrafast Growth of Millimeter&#8208;Scale&#8208;Length Tellurium Nanowires With Broadband Bulk Photovoltaic Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a self&#8208;limiting diffusion strategy to rapidly grow ultralong Te single&#8208;crystal nanowires with uniform non&#8208;centrosymmetric spiral chain structure. The fabricated Te nanowire photodetectors exhibit broadband BPVE response, ultrahigh responsivity and detectivity, and calibration&#8208;free polarization sensitivity, enabling high&#8208;resolution polarization imaging and linear detector arrays in a single nanowire.








ABSTRACT
Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) featured by polarization&#8208;dependent photoresponse at zero external bias exhibits huge potential for exploiting next&#8208;generation photodetectors. However, the BPVE is mainly limited in the wide&#8208;bandgap ferroelectrics and complex van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures and scarcely demonstrated in narrow&#8208;bandgap vdW semiconductors. Here we develop a surface self&#8208;limiting diffusion driven growth strategy to rapidly synthesize millimeter&#8208;scale&#8208;length narrow&#8208;bandgap tellurium (Te) single&#8208;crystal nanowires with highly uniform non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure. The sub&#8208;5&#8208;min ultrafast growth&#8208;a feat not realized in prior Te synthesis arises from ultralow self&#8208;limiting diffusion and nucleation barriers of H2Te precursors in a hydrogen&#8208;assisted space&#8208;confined environment. The fabricated photodetectors show broadband BPVE response from 520 nm to 4.6 &#181;m, ultrahigh peak responsibility of 220 A/W and blackbody responsivity of 2.3 A/W, which are far superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art self&#8208;powered vdW devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate high&#8208;resolution polarization imaging and BPVE detector arrays in a single Te nanowire. This work opens perspectives of ultralong Te nanowires with robust BPVE for the development of high&#8208;performance on&#8208;chip integrated multidimensional photodetection systems.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Milliscale&#8208;Resolution Bimodal Tactile Sensor Array with Human&#8208;Skin&#8208;Like Graphesthesia Sensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To endow embodied artificial intelligence with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like sensation, multimodal sensation is required. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution multimodal perception in a compact sensing area remains challenging. Here, a bimodal tactile sensor array that achieves sub&#8208;milliscale spatial resolution of 700&#160;&#181;m and high sensor density of 226 pixels/cm2 is presented, demonstrating fine&#8208;grained multimodal perception and showing potential in embodied artificial intelligence.








ABSTRACT
Multimodal sensory integration advances the development of embodied intelligent systems and robotics with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like tactile perception. However, the difficulties in simultaneously achieving high resolution and multimodality hamper the exquisite tactile perception to differentiate information through touching. In this study, we report a sub&#8208;milliscale&#8208;resolution bimodal tactile sensor array consisting of a piezoelectric sensor array for mapping pressure magnitude distribution and a triboelectric sensor array for contact height detection, enabling the calculation of Young's modulus distribution. As compared to existing studies, the bimodal tactile sensor array achieved sub&#8208;milliscale spatial resolution of 700&#160;&#181;m and relatively high sensor density of 226 pixels/cm2, demonstrating fine&#8208;grained multimodal perception. By combining the pressure mapping information from the piezoelectric sensor array and contact height information from the triboelectric sensor array, with a rapid response time of 50&#160;ms, the Young's modulus distribution can be revealed. Furthermore, the tactile sensor array can achieve human&#8208;skin&#8208;like graphesthesia sensation and reconstruct the softness&#8208;encrypted pattern with the assistance of deep learning algorithms, providing a paradigm&#8208;shift strategy of sub&#8208;milliscale&#8208;resolution tactile perception toward embodied intelligence and robotics.

         <title>Novel Antimicrobial Nano Bacteriocin: Lactic Acid Bacteria&#8208;Derived, Self&#8208;Assembled, and Enhanced for Superior Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carrier&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly of a food&#8208;derived bacteriocin produces stable nano&#8208;antimicrobial bacteriocins (NAMBs) with enhanced solubility and broad&#8208;spectrum potency. NAMBs effectively inhibit Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative pathogens through dual mechanisms&#8212;disrupting metabolic processes and remodeling bacterial envelopes&#8212;offering a versatile and sustainable strategy to overcome antimicrobial resistance and develop next&#8208;generation antimicrobial therapeutics.








ABSTRACT
As antimicrobial resistance emerges as a critical global health threat, food&#8208;grade bacteriocin, a kind of antimicrobial peptide (AMPs), offers promising new therapies but is hampered by poor stability and water solubility. To address this, we engineered a carrier&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly strategy: a novel bacteriocin from lactic acid bacteria in fermented food was modified to increase its hydrophobicity, enabling spontaneous formation of nano&#8208;antimicrobial bacteriocins (NAMBs) in TSB, LB, and MH media. These NAMBs exhibit a broader antimicrobial spectrum and enhanced potency against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, as evidenced by markedly reduced minimum inhibitory concentrations in vitro and superior therapeutic efficacy in infected mice in vivo. Mechanistic investigations reveal targeted disruption of cell envelope metabolism: in L. monocytogenes, NAMBs fortify the peptidoglycan layer while depleting wall teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids, impairing carbohydrate metabolism and membrane transport; in A. baumannii, they downregulate fatty acid synthesis, disorder phospholipid composition, and weaken lipopolysaccharide integrity, culminating in membrane destabilization and cell death. These dual actions&#8212;disordering metabolic processes and remodeling bacterial cell walls or membranes&#8212;highlight the versatility of NAMBs. Our carrier&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly approach thus overcomes AMP stability and solubility limitations and paves the way for next&#8208;generation antimicrobial therapies.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Driven Fringe&#8208;Field Effects, Reduced Screening, and Bandgap Widening in Graphene Nanoribbons Enable Single&#8209;Molecule Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene nanoribbon (GNR)&#8208;based FETs enable single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, with 20&#160;nm GNRs exhibiting &#8764;116&#160;mV Dirac&#8208;shifts/molecule. Contrary to the preference for smooth edges, we show that engineered edge roughness strengthens anchoring, increases orbital overlap, and tunes band structure, enhancing charge transfer and sensitivity. These results yield practical design rules, positioning edge engineering as a key lever for GNR sensors.








ABSTRACT
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) offer promising platforms for single&#8208;molecule sensing due to their quasi&#8208;1D channels and discrete electronic states, providing superior sensitivity toward molecular perturbations. While prior studies emphasize smoother edges as essential for optimal performance, the potential benefits of controlled edge roughness remain largely unexplored. Additionally, most investigations focus on GNR arrays, leaving critical edge&#8208; and width&#8208;dependent factors, including fringe fields, bandgap widening, interactions between adsorbing molecules and GNR atoms, density of states (DOS) suppression, and electrostatic screening lengths, and their collective impact on sensitivity, poorly understood. Here, we fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors using individual GNRs (widths: 200&#8211;20&#160;nm) and characterized their response to molecular adsorption with perfluorooctanoic acid as the model analyte. Narrower ribbons displayed significantly enhanced sensitivity, yielding a coverage&#8208;normalized response of 116&#160;&#177;&#160;10&#160;mV per molecule in 20&#160;nm&#8208;wide GNRs (from calibrated ensemble Dirac&#8208;point shifts). Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that this heightened sensitivity arises from stronger fringe fields, width&#8208;dependent quantum confinement effects, reduced DOS, and increased edge roughness that facilitates molecular anchoring, enhanced orbital overlap, and improved charge transfer efficiency. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption that smoother edges inherently enhance sensor performance, demonstrating that controlled edge disorder substantially boosts molecular sensitivity in GNR sensors.

&lt;p&gt;Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) offer promising platforms for single-molecule sensing due to their quasi-1D channels and discrete electronic states, providing superior sensitivity toward molecular perturbations. While prior studies emphasize smoother edges as essential for optimal performance, the potential benefits of controlled edge roughness remain largely unexplored. Additionally, most investigations focus on GNR arrays, leaving critical edge- and width-dependent factors, including fringe fields, bandgap widening, interactions between adsorbing molecules and GNR atoms, density of states (DOS) suppression, and electrostatic screening lengths, and their collective impact on sensitivity, poorly understood. Here, we fabricated field-effect transistors using individual GNRs (widths: 200&#8211;20&#160;nm) and characterized their response to molecular adsorption with perfluorooctanoic acid as the model analyte. Narrower ribbons displayed significantly enhanced sensitivity, yielding a coverage-normalized response of 116&#160;&#177;&#160;10&#160;mV per molecule in 20&#160;nm-wide GNRs (from calibrated ensemble Dirac-point shifts). Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that this heightened sensitivity arises from stronger fringe fields, width-dependent quantum confinement effects, reduced DOS, and increased edge roughness that facilitates molecular anchoring, enhanced orbital overlap, and improved charge transfer efficiency. Our findings challenge the conventional assumption that smoother edges inherently enhance sensor performance, demonstrating that controlled edge disorder substantially boosts molecular sensitivity in GNR sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Built&#8208;In Polarization via Single&#8208;Atom Nickel Engineering in Hexagonal Cavities for Efficient Photoreforming of Biomass</title>

We report that anchoring single&#8208;atom Ni in Zn3In4S9 hexagonal cavities activates PEF, boosting bulk charge separation. The optimized Ni0.4&#8208;Zn3In4S9 exhibits exceptional H2 and benzaldehyde production (48.14 and 44.72 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), a 42.9% AQY at 420 nm. This work offers a new strategy to suppress bulk recombination in photocatalysis.








ABSTRACT
Rapid bulk charge recombination in crystalline semiconductors remains a critical bottleneck hindering the scalability of photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Here, we report that precise anchoring of single&#8208;atom nickel into the hexagonal cavities of crystalline Zn3In4S9 activates a strong built&#8208;in polarization electric field (PEF), which dramatically enhances charge separation. The optimized Ni0.4&#8208;Zn3In4S9 shows hydrogen production and benzaldehyde (BAD) generation rates of 48.14 and 44.72&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, corresponding to 22.3&#8208; and 17.4&#8208;fold enhancements over the Zn3In4S9. It also exhibits a 42.9% apparent quantum yield at 420&#160;nm and exceptional stability, maintaining over 94.2% (H2) and 89.2% (BAD) activity after 48 h with 6.28&#8208; and 14.4&#8208;fold stability enhancement for hydrogen and BAD production, respectively. This work proposes an atomic&#8208;level design strategy for activating PEF in Zn3In4S9 hexagonal cavities, enabling highly efficient photoreforming of biomass derivatives.

         <title>From Thin Films to Nanodots: Bottom&#8208;Up Integration of Fe3O4 on Nb:STO for Functional Oxide Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable bottom&#8208;up fabrication of Fe3O4 nanodots on Nb:SrTiO3 using anodic alumina templates enables long&#8208;range ordered arrays with diameters down to 30 nm. STEM highlights the epitaxial growth of Fe3O4 films on Nb:SrTiO3. Complementary polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) and X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements on continuous films reveal the presence of a thin &#947;$\gamma$&#8208;Fe2O3 interlayer. The nanodots retain key crystallographic and magnetic properties of continuous films, including the Verwey transition, while exhibiting reproducible bipolar resistive switching at the nanoscale. This combined structural, magnetic, and electrical characterization establishes a robust platform for integrating ordered magnetite nanostructures into functional oxide&#8208;based nanoelectronic devices.








ABSTRACT
Epitaxial heterostructures of iron oxide thin films on oxide substrates are promising for spintronic applications. Scaling down such heterostructures into ordered nanostructures enables integration into functional devices. However, fabricating well&#8208;ordered nanostructures while retaining their structural and functional integrity remains challenging. A bottom&#8208;up approach is used to grow epitaxial Fe3O4 nanodot arrays on Nb&#8208;doped SrTiO3(Nb:STO) substrates integrating anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates combined with pulsed laser deposition. Following this method, the lateral confinement of Fe3O4 into 30 and 70&#160;nm nanodots with 3D long&#8208;range ordering is then confirmed by grazing&#8208;incidence small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GISAXS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Building on this structural evidence, the Verwey transition is found to be retained, as observed in the continuous film. To explore its applicability in nanoelectronics, conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) is used to probe local electrical behavior, and reveals bipolar resistive switching at room temperature in individual nanodots, consistent with behavior observed in thin films. Together, these results establish the first demonstration of ordered epitaxial Fe3O4/Nb:STO nanodots with preserved structural, magnetic, and electrical functionalities, providing a generalizable route for nanoscale integration of complex&#160;oxides.

         <title>Exceptional Thermal Switching Performance in 2D MoS2 Due to Hexagonal to Rhombohedral Phase Transition and Polarization Switch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Active control of heat flow is crucial for managing thermal energy in sustainable technologies. However, current technologies are limited by the small switching ratio and narrow operating temperature range of thermal switching materials. Herein, we demonstrate that molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) exhibits an excellent thermal switching performance across an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of 300&#8211;1573 K, based on a reversible transition between the non&#8208;polarized hexagonal (2H) and electronically polarized rhombohedral (3R) phases. This phase transition is kinetically limited, and the presence of electric field lowers the transition barrier, dramatically reducing the temperature and pressure required to drive the phase transition. The application of the electric field results in a vertical flip from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane alignment along the pressure direction in the 2H phase (&#8220;off&#8221; state) to an in&#8208;plane polarization alignment along the electric field direction in the 3R phase (&#8220;on&#8221; state). This phase transition and polarized orientation switching, in conjunction with the significant anisotropic thermal transport properties of both phases, lead to a record&#8208;high thermal switching ratio of 15.2 at 300 K and maintains 6.6 at 1573 K. Our findings provide a new avenue for exploring high&#8208;performance thermal switch material triggered by phase transition and orientation changes in highly anisotropic materials.

         <title>Stoichiometry&#8208;Programmed MXenes via Precursor Engineering for High&#8208;Performance EMI Shielding and Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precursor carbon stoichiometry programs internal strain and oxygen substitution in Ti3AlCxO2&#8208;x, deterministically switching Ti3CxO2&#8208;xTz MXenes between highly aligned 2D nanosheets and spontaneous 1D nanoscrolls. This synthesis&#8208;stage architecture control enables ultrathin X/W&#8208;band EMI shielding with outstanding mass&#8208;normalized performance and bending durability, and high&#8208;rate supercapacitor performance with robust cycling stability, providing an application&#8208;specific design lever within established MXene processing workflows.








ABSTRACT
Device&#8208;level performance in MXenes is dictated by architecture&#8212;planar nanosheets are optimal for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, while scrolled structures enhance ion transport for energy storage&#8212;particularly when morphology is programmed at synthesis. Whether such architectures can be deterministically encoded through precursor stoichiometry remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that precise carbon stoichiometry control in Ti3AlCxO2&#8208;x MAX phases tunes internal lattice strain and thereby directs the emergent MXene architecture. Carbon&#8208;rich precursors (x = 1.94) yield strain&#8208;relieved, high&#8208;crystalline nanosheets with metallic conductivity (&#8764;23&#160;300&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), enabling ultrathin films with record&#8208;high EMI shielding performances across X&#8208; and W&#8208;bands (&#8805; 2.0 &#215; 106&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1 at 8.2&#160;GHz for 29&#160;nm; 108&#160;dB at 100&#160;GHz for 8 &#181;m) and robust W&#8208;band retention after 5,000 bending cycles (r = 2.5&#160;mm). In contrast, carbon&#8208;deficient precursors (x = 1.71) introduce lattice compression and oxygen substitution, triggering spontaneous scrolling upon delamination. The resulting nanoscrolls offer exceptional ion accessibility, achieving 657&#160;F g&#8722;1 at 2&#160;mV s&#8722;1 with 99.4% retention over 12&#160;000 cycles. This stoichiometry&#8208;programmed approach establishes a synthesis&#8208;stage lever linking MAX chemistry to MXene architecture and function, enabling application&#8208;specific architecture design within established MAX/MXene synthesis and solution&#8208;processing workflows for next&#8208;generation electronics and energy storage.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; MAX phases tunes internal lattice strain and thereby directs the emergent MXene architecture. Carbon-rich precursors (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 1.94) yield strain-relieved, high-crystalline nanosheets with metallic conductivity (&#8764;23&#160;300&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), enabling ultrathin films with record-high EMI shielding performances across X- and W-bands (&#8805; 2.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;dB cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 8.2&#160;GHz for 29&#160;nm; 108&#160;dB at 100&#160;GHz for 8 &#181;m) and robust W-band retention after 5,000 bending cycles (r = 2.5&#160;mm). In contrast, carbon-deficient precursors (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 1.71) introduce lattice compression and oxygen substitution, triggering spontaneous scrolling upon delamination. The resulting nanoscrolls offer exceptional ion accessibility, achieving 657&#160;F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2&#160;mV s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 99.4% retention over 12&#160;000 cycles. This stoichiometry-programmed approach establishes a synthesis-stage lever linking MAX chemistry to MXene architecture and function, enabling application-specific architecture design within established MAX/MXene synthesis and solution-processing workflows for next-generation electronics and energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Dynamics and Crosslink Stability in Supramolecular Hydrogels Using Associative Exchange</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How does reorganization impact the stability of supramolecular hydrogels? In contrast to dissociative crosslink exchange, implementing associative exchange in macroscale DNA hydrogels enables decoupling of reorganization dynamics from thermal and mechanical stability. This establishes the reorganization mechanism, and its underlying thermodynamic pathway, as a key design parameter for creating robust, reconfigurable soft materials.








ABSTRACT
The design of hydrogels that combine mechanical robustness with dynamic reconfigurability remains a fundamental challenge, as increasing crosslink dissociation rates compromise network integrity. This limitation is addressed through the incorporation of an associative crosslink exchange into DNA&#8208;based supramolecular hydrogels, enabling the decoupling of network relaxation behavior from crosslink stability. The hydrogels are constructed from enzyme&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;stranded DNA that self&#8208;assembles via hybridization between complementary domains. These crosslinks can reorganize through dissociative melting or associative strand displacement reaction, yielding networks with tunable relaxation timescales spanning over three orders of magnitude. Rheological measurements and thermodynamic modeling confirm that associative exchange facilitates efficient stress dissipation without diminishing rupture strength or thermal stability. In contrast, dissociative systems inherently trade increased dynamics with mechanical weakening. This decoupling is achieved through the implementation of a catalytic reorganization pathway governed by the composition of the sample, independently of the crosslink strength. These findings establish the mechanism of reorganization as a key design parameter for engineering adaptive soft materials that combine resilience and responsiveness.

         <title>A Smart&#8208;Perception Rare Earth MOF</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design strategy has been developed for constructing high&#8208;performance smart multi&#8208;stimuli responsive scintillators (SMRS) based on rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks. An organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid SMRS capable of both active and passive perception in response to irradiation/thermal stimuli and composition tuning is reported for the first time, demonstrating significant potential in photonic barcoding and in situ perception imaging.








ABSTRACT
Smart responsive luminescent materials have attracted considerable scientific and technological interest owing to their broad optoelectronic applications. However, issues such as single responsive mode, inadequate spectral coverage, and poor environmental adaptability still hinder their diversified development. Herein, we propose the concept of smart multi&#8208;stimuli responsive scintillator (SMRS) and fabricate a new series of rare earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs) with active and passive perception capabilities. Such RE&#8208;MOFs exhibit excellent scintillation performances, including high relative light yield (max &#8764; 42,200 photons MeV&#8722;1), low dose rate detection limit (min &#8764; 128.2 nGyair s&#8722;1), and great photostability. Systematic modulation of RE3+ contents endows MOFs with tunable broadband luminescence, thereby ensuring the passive perception. The distinct photo&#8208; and radio&#8208;luminescent mechanisms lead to significant spectral contrasts under UV and X&#8208;ray irradiation. Furthermore, RE&#8208;MOFs demonstrate thermal&#8208;stimuli responsive luminescent variation since heat will influence the energy transfer processing among the organic and inorganic units. As a result, RE&#8208;MOFs autonomously produce active luminescent perception toward both irradiation and thermal stimuli. These SMRSs exhibit great potential in in situ optical imaging and high&#8208;security photonic barcodes (the widest spectral range among MOFs for photonic encoding). This study establishes a new paradigm for smart MOF&#8208;based scintillators for an advanced intelligent perception system.

         <title>Turn Nonweldable Ni&#8208;Superalloys Printable and Microstructurally Controllable</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines nonweldable Nibased superalloys fabricated by additive manufacturing, highlighting crack&#8208;initiation mechanisms and mitigation strategies, melt pool dynamics governed hierarchical microstructure evolution, and mechanical properties. Future perspectives emphasize a transition from empirical optimization toward predictive, design&#8208;driven strategies for superalloy additive manufacturing.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;based superalloys are critical materials in aerospace and power generation industries due to their exceptional high&#8208;temperature performance, achieved through carefully designed chemical compositions and meticulously controlled microstructures. Traditionally, these components are manufactured through subtractive processes that are costly and time&#8208;intensive, yet even these high&#8208;value components are prone to damage during prolonged service in harsh environments, necessitating innovative methods for manufacturing, remanufacturing, and repair. Recent advancements in 3D&#8208;printing technologies have demonstrated significant potential in addressing these needs, particularly for nonweldable Ni&#8208;based superalloys, but formidable challenges remain. Key issues include preventing crack formation, controlling crystal grain structure, and optimizing precipitate volume fraction and morphology to enhance mechanical properties. Here,&#160;an overview of the recent studies that have elucidated fundamental mechanisms underlying these challenges, such as elemental microsegregation, melt pool morphology, and the spatiotemporal distributions of microscopic defects and stresses, is presented. Based on these insights, strategies involving the optimization of printing parameters and the implementation of heat treatments are developed to improve the printability and microstructural controllability. By examining the fabrication of a turbine blade as an example, this review highlights the progress made, the persistent challenges, and future opportunities for the 3D printing of high&#8208;performance Ni&#8208;based superalloy components.

         <title>Biomass&#8208;Derived Carbon with Heavy Doping for Anode of Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pyrolysis of biomass incorporates a large number of heteroatoms into its derived carbon with expanded graphitic interlayer spacing and abundant porous structures, which contribute to the cycle life of 18&#160;000 cycles and the rate capability of 260 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1 as an anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








ABSTRACT
The potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) is anticipated to be a cost&#8208;effective candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage for the green power grid. For PIB anodes, carbon is promising owing to its conductivity and abundance. Yet, the insufficient cycle life and rate performance of the carbon anode remain the bottleneck limiting PIBs, stemming from the mismatch between the narrower graphitic interlayer spacing and the larger radius of potassium. Herein, a large number of heteroatoms (18.2 at%) are incorporated into a biomass&#8208;derived carbon. The synthesized carbon material is thus endowed with improved interlayer spacing as well as active sites and mesoporous structures. These attributes collectively contribute to outstanding cycle life (18&#160;000 cycles) and rate capability (260 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), making it a promising candidate for PIBs for grid&#8208;oriented energy storage.

         <title>Zn2+ Engineered Low&#8208;Barrier LiNbO3 Enables Visible&#8208;Light Programmable Ferroelectric Memristors for Noise&#8208;Immune Neuromorphic Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn2+ engineered LiNbO3 photonic ferroelectric memristors achieve light&#8208;induced nonvolatile switching by lowering polarization barriers and narrowing the bandgap. The device exhibits ultrastable switching voltages and multilevel resistance states, a high on/off ratio (&#8764;103), long retention (&gt; 104 s), and excellent endurance (up to 108 cycles), along with broadband photo&#8208;synaptic plasticity. Leveraging these features, an optical reservoir computing neural network achieves 98.6% recognition accuracy on noise&#8208;corrupted images, marking significant progress in bioinspired visual chip technology.








ABSTRACT
Lithium niobate (LiNbO3), owing to its unique ferroelectric polarization and excellent optical properties, has shown great potential in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic integrated devices. However, the high polarization switching energy barrier makes it difficult to achieve polarization reversal under low&#8208;power visible light, severely limiting its practical applicability. Here, Zn2+ ions were doped into the LiNbO3 lattice to modulate the local lattice structure via valence&#8208;state imbalance, effectively suppressing the formation of NbLi4+ antisite defects and reducing electron&#8208;trap density. Meanwhile, the narrowed bandgap enhanced carrier excitation efficiency and improved depolarization&#8208;field screening, lowering the polarization switching energy barrier by approximately 69% and enabling polarization reversal under low&#8208;energy visible light illumination (10&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). Accordingly, the fabricated Pt/Zn&#8208;LiNbO3/Nb:SrTiO3 optoelectronic bimodal memristor exhibits ultra&#8208;stable switching voltage characteristics, with a voltage coefficient of variation as low as 2.2%&#8211;3.2%; a high on/off ratio of approximately 103; 24 clearly distinguishable resistance states; retention exceeding 104 s; and excellent endurance up to 108 cycles. Under visible light stimulation, the device emulates multiple representative synaptic functions, including short&#8208;term to long&#8208;term memory (STP&#8211;LTP) transition, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF), and associative learning. Moreover, an optical reservoir computing neural network constructed from the device's multilevel optical memory and synaptic features achieves a high recognition accuracy of 98.6% on the noise&#8208;corrupted MNIST dataset, demonstrating robustness and visual recognition capability comparable to biological systems. This study proposes a new materials design paradigm for constructing low&#8208;barrier, high&#8208;performance ferroelectric optoelectronic systems with integrated sensing, storage, and computation functionalities.

&lt;p&gt;Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; engineered LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photonic ferroelectric memristors achieve light-induced nonvolatile switching by lowering polarization barriers and narrowing the bandgap. The device exhibits ultrastable switching voltages and multilevel resistance states, a high on/off ratio (&#8764;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), long retention (&amp;gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s), and excellent endurance (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cycles), along with broadband photo-synaptic plasticity. Leveraging these features, an optical reservoir computing neural network achieves 98.6% recognition accuracy on noise-corrupted images, marking significant progress in bioinspired visual chip technology.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium niobate (LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), owing to its unique ferroelectric polarization and excellent optical properties, has shown great potential in high-performance optoelectronic integrated devices. However, the high polarization switching energy barrier makes it difficult to achieve polarization reversal under low-power visible light, severely limiting its practical applicability. Here, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were doped into the LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; lattice to modulate the local lattice structure via valence-state imbalance, effectively suppressing the formation of Nb&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; antisite defects and reducing electron-trap density. Meanwhile, the narrowed bandgap enhanced carrier excitation efficiency and improved depolarization-field screening, lowering the polarization switching energy barrier by approximately 69% and enabling polarization reversal under low-energy visible light illumination (10&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Accordingly, the fabricated Pt/Zn-LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Nb:SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; optoelectronic bimodal memristor exhibits ultra-stable switching voltage characteristics, with a voltage coefficient of variation as low as 2.2%&#8211;3.2%; a high on/off ratio of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; clearly distinguishable resistance states; retention exceeding 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s; and excellent endurance up to 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cycles.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Optoelectronic Devices Composed of Cs3Cu2I5/Graphene/Ge Multi&#8208;Heterostructures Enabling Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Synaptic Behavior and Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cs3Cu2I5/graphene/Ge multi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based dual&#8208;functional optoelectronic device can realize high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) synaptic behavior and self&#8208;driven near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetection simultaneously. Electron trapping by B4PyMPM sites and NIR light trapping by Cs3Cu2I5 can significantly enhance the DUV synaptic and NIR photodetection performance, respectively. The applications in DUV fingerprint recognition, optoelectronic reservoir computing, and single&#8208;pixel NIR optical imaging are demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
Multi&#8208;functional optoelectronic devices that integrate the capacities of neuromorphic processing and photodetection are of pivotal importance for advancing optoelectronic techniques. Here, we present a dual&#8208;functional optoelectronic device based on a multi&#8208;heterostructure of Cs3Cu2I5/graphene/Ge, which realizes high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) synaptic behavior and self&#8208;driven near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetection simultaneously. On one hand, the device leverages the photogating effect in the Cs3Cu2I5/graphene heterostructure to produce persistent photo&#8208;conductivity, emulating synaptic behavior upon DUV light stimulation. Electron trapping by introducing B4PyMPM as capture sites significantly promotes spatial divorcement of photocarriers, guaranteeing remarkably improved synaptic characteristics. The utilizations in DUV fingerprint recognition with an accuracy of 97.8%, and optoelectronic reservoir computing with recognition accuracy reaching 100% for three 4&#8208;bit numbers are demonstrated. On the other hand, the device utilizes the photovoltaic effect in the graphene/Ge heterostructure to generate photoresponse at zero working bias, enabling self&#8208;driven photodetection upon NIR light illumination. The wide&#8208;bandgap Cs3Cu2I5 functions as an effective NIR anti&#8208;reflection layer to induce a strong light trapping effect, giving rise to boosted photoresponse properties. The excellent photoresponse supports the device in performing single&#8208;pixel NIR optical imaging. It is believed that this work is inspiring to the design of high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;functional optoelectronic devices toward integrated and intelligence applications.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of MXene Scrolls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable strategy to convert 2D MXene nanosheets into 1D nanoscrolls with high yield. This morphological transition, driven by surface termination asymmetry, unlocks distinct physicochemical properties, including electrorheological alignment, accelerated ion transport, and emergent superconductivity. These 1D MXene scrolls offer a robust platform for advancing flexible electronics, energy storage, and sensing technologies.








ABSTRACT
MXenes represent a promising class of 2D carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides known for their high electrical conductivity, hydrophilicity, mechanical strength, and unique optoelectronic properties, which have led to numerous applications. However, their scalable synthesis in 1D morphology, such as nanotubes or scrolls, has not been demonstrated yet. This work presents a versatile and scalable method for manufacturing MXene scrolls, including Ti2CTx, Ti3C2Tx, Ti3CNTx, V2CTx, Nb2CTx, and Ta4C3Tx. We demonstrate a scalable and high&#8208;yield production up to 10 g of pure scrolls with precise control over their alignment and morphology. Properties of scrolls differ from 2D flakes; e.g., a freestanding film made of scrolled Nb2CTx presents 33 times increase in electrical conductivity and shows a superconducting state below 5.2 K. Films of MXene scrolls exhibit 3 times lower density and enhanced mass transport compared to flakes, resulting in an improved performance in supercapacitor electrodes and humidity sensors. The dispersion of the scrolls in water behaves like an electrorheological fluid. Aligning scrolls in an electric field allows for circuit switching between electrically insulating and conductive states. These scrolls can be assembled into vertically aligned MXene forests, fibers, and other architectures. The availability of 1D MXene scrolls offers exciting opportunities in many fields.

         <title>Hydrogelation via Supramolecular Copolymerization of Structural Water within Adaptive Metal&#8211;Organic Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural water is harnessed as an active co&#8208;monomer to drive supramolecular polymerization in bulk water. Zinc(II) Salphen complexes confine water molecules to form hollow, metal&#8211;organic nanofibers that assemble into adaptive hydrogels with thermoresponsive mechanics and selective chiral recognition.








ABSTRACT
Water is conventionally viewed as a disruptive solvent for supramolecular materials, destabilizing directional noncovalent interactions. Here, we report a metal&#8211;organic material in which water instead acts as a structural co&#8208;monomer driving the formation of supramolecular fibers. A zinc(II) bisphenoxyimine (&#8220;Salphen&#8221;) complex featuring convergent hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor sites assembles in bulk water into long, hollow nanofibers stabilized by confined structural water molecules. Single&#8208;particle analysis and density functional theory reveal tubular architectures in which intercalated water bridges the metal centers and defines a hydrophilic inner channel. The fibers form hydrogels with thermomechanical response, chemically triggerable disassembly and enable selective chiral recognition of amino acids via water&#8208;mediated molecular&#8211;to&#8211;supramolecular information transfer. In organic solvents, the water content can be used for control over supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and hence gelation and liquefaction. Our findings establish structural water as a design element for creating adaptive, chiral, and dynamically reconfigurable metal&#8211;organic materials, offering a new paradigm to unlock this sustainable building block in supramolecular materials design.

         <title>Heterophase fcc&#8208;hcp&#8208;fcc High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanomaterials with Tailored Electron Divergence for Selective Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterophase fcc&#8208;hcp&#8208;fcc RuFeMMnMo (M&#9552;CoNi, Co, and Ni) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanomaterials have been successfully synthesized using a one&#8208;pot approach. The highly random distribution of multiple metal components and the tunable diversity of metal atomic arrangements can be realized simultaneously. By combining metals with different work functions, fcc&#8208;hcp&#8208;fcc RuFeCoNiMnMo nanoflowers present strong electronic modulations, promoting selective nitrate electroreduction to ammonia.








ABSTRACT
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction provides a broad prospect for developing green electrochemical ammonia production and efficient treatment of industrial wastewater rich in nitrate, but poses a challenge to the high activity and stability of electrocatalysts. Herein, we report the versatile and scalable one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthesis of a series of RuFeMMnMo (M&#9552;CoNi, Co, and Ni) high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanomaterials, possessing a unique face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;hexagonal close&#8208;packed&#8208;face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc&#8208;hcp&#8208;fcc) heterophase. The highly random distribution of multiple metal components and the tunable diversity of metal atomic arrangements can be realized simultaneously. Significantly, RuFeCoNiMnMo HEAs present a high Faradaic efficiency of 99.3&#8201;% and a promising yield rate of 83.35&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 toward ammonia production at &#8722;0.6&#160;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Ex/in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations have revealed that by high electron coupling of high&#8208;entropy effect, heterophase fcc&#8208;hcp&#8208;fcc RuFeCoNiMnMo HEAs have shown strong electronic modulations with charge redistributions. The positive charges and negative charges for Ru sites and Ni/Co sites promote the adsorption of key intermediates and generation of active protons, respectively, which guarantees efficient nitrate reduction due to the reduced energy barriers.

&lt;p&gt;Heterophase &lt;i&gt;fcc-hcp-fcc&lt;/i&gt; RuFeMMnMo (M&#9552;CoNi, Co, and Ni) high-entropy alloy nanomaterials have been successfully synthesized using a one-pot approach.

         <title>Spectro&#8208;Temporal Ratiometric Strategy for Thermally Invariant Optical Manometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectro&#8208;temporal ratiometric strategy is presented for thermally invariant optical manometry. In Y3In2Ga3O12:Cr3+, pressure is quantified by two self&#8208;referenced readouts: a spectral luminescence&#8208;intensity ratio defined using fixed wavelength windows and a time&#8208;gated intensity ratio derived from selected decay gates. The rigid garnet lattice suppresses thermal drift, enabling thermal invariability manometric factor values up to &#8764;7700 and &#8764;2500 K&#183;GPa&#8722;1.








ABSTRACT
Optical manometry provides noncontact pressure sensing but remains vulnerable to temperature&#8208;induced drift, where thermal expansion and nonradiative relaxation distort luminescence spectra and kinetics. We develop a spectro&#8208;temporal ratiometric approach that combines spectral and time&#8208;gated luminescence channels to decouple pressure and temperature responses and realize thermally invariant optical manometry. Using Y3In2Ga3O12:Cr3+ as a rigid&#8208;lattice host (Dq/B &#8776; 2.2), lattice stiffness minimizes thermal sensitivity SR,T, while ratiometric detection stabilizes pressure sensitivity SR,p. The resulting thermal&#8208;invariance manometric factor (TIMF) = SR,p/SR,T reaches &#8776;7700&#160;K&#183;GPa&#8722;1 in the spectral domain and &#8776;2500 K&#183;GPa&#8722;1 in the time&#8208;gated domain, with SR,p up to 51%&#183;GPa&#8722;1. These values exceed ruby benchmarks by two orders of magnitude and surpass conventional lifetime analysis by &#8764;40 times, enabling accurate, self&#8208;referenced optical pressure mapping under extreme thermo&#8208;mechanical conditions. This work provides luminescent manometry from empirical calibration to a quantitative framework for thermally reliable sensing in coupled fields.

         <title>Engineered Perfusable Hepatic Fibrosis Model via Embedded Sacrificial Bioprinting Recapitulates Stiffness&#8208;Driven Fibrogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research integrates matrix stiffness modulation, 3D multicellular interactions, and dynamic mechanical stimulation to replicate the self&#8208;perpetuating cycle of liver fibrosis, in which ECM deposition induces matrix stiffening that subsequently drives HSC activation. By incorporating dynamic perfusion, this system resolves the insensitivity of hepatocytes to physiological stiffness inherent in traditional static models, providing a novel platform for developing anti&#8208;fibrotic strategies targeting ECM remodeling and mechanosensitive signaling pathways.








ABSTRACT
Hepatic fibrosis, as the common pathological endpoint of chronic liver diseases, is characterized by a self&#8208;perpetuating vicious cycle comprising extracellular matrix (ECM) driven liver tissue stiffening and sustained hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. Although existing studies have simulated fibrotic microenvironments using 2D models with tunable matrix stiffness or static 3D cultures, these models lack engineered hepatic sinusoidal vasculature and dynamic mechanical stimulation within 3D ECM contexts. This study employed embedded sacrificial bioprinting to construct functional liver sinusoid&#8208;mimetic vascular networks within hydrogel matrix of precisely tunable elastic modulus, establishing a dynamically perfused in vitro liver fibrosis model. Experimental validation demonstrated that matrix stiffness directly drives HSC activation, inducing marked myofibroblastic transdifferentiation. Furthermore, compared to static models, 3D dynamic perfusion significantly enhanced hepatocyte sensitivity to high&#8208;stiffness matrix, more accurately replicating the functional decline of hepatocytes in fibrotic microenvironments observed in vivo. More critically, the biomimetic in vitro platform established in this study presents a potential avenue for evaluating pharmacotherapeutic interventions against liver fibrosis. Through targeted inhibition of key signaling hubs, we achieved partial reversal of HSC activation on stiff matrix and partial recovery of liver tissue function. Overall, by simultaneously integrating matrix stiffness modulation, 3D multicellular interactions, and hemodynamic stimulation, this work effectively addresses the insufficient responsiveness of hepatocytes to mechanical cues in conventional models due to inadequate mechanical stimulation. This approach provides a robust framework for faithfully recapitulating the pathophysiological progression of liver fibrosis in vitro through precise tuning of ECM mechanical properties, thereby offering a promising platform for future drug screening and therapeutic assessment.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Carbon Dot&#8208;Loaded Cellulose Nanocrystal Chiral Superstructures With Tailorable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Change&#8208;tailorable carbon dots (CDs) dictate self&#8208;assembly pathways of biphasic cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) suspensions. Fusion of negatively charged CNC tactoids is hindered by positively charged CDs but unaffected by negatively charged CDs. Consequently, charge nature and density of CDs govern CD&#8208;loaded CNC chiral superstructures and corresponding CPL performance. Importantly, switchable CPL handedness is achieved by single&#8208;helicity chiral superstructures.








ABSTRACT
Surface charge critically influences the self&#8208;assembly and functional performance of colloidal liquid crystals. However, in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) systems, the regulatory role of guest surface charge in their self&#8208;assembly remains fundamentally unclear, hindering the rational design of adjustable high&#8208;performance CPL materials. Herein, we judiciously synthesize a series of positively and negatively charged carbon dots (P&#8208;/N&#8208;CDs) with satisfactory solid&#8208;state emission and incorporate them into colloidal cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) liquid crystal with phase adjustability via evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA). By precisely modulating the surface charge of CDs, the resulting P&#8208;/N&#8208;CD&#8208;loaded CNC (P&#8208;/N&#8208;CDCNC) chiral superstructures exhibit tailorable CPL with luminescence dissymmetry factor values from +0.16 to &#8722;0.91. The decisive role of surface charge in the EISA process is further elucidated. In situ microscopy demonstrates divergent charge&#8208;directed assembly pathways: N&#8208;CDs allow CNC tactoid fusion to proceed, whereas P&#8208;CDs arrest fusion through electrostatic crosslinking. This triggers unprecedented Janus P&#8208;CDCNC superstructures, leading to side&#8208;dependent CPL handedness. Such CDCNC superstructures with different polarization states are readily designed to patterns and sophisticated codes, which offer powerful avenues for high&#8208;security anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption. This work pioneers guest charge modulation as a universal strategy for controlling chiroptical assembly, overcoming limitations to attain handedness&#8208;adjustable, high&#8208;performance CPL from natural chiral materials.

         <title>Tuning Cu&#8211;Cu Spacing in Single&#8208;Atomic Layer Cu Catalysts for Efficient and Stable CO2&#8208;To&#8208;C2H4 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isotropic 2D Cu single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer catalyst is constructed with a precisely tuned Cu&#8211;Cu spacing of 2.35 &#197;, matching the C&#9472;C bond length of ethylene. The engineered continuum of single Cu sites stabilizes Cu&#948;+ species and significantly promotes C&#9472;C coupling in CO2 reduction, enabling 78.6% Faradaic efficiency toward C2H4 at &#8722;0.8 V with outstanding stability.








ABSTRACT
The transition to sustainable energy relies on the efficient conversion of CO2 into specific multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products, yet this process is severely hindered by the slow kinetics of C&#9472;C coupling and uncertain product selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;An isotropic 2D Cu single-atomic-layer catalyst is constructed with a precisely tuned Cu&#8211;Cu spacing of 2.35 &#197;, matching the C&#9472;C bond length of ethylene. The engineered continuum of single Cu sites stabilizes Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; species and significantly promotes C&#9472;C coupling in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, enabling 78.6% Faradaic efficiency toward C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;0.8 V with outstanding stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition to sustainable energy relies on the efficient conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into specific multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) products, yet this process is severely hindered by the slow kinetics of C&#9472;C coupling and uncertain product selectivity. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit promising catalytic performance but suffer from a fundamental limitation: their lack of contiguous active sites impedes C&#9472;C coupling. Herein, we report an innovative isotropic 2D Cu single-atomic-layer catalyst anchored on amorphous carbon substrate, designed to enhance C&#9472;C coupling and C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. By stabilizing Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;&lt;/sup&gt;

The catalyst achieved a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 78.6% for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, accompanied with high stability over 120 h.

         <title>Autonomous Hydrogel Actuators Programmed by Endogenous Biochemical Logic for Dual&#8208;Stage Morphing and Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed BSA&#8211;PEGDA bilayer actuator performs biochemical logic, bending autonomously in acid and releasing its drug payload only when both acid and pepsin are present. This dual&#8208;stage, enzyme&#8208;gated mechanism enables autonomous catch&#8208;and&#8208;release motion and controlled gastric drug delivery, representing a programmable soft material powered by endogenous biochemical cues.








ABSTRACT
Designing soft materials that autonomously respond to complex physiological environments remains a fundamental challenge in biomedical systems engineering. Here, we report on a 3D&#8208;printed hybrid protein&#8208;polymer hydrogel actuator that operates via&#160;endogenous biochemical logic, enabling fully autonomous dual&#8208;stage shape morphing and enzyme&#8208;triggered drug release in gastric&#8208;mimicking environments. The actuator comprises a bilayer structure: an active layer based on bovine serum albumin&#8208;poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (BSA&#8208;PEGDA), and a passive PEGDA layer. In acidic gastric fluid, the BSA&#8208;PEGDA layer undergoes rapid conformational swelling, followed by delayed softening from pepsin&#8208;mediated degradation, autonomously driving reversible shape transitions without manual intervention. By embedding doxorubicin (DOX) within the BSA&#8208;PEGDA hydrogel network, the system achieves site&#8208;specific, enzyme&#8208;gated drug release that is tunable using pepstatin A as a biochemical inhibitor. High&#8208;resolution digital light processing (DLP) printing enables the fabrication of complex autonomous actuators and microneedle&#8208;equipped grippers capable of mucosal adhesion, catch&#8208;and&#8208;release behavior, and controlled delivery. This work establishes a materials design strategy where biochemical cues are used as programmable inputs to drive mechanical and therapeutic outputs, offering a robust platform for bioresponsive soft robotics and in situ drug delivery.

         <title>Nanomaterials Reinforced Antifouling Coatings: From Strategic Design to Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances and emerging trends in antibacterial nanomaterials employed as surface coatings, emphasizing rational design strategies to enhance bactericidal performance and stability. Distinctive characteristics and interfacial engineering methodologies of nanocoatings tailored for combating marine biofouling, microbial corrosion, and biomedical infection are systematically discussed. Current challenges and future opportunities are also outlined for fostering economic viability and commercialization.








Abstract
Diverse microorganisms routinely organize into biofilms, posing a persistent threat to ecological contamination, industrial dysfunction, and public health. Engineered antibacterial nanomaterials, achieving several orders of magnitude reduction in bacterial viability, have emerged as broad&#8208;spectrum agents that suppress bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation while presenting a lower risk of resistance development. Embedding nanomaterials or creating nanostructures within surface coatings constitutes an effective, economical, and eco&#8208;friendly strategy for long&#8208;term biofouling mitigation in complex biological environments. Rational interfacial engineering enables mechanically robust and durable antifouling coatings on diverse substrates, unlocking applications across biomedical, environmental, and energy sectors. This review summarizes a comprehensive understanding of designing nanomaterial&#8208;integrated antifouling coatings (NACs) that correlates interfacial engineering with nano&#8208;microbe interactions. First, an overview of primary antibacterial nanomaterials employed in functional coatings, detailing fundamental properties, and antifouling mechanisms, is provided. Then, the principles of interfacial engineering for NACs are explored, emphasizing the structure&#8208;activity relationships that enhance antifouling activity, mechanical integrity, and durability. Emerging trends in the deployment of NACs for marine antifouling, antimicrobial corrosion protection, and biomedical use are subsequently highlighted. Finally, fundamental and practical challenges facing targeted NAC architectures are discussed, and perspectives for future research that bridge the gap between nanomaterial characteristics and macroscopic antifouling performance are offered.

         <title>The First Review on Nano&#8208;Agricultural Applications of MXene and MBene&#8208;Based Materials for Plant&#8208;Immunoengineering, Controlled Protection, and Inducing Biostimulation Mechanisms</title>

MXene and MBene nanomaterials show significant potential in addressing critical challenges in biomedicine, applied biology, agriculture, and the environment. From a nano&#8208;agricultural perspective, this relatively young field has witnessed emerging advances towards applications for plant&#8208;immunoengineering, biostimulation, and controlled delivery/sustained release of agrochemicals. These strategies encompass the design, fabrication, surface modification, and post&#8208;functionalization of MXene/MBene&#8208;based biomaterials, enabling the enhancement of plant defense mechanisms against biotic/abiotic stresses, as well as the promotion of growth for high&#8208;yield production to reduce the reliance on agrochemical inputs and alleviate their risks to human health and the environment. This innovative review presents comprehensive discussions on the proposed mechanisms, modes of action, biocompatibility, and future outlooks.








Abstract
Producing quality food crops with a focus on climate and environmental improvement policies has become central to modern farming and sustainability strategies. However, the rising world population and food demand have region&#8208;dependently pushed these boundaries to the overuse of agrochemical inputs. These include plant antimicrobials, pesticides, and soil fertilizers, applied to boost crop yields, reaching a critical juncture. The reliance on agrochemicals has been proven effective in priming, plant growth, and enhancing defense/resistance to biotic stressors, such as phytopathogens and invasive organisms, as well as abiotic pressures, including heat, drought, salinity, and light stress, by increasing nutrient absorption and innate immunity or adaptive stress resistance. However, increasing concerns about the safety, cost, and environmental impact of agrochemicals have intensified the necessity for applying sustainable precision technologies. Nano&#8208;agriculture has introduced emerging possibilities for utilizing low&#8208;dimensional biomaterials for plant protection/stimulation applications, once these technologies are proven safe. Among them, carbon&#8208;based MXenes and derivatives (MBenes) show potential due to their high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume area, biocompatibility at controlled doses, and tunable physicochemical/biological properties. These unique specifications support targeted delivery and sustained release, while also enhancing plant growth and stress tolerance. This comprehensive review covers their effect on seed germination, seedling maturation, plant&#8208;immunoengineering, priming, eliciting, stomatal closure, antimicrobial actions, and gene or phytohormone regulation. It also discusses their role as sustainable carriers for the delivery and release of agrochemicals and plant protection by nano&#8208;design, aiming to reduce agrochemical consumption. Lastly, we discuss the current environmental regulations for nanomaterials and recommend rational outlooks for future work.

         <title>Monolithic 3D Integration of Vertical Memory with Phototransistor for Near&#8208;Sensor Cryptography and Homomorphic Data Searching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Growing security threats require neuromorphic hardware to move beyond biological mimicry and embed cryptographic capabilities within sensory systems. This work introduces a multifunctional wafer&#8208;scale monolithic 3D architecture that integrates quantum dot&#8208;sensitized phototransistors with vertical memories. By incorporating near&#8208;sensor cryptographic engines with homomorphic associative memory, the M3D platform addresses critical security gaps in neuromorphic systems operating within resource&#8208;constrained edge environments.








Abstract
Inspired by the human retina, retinomorphic systems achieve efficient near&#8208;sensor processing by tightly integrating sensing, memory, and computing. However, unlike biological vision, which evolved without selective pressure for data confidentiality, artificial edge systems face critical security demands. Therefore, next&#8208;generation hardware must extend beyond biological mimicry by combining bio&#8208;inspired efficiency with cryptographic capabilities. Here, a compact, multifunctional wafer&#8208;scale monolithic 3D (M3D) architecture is proposed for secure in&#8208;memory processing of optically acquired visual data. Integrating quantum dot&#8208;sensitized phototransistors with stacked high&#8208;density vertical resistive random&#8208;access&#160;memories (VRRAMs) provides multi&#8208;domain entropy sources, generating physical unclonable function (PUF) keys with &#8776;50% inter&#8208;device variability. Multi&#8208;layer encryption using functionally independent PUF keys enhances cryptographic resilience through key diversity. Concurrently, M3D ternary content&#8208;addressable memory (TCAM) array, implemented with wide&#8208;bandgap IGZO transistors, achieves high sensing margin (&#8776;1.58 &#215; 105), along with 9.61&#215; area efficiency and 6.25&#215; energy&#8208;delay product improvements over planar designs. Notably, M3D sensory and TCAM systems support near&#8208;sensor hashing and in&#8208;memory Hamming distance computation directly on encrypted data, enabling application&#8208;specific homomorphism with a 94.1% similarity preservation rate. Comparable classification accuracy for plaintext and encrypted hash inputs further underscores the potential of M3D&#8208;integrated platforms for secure, privacy&#8208;preserving machine vision at the edge.

     alt="Monolithic 3D Integration of Vertical Memory with Phototransistor for Near-Sensor Cryptography and Homomorphic Data Searching"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing security threats require neuromorphic hardware to move beyond biological mimicry and embed cryptographic capabilities within sensory systems. This work introduces a multifunctional wafer-scale monolithic 3D architecture that integrates quantum dot-sensitized phototransistors with vertical memories. By incorporating near-sensor cryptographic engines with homomorphic associative memory, the M3D platform addresses critical security gaps in neuromorphic systems operating within resource-constrained edge environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the human retina, retinomorphic systems achieve efficient near-sensor processing by tightly integrating sensing, memory, and computing. However, unlike biological vision, which evolved without selective pressure for data confidentiality, artificial edge systems face critical security demands. Therefore, next-generation hardware must extend beyond biological mimicry by combining bio-inspired efficiency with cryptographic capabilities. Here, a compact, multifunctional wafer-scale monolithic 3D (M3D) architecture is proposed for secure in-memory processing of optically acquired visual data. Integrating quantum dot-sensitized phototransistors with stacked high-density vertical resistive random-access&#160;memories (VRRAMs) provides multi-domain entropy sources, generating physical unclonable function (PUF) keys with &#8776;50% inter-device variability. Multi-layer encryption using functionally independent PUF keys enhances cryptographic resilience through key diversity. Concurrently, M3D ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) array, implemented with wide-bandgap IGZO transistors, achieves high sensing margin (&#8776;1.58 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;), along with 9.61&#215; area efficiency and 6.25&#215; energy-delay product improvements over planar designs. Notably, M3D sensory and TCAM systems support near-sensor hashing and in-memory Hamming distance computation directly on encrypted data, enabling application-specific homomorphism with a 94.1% similarity preservation rate. Comparable classification accuracy for plaintext and encrypted hash inputs further underscores the potential of M3D-integrated platforms for secure, privacy-preserving machine vision at the edge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Self&#8208;Healing of Perovskite Solar Cells Using Dendrimers as Volatile Reservoirs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable self&#8208;healing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are developed through the incorporation of dendrimers with unique molecular structures and appropriately placed functional groups. Notably, even after subjecting ten harsh degradation and recovery cycles, these PSCs maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency (&gt;26%). The underlying dendrimer&#8208;driven healing mechanism is systematically investigated and clearly elucidated.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) face critical challenges owing to their intrinsic instability under harsh environmental conditions. Although various strategies are explored to enhance stability, their effects remain temporary. Herein, dendrimers are designed that serve as volatile reservoirs, enabling repeated self&#8208;healing while simultaneously enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE). PSCs containing these dendrimers achieve a PCE exceeding 26% and recover 90% of their initial PCE after ten cycles of alternating high&#8208;humidity and dry conditions. Then the self&#8208;healing mechanism is elucidated, which is facilitated by the dendrimers capturing volatile FA and interacting with PbI6 octahedra to form intermediate phases. These phenomena afford a reversible transition between perovskite and degraded perovskite phases. This approach offers a sustainable pathway toward semi&#8208;permanent PSCs by enabling continuous self&#8208;healing of perovskite materials.

         <title>Unveiling Hydrogen Coverage on Ru Nanoparticles Through Modeling and Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study illustrates the particle size&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent hydrogen coverage on Ru particles. For small nanoparticles with the appearance of corner and edge atoms, the hydrogen uptake can exceed 1 ML and even reach &gt; 2 ML. This study provides insights into the accurate characterization of nanoparticle size and the control of hydrogen poisoning, paving the way for more efficient catalyst designs.








Abstract
Understanding metal&#8208;hydrogen interactions is essential in catalysis research. Hydrogen activation on metal catalysts is crucial in industrially catalytic processes, and measurements of hydrogen uptake are widely used to estimate the dispersion of supported metal catalysts. Here, advanced computational strategies, including density functional theory (DFT), ab initio phase diagrams, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, are combined with experiments to quantitatively examine hydrogen uptake by Ru at the atomic scale. The results reveal that small Ru nanoparticles (&#8776;1&#160;nm) can adsorb more than two monolayers (ML) of hydrogen (H/Ru &gt; 2) under ambient conditions, while even for larger particles (&#8776;4.8&#160;nm), hydrogen uptake remains higher than 1.2 ML (H/Ru &gt; 1). This size&#8208;dependent behavior, confirmed experimentally using high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and chemisorption, challenges the conventional assumption of a uniform 1 ML saturation coverage on surfaces, and indicates that conventional chemisorption analyses may significantly overestimate Ru dispersion or underestimate particle size. Furthermore, DPMD simulations also qualitatively predict hydrogen uptake on Ru surfaces at ambient and working temperatures. The findings provide a more accurate database of Ru&#8211;H interactions, correcting for Ru particle size&#8211;dependent hydrogen uptake, and can potentially be applied to both academic research and industrial applications.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain&#8208;Engineered Insulating Polymer Distribution Enables High&#8208;performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering insulating polymer side chains to regulate compatibility, chain diffusivity, and docking position within components, their spatial distribution is precisely controled in active layers. This enables decoupling of photovoltaic and mechanical properties at high PMMA additive loading through its dual functionality, namely forming entangled networks within PM6 amorphous regions for stress dissipation and enhancing crystalline ordering for efficient stretchable organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) face a critical efficiency&#8208;stretchability trade&#8208;off that limits wearable applications. Here, a breakthrough molecular design strategy employing side&#8208;chain&#8208;engineered insulating polymers&#8212;poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBMA)&#8212;as multifunctional additives to simultaneously enhance electronic and mechanical properties is presented. Through synergistic control of compatibility, chain diffusivity, and docking position with PM6/Y6 components, PMMA selectively distributes in the amorphous regions of the PM6 donor while promoting molecular packing in crystalline regions, enabling dual stress&#8208;dissipation networks and efficient charge transport pathways. As a result, the rigid 10PMMA (with 10 wt.% PMMA) devices achieve a record 19.01% power conversion efficiency (PCE), while maintaining 18.53% PCE (only 2% loss) for the rigid 20PMMA (with 20 wt.% PMMA) devices. More remarkably, the stretchable 20PMMA devices exhibit exceptional mechanical robustness with 10.8% fracture strain (2.2&#8208;fold improvement) and 87% PCE retention after 100 stretching cycles (10% strain), far surpassing the control devices (50% retention). The work establishes fundamental design principles for insulating polymer additives in is&#8208;OPVs, demonstrating how molecular control over micro&#8208;/nanoscale distribution can simultaneously optimize electronic and mechanical properties. These findings provide a universal materials platform for high&#8208;performance stretchable electronics, particularly for next&#8208;generation wearable energy technologies where both efficiency and durability are paramount.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Induced Nucleation and Surface Chemical Polishing Co&#8208;Strategy for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Mixed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimolecular synergistic approach combining micelle&#8208;induced nucleation and surface chemical polishing was successfully to modulate perovskite crystallization and defect passivation of tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite (TLP) solar cells, due to their tunable bandgap, have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, the strong Lewis acidity of the tin&#8208;halide component in TLP increases the propensity for defect formation and phase separation during the fabrication process. In this study, a bimolecular synergistic regulation approach that combines micelle&#8208;induced nucleation and surface chemical polishing for crystallization control and defect passivation in TLP solar cells is introduced. The TLP precursor micelle&#8208;induced nucleation strategy modifies the characteristic of the micelles through hydrogen&#8208;bonding and selective coordination with 4&#8208;hydrazinylbenzonitrile hydrochloride (HBN), thereby lowering the critical nucleation concentration and accelerating the uniform and simultaneous nucleation of the perovskite. This crystallization control strategy significantly enhances the quality of TLP films and suppresses defect introduction during the uncontrollable film formation process. The surface chemical polishing strategy entails the passivation of TLP interface defects with hydrazine&#8208;based phenylsulfonamide hydrochloride (HSA), inhibiting the oxidation of divalent tin and optimizing charge carrier extraction at the interface. Ultimately, a TLP solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 24.01% is achieved, and the encapsulated device exhibits an T80 value of 391 h under prolonged illumination.

         <title>Universal 3D/2D Surface Heterojunction&#8208;Based Piperidine Derivatives for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure effectively enhances both efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpiperidine, a fluorinated piperidine derivative, is used to reconstruct the surface of 3D perovskite films. The steric hindrance of the piperidine ring and the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group work together to control 2D phase crystallization. This 3D/2D structure enhances electron extraction and transport, lowers defect density at the interface, and reduces carrier recombination.








Abstract
The 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure has emerged as a promising strategy to simultaneously enhance both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This work introduced a fluorinated piperidine derivative, 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpiperidine (p&#8208;CF3PiP), as a precise surface reconstruction agent for 3D perovskite. By harnessing the strong hydrophobicity of the &#9472;CF3 groups and the coordination interaction between the piperidine ring and lead iodide, this approach promotes the growth of high&#8208;n&#8208;value (n = 4) 2D perovskite, resulting in significantly improved film stability. The 3D/2D structure significantly facilitates the extraction and transport of electrons, effectively reducing the density of defect states at the interface, leading to suppressed carrier recombination. The resulting inverted PSC (with a 1.55 eV bandgap) achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.17%, along with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.194 V. This strategy demonstrates broad applicability, as flexible devices reached a PCE of 24.26%, and wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68 eV) systems achieved 22.72%. Notably, the 3D/2D heterojunction exhibits exceptional long&#8208;term stability, maintaining 99% of its initial PCE after 1730 h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 protocols at 25&#160;&#176;C, and displaying only 20% PCE degradation after 423 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under 85&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Hierarchical Amorphous&#8211;Crystalline Ceramic Nanotube Array Nanocomposites with Superior Mechanical and Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enamel&#8208;inspired amorphous/crystalline ceramic nanocomposites (EACN) with superior mechanical and functional properties is prepared. The outstanding performance is due to stiff structural skeleton of hierarchical tubular ceramic heterophase microstructures and strong polymeric interfacial adhesion provided by compositional heterogeneity. The nanocomposite has demonstrated practical value in electronic structural material for bioelectronics exemplified as a wireless tooth patch for oral health monitoring.








Abstract
Despite extensive efforts to develop high&#8208;performance ceramic nanocomposites, specially achieving both high stiffness and high damping remains challenging because these properties are typically mutually exclusive. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is developed to fabricate an enamel&#8208;inspired ceramic nanotube array nanocomposite by assembling highly ordered amorphous/crystalline&#8208;titania nanotube arrays infiltrated with a polymethyl methacrylate matrix on a large scale. This nanocomposite simultaneously exhibits high stiffness (nanoindent Young's modulus: &#8776;71.4&#160;GPa; nanoindent hardness: &#8776;4.3&#160;GPa), high damping (tan&#948;: &#8776;0.07), exceptional energy dissipation (&#8776;4.6 &#181;J &#181;m&#8722;3), and excellent fatigue resistance that surpass those of conventional and biomimetic ceramic&#8208;based materials, while also offering good processability (can be sculptured into various shapes), biocompatibility (no tissue damage or abnormal immune responses in vivo), and corrosion resistance. The remarkable mechanical performance arises from the robust amorphous/crystalline ceramic nanotube array skeleton and the abundant three&#8208;phase interfacial adhesion. This work expands the hierarchical dimensionality of enamel&#8208;like material design by precisely tailoring the heterogeneous phases within nanotubes, positioning this nanocomposite as a promising candidate for multipurpose applications that demand exceptional dynamic load&#8208;bearing capacity, exemplified by the electronic substrate of a dental patch for oral health monitoring.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Chromate Metafabric for Broadband Infrared Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiative cooling metafabric, a composite of randomly distributed high&#8208;entropy chromate nanofibers and silica nanofibers, is developed. The metafabric exhibits ultrahigh broadband infrared emissivity, thermal stability, and flexibility based on the high&#8208;entropy engineering and a 1D induced shaping strategy. It is an ideal cooling material and effectively addresses the key challenge of thermal management for spacecraft in extreme environments.








Abstract
Radiative cooling, dissipating thermal energy via electromagnetic waves, is the predominant thermal management pathway for the space industry. Developing materials that combine high broadband infrared emissivity, thermal stability, and flexibility represents a desirable yet highly challenging goal. Herein, a metafabric based on high&#8208;entropy engineering and a 1D induced shaping strategy for efficient spacecraft cooling is pioneered. Benefiting from the multiplicity absorption mechanisms and ordered structure, the engineered (La0.2Y0.2Nd0.2Gd0.2Sr0.2)CrO3 exhibits inherent thermal stability and broadband infrared emissivity. Building on this feature, the developed (La0.2Y0.2Nd0.2Gd0.2Sr0.2)CrO3 nanofibers demonstrate excellent spectral response and flexibility, enabled by restricted planar infrared scattering and randomly distributed amorphous regions. After weaving them into a fabric&#8208;like architecture, the resulting metafabric demonstrates both ultra&#8208;high emissivity within a broad IR band, flexibility, exceptional temperature resistance, and structural stability during bending. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that the metafabric exhibits additional cooling properties and a high cooling power compared to conventional cooling systems. These advancements highlight significant potential for efficient cooling in next&#8208;generation spacecraft thermal management systems.

         <title>Salt Ice VI as Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressure&#8208;induced phase transition in lithium salt solutions that forms an ionically conductive solid&#8208;state phase, salt ice VI. The resulting high&#8208;pressure electrolyte exhibits promising ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. These findings establish high&#8208;pressure phase engineering as an effective route for designing next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes beyond conventional chemical strategies.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are the decisive component of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), determining both safety and energy density. Instead of pursuing new SSEs via various synthetic methods and ever more complex chemical compositions, here a physical&#8208;phase strategy is proposed: convert simple liquid electrolytes into high&#8208;performance SSEs through pressure&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;solid transitions. Using lithium&#8208;salt aqueous solutions as a model system, the pressure&#8208;induced structural evolution is tracked in situ, and discovered that a conductive salt ice VI emerges reproducibly between 1.3 and 2.5 GPa. In situ high&#8208;pressure electrochemical measurements reveal room&#8208;temperature Li+ conductivities of 10&#8722;4&#8211;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, an activation energy of 0.87 eV, and an electrochemical stability window widens to 3.8 V. Density&#8208;functional calculations and a constructed pressure&#8208;temperature phase diagram further elucidate the favorable migration pathways and robust phase stability of salt ice VI. These findings establish pressure&#8208;phase engineering as a powerful, chemistry&#8208;agnostic route for rapidly discovering next&#8208;generation SSEs beyond traditional synthetic paradigms.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Template Vertical Epitaxial Growth of 2D Stacked Organic Cocrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the high interfacial compatibility between BTB and NTB cocrystals, OSHs are successfully constructed using a two&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase method. Through cocrystal engineering, BTB (001) surface was constructed as a template, and vertical epitaxial growth of NTB molecules was induced by motif&#8208;based assembly to form 2D OSHs. This work provides new ideas for the design and construction of epitaxial heterostructures. 








Abstract
2D organic stacked heterostructures (2D OSHs) have become an ideal material for developing on&#8208;chip integrated optoelectronic devices due to their unique interlayer coupling effects and interface engineering potentials. However, achieving a controlled synthesis of 2D OSHs remains challenging due to the inherent difficulty of regulating organic molecular orientations and overcoming thermodynamic barriers. Herein, a cocrystal engineering&#8208;based template method is reported, where cocrystals are engineered into 2D templates to induce vertical epitaxial growth of other cocrystals, enabling the large&#8208;scale synthesis of 2D OSHs. The thickness ratio of two layers can be precisely regulated and exhibits a continuously tunable emission from yellow to blue, where the OSHs with the ratio of 0.25 exhibit near&#8208;white emission (CIE: 0.33, 0.35). In addition, the OSHs exhibit excellent dual&#8208;band optical waveguide performance. This work provides a new synthesis method for OSH's functional integrated materials in the fields of optical displays and waveguides, promoting their application in the next generation of integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Four&#8208;Dimensional Dynamic Multicolor Emission in MgGa2O4:Tb3+ Through Orthogonal Modulation of Excitation Wavelength, Time, Temperature and Pressure</title>

Dynamic multicolor luminescence of MgGa2O4:Tb3+ across four dimensions of excitation wavelength, time, temperature, and pressure.








Abstract
Multimodal luminescence materials exhibiting multiple stimulus responses are highly favored in optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. However, this static luminescence under fixed stimuli remains vulnerable to replication. The development of dynamic multicolor luminescent materials offers an effective solution, yet integrating multidimensional dynamic luminescence within a single material remains challenge. Here, this work introduces Tb3+ capture centers into the self&#8208;activated luminescent host MgGa2O4&#8208;featuring an alternating layered structure and abundant defects&#8208;to construct efficient energy transfer channels. This design enables not only static multicolor luminescence dependent on concentration and interplanar spacing, but also, for the first time, stable dynamic multicolor luminescence modulated by four independent dimensions: excitation wavelength, time, temperature, and pressure. In particular, the time domain reveals dynamic photoluminescence with tunable evolution rates, as well as visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;band persistent luminescence. These unique optical properties provide strong potential for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting and visual temperature/stress sensing. Moreover, this work proposes a 4D coupled dynamic encryption system that integrates self&#8208;destruction protection and memory fault&#8208;tolerance, thereby greatly reducing the risk of information leakage. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, opening new avenues for the design of multidimensional dynamic multicolor luminescent materials.

         <title>A Multifunctional 2D&#8208;Conjugated BDT Polymer Interlayer Enables Over 20% Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D&#8208;conjugated BDT&#8208;based polymer PBDB&#8208;tvt is designed and synthesized. Acting as a multifunctional interlayer, it enhances light absorption, optimizes phase distribution, and charge behavior, enabling SD&#8208;hybrid devices to reach a PCE of 20.3% with good stability. This work highlights the importance of rational molecular design for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.








Abstract
The bicontinuous active layer morphology plays a crucial role in affecting the charge transport/recombination in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the conventional bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blending typically results in an uncontrollable vertical phase distribution, hindering further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we designed a two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymer donor PBDB&#8208;tvt by incorporating a long&#8208;conjugated side chain, chlorinated alkylthio&#8208;thiophene&#8208;vinyl&#8208;thiophene (tvt), onto the benzodithiophene (BDT) unit. The extended structure up&#8208;shifts energy level, enhances optical absorption, and improves charge transport. Interestingly, PBDB&#8208;tvt shows selective solubility in common processing solvents, making it suitable for sequential deposition. By using it as the interlayer between the electrode modification layer and bulk heterojunction, we constructed a hybrid device (functional modification layer/BHJ) configuration. The tailored structure not only brings improved phase distribution but also enhances light utilization in the short&#8208;wavelength region, which leads to a simultaneous increase of photovoltaic parameters, including open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density, and fill factor. As a result, the best device achieves a maximum PCE of 20.3%. This contribution highlights the pivotal role of a multifunctional interlayer in enhancing the light absorption and controlling the active layer morphology, providing a feasible method to further improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Fully Biocompatible Tantalum&#8208;Based Antioxidant Nanoshields for Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells&#8208;Targeted Mitochondrial Holistic Protection in Acute Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduced fully&#8208;biocompatible tantalum&#8208;based antioxidant nanoshields (fTANS) for AKI treatment. fTANS traverse the glomerular filtration barrier and are sequentially delivered to the proximal tubular epithelial cells, ultimately becoming enriched in mitochondria. fTANS effectively maintain the integrity of mitochondria by regulating ROS signals, thereby limiting apoptosis and inflammatory storms, showing excellent renoprotective effects.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has an alarmingly high annual incidence. Heterogeneous AKI shares a common pathological hallmark&#8212;excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily generated from damaged proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). Toxic ROS overload triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive inflammation, initiating pathological crosstalk and vicious cycles that exacerbate AKI progression. However, many emerging preclinical therapeutic strategies or nanotechnologies face obstacles, including poor biocompatibility, inadequate targeting, and/or complex assembly, which hinder drug delivery and clinical translation. To address these limitations, fully&#8208;biocompatible tantalum&#8208;based antioxidant nanoshields (fTANS) with megalin (PTECs receptor)&#8208;mediated active targeting have been developed. fTANS combine the elegant delivery capability from albumin coating with the superior ROS&#8208;scavenging efficiency from reduced tantalum. fTANS traverse the glomerular filtration barrier with ultra&#8208;small particle size and actively internalize into PTECs via the affinity between megalin and albumin, sequentially targeting mitochondria due to their mitochondrial affinity. By modulating ROS signals, fTANS effectively preserve mitochondria, thereby limiting cytochrome c&#8208;induced apoptosis and mitochondrial DNA&#8208;triggered cGAS/STING&#8208;mediated sterile inflammation, ultimately leading to effective treatment in AKI models. Following treatment, fTANS are cleared via renal excretion without observable toxicity, exhibiting remarkable biocompatibility. Collectively, this work represents a compelling advancement in targeted antioxidant nanomedicine, offering a promising avenue for AKI treatment.

         <title>Bioinspired Hierarchical Radiative&#8208;Phase Change Hybrid Cooling Composite with Record&#8208;Breaking Cooling Power</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired radiative&#8208;phase change hybrid composite achieves record cooling power of 226&#160;W m&#8722;2 and a 10.1 &#176;C subambient drop by integrating core&#8211;shell phase change capsules into a multilayered cellulose matrix. Combining high reflectivity, large latent heat, and homogeneous heat transfer, this scalable design enables building energy savings and supports global carbon neutrality.








Abstract
Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) offers a sustainable route to reducing cooling energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, conventional PDRC materials exhibit limited cooling power (&lt;150&#160; W m&#8722;2), insufficient for growing cooling demands. While integrating phase change materials enhances cooling capacity, to balance radiative cooling, latent heat, and heat transfer performances remains challenging due to their conflicting requirements. Inspired by the light scattering mechanism of nacre&#8208;pearl systems, hierarchically microstructured radiative&#8208;phase change hybrid cooling (RPHC) composites with a homogeneous morphology are developed via a water pre&#8208;removal strategy.

     alt="Bioinspired Hierarchical Radiative-Phase Change Hybrid Cooling Composite with Record-Breaking Cooling Power"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bioinspired radiative-phase change hybrid composite achieves record cooling power of 226&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a 10.1 &#176;C subambient drop by integrating core&#8211;shell phase change capsules into a multilayered cellulose matrix. Combining high reflectivity, large latent heat, and homogeneous heat transfer, this scalable design enables building energy savings and supports global carbon neutrality.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) offers a sustainable route to reducing cooling energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, conventional PDRC materials exhibit limited cooling power (&amp;lt;150&#160; W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), insufficient for growing cooling demands. While integrating phase change materials enhances cooling capacity, to balance radiative cooling, latent heat, and heat transfer performances remains challenging due to their conflicting requirements. Inspired by the light scattering mechanism of nacre-pearl systems, hierarchically microstructured radiative-phase change hybrid cooling (RPHC) composites with a homogeneous morphology are developed via a water pre-removal strategy. The composite combines a multilayered microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) matrix with core&#8211;shell phase change capsules (PCCs), achieving solar reflectivity of 0.969 and mid-infrared emissivity of 0.958. Efficient PCC integration provides a high latent heat of 132.1&#160; J g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This nacre-pearl-inspired design enables a record-high PRHC power of 226&#160; W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an average temperature reduction of 10.1&#160;&#176;C below ambient. Applied to building envelopes, the MFC/PCC composite reduces cooling energy use by up to 4.4%, potentially cutting global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 1.22 billion metric tons annually. Overall, this work provides innovative energy-saving materials for energy savings and carbon neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hypergap Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypergap materials, transparent above the bandgap, are introduced with optical properties unattainable in bandgap insulators, including negative permittivity, anomalous&#8208;dispersion phase matching, and negative group&#8208;velocity dispersion. High&#8208;throughput density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory searches identify over 200 candidates, and one crystal is experimentally verified, pointing to broad opportunities for plasmonics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast optics.








Abstract
Optical materials primarily refer to transparent insulators and semiconductors for guiding, diffracting, and nonlinearly&#8208;generating light at photon energies below the electronic bandgaps. This work proposes&#160;that a solid can be equally lossless, above the fundamental bandgap, in an energy interval dubbed the hypergap, when the conduction and valence bands are well&#8208;isolated. The optics within the hypergap could defy the conventional rules and limits set by the bandgap materials, including the low&#8208;loss negative permittivity unavailable in existing metals, the anomalous&#8208;dispersion phase matching in crystals without birefringence or microstructures, as well as the negative group&#8208;velocity dispersion across the visible spectrum unattainable in known dielectrics. High&#8208;throughput searches are performed in comprehensive material databases, predict over a hundred hypergap candidates, and experimentally verify one of them. Therefore, hypergap materials might lead to lower loss plasmonic metamaterials, easier wavelength converters in nonlinear optics, and simpler pulse stretchers or compressors in ultrafast optics, potentially transforming optics with unexplored material opportunities.

         <title>Achieving 20.80% Efficiency in Ternary Organic Solar Cells via Suppression of Static and Dynamic Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimeric acceptor NVN is incorporated as a guest component into the D18:L8&#8208;BO&#160;host blend to fabricate high&#8208;performance OSCs. Incorporation of NVN suppresses both dynamic and static disorder, resulting in mitigated trap states, reduced energy loss, and improved charge transport. Consequently, the D18:L8&#8208;BO:NVN&#8208;based&#160;ternary OSCs achieve a remarkable efficiency of 20.80% with superior photostability.








Abstract
Suppressing energetic disorder represents a critical pathway toward high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a ternary system is successfully developed to regulate the energetic disorder and enhance the photovoltaic performance of OSCs through strategic incorporation of a dimeric acceptor NVN into D18:L8&#8208;BO host. It is demonstrated that NVN incorporation simultaneously suppresses&#160;both&#160;static&#160;and&#160;dynamic disorder. Crucially, NVN&#8208;mediated suppression of dynamic disorder achieved through suppressing structural relaxation is identified as the dominant factor enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and minimizing non&#8208;radiative energy loss. Furthermore, NVN optimizes the double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM), induces graded vertical phase separation, and enhances molecular packing order. These morphological improvements reinforce structural regularity and mitigate static disorder. As a result, suppressed trap states, retrained energy loss, facilitated exciton dissociation, and improved charge transport are achieved in the ternary system. Owing to these synergistic effects, the D18:L8&#8208;BO:NVN&#160;ternary OSC achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.80% (certified 20.39%) with enhanced operational photostability. Overall, this work underscores the fundamental importance of energetic disorder control in achieving high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Enhancing Thermal Conductivity in Low Dielectric Polybutadiene via a Liquid Crystal Ordering Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal molecule is designed and synthesized with triphenyl mesogen and styrene end groups, which can cross&#8208;link in polybutadiene to form a network bearing LC polymers. This polymer with orderly&#8208;arranged structures exhibits an enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity, while displaying excellent dielectric properties with a low Dk and Df.








Abstract
Hydrocarbon polymers are ideal dielectric materials in microelectronic industry due to their extraordinarily low dielectric constant (Dk) and dielectric loss (Df). However, a challenge remains in improving their intrinsic thermal conductivity. This work establishes a novel method to develop hydrocarbon polymers with enhanced thermal conductivity by a liquid crystal (LC) ordering effect. An LC molecule is designed with triphenyl mesogen and styrene end groups (ST38), cross&#8208;linking in polybutadiene to form an LC polymer (ST38PB). The exploration of LC arrangement reveals that the formation of well&#8208;ordered LC domains is induced by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of triphenyl group, with its orientation being fixed by the cross&#8208;linking reaction. The LC domains demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, maintaining their structural integrity even at 260&#160;&#176;C. ST38PB exhibits an enhanced intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) of 0.62&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, which is 3.4 times that of pristine polybutadiene. Meanwhile, it displays excellent dielectric properties (Dk = 2.40, Df = 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 at 10&#160;GHz). The use of ST38PB as thermal management materials for chip cooling and dielectric substrates for printed circuit boards is investigated. The findings confirm its promising potential for applications, and this strategy can be further extended to develop other LC&#8208;based thermally conductive polymers for demanding high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Gradients of Aliveness and Engineering: A Taxonomy of Fungal Engineered Living Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper explores the potential of fungal engineered living materials (ELMs), examining fungal biology and growth mechanisms, which underpin their development. It presents a classification framework based on aliveness, scaffold composition, and engineering degree. Unique properties such as self&#8208;healing, biosensing, and bioremediation are highlighted, alongside challenges in scalability, viability, and ethical considerations.








Abstract
Filamentous fungi offer unique potential for engineered living materials (ELMs), enabling self&#8208;assembling, adaptive, and sustainable biofabrication. However, the field lacks a systematic framework to classify fungal ELMs, as they vary in biological state (dead, dormant, or living), scaffold composition, and degree of engineering intervention. Here, a classification system is introduced to categorize fungal ELMs, enabling researchers to map existing studies and guide future development. The ability to form resilient 3D networks make filamentous fungi ideal for applications ranging from self&#8208;healing composites to materials for bioremediation and real&#8208;time sensing, as demonstrated in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications. A roadmap for next&#8208;generation fungal ELMs is outlined, including spatial&#8211;temporal control of fungal states, multispecies integration for enhanced complexity, and computational modeling for predictive design. Key challenges, such as contamination control, cell viability, and bio&#8208;digital integration, are discussed alongside strategies for genetic engineering. Finally, ethical and environmental considerations are emphasized as crucial factors for the responsible scaling of fungal ELMs.

A roadmap for next-generation fungal ELMs is outlined, including spatial&#8211;temporal control of fungal states, multispecies integration for enhanced complexity, and computational modeling for predictive design. Key challenges, such as contamination control, cell viability, and bio-digital integration, are discussed alongside strategies for genetic engineering. Finally, ethical and environmental considerations are emphasized as crucial factors for the responsible scaling of fungal ELMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Structurally Adaptive Microneedle Bioelectrode
The cover illustrates a structurally adaptive microneedle bioelectrode that transforms from a bulky state into an ultrathin, compliant interface after insertion. This transition extends epidermal electronics into dermal electronics, enabling stress&#8208;free, stable, and long&#8208;term signal acquisition. More details can be found in the Research Article by Geunbae Lim and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202509719).

Hypergap Optical Materials
In the Research Article by Ling Lu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202512769), hypergap materials, transparent above the bandgap, are introduced with optical properties unattainable in bandgap insulators, including negative permittivity, anomalous&#8208;dispersion phase matching, and negative group&#8208;velocity dispersion. High&#8208;throughput density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory searches identify over 200 candidates, and one crystal is experimentally verified, pointing to broad opportunities for plasmonics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast optics.

Self&#8208;Healing Perovskites with Dendrimers
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202512410), Min Jae Ko and co&#8208;workers present a dendrimer&#8208;based self&#8208;healing strategy for perovskite solar cells. The dendrimer, with its tree&#8208;like architecture and multi&#8208;functional branches, captures volatile species released during the moisture&#8208;induced decomposition of perovskite. By acting as a volatile reservoir, it enables reversible self&#8208;healing, allowing the perovskite film to restore its pristine structure through multiple degradation cycles.

Personalized Organ&#8208;on&#8208;Chip Carotid Thrombosis Investigation
A rapid glass&#8208;substrate 3D microfabrication method creates anatomically accurate Carotid Artery&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models from stroke patient scans in two hours. These miniaturized devices replicate patient&#8208;specific blood vessel geometry and flow patterns, enabling real&#8208;time imaging of clot formation under controlled injury. This rapid biomanufacturing approach represents a significant advance in patient&#8208;specific organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip technology, with applications in personalized medicine and vascular device development. More details can be found in the Research Article by Yunduo Charles Zhao, Lining Arnold Ju, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508890).

         <title>Multiscale Failure Mechanisms of Ternary Oxide Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The failure mechanism of ternary cathode NCM is analyzed thoroughly through a cross&#8208;scale multilevel perspective, providing a deep insight into the development of advanced cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and recycling of spent cathode materials.








Abstract
Ternary oxide cathodes (LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2, NCM) have emerged as promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to high energy densities and tunable electrochemical properties. However, their structural degradation during electrochemical cycling remains challenging, with complex multiscale failure mechanisms driven by the interplay of mechanical, chemical, and electrochemical factors. These processes ultimately compromise battery activity, lifespan, and safety. To systematically unravel these failure pathways, herein, a hierarchical perspective from atomic, particle to electrode scales is adopted to dissect the origin and evolution of NCM failures. At the atomic scale, the degradation manifests as cation mixing and oxygen vacancy formation. At the particle scale, the mechanical strain accumulation induces intragranular/intergranular microcracks and particle pulverization. At the electrode scale, the failure is demonstrated by active material delamination from the current collector. Also, phase transition and side reactions across multiple scales are discussed. Furthermore, the advanced characterization techniques that enable precise identification of degradation phenomena across these scales are critically evaluated. Meanwhile, challenges in the investigation of failure mechanisms across scales are analyzed, and countermeasures are proposed. By establishing a cross&#8208;scale framework, this review aims to inspire the rational design for next&#8208;generation NCM cathode materials and even guide the recycling and reutilization of spent NCM materials for LIBs.

         <title>The Rise of AIE&#8208;Peptide Systems: Design Principles, Multifunctional Applications, and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the synergistic fusion of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens and peptides for their transformative applications in sensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. It explores modular design strategies, assesses breakthroughs in bioapplications, and discusses challenges and future directions for enhancing AIE&#8208;peptide applications, aiming to inspire new research and development.








Abstract
Peptides exhibit exceptional potential in revolutionizing sensors, diagnostics, and therapeutics due to their multifunctionality, target specificity, self&#8208;assembly capacity, microenvironment responsiveness, and inherent biocompatibility. Nevertheless, conventional peptide nanomaterials are constrained by limitations in real&#8208;time monitoring and comprehensive disease management. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) address the critical aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem of traditional fluorophores by demonstrating intensified fluorescence emission and amplified photodynamic/photothermal performance in aggregated states. The strategic coupling of AIEgens with peptides (AIE&#8208;peptide) creates a synergistic &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; platform, enabling transformative applications in sensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. This review systematically evaluates innovative design strategies and emerging applications of AIE&#8208;peptide materials through molecular engineering perspectives. First, modular design principles are elucidated, followed by critical assessments of multidimensional breakthroughs in sensing, imaging, theranostics, and the synthesis of novel materials. Furthermore, current challenges and future directions for optimizing AIE&#8208;peptide architectures and translational implementations are comprehensively discussed. Given the nascent stage and rapid development of this field, continued progress is expected to address existing limitations and broaden practical implementations across diverse disciplines. This review aims to stimulate scientific discourse and inspire innovative frameworks for developing next&#8208;generation AIE&#8208;peptide materials with heightened biomedical efficacy and clinical impact.

         <title>Reassessing Electrolyte Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Magnesium Batteries: Atomistic Structures and Performance Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines recent advances in non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes for rechargeable magnesium batteries, focusing on chlorine&#8208;containing and chlorine&#8208;free systems. It highlights the interdependent relationship between electrolyte compositions, atomistic structures, and electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Non&#8208;aqueous magnesium (Mg) batteries have attracted considerable attention as a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology, owing to the high Mg resource abundance and good safety. Nevertheless, the development of efficient non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes remains a critical challenge that hinders the practical deployment of Mg batteries. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advances, ongoing challenges, and future directions for non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes in Mg batteries, emphasizing both chlorine&#8208;containing and chlorine&#8208;free electrolytes. Furthermore, it discusses how these electrolyte systems influence the Mg stripping/plating process, particularly in terms of compatibility with the Mg metal anode, and evaluates their electrochemical stability, including the applicable voltage window. Chlorine&#8208;containing electrolytes exhibit high ionic conductivities and reversibility but present challenges related to corrosion and limited electrochemical stability. In contrast, chlorine&#8208;free electrolytes offer a more eco&#8208;friendly alternative, though often with lower ionic conductivity and limited compatibility with Mg metal anodes. This review examines electrolyte design strategies, atomistic structures, and performance optimization to outline the advantages and drawbacks of each electrolyte type. Emerging methodologies for advanced electrolyte development are also discussed. This comprehensive analysis highlights the pivotal role of electrolyte innovation in realizing the full potential of non&#8208;aqueous Mg batteries and advancing sustainable, high&#8208;performance energy storage solutions.

         <title>Bionic Intelligent Clothing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution process of bionic clothing, from color, morphology, material, to function and intelligent bionic is systematically summarized. Bionic principles, construction strategies, optimized design, and application scenarios of bionic intelligent clothing are the core and key points. The existing bottlenecks and practical solutions are thoroughly explored to guide future research.








Abstract
As an advanced outcome of interdisciplinary technological integration, bionic intelligent clothing (BIC) is driving profound transformations in human daily life. However, as an evolving frontier field, a comprehensive, in&#8208;depth, and instructive systematic review remains absent. In response, this review first combs the historical development context of BIC, discussing its evolutionary process from ancient color bionics and morphological bionics to modern intelligent bionics. Subsequently, the methodologies and action mechanisms of structural bionics are explored from micro to macro scales. Based on functional dimensions, the application practices of BIC in bionic protection, bionic appearance design, and bionic function enhancement are summarized systematically with a focus on bionic principles, construction technologies, and existing bottlenecks. During the evolution from functional bionics to intelligent bionics, intelligent temperature regulation, bionic sensing, and responsive deformation clothing have emerged as the current hotspots and mainstream research areas. Finally, the achievements and challenges in BIC commercialization are discussed. From the perspective of government&#8208;industry&#8208;university&#8208;research&#8208;application collaboration, the realistic challenges and technical bottlenecks faced in interdisciplinary applications are comprehensively analyzed, aiming to provide theoretical inspiration and practical guidance for promoting the deep integration of BIC into public daily life.

         <title>Structural and Interfacial Design of Atomically Thin Materials and Their Heterostructures for Advancing Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of atomically thin materials (ATMs) and their heterostructures in key electrocatalytic reactions, discussing synthesis methods, structure&#8211;property relationships, and mechanism&#8208;driven design strategies. It also highlights future directions involving structural optimization, scalable fabrication, advanced characterization, and AI&#8208;assisted materials design for enhanced catalytic performance.








Abstract
Atomically thin materials (ATMs) with a thickness of less than 5 nm are emerging as prominent catalysts in electrocatalysis. Their monolayer or few&#8208;layer thickness enables remarkable activities, ultrahigh atomic utilization, and extraordinary electronic structure. The construction of ATMs into heterostructures further introduces unconventional interfacial behaviors that may even overcome the scaling relationship that governs trade&#8208;offs between thermodynamic and kinetic performance metrics. In this review, a comprehensive discussion on ATMs and their heterostructures primarily applies to oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), oxygen evolution reactions (OER), hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RR) is given. Past achievements with a timeline are first highlighted, and then key methodologies for ATMs synthesis and characterization are outlined, followed by representative categories of ATMs applied in different reactions. Their structural and electronic properties&#160;are also systematically discussed, and a series of mechanism&#8208;driven design strategies, involving vacancy, doping, defects, coordination number, phase and structure, strain, and heterostructure and interface, are summarizad. Their electrocatalytic performances, along with mechanistic insight into how different strategies modulate adsorption and catalytic behaviors, are thoroughly investigated. Finally, future perspectives for ATMs are outlined, including thickness tuning, coordination structure regulation, novel heterostructures design, scalable synthesis, practical devices integration, in situ characterization advancement, and AI&#8208;assisted materials design.

         <title>From Structure to Performance: Exploring MOF&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Enhanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable porosity and functional groups improve Na transport, dendrite suppression, and interfacial stability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. This review develops structure&#8208;performance relationships which connect pore geometry, functional group chemistry, and framework flexibility to support rational MOF design. Integrating polymers or ionic liquids increases the conductivity, stability, and scalability of next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Energy storage systems (ESSs) are recognized as vital for sustaining industrial growth and the rising demand for portable and large&#8208;scale applications. Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), using abundant sodium, offer an alternative to costly lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) but face challenges with lower energy density, slow ion transport, and limited cycle stability. This review critically examines metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as next&#8208;generation electrolytes capable of addressing these challenges by following these mechanisms. High porosity and ordered channels (6&#8211;12&#160;&#197;) facilitate uniform Na+ diffusion and reduce activation barriers from 1.23 to 0.36&#160;eV, directly improving power density. Tunable functional groups with strategic electronegativity enable selective ion transport and dendrite suppression, thereby enhancing cycle stability. Framework versatility allows integration with polymers and ionic liquids, yielding ionic conductivities above 10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and boosting energy density. Charge transport occurs via both through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space pathways, with the latter achieving up to 43&#8208;fold improvements in diffusion coefficients. By consolidating these findings, the review establishes a systematic structure performance framework: pore geometry governs ionic conductivity, functional groups control ion selectivity, and framework flexibility dictates mechanical stability during cycling. This MOF electrolytes development from empirical exploration to rational design, providing guiding principles and future directions for scalable, safe, and high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Sustainable Liquid Metal Composites for Soft Electronics and E&#8208;Waste Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal (LM) composites embody recyclability, repairability, renewability, and resilience (4R), offering a sustainable route for soft electronics. With exceptional conductivity, stretchability, and eco&#8208;friendly recovery, these systems enable closed&#8208;loop lifecycles and reduce e&#8208;waste. Their integration paves the way for wearable, flexible, and recyclable devices that support a circular electronics economy.








Abstract
There has been tremendous progress in soft printable electronics with liquid metal (LM) for creating elastic, stretchable, and thin&#8208;film circuitry. However, such innovation risks outpacing sustainability. As the world moves toward softer, thinner, and more integrated electronics, these advancements may accelerate the exponential rise of electronic waste&#8212;projected to surpass 74 million tons by 2030 and reach &#8776;120 million tons by 2050. Therefore, in developing LM&#8208;based electronics, it is critical to address the urgent need for eco&#8208;friendly recycling strategies. This review proposes a paradigm shift toward recyclable, repairable, renewable, and resilient (&#8220;4R&#8221;) soft electronics enabled by LM composites. Gallium&#8208;based alloys and their eutectics, such as Galinstan and EGaIn, offer a rare convergence of high conductivity, fluidic deformability, and recyclability&#8212;ideally suited for stretchable circuits, soft robotics, and wearables. Yet, their promise remains incomplete without scalable, eco&#8208;friendly recovery methods. Advanced extraction and recycling approaches are examined, including mechanical&#8211;chemical and physicochemical methods using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and ionic liquids for selective recovery with minimal environmental impact. Emphasis is placed on materials selection, substrate compatibility, and integration strategies that enable circular lifecycles. LM composites offer a path to redefine electronics&#8212;not only for performance but also for durability, self&#8208;healing, and sustainability.

         <title>Developments in Nanopatterning of Graphene; Toward Direct Writing</title>

Overview of principal direct&#8208;write graphene patterning methodologies including focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID), laser induced graphitisation (LIG), focused ion beam (FIB), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)








Abstract
Graphene, with its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties, remains a cornerstone material for next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics. However, conventional lithographic approaches to graphene patterning are fraught with challenges, including contamination, alignment complexity, and scalability constraints. This review critically examines the evolving landscape of direct&#8208;write graphene technologies, focusing on forefront strategies such as focused electron beam&#8208;induced deposition (FEBID), polymer&#8208;to&#8208;graphene (P2G) conversion, focused ion beam (FIB) modification, and laser&#8208;assisted graphitisation. These techniques represent a departure from traditional top&#8208;down or transfer&#8208;based methods by enabling bottom&#8208;up, spatially resolved patterning without intermediary masking steps. Particular attention is devoted to the physicochemical mechanisms that underlie electron&#8208; and photon&#8208;mediated graphitisation, the role of precursor chemistry and substrate interactions, as well as the influence of beam parameters on sp2&#8208;carbon content and structural ordering. The review further delineates the limitations intrinsic to current methodologies, including partial graphitisation, resolution fidelity, and hardware constraints, and proposes a roadmap to achieve truly &#8220;direct&#8221; graphene writing. This includes in situ processing under controlled environments, advanced beam control systems, and the adoption of catalytic and graphitizable precursors.

&lt;p&gt;Overview of principal direct-write graphene patterning methodologies including focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID), laser induced graphitisation (LIG), focused ion beam (FIB), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene, with its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties, remains a cornerstone material for next-generation nanoelectronics. However, conventional lithographic approaches to graphene patterning are fraught with challenges, including contamination, alignment complexity, and scalability constraints. This review critically examines the evolving landscape of direct-write graphene technologies, focusing on forefront strategies such as focused electron beam-induced deposition (FEBID), polymer-to-graphene (P2G) conversion, focused ion beam (FIB) modification, and laser-assisted graphitisation. These techniques represent a departure from traditional top-down or transfer-based methods by enabling bottom-up, spatially resolved patterning without intermediary masking steps. Particular attention is devoted to the physicochemical mechanisms that underlie electron- and photon-mediated graphitisation, the role of precursor chemistry and substrate interactions, as well as the influence of beam parameters on sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon content and structural ordering. The review further delineates the limitations intrinsic to current methodologies, including partial graphitisation, resolution fidelity, and hardware constraints, and proposes a roadmap to achieve truly &#8220;direct&#8221; graphene writing. This includes in situ processing under controlled environments, advanced beam control systems, and the adoption of catalytic and graphitizable precursors. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for the rational design of next-generation nanofabrication protocols and underscores the transformative potential of direct-write techniques in enabling scalable, high-fidelity graphene-based&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upper Interface Engineering Between Perovskite and Electron Transport Layer Toward Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in upper interface engineering for PSCs, addressing key challenges including insufficient coordination, weak chemical stability, and energy level mismatches. These approaches aim to optimize charge transport, suppress ion migration, and enhance interfacial adhesion, marking an important step toward high efficiency and stability of inverted PSCs. The findings establish fundamental design principles for optimizing perovskite interfaces through targeted molecular engineering, which provides rational guidance for the design of next&#8208;generation perovskite photovoltaic devices.








Abstract
Inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their excellent stability and compatibility with tandems. However, their performance is critically limited by the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) upper interface. This interface governs electron extraction efficiency, ion migration, and non&#8208;radiative recombination, directly affecting open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). Moreover, interfacial defects, energy level misalignment, and chemical instability at this junction often lead to hysteresis and degradation, hindering commercialization efforts. This review systematically examines interfacial modification strategy through a materials classification approach by four categories: ammonium salts, organic molecules, polymers, and inorganic materials. How these materials optimize charge transport, suppress ion migration, and enhance interfacial adhesion is thoroughly discussed. A systematic understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships at this critical interface is elucidated. Besides, characterization techniques for probing interfacial phenomena is summarized. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are elucidated at this underexplored interface. These insights position upper interface engineering as the next frontier in realizing commercially viable, high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs.

This review summarizes recent progress in electrolyte design, interphase chemistry, and sulfur conversion mechanisms, highlights advanced characterization techniques for probing electrolyte and interfacial behavior, and outlines future opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance RT&#8208;NSBs.








Abstract
The urgent need for sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy storage beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries has propelled the development of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries (RT&#8208;NSBs), which leverage earth&#8208;abundant elements to offer a high theoretical energy density. However, the practical realization of RT&#8208;NSBs is severely constrained by formidable challenges originating at the electrolyte, primarily the detrimental polysulfide shuttle effect, the uncontrolled growth of sodium dendrites, and sluggish reaction kinetics. Addressing these intertwined issues through rational electrolyte design is paramount for unlocking the potential of this technology. This review offers a comprehensive comparison of liquid, gel polymer, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes for RT&#8208;NSBs, establishing a mechanistic framework that connects solvation chemistry, interfacial reactions, and electrochemical behavior to actionable electrolyte design principles. The fundamental operating principles and key challenges are first outlined. Subsequently, a systematic overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies across different electrolyte platforms is presented, emphasizing the underlying mechanisms and notable achievements. Furthermore, the pivotal role of advanced characterization techniques in elucidating complex solvation structures, electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and sulfur redox pathways is discussed to accelerate the rational design of electrolytes. Finally, this review points out the remaining challenges and potential directions to accelerate the transition of RT&#8208;NSBs into practical, next&#8208;generation energy storage solutions.

         <title>Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries at the Full&#8208;Cell Level: A Review of Methodology Advances, Data Analytics, and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a critical assessment of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, covering measurement methods and data analysis across formats and chemistries and under dynamic operating conditions. It highlights methodological limitations, proposes benchmark protocols, and outlines future directions for cell&#8208;level thermal conductivity, including in situ methods, comprehensive datasets, and artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;assisted diagnosis, to enable safer and more predictable battery systems.








Abstract
The knowledge of anisotropic thermal conductivity of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is paramount for accurate battery thermal modeling and diagnosis because of its decisive influence on the internal temperature distribution and overall thermal behaviors of LIBs. However, due to the complex materials, geometries, and dynamic state variations of LIBs, obtaining accurate anisotropic thermal conductivity at the full&#8208;cell level remains challenging. Here, a comprehensive review is provided on the latest methodologies and data analytics of the anisotropic thermal conductivity of battery cells with different chemistries and geometries under dynamic operating conditions. The applicability, uncertainty, advantages, and limitations of current measurement methods are examined, providing guidance for method selection and future improvement. The anisotropic thermal conductivity data across various cell formats and electrode materials are evaluated, and their variations with temperature, state of charge, state of health, and charge/discharge rates &#160;are analyzed. Additionally, future applications are highlighted for thermal conductivity to serve as a key input for thermal modeling and an indicator for battery diagnostics, with the development of in situ and real&#8208;time measurement methods and artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;driven models. These efforts collectively support an integrated framework for next&#8208;generation thermal management systems toward improving the performance, safety, and lifespan of LIBs and other emerging batteries.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Cooling: Advanced Micro/Nanostructures for Managing Extreme Heat Flux</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the design, application, and manufacturing of biomimetic or engineered micro/nanostructures for managing high heat&#8208;flux in multi&#8208;level electronics by enhancing conductive, convective, phase&#8208;changing, and radiative heat transfer mechanisms, highlighting their potential for efficient, targeted thermal management, and future prospects.








Abstract
The surge in device integration has escalated thermal losses, compromising performance and safety, necessitating advanced thermal management solutions with extraordinary heat flux capabilities to address power and heat dissipation challenges in high heat&#8208;flux electronics. Micro/nanostructures have emerged as promising solutions for targeted heat dissipation in electronics due to their outstanding performance, miniature footprint, and design flexibility. However, a comprehensive review of recent advancements in heat transfer control via micro/nanostructures and their current and potential applications for high heat&#8208;flux thermal management, particularly for electronic devices, remains lacking. This review systematically examines the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms enabled by micro/nanostructures at multiscales. A wide range of bio&#8208;inspired or engineered designs are highlighted as formidable candidates for highly efficient thermal and hydrodynamic metamaterials. Novel micro/nano&#8208;patterns that significantly contribute to the modulation of coupled heat transfer processes in practical applications for electronic thermal management are elaborated. Furthermore, the strengths and limitations of existing design and manufacturing methods for micro/nanostructures are comparatively summarized. Finally, key challenges and prospects of micro/nanostructure&#8208;based thermal management techniques are discussed, drawing insights from previous applications. This review underscores the transformative potential of micro/nanostructures in achieving reliable, sustainable, and targeted thermal management for high&#8208;performance electronic devices in the near future.

         <title>Water Interactions in Hydrated Aliphatic Polyester Composite Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions among polymer chains, ceramic particles, and water affect properties like crystallinity, thermal behavior, and strength. Advances in scaffold&#8208;guided bone regeneration (SGBR)&#160;depend on understanding multiscale mechanisms in hydrated ceramic particle&#8211;polymer composites (CPPCs). This review explores the molecular basis of polymer hyperelasticity in relation to hydration and structure, and examines interfacial mechanisms in hydrated CPPCs to inform future research.








Abstract
The organ bone consists of mineralized and non&#8208;mineralized tissues. The mineralized tissues can be defined from a material science point of view as composites of inorganic and organic matter. Hydration of the composites is vital for mechanical and physico&#8211;chemical properties, supporting macromolecular networks in optimizing structure and function. In the field of scaffold&#8208;guided bone regeneration (SGBR), researchers have sought to mimic these naturally derived composites by combining ceramic particles with polymeric biodegradable biomaterials, mainly aliphatic polyesters, aiming to enhance the physicochemical properties of the polymeric matrix. However, the behavior of these resulting composites under physiological conditions remains underexplored. A complex interplay exists among the polymeric chains, ceramic particles, and water molecules, influencing various characteristics, including crystallinity, thermal properties, and mechanical strength, of the composite. Future advancements in scaffold design and manufacturing in SGBR cannot be separated from a comprehensive understanding of the diverse, multiscale physicochemical mechanisms at work in hydrated ceramic particle&#8211;polymer composites (CPPCs). This review analyzes literature on the molecular origins of hyperelasticity in polymers, focusing on hydration and structural rearrangements. It also discusses interfacial mechanisms in hydrated CPPCs, which allows future research to refine manufacturing, design, and strategies for next&#8208;generation CPPCs.

         <title>Design Principles for Air Tolerance in Pyridinium&#8208;Based Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Equilibrium models are derived for redox flow battery electrolytes that enable accurate prediction of the onset air stability in methyl viologen &#8211; a compound known to the community for over 100 years and one of the most well&#8208;studied aqueous flow battery electrolytes.








Abstract
Pyridinium compounds represent promising electrolyte candidates for aqueous redox flow batteries. Recently, their ability to afford air&#8208;stability was demonstrated, unlocking potential avenues both for relaxed system constraints and for high voltage operation. Here, simple equilibrium models for pyridinium electrolytes are developed, which are leveraged to predict and successfully validate the air stability of methyl viologen &#8211; the lowest cost and most well&#8208;studied pyridinium system to date. By controlling the degree of &#960;&#8208;association of active species, the total fraction of radicals can be kept below a critical threshold, from which air&#8208;stable operation can be accessed. The resulting system exhibits 94.9% capacity retention in air after 150 cycles but undergoes dramatic losses in performance once diluted outside of its air stability threshold. We tie this behaviour to rates of oxygen consumption in solution and further derive the second Damk&#246;hler number, a dimensionless parameter which informs optimal scaling of battery components. On this basis, air stability is shown to be compatible with scaling requirements needed for applications in long&#8208;duration energy storage. Given the known tendency for broader classes of organic electrolytes to associate, it is anticipated that the findings presented can be generalized to many other current and future systems.

         <title>Operando Neutron Imaging of Lithium Flux and Gradient Cathode Design for Enhanced Kinetics in High&#8208;Loading All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#9472;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando neutron imaging directly visualizes lithium flux in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries, revealing sluggish Li&#8208;ion transport and nonuniform reactions as key barriers in Li&#8211;S solid&#8208;state batteries. A gradient cathode design with tailored catholyte concentrations enhances charge transfer, promotes more uniform reactions, and significantly improves sulfur utilization, offering a higher mass loading, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage owing to their inherent safety, high energy density, and abundant sulfur resources. However, slow redox kinetics greatly limit sulfur utilization during solid&#8208;solid sulfur reactions, leading to significant challenges to achieve efficient performance in high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading ASSLSBs. Here, operando neutron image is employed to directly visualize, for the first time, that sluggish Li+ transport kinetics and the uneven distribution of Li+ during cathodic reactions are critical factors limiting sulfur conversion. To address this issue, gradient cathode architectures comprising three and five layers are designed, in which catholyte concentrations are strategically varied to optimize Li&#8208;ion flux and enhance ionic conductivity of the whole composite cathode electrode. Operando neutron imaging distinctly visualizes and confirms that three&#8208;layer gradient approach significantly enhances Li&#8208;ion mobility, resulting in more uniform redox reactions and greatly improved sulfur utilization compared to traditional non&#8208;gradient structures. Consequently, the three&#8208;layer gradient cathode achieves superior rate performance and reduced electrode polarization at high sulfur mass loadings of 4.5 and 6.0 mg cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the applicability and scalability of this design are demonstrated in a five&#8208;layer gradient cathode architecture, achieving an impressive discharge specific capacity increase from 656 mAh g&#8722;1 (three&#8208;layer gradient) to 1232 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1/20 C for ultra&#8208;high sulfur loading of 7.5 mg cm&#8722;2. This innovative gradient cathode design offers substantial advancements in understanding and overcoming Li&#8208;ion transport limitations, paving the way toward practical, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLSBs.

         <title>Bicontinuous Structure Mediated Microstructural Engineering of Hard Carbon for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microstructure of the hard carbon is modified by introducing an ordered bicontinuous mesoporous structure. The layer spacing of short&#8208;range ordered crystalline graphite regions is enlarged, and more active sites are generated. Hard carbon with a bicontinuous mesoporous structure achieves a specific capacity of 80 mAh g&#8722;1 even after 100&#160;000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising energy storage technology due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges, including high irreversible capacity loss during initial cycles, poor rate performance, and structural instability. Here, a bicontinuous mesoporous hard carbon&#160;with a single primitive (SP) microstructure (coined SP&#8211;HC) is introduced that addresses these limitations through microstructural engineering. This SP&#8211;HC design increases the density and accessibility of Na+ storage sites, enhances carbon disorder, and expands interlayer spacing, leading to improved sodium storage capacity and kinetics. The 3D continuous meso&#8208;channels enable rapid Na+ transport, achieving an exceptional rate performance of 172 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 (full charge in 1 min). Remarkably, the SP&#8211;HC anode exhibits unprecedented cycle stability, retaining a high capacity of 80 mAh g&#8722;1 even after 100&#160;000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g&#8722;1, which represents the best cycle stability reported for hard carbon&#8208;based anodes of SIBs. This study provides an insight into the critical role of microstructural engineering in optimizing electrochemical storage of hard carbon anodes for SIBs.

         <title>Organic Layer Bridged 3D/2D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly cross&#8208;linked polymer is deposited between 3 and 2D perovskite, leading to improved carrier transport performance and suppressing cation penetration across 3D/2D interfaces under thermal&#8208;stress, thus resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) continue to encounter challenges in long&#8208;term stability and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficits, thereby constraining the performance and stability of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs).

         <title>Direction&#8208;Selective Energy Control Using Thermal Lens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometrical&#8208;optics refraction approach is introduced to achieve passive, angle&#8208;selective control of radiative signatures across visible and infrared bands. The surface integrates thermal lens arrays, Au/quartz infrared patterns, and visible coloration layers, and is validated in planar and wedge geometries. This scalable design offers new opportunities for adaptive thermal management, radiative cooling, and camouflage materials.








Abstract
Directional energy control is a critical requirement for applications involving adaptive thermal management, infrared (IR) signature suppression, and multiband optical modulation. Herein, a directional energy control surface (DECS) is introduced that achieves passive, refraction&#8208;based directional energy manipulation across visible and IR bands without requiring external power input. The DECS comprises three key layers: The directional control layer (DCL), composed of a thermal lens array, facilitates direction&#8208;selective refraction, enabling real&#8208;time control over radiative signatures. The IR control layer (IRCL), featuring an Au/quartz pattern, modulates IR emissivity. Finally, the visible coloration layer (VCL) enables adjustable optical reflection in the visible band. Experiments demonstrate that the DECS enables periodic, direction&#8208;selective modulation of thermal and optical signatures, enhancing or suppressing radiance effectively depending on the detection angle. Extending the experimental evaluation to 3D wedge geometries confirms that the DECS can maintain its directional control capability in complex environments. These results establish the DECS as a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient solution for directional energy control across multibands, offering a new paradigm for passive spectral and angular energy regulation. Thus, this study can facilitate the development of next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;controlling surfaces with potential applications in thermal camouflage, radiative cooling, energy&#8208;efficient coatings, and dynamic optical management.

         <title>Quantum Phase Transitions in Graphene Coupled to a Twisted WSe2 Moir&#233; Ferroelectricity</title>

         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; ferroelectricity in twisted WSe2 (t&#8208;WSe2) breaks graphene's sublattice symmetry, inducing a room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;insulator transition. Coupling graphene with ferroelectric domains of t&#8208;WSe2 creates local Dirac points and metallic phases with Fermi&#8208;liquid and non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;liquid behavior. Scaling analysis confirms continuous quantum phase transitions, establishing a route totunable quantum phases in graphene at ambient conditions.








Abstract
Sublattice symmetry in graphene governs its Dirac semimetal behavior, where electrons exhibit linear dispersion, limiting its potential for technological applications. Here, moir&#233; ferroelectricity in twisted WSe2 (t&#8208;WSe2) is exploited to break graphene's sublattice symmetry, inducing a metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) near room temperature. The periodic polarization domains in t&#8208;WSe2 imprint an electrostatic potential onto graphene, breaking its sublattice symmetry and leading to the emergence of a local Dirac point, as observed in the transfer characteristics of a t&#8208;WSe2/graphene field&#8208;effect transistor. Temperature&#8208;dependent transport measurements reveal multiple MIT points at relatively high temperatures, attributed to the room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric polarization in t&#8208;WSe2. Furthermore, A distinct metallic phases is identified exhibiting T2 and linear&#8208;T dependent longitudinal resistance under electrostatic doping, indicative of Fermi&#8208;liquid and non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;liquid metallic behavior, respectively. Finally, finite&#8208;size scaling analysis of Rxx near the MIT points indicates continuous quantum phase transitions near room temperature, establishing moir&#233; ferroelectricity as a pathway for engineering quantum electronic phases of monolayer graphene at ambient conditions.

         <title>Reconfiguring Hierarchical Porous Architecture of 2D Metal Nanosheets for Multifunctional Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically porous copper nanosheet&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerator (HPC&#8208;TENG) delivers superior output, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality through scalable solution processing and structural reconfiguration. Beyond energy harvesting, the platform exhibits robust EMI shielding and efficient Joule heating. These integrated capabilities highlight HPC&#8208;TENGs as versatile building blocks for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics, flexible heating modules, EMI protection, and self&#8208;powered electronic systems.








Abstract
2D single&#8208;crystalline metal nanosheets are a promising platform for self&#8208;powered electronics, yet their potential for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) remains unexplored. A key challenge in TENGs is overcoming low current output and limited durability. A hierarchical porous copper nanosheet&#8208;based TENG (HPC&#8208;TENG) is reported to substantially enhance triboelectric performance through a unique structural design. The method uses a simple spray&#8208;coating process to create a hierarchical porous conductive film from 2D copper nanosheets (Cu NSs). By infiltrating this film with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), interfacial contact is maximized, significantly boosting charge generation during mechanical cycling. The HPC&#8208;TENG achieves a remarkable 590% enhancement in electrical output compared to conventional Cu thin&#8208;film TENGs, while maintaining stable operation over 100&#8201;000 cycles. Beyond energy harvesting, this architecture provides integrated multifunctionality, including stable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness exceeding 30 dB and efficient Joule heating. These findings highlight the strong potential of hierarchical porous metal nanosheet electrodes as a versatile platform for advanced energy harvesting, EMI shielding, and flexible heating, opening new avenues for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Cosolvent Electrolyte Design for Li&#8211;S Batteries: Suppressing the Shuttle Effect via Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of introducing cosolvents are investigated with diverse properties into a high&#8208;donor&#8208;number solvent for Li&#8211;S batteries. This approach regulates LiPS solubility and S3&#8226;&#8722; radical formation, strongly influencing sulfur redox kinetics. Moreover, a cosolvent with low miscibility effectively suppressed the shuttle effect, thereby enhancing cycling stability and providing insights into electrolyte design strategies.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. However, their commercialization is hindered by poor cycling performance caused by the polysulfide shuttle effect. While strategies such as physical barriers or chemical adsorption have been proposed, they inevitably introduce inactive components, reducing energy density. These limitations underscore the need for a more fundamental approach that avoids the use of inactive materials. In this study, a cosolvent&#8208;based electrolyte design as a fundamental strategy is presented to suppress the shuttle effect without relying on inactive additives. A high donor number solvent is used as the base, and four cosolvents with distinct physicochemical properties are individually introduced. By varying the cosolvent, the lithium polysulfides solubility is systematically tuned, directly influencing electrochemical kinetics. Notably, the combination of two low&#8208;miscibility solvents induced local phase separation, which hindered the diffusion of lithium polysulfides and effectively mitigated the shuttle effect. As a result, significantly improved cycling stability is achieved. These findings provide a new direction for Li&#8211;S battery electrolyte development, emphasizing the importance of solvent miscibility in governing polysulfide transport.

This approach regulates LiPS solubility and S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; radical formation, strongly influencing sulfur redox kinetics. Moreover, a cosolvent with low miscibility effectively suppressed the shuttle effect, thereby enhancing cycling stability and providing insights into electrolyte design strategies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage due to their high energy density and low cost. However, their commercialization is hindered by poor cycling performance caused by the polysulfide shuttle effect. While strategies such as physical barriers or chemical adsorption have been proposed, they inevitably introduce inactive components, reducing energy density. These limitations underscore the need for a more fundamental approach that avoids the use of inactive materials. In this study, a cosolvent-based electrolyte design as a fundamental strategy is presented to suppress the shuttle effect without relying on inactive additives. A high donor number solvent is used as the base, and four cosolvents with distinct physicochemical properties are individually introduced. By varying the cosolvent, the lithium polysulfides solubility is systematically tuned, directly influencing electrochemical kinetics. Notably, the combination of two low-miscibility solvents induced local phase separation, which hindered the diffusion of lithium polysulfides and effectively mitigated the shuttle effect. As a result, significantly improved cycling stability is achieved. These findings provide a new direction for Li&#8211;S battery electrolyte development, emphasizing the importance of solvent miscibility in governing polysulfide transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Turn&#8208;On of Current&#8208;Induced Spin Torque Upon Non&#8208;collinear Antiferromagnetic Ordering in Delafossite PdCrO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdCrO2 has the delafossite structure, consisting of alternating highly&#8208;conducting palladium layers and Mott&#8208;insulating CrO2 layers, within which the spins on the chromium sites form a 120&#176; non&#8208;collinear structure. The spin torque increases strongly as the temperature is reduced through the N&#233;el temperature, when the PdCrO2 transitions from a paramagnetic phase to a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnetic state.








Abstract
Measurements of the current&#8208;induced spin torque produced by the delafossite antiferromagnet PdCrO2 and acting on an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy layer are reported. The spin torque increases strongly as the temperature is reduced through the N&#233;el temperature, when the PdCrO2 transitions from a paramagnetic phase to a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnetic state. This result is qualitatively consistent with density functional theory calculations regarding how spin&#8208;current generation changes upon antiferromagnetic ordering in PdCrO2.

         <title>Reducing Energy Loss of 2D Perovskite Single Crystal for Stable and Efficient X&#8208;Ray Detection by Quenching the Radioluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational ion substitution strategy is designed to quench the radioluminescence (RL) intensity, reduce the interlayer spacing, and extend the RL lifetime of 2D perovskite single crystals (SCs). Therefore, the 2D SC detectors with low energy loss and then achieve a high detection sensitivity of 5217.3&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.5&#160;nGy s&#8722;1, excellent stability, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are demonstrated as promising materials for X&#8208;ray detection because of their large resistivity, excellent stability, tunability of interlayer spacing, and strong X&#8208;ray absorption. However, the high exciton binding energy of 2D perovskites usually generates obvious radioluminescence (RL) under X&#8208;rays, which causes non&#8208;negligible energy loss during detection. In this work, the RL intensity is successfully reduced and the carrier recombination lifetime is extended through rational design of ion (Bi3+) substitution to greatly improve the X&#8208;ray detection performance of the 2D perovskite single crystals (SCs). Specifically, the quenched RL reduces energy loss, and the extended RL lifetime improves the carrier collection efficiency during X&#8208;ray detection. In addition, 2D SCs with Bi incorporation exhibit higher ion migration activation energy and shorter interlayer spacing than the pristine SCs, thus realizing lower current drift and higher carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#181;&#964;) product. Therefore, the 2D SC detectors achieve high detection sensitivity of 5217.3&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, low detection limit of 2.5&#160;nGy s&#8722;1 and excellent response stability. The rare combination of these excellent properties enables the detectors to achieve high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. This work provides a new design idea and a specific manipulation strategy for further improving the X&#8208;ray detection performance of 2D SCs.

         <title>Liquid Metal Solvent Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystal Rhenium Nanoparticles with Ultrahigh Strength and Plasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid metal solvent strategy to synthesize high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal refractory metal nanoparticles, where the liquid metal promotes the rapid diffusion and aggregation of refractory metal atoms is reported. Taking Re as an example, the as&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;crystal Re nanoparticles with highly symmetrical shape exhibit exceptional mechanical behaviors of ultrahigh strength and significant plastic deformability. 








Abstract
The unique properties of refractory metals, such as high melting point, high strength, and great corrosion resistance, qualify them as an intriguing option for harsh applications. However, internal defects and surface flaws inherent in currently prepared refractory metals compromise their mechanical properties, making them inadequate for practical applications. Here, a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated strategy enabling the preparation of single&#8208;crystal refractory metal nanoparticles with a highly symmetrical shape is reported. Liquid metals provide a favorable solution environment that facilitates rapid diffusion and aggregation of refractory metal atoms, allowing them to self&#8208;rearrange into stable Wulff configurations. The exceptional mechanical properties of the synthesized single&#8208;crystal refractory metal nanoparticles are highlighted by rhenium (Re) samples, which exhibit ultrahigh strength (up to 67.8&#160;GPa) exceeding that of any known metal and significant plastic deformability capable of retaining shape without cracking up to an 80% strain. This remarkable combination of mechanical properties arises from the synergistic effects of the highly symmetrical shape and high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal structure. This strategy not only lays the groundwork for the controlled synthesis of high&#8208;quality refractory metals but also advances the fundamental understanding of their structure&#8208;property relationships for the rational design of high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Multiscale Interfacial Confined Locking from Nano to Macro Enables Strain Insensitivity in Epidermal Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiscale confined interfacial locking structure constructed between the conductive material and the nanomesh substrate can effectively improve the adhesion strength between the two (9.48 MPa), and the relative resistance change (&#916;R/R0) of the prepared strain&#8208;insensitive conductive film under 200% tensile strain is only 0.36. The film has been successfully used to monitor human blood pressure and muscle fatigue.








Abstract
Stable electrical conductivity in epidermal bioelectronics is essential for accurate health monitoring of humans. Yet, the poor adhesion between active conductive materials and elastic substrate leads to conductivity issues during deformation. Here, a multiscale interfacial confined locking strategy is proposed that combines molecular entanglement between the conductive polymer and the substrate with physical confinement within the electrospun membrane pores. To date, multiscale interfacial confined locking structures show the best interfacial adhesion strength (9.48&#160;MPa) compared to previous works. Such structures benefit from a &#8776;13.9 times interface adhesion improvement over those without this design. For the first time, multiscale interfacial confined locking structures are prepared by in situ polymerization and swelling to enhance the interfacial adhesion strength, and the method can be extended to different substrates (e.g., polyurethane). The high adhesion promotes the wavy and wrinkled microstructure of the nanomesh film, which enables it to maintain a near&#8208;constant resistance under tensile strain (&#8776;200%). The prepared strain&#8208;insensitive conductive film has been successfully applied to epidermal bioelectronics (e.g., sensor and bioelectrode).

         <title>In Situ Thermally&#8208;Driven Radial Heterophase Evolution of &#948;&#8208;Bi2O3 Modulates the p&#8208;Block Bi 6p Orbitals and p&#8208;Band Center for Enhancing Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>

In situ, thermally driven radial spatial gradient heterophase evolution of &#948;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;OVS/Bi@CNFs, mediated by lignin&#8208;derived carbon nanofibers, modulates the p&#8208;block Bi 6p orbitals and p&#8208;band center, enhancing sulfur redox reactions and mitigating the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides based on Sabatier principles, ultimately improving the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
The commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is hindered by challenges such as the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), slow sulfur redox reaction kinetics, and poor electrical conductivity. The electronic configuration of the p&#8208;block Bi 6p orbitals is modulated through an in situ thermally&#8208;induced reduction strategy using lignin&#8208;based carbon nanofibers (CNFs). This approach enables the radial gradient heterophase transformation of &#948;&#8208;Bi2O3, leading to the formation of a high&#8208;density heterojunction network composite (&#948;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;OVS/Bi@CNFs) rich in oxygen vacancies (OVS), which effectively moderates the adsorption of LiPSs and enhances the kinetics of sulfur redox reactions. Based on the &#948;&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;OVS/Bi@CNFs, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density (377&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) pouch cell with a capacity of 1.8&#160;Ah is fabricated and successfully used in drone flights, highlighting its potential for practical applications. This work elucidates the mechanism of in situ thermally&#8208;induced radial&#8208;gradient heterophase evolution of p&#8208;block metal oxides and the influence of 6p&#8208;orbital electron modulation on the sulfur redox reaction.

         <title>Prediction and Reinforcement of Fracture&#8208;Prone Regions in Disordered Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing on nature's way of making high&#8208;performance materials with simple rules, the study develops a self&#8208;organizing algorithm for disordered mechanical metamaterials. Meanwhile, the GEBC values are used to predict the fracture&#8208;prone regions of these metamaterials, strengthen these regions through multiple strategies. Further achieve regional customization, providing new ideas for the design of related metamaterials.








Abstract
Disordered metamaterials have gained prominence in engineering applications owing to their exceptional strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and tunable mechanical behaviors. However, the inherent structural heterogeneity of these metamaterials often induces stress localization, creating fracture&#8208;prone regions that compromise structural reliability. To address this challenge, a self&#8208;organized generation algorithm is proposed beyond conventional unit&#8208;cell&#8208;based architectures, enabling the customization of disordered mechanical metamaterials. Fracture&#8208;prone regions are evaluated by geodesic edge betweenness centrality (GEBC)&#160;metrics, and are optimized by node connectivity adjustment and preferential short&#8208;bond redistribution. Remarkably, increasing short&#8208;bond frequency resulted in simultaneous enhancement of fracture toughness and ultimate strength while maintaining constant mass density. This study provides new insights into the design of amorphous architected materials, establishing a computational framework for designing disorder metamaterials with damage&#8208;tolerant characteristics.

         <title>Synergistic Dual Heteroatom&#8208;Engineered Superactivated Carbon Unlocks Record&#8208;High Hydrogen Storage via Mg&#9472;F Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;derived porous carbon engineered with Mg&#9472;F groups achieves record hydrogen storage via synergistic pore&#8208;functional group enhancement. Tailored structures enable exceptional capacities of 4.2 wt% (1 bar) and 9.7 wt% (50 bar) under 77 K. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal orbital hybridization between Mg and hydrogen as the key mechanism, while demonstrating universal applicability across agricultural wastes for sustainable energy solutions.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage remains a critical challenge for sustainable energy systems. Here, a surface functionalization strategy is reported through C&#8208;Mg&#9472;F ternary coordination to engineer biomass&#8208;derived porous carbons with exceptional hydrogen storage performance. Using tobacco stems as precursors, the synthesized Mg&#8208;F@C material achieves record hydrogen uptake capacities under 77 K of 4.2 wt% at 1 bar and 9.7 wt% at 50 bar, doubling pristine carbon performance. Multiscale analyses reveal adsorption mechanisms dominated by orbital interactions at Mg&#8208;active sites, where H2 electron transfer arises from hybridization of Mg 2p and unsaturated 3s orbitals, inducing directional polarization of H2 electron clouds which synergizes with hierarchical porosity (3500 m2 g&#8722;1 surface area) to enhance adsorption. Combined photophysical analysis establishes a mechanistic framework linking static electronic configurations to dynamic adsorption processes. The material retains structural integrity under pressure cycling and demonstrates universal applicability across diverse biomass. This work provides a generalizable paradigm for designing high&#8208;capacity hydrogen storage materials via orbital&#8208;level modulation of porous carbons.

         <title>Mechanotyping of Organoids for Assessing Drug&#8208;Induced Injuries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A centrifugal mechanotyping platform enables rapid, label&#8208;free assessment of tissue stiffness and elastic recovery in 3D organoids. The platform applies controlled centrifugal forces and uses image&#8208;based deformation analysis to detect subtle drug&#8208;induced biomechanical changes in cardiac organoids. This scalable, non&#8208;destructive method offers early detection of tissue injury in preclinical drug testing.








Abstract
Changes in the mechanical properties, i.e., mechanotypes, of tissues are powerful indicators of disease states and drug&#8208;induced injuries. Although differential mechanotyping has emerged as a valuable tool for non&#8208;invasive disease diagnostics, it remains particularly underutilized for drug safety and efficacy screening in preclinical studies. This is largely due to the lack of scalable mechanotyping methods compatible with modern 3D organoid models. Here, the Centrifugal Mechanical Testing (CeMeT) platform is presented, which enables rapid, robust, and label&#8208;free mechanotyping of 3D organoids. Utilizing centrifugal mechanical principles and high&#8208;speed imaging, this platform achieves high accuracy and precision and can assess a wide range of tissue stiffness. It is demonstrated that the CeMeT platform distinguishes mechanical properties, i.e., stiffness and elastic recovery, among various hydrogel bead formulations and hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiac organoids, successfully detecting pathological changes in mechanotype with high sensitivity. Through experiments on organoids treated with drugs like pergolide and Cytochalasin&#8208;D, it is established that changes in organoid mechanotypes can serve as reliable indicators of drug&#8208;induced tissue injuries in vitro. These findings position the CeMeT platform as a potentially transformative tool for early&#8208;stage drug safety assessment through mechanotyping,&#160;with immediate applications extending to fundamental disease pathology research and drug efficacy testing using organoid models.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Stress&#8208;Free Percutaneous Bioelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally adaptive soft microneedle bioelectrode is developed with an effervescent sacrificial core that dissolves after insertion, leaving an ultrathin and highly compliant electrode integrated with skin. This design enables ultra&#8208;flexible, cell&#8208;stress&#8208;free, stable, and high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological monitoring under dynamic conditions such as sweat and dehydration, surpassing conventional film and gel electrodes in both long&#8208;term signal stability and mechanical compatibility.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics have advanced dramatically over the past decade, yet remain constrained by their superficial placement on the skin, which renders them vulnerable to environmental fluctuations and mechanical instability. Existing microneedle (MN) electrodes offer minimally invasive access to dermal tissue, but their rigid, bulky design&#8212;often 100 times larger and 10,000 times stiffer than dermal fibroblasts&#8212;induces pain, tissue damage, and chronic inflammation, limiting their long&#8208;term applicability. Here, a cell&#8208;stress&#8208;free percutaneous bioelectrode is presented, comprising an ultrathin (&lt;2&#160;&#181;m), soft MN (sMN) that dynamically softens via an effervescent structural transformation after insertion. The sMN exhibits near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio deformation, preserving cellular morphology and minimizing immune activation over multiple days of use in rats and humans. Synchrotron imaging and histological analysis reveal reduced tissue disruption, while electrophysiological measurements demonstrate stable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios under sweat, dehydration, and extended use. This architecture shifts the biosensing interface from the epidermis to the dermis, establishing a mechanically and electrically stable platform for environment&#8208;independent signal acquisition. The findings establish dermal electronics as a next&#8208;generation paradigm for long&#8208;term, biocompatible wearable sensing.

&lt;p&gt;A structurally adaptive soft microneedle bioelectrode is developed with an effervescent sacrificial core that dissolves after insertion, leaving an ultrathin and highly compliant electrode integrated with skin. This design enables ultra-flexible, cell-stress-free, stable, and high-fidelity electrophysiological monitoring under dynamic conditions such as sweat and dehydration, surpassing conventional film and gel electrodes in both long-term signal stability and mechanical compatibility.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Deformability Enables Nanozyme&#8208;Integrated Vaccine for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This dynamic, multifunctional nanovaccine addresses the limitations of static, single&#8208;feature designs by combining intelligent morphology regulation with catalytic functionality. By achieving precise antigen delivery, robust DC activation, and potent CTL induction, this strategy represents a significant advancement in cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy leveraging vaccine&#8208;based approaches has emerged as a promising strategy for long&#8208;term tumor regression and metastasis prevention. However, the design of effective vaccines remains challenging due to the need for efficient lymph node (LN) targeting, dendritic cell (DC) uptake, and robust cellular immunity activation. Here, a proton&#8208;driven, multifunctional nanovaccine (PP@Pt&#8208;OVA) is presented that combines intelligent morphology regulation and nanozyme catalysis to address these challenges. The nanovaccine, comprising PVP@Pt nanozymes and OVA257&#8211;264 peptides encapsulated in PEG&#8208;b&#8208;PAE micelles, undergoes proton&#8208;driven morphology transformation in acidic LN microenvironments, enhancing particle size and reducing PEGylation for optimized LN retention and DC uptake. Once internalized, PVP@Pt nanozyme catalyzes reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, facilitating endosomal escape, antigen cross&#8208;presentation, and DC maturation. PP@Pt&#8208;OVA demonstrated efficient LN targeting, robust CD8+ T cell activation, and significant tumor inhibition in both prophylactic and therapeutic melanoma models, with excellent biocompatibility and minimal systemic toxicity. These findings highlight the potential of PP@Pt&#8208;OVA as a versatile nanovaccine platform, offering a rational design framework for overcoming the limitations of subunit vaccines and advancing cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Water Treatment for Long&#8208;Lived Room Temperature Phosphorescent Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescent adhesives are developed via water&#8208;induced polymer chain reorganization. Their long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescent properties are extremely stable and can be long&#8208;term maintained, and can be employed to non&#8208;destructively and precisely monitor the sticking status.








Abstract
Polymer materials with long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are promising because they are easy to process to fit broad luminescent events. However, these systems typically rely on polar groups to form hydrogen or ionic bonds to confine chromophores to produce long&#8208;lived RTP. Such interactions are susceptible to moisture, which greatly limits the stability of such materials and their luminescent signals. Here, long&#8208;lived RTP adhesives are developed by random copolymerization of a trace amount of chromophores into polyacrylic acid. For these polymers, a water&#8208;induced polymer reorganization can be observed at room temperature to form protective confined regions for chromophores, resulting in an afterglow lifetime up to 3 s, with a high moisture tolerance threshold. The strategy is applicable to diverse chromophores, resulting in RTP with a wide range of tunable emission colors. Meanwhile, these polymers are soluble in water and can be used as removable adhesives. The long&#8208;lived RTP can be employed to monitor sticking status non&#8208;destructively and precisely, which can inspire the development of high&#8208;performance RTP polymers for unprecedented practical applications.

         <title>Optoacoustic&#8208;Guided Magnetic Microrobot Platform for Precision Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoacoustically guided FePt@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based microrobots are designed with high drug loading capacity, controllable locomotion, and deep&#8208;tissue imaging capability. By integrating navigation, drug release, and real&#8208;time monitoring into a single platform, they provide a versatile tool for precise intervention, opening new possibilities for treating neurological disorders and tumors located in hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach regions.









Abstract
Precision drug delivery remains a significant challenge due to limitations in drug loading, targeted release, precise navigation, and real&#8208;time monitoring. Here, the study reports a magnetic microrobot platform (MMP) that integrates high&#8208;capacity drug loading, magnetically actuated collective navigation, controlled drug release, and real&#8208;time 3D optoacoustic imaging in a single system. The MMP exploits synergistic advantages by embedding hard&#8208;magnetic FePt nanoparticles in a degradable ZIF&#8208;8 shell, achieving a drug loading efficiency of &#8776;93.9% and enabling precise release in response to pH changes and radiofrequency&#8208;induced heating. Reconfigurable swarm behavior strategies significantly enhance the navigation efficiency of microrobots against physiological blood flows within complex cerebral vasculature. The ex vivo and in vivo experiments further demonstrate strong contrast characteristics of the microrobots, enabling high&#8208;resolution visualization of deep vascular structures and dynamic tracking of MMP with real&#8208;time 3D optoacoustic imaging. This multifunctional strategy paves the way for clinical translation and precision therapy in complex biological settings.

         <title>Hygroscopic&#8208;Evaporative Generator for Multiform Energy Harvesting from Environment and Food Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired hygroscopic&#8211;evaporative generator, mimicking plant transpiration, stably harvests multiple ubiquitous energies&#8212;humidity, heat, wind, light, and fruit respiration. Its electricity originates from evaporation&#8208;driven spontaneous Li&#8314; migration within a Li&#8211;Cellulose matrix. This mechanism ensures continuous, environment&#8208;adaptive operation, positioning HEGs as sustainable power platforms for real&#8208;world environments and food applications.








Abstract
Moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation (MEG) has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, most current systems rely exclusively on ambient relative humidity, exhibiting low output power and limited operational stability under fluctuating environmental conditions. Inspired by the natural process of plant transpiration&#8212;which efficiently circulates water using environmental stimuli such as humidity, sunlight, and wind&#8212;this study reports a hygroscopic&#8208;evaporative generator (HEG) capable of constantly converting ambient moisture into electricity. The HEG consists of a Lithium&#8208;Cellulose&#8208;based hygroscopic layer rich in mobile Li&#8314; ions and a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area evaporative layer. Electricity generation is driven by spontaneous water adsorption on one side and directional water evaporation on the other, establishing a Li&#8314; ion flow across the device. A single HEG unit delivers a peak voltage exceeding 1.0&#160;V, a peak current of 0.8&#160;mA, and a maximum power density of 1.506&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;3. By harvesting supplemental solar and wind energy, the HEG exhibits enhanced power output and stable performance even under large day&#8208;night humidity fluctuations. Furthermore, the device effectively scavenges bio&#8208;moisture from fruit respiration, enabling the generation of 1.2&#8211;1.4&#160;V and significantly prolonging fruit shelf life, underscoring its durability and practical relevance for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Lithographically Controlled Liquid Metal Diffusion in Graphene: Fabrication and Magnetotransport Signatures of Superconductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithography&#8208;guided intercalation creates a proximitized 2D superconducting Ga layer under graphene Hall bars via liquid&#8208;metal intercalation. The image shows a Hall bar where Ga atoms from the liquid phase enter through patterned intercalation channels beneath quasi&#8208;freestanding bilayer graphene, forming a confined 2D metal that demonstrates superconductivity near 3.5 K and suppresses the quantum Hall effect in the intercalated graphene.








Abstract
Metal intercalation in epitaxial graphene enables the emergence of proximity&#8208;induced superconductivity and modified quantum transport properties. However, systematic transport studies of intercalated graphene have been hindered by challenges in device fabrication, including processing&#8208;induced deintercalation and instability under standard lithographic techniques. Here, a lithographically controlled intercalation approach is introduced that enables the scalable fabrication of gallium&#8208;intercalated quasi&#8208;freestanding bilayer graphene (QFBLG) Hall bar devices. By integrating lithographic structuring with subsequent intercalation through dedicated intercalation channels, this method ensures precise control over metal incorporation while preserving device integrity. Magnetotransport measurements reveal superconductivity with a critical temperature Tconset$T_c^{{\mathrm{onset}}}$&#8776; 3.5 K and the occurrence of a transverse resistance, including both symmetric and antisymmetric field components, which is attributed to the symmetric&#8208;in&#8208;field component of non&#8208;uniform currents. These results establish an advanced fabrication method for intercalated graphene devices, providing access to systematic investigations of confined 2D superconductivity and emergent electronic phases in van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Synergistic Hollow Structure Design and Defect Engineering in Dandelion&#8208;Like &#945;&#8208;MnO2 for Superior Radar&#8208;Infrared Compatible Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a design of defect&#8208;manipulated &#945;&#8208;MnO2 featuring dandelion&#8208;like hollow nanoarchitectures, the remarkably broadband microwave absorption (8.9&#160;GHz at 2.7&#160;mm, RL&#8592;10&#160;dB) and thermal conductivity (0.31&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) are simultaneously achieved for the as&#8208;filled single coating layer. Therefore, this study presents a groundbreaking solution to address the inherent microwave absorption incompatibility of conventional thermal insulation coatings, offering a bright new design strategy in exploring next&#8208;generation multispectral stealth materials.








Abstract
Radar&#8208;infrared compatible materials have emerged as a pivotal research focus on developing next&#8208;generation multispectral stealth technologies. However, achieving high&#8208;performance compatible stealth in a single integrated coating remains a significant challenge. This study proposes the design of a unique ion&#8208;modulated &#945;&#8208;MnO2 with a dandelion&#8208;like hollow structure, which functions as a promising filler to achieve superior radar&#8208;infrared compatible stealth property in a single&#8208;layer coating using epoxy resin as the binder. The intriguing phenomenon is primarily attributed to the synergistic effects of multitiered hollowness and defects induced by low&#8208;valence cation doping, which enhance polarization loss behaviors and further reduce thermal conductivity. As a result, the remarkably broadband microwave absorption (RL&#8592;10&#160;dB) of 8.9&#160;GHz is achieved, covering most of X/Ku bands. Meanwhile, the thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;) of the coating is prominently reduced from 0.59 to 0.31&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, with actual thermal radiation signals being visually suppressed. Therefore, this work presents a significant solution to address the inherent microwave absorption incompatibility of conventional thermal insulation coatings, offering a new strategy in exploring advanced multispectral stealth materials.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Liquid Metal Nanophotonic Platform for Color Display and Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrically reconfigurable nanophotonic platform is realized by combining electrowetting&#8208;actuated liquid metal and gold nanoantennas in a microfluidic system. Controlled movement of the liquid metal in the microfluidic channel leads to structural change of the nanophotonic resonators, which in turn induces drastic changes in their reflection spectra and colors. The demonstrated reconfigurable nanophotonic platform may find a wide range of display, imaging, and sensing applications.








Abstract
Dynamically tunable optical materials and device architectures are essential for future photonic technologies, yet conventional solid metals lack the intrinsic tunability required for advanced functionalities. Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LMs) present an appealing alternative thanks to their distinctive mechanical and optical properties; however, their practical integration in tunable photonic elements remains largely unexplored. Here, an electrochemically controlled nanophotonic platform is demonstrated that integrates a dynamically reconfigurable LM ground plane with gold nanoantenna arrays within a microfluidic system, enabling precise and reversible modulation of optical resonances across the visible to mid&#8208;infrared spectral ranges. By employing moderate operational voltages (1.5&#8211;3.0&#160;V), real&#8208;time tuning of high&#8208;resolution structural color patterns is achieved through nanoscale control of the interfacial gap between the LM and Au nanoantennas. This innovative platform facilitates electrically programmable, high&#8208;contrast color patterns suitable for dynamic optical displays, secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and imaging applications. Additionally, this platform enables tunable mid&#8208;infrared spectral responses, which may be utilized for chemical and biological sensing applications. This versatile integrated LM&#8208;based nanophotonic platform opens new paths toward multifunctional, actively tunable/reconfigurable photonic device and system technologies.

         <title>Ivy&#8208;Inspired Design of Polymer Gel Electrolytes for Fiber Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by ivy's strong adhesion endowed by polymerizing its secreted monomers, a fiber lithium&#8208;ion battery is developed by copolymerizing monomers within twisted fiber electrodes under mild conditions, producing stable interfaces with electrodes. The fiber battery exhibits high cycling, deforming and storing stability with a low cost of $1.5 per meter.








Abstract
Polymer gel electrolytes have been integrated into flexible electrodes with channeled structures to replace liquid electrolytes, enabling flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries that offer both enhanced safety and high performance. However, conventional gel electrolyte preparation often requires harsh conditions&#8212;such as heating, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, or oxygen&#8208;free environments&#8212; which hinder scalable and cost&#8208;effective manufacturing. Inspired by the natural adhesion mechanism of ivy, which winds around supports, secretes a monomer&#8208;rich fluid, and undergoes mild crosslinking, a fiber lithium&#8208;ion battery is designed by co&#8208;winding fiber&#8208;based cathodes and anodes, followed by infiltrating and curing a precursor solution containing ternary and pentagonal cyclic ethers as monomers and a Lewis acid as an electrophilic initiator. This solution undergoes room&#8208;temperature curing, forming a robust and stable interface between the gel electrolyte and electrodes. The resulting fiber battery exhibits excellent cycling stability (88% capacity retention after 1000 cycles), mechanical durability (96% retention after 10&#160;000 bending cycles), and storage stability (80% capacity retention at 40&#160;&#176;C and 80% relative humidity (RH)). Remarkably, the battery remains operational under extreme conditions such as cutting and burning. This bioinspired strategy eliminates complex processing steps and lowers production costs by 46%, achieving a manufacturing cost of $1.5 per meter&#8212;a critical advancement for the scalable application of flexible battery technology.

The phosphate bonded perchloric superstructure confines free water molecules and functions simultaneously on both electrodes, improving the kinetics of sodium&#8208;ion intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation at the cathode while promoting a stable, uniform and robust solid electrolyte interphase at the anode. These synergistic actions enhance the performance of aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) offer a cost&#8208;effective and safe platform for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical application is impeded by poor energy density and limited operating time, primarily due to the sluggish Na+ intercalation kinetics and severe parasitic side reactions. Here, through multiple characterizations and molecular dynamics simulations, an unexpected phase transition of the NaMnO2 cathode and incomplete formation of phosphorus oxide interphase on the anode is observed, which causes the failure of ASIBs. To circumvent these issues, an electrolyte with phosphate bonded perchloric (PBP) superstructure is proposed to simultaneously boost cathodic Na+ transport and promote the formation of a robust Na4P2O6/Na4P2O7 interphase on the anode surface. This electrolyte design enables batteries to deliver a cathodic specific capacity of 198.21&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, with prolonged operating time exceeding 1440 h and an energy density of 82.31&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 (based on the mass of electrode materials). Even under practical application conditions (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and a mass loading of 10&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), the batteries remain functional and exhibit exceptional electrochemical performance. The study underscores the potential of PBP superstructure as an alternative electrolyte engineering pathway toward energy&#8208;dense and long lifespan ASIBs.

         <title>3D Printing of Gradient Biomimetic Scaffold via Electrochemical Molecular Lock for Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and simple preparation method is proposed for continuous gradient scaffolds. It addresses the difficulty of simultaneously reproducing multi&#8208;scale anisotropy and continuous gradient structures in vitro. This study proposes a novel method for constructing bio&#8208;grade continuous gradient hydrogel scaffolds, paving the way for new avenues in engineering biomimetic tissue scaffolds.








Abstract
Gradient structures are widely present in tissues. The natural gradient exhibits an accuracy of 10 nm and possesses a four&#8208;level multi&#8208;scale structure (10nm&#8211;1cm). The accuracy of biological 3D printing is approximately 5um, which presents huge challenges in simultaneously replicating multi&#8208;scale anisotropy and continuous gradient structures in vitro. Here, a fabrication method termed as electrochemical training of gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel is reported that leverages gradient ion coordination and molecular locking to achieve the rapid assembly of disordered hydrogel to fill this gap. This ETH (electrochemical training hydrogel) scaffold exhibits multi&#8208;scale anisotropic gradient structure from 5nm to 2cm, marking the first successful integration of multi&#8208;scale anisotropy with continuous gradient structures. More importantly, this method constructed a tough gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel scaffold with a strength of 12.67 MPa, which increased by 937 times (13.5 kPa to 12.67 MPa). This study proposes a novel method for constructing bio&#8208;grade gradient hydrogel scaffolds, paving the way for new avenues in engineering biomimetic tissue scaffolds.

         <title>Manipulating F&#246;rster and Dexter Energy Transfer via Generation Regulation of Dendritic TADF Sensitizer for Solution&#8208;Processable Narrowband Electroluminescence with EQE over 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripheral branches generation&#8208;regulated thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecules have been developed to act as dendritic sensitizers to modulate energy transfer of excitons, achieving a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 40.6% for a solution&#8208;processable TADF&#8208;sensitized narrowband green device.








Abstract
A high&#8208;efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitized fluorophor, abbreviated as TSF, requires suppressing Dexter energy transfer (DET) while ensuring an effective F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The current general strategy for blocking DET is encapsulating the terminal emitter to increase the distance between the TADF sensitizer and emitter (RDA); however, there are few reports on increasing RDA by modifying the molecular structure of the TADF sensitizer. Here, a molecular design is proposed to modulate RDA from the perspective of TADF sensitizer, where three dendritic TADF sensitizers (nGPh&#8208;5CzBN, n = generation) are developed by increasing the generation of peripheral branches. On the one hand, TADF sensitizer with high&#8208;generation dendrons blocks DET and prevents excitons loss by enlarging RDA; on the other hand, the excessive cladding of dendritic TADF sensitizer, in turn, also hinders efficient FRET from itself to the emitter. As a result, a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 40.6% is realized for 2GPh&#8208;5CzBN&#8208;based solution&#8208;processable TSF&#8208;OLEDs, with a full width at half maximum of 34 nm, but the EQEmax values are 23.9% and 16.0% for 1GPh&#8208;5CzBN&#8208;based and 3GPh&#8208;5CzBN&#8208;based counterparts, respectively. This work demonstrates the cutting&#8208;edge EQE of solution&#8208;processable narrowband devices, highlighting unique advantages of structural control for dendritic molecules.

         <title>Improvement of Room Temperature Valley Polarization in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Homojunction via Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Gated Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving strong valley polarization in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at room temperature is highly desirable but remains difficult. Here, by employing bilayer TMDs homojunctions with ionic&#8208;liquid gating and back&#8208;gate modulation, this work achieves remarkable enhancement of valley polarization, offering new opportunities for practical valley&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Due to broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the valleys in momentum space can be selectively controlled by circularly polarized light. This property enables valleytronics applications, where information is encoded in valley states, paving the way for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and quantum devices. In this work, bilayer TMDs homojunctions are fabricated that preserve the intrinsic valley degrees of freedom while maintaining broken spatial inversion symmetry. A significant increase in the degree of valley polarization (DVP) from 0 to 23% and 28% for A (XA) and B (XB) excitons of MoS2/MoS2 homojunction, and 16% for WS2/WS2 homojunction at 300 K is achieved by employing the ionic&#8208;liquid gating (ILG) method. Furthermore, in the MoS2/MoS2 homojunction, the room temperature DVP can be further enhanced to 44% and 51% through back&#8208;gate&#8208;controlled Fermi level modulation, respectively, exceeding the previously reported values for MoS2 monolayers. This improvement is attributed to the high electron concentration, which suppresses intervalley scattering through Coulomb interaction screening, thereby enhancing valley polarization. These findings provide a robust strategy for achieving higher valley polarization in TMDs, advancing the development of practical valley&#8208;based electronic devices operable at room temperature.

         <title>Electrolyte Li+ Chemical Potential Correlates with Graphite Negative Electrode Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the electrolyte Li+ chemical potential (&#181;Li+) is a quantitative descriptor of electrochemical Li+ intercalation into graphite negative electrodes. Solvent cointercalation can be generally suppressed, and Li+ intercalation is enabled by employing electrolytes with t high &#181;Li+ exceeding the boundary region, which provides a design principle for advanced battery electrolytes.








Abstract
Novel electrolytes for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with higher energy density and safety are being extensively explored. A major challenge in developing new electrolytes is achieving reversible Li+ intercalation into graphite negative electrodes. In commercial LIBs, this reaction is reversible in ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolytes, whereas unfavorable Li+&#8211;solvent cointercalation occurs in many other electrolytes. Recently, EC&#8208;free Li+ intercalation has been achieved in some types of advanced electrolytes, including (localized) highly concentrated electrolytes and weakly coordinating electrolytes. However, an essential factor that dominates whether Li+ intercalation or Li+&#8211;solvent cointercalation occurs has yet to be identified. Herein, the electrolyte Li+ chemical potential is reported as a quantitative descriptor of the Li+ intercalation behavior. Solvent cointercalation is generally inhibited above a certain threshold of the electrolyte Li+ chemical potential. This work provides a novel guideline for designing advanced LIB electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates that the electrolyte Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chemical potential (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is a quantitative descriptor of electrochemical Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation into graphite negative electrodes. Solvent cointercalation can be generally suppressed, and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation is enabled by employing electrolytes with t high &lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Li&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exceeding the boundary region, which provides a design principle for advanced battery electrolytes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel electrolytes for advanced lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with higher energy density and safety are being extensively explored. A major challenge in developing new electrolytes is achieving reversible Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation into graphite negative electrodes. In commercial LIBs, this reaction is reversible in ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolytes, whereas unfavorable Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;solvent cointercalation occurs in many other electrolytes. Recently, EC-free Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation has been achieved in some types of advanced electrolytes, including (localized) highly concentrated electrolytes and weakly coordinating electrolytes. However, an essential factor that dominates whether Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;solvent cointercalation occurs has yet to be identified. Herein, the electrolyte Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chemical potential is reported as a quantitative descriptor of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation behavior. Solvent cointercalation is generally inhibited above a certain threshold of the electrolyte Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chemical potential. This work provides a novel guideline for designing advanced LIB electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivating the Current Collector: A Catalytic Strategy for Carbon&#8208;Free Sulfur&#8208;Based Cathodes</title>

Carbon&#8208;Free Sulfur Cathode via Catalytic Transformation: Overcomes sluggish kinetics and polysulfide dissolution in sulfur batteries without energy&#8208;dense carbon additives (&gt;30 wt.%). A spontaneous reaction on copper foil, catalyzed by iron sulfide, forms conductive copper sulfide. Enables 95 wt.% active material cathodes with high capacity (1588 mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), 100% retention over 1000 cycles, offering a scalable high&#8208;energy framework.








Abstract
The practical deployment of sulfur cathodes in rechargeable batteries is limited by sluggish redox kinetics and polysulfide dissolution, which impair energy efficiency and cycling stability. Conventional strategies&#8211;such as carbon&#8208;sulfur composites&#8211;mitigate these issues but require &gt;30&#160;wt.% of electrochemically inactive additives, reducing energy density. Here, a carbon&#8208;free sulfur&#8208;based cathode formed via a spontaneous solid&#8208;state reaction is presented between elemental sulfur and copper foil, catalyzed by layered mackinawite iron sulfide. By effectively lowering the reaction energy barrier, this catalyst accelerates the solid&#8208;phase reaction kinetics between sulfur and copper, thereby enabling the in situ formation of conductive covellite copper sulfide with pseudocapacitive behavior, which allows electrodes with 95&#160;wt.% active material. The cathodes deliver remarkable kinetic performance, with a specific capacity of 1588&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, as well as exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability, demonstrating 100% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Operando spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations elucidate the structural and electronic evolution underlying the catalytic process. By reconfiguring the current collector as an active component, this strategy offers a scalable and generalizable framework for constructing high&#8208;energy, carbon&#8208;free sulfur&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Terraced Stacking Engineering in Moir&#233; Ferroelectric Superlattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; ferroelectricity promises ultracompact electronics but is hindered by topological constraints and complex polarization evolution. This work introduces a boundary confinement strategy to disrupt topological restrictions and achieve precise domain control. Through this strategy, stacking configurations and domain walls are directly visualized, enabling nonvolatile polarization switching. These findings elucidate the structure&#8208;polarization relationship, advancing the design of functional moir&#233; ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
Emergent moir&#233; ferroelectricity, capable of realizing ferroelectricity down to the atomic scale, holds transformative promise for ultracompact electronics. However, directly visualizing the stacking&#8208;engineered interfacial ferroelectric phase is inherently difficult due to the intricate domain network involving overlapping lattice structures and complex polarization evolution. Moreover, the topological nature of the network inherently restricts nonvolatile switching, posing a fundamental barrier to practical implementation. In this work, a controlled boundary confinement engineering is proposed to disrupt topological constraints and enable precise domain engineering in moir&#233; superlattices. Utilizing scanning probe microscopy and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, atomic&#8208;resolution observation of the WSe2 stacking configuration is achieved, including R&#8208; (sliding ferroelectricity), H&#8208;stacking, and domain walls with broken C3 symmetry, from a cross&#8208;sectional perspective. Nonvolatile polarization switching is observed due to the elimination of nodes&#8217; pinning effects and the freedom of domain wall motion. The findings clarify the relationship between atomic structure and polarization distribution in the moir&#233; system, providing crucial insights for the design and manipulation of moir&#233; ferroelectrics in functional devices.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Level Energy Dissipation and Multi&#8208;Scenario Energy Harvesting in Elastomers Enabled by Synergistic Coordination of Subnanowires and Dynamic Boron&#8208;Oxygen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)&#8208;polyborosiloxane (PBS)&#8208;GdOOH (PPG) elastomer is designed via synergistic coordination of GdOOH subnanowires (SNWs) and dynamic boron&#8208;oxygen (B&#9472;O) bonds. Multi&#8208;level energy dissipation of PPG includes: i) hydrogen bond breaking; ii) coordination bond breaking; iii) entanglement and sliding of SNWs. PPG exhibits excellent impact resistance, and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on PPG can effectively capture energy from human motion, water droplets, and waves.








Abstract
The development of durable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) capable of efficient energy harvesting across diverse scenarios remains challenging due to the inherent brittleness and limited energy&#8208;dissipation capacity of conventional triboelectric materials. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)&#8208;polyborosiloxane (PBS)&#8208;GdOOH (PPG) elastomer is designed via synergistic coordination of GdOOH subnanowires (SNWs) and dynamic boron&#8208;oxygen (B&#9472;O) bonds. Multi&#8208;level energy dissipation of PPG occurs during the stress process: i) hydrogen bond breaking; ii) dynamic B&#9472;O bond and metal coordination bond breaking; iii) entanglement and sliding of SNWs. Compared to pure PDMS, PPG exhibits 6.1 times higher maximum strain and 37.6 times higher toughness, as well as excellent impact resistance. Furthermore, SNWs significantly enhance the triboelectric performance of TENG, yielding an open&#8208;circuit voltage and a short&#8208;circuit current that are 53 and 19 times higher than the PDMS&#8208;based device. Such TENGs enables efficient energy harvesting from human motion, water droplets, and waves. It is demonstrated that SNWs exhibit a synergistic enhancement effect on the mechanical and triboelectric properties of polymers, offering new insights for the design of impact&#8208;resistant materials and high&#8208;performance TENGs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Limiting Synthesis of Supported Nanoparticle Superlattices on Diverse Substrates via Surface Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;limiting surface coordination enables the scalable synthesis of high&#8208;density nanoparticle superlattices on diverse substrates. Sodium oleate (NaOA) adsorption facilitates uniform cation exchange, followed by pyrolysis to produce size&#8208;controlled nanoparticles that spontaneously assemble into ordered arrays. This strategy is exemplified by FeMnCoZnCeNiO@CNT, which enhances sulfur reduction reaction kinetics through multimetallic synergy&#8212;bridging precision nanochemistry with scalable manufacturing.








Abstract
High&#8208;loading, uniformly dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) on functional substrates are vital for advanced catalysis and energy storage, yet remain difficult to realize because of particle aggregation, size polydispersity, and weak interfacial binding. Herein, a versatile and scalable self&#8208;limiting synthesis strategy based on surface coordination chemistry is presented to fabricate compositionally tunable NP superlattices on a broad range of substrates&#8212;including carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, carbon fibers, silicon wafers, and natural shells. This approach leverages the selective adsorption of sodium oleate onto substrate surfaces through hydrogen bonding between its carboxyl groups and surface hydroxyl or carboxyl groups, creating a reactive interface for site&#8208;specific cation exchange with mono&#8208; to multinary metal ions. Subsequent pyrolysis converts the exchanged layer into NPs, while the self&#8208;limiting mechanism&#8212;driven by precursor exhaustion and ligand passivation&#8212;ensures uniform NP sizes and spontaneous assembly into ordered superlattices. As a functional demonstration, high&#8208;density deposition of complex FeMnCoZnCeNiOx NPs on commercial carbon nanotubes is achieved, showcasing their enhanced performance as catalytic sulfur hosts in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This strategy offers a robust pathway to integrate precision nanochemistry with scalable materials processing, opening new possibilities for advanced energy storage and catalysis.

Herein, a versatile and scalable self-limiting synthesis strategy based on surface coordination chemistry is presented to fabricate compositionally tunable NP superlattices on a broad range of substrates&#8212;including carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, carbon fibers, silicon wafers, and natural shells. This approach leverages the selective adsorption of sodium oleate onto substrate surfaces through hydrogen bonding between its carboxyl groups and surface hydroxyl or carboxyl groups, creating a reactive interface for site-specific cation exchange with mono- to multinary metal ions. Subsequent pyrolysis converts the exchanged layer into NPs, while the self-limiting mechanism&#8212;driven by precursor exhaustion and ligand passivation&#8212;ensures uniform NP sizes and spontaneous assembly into ordered superlattices. As a functional demonstration, high-density deposition of complex FeMnCoZnCeNiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; NPs on commercial carbon nanotubes is achieved, showcasing their enhanced performance as catalytic sulfur hosts in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This strategy offers a robust pathway to integrate precision nanochemistry with scalable materials processing, opening new possibilities for advanced energy storage and catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Engineered Ceria Enables 4f&#8208;Orbital&#8208;Driven Redox Catalysis for Bidirectional Sulfur Conversion in Li&#9472;S Batteries</title>

Vacancy&#8208;engineered CeO2 catalyst, leveraging 4f&#8208;orbital modulation, dynamically regulates polysulfide redox via reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ cycling. Configured as a conformal layer on commercial separators, Ov&#8208;CeO2/CNT enables rapid and durable bidirectional sulfur conversion with high energy density in Li&#9472;S batteries.2.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;flexible rare&#8208;earth catalysts featuring partially filled 4f orbitals enable orbital&#8208;level modulation of sulfur electrochemistry. Here, an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered CeO2/carbon nanotube (Ov&#8208;CeO2/CNT) composite is reported, configured as a conformal catalytic layer on a commercial separator, to regulate polysulfide redox reactions in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries. In situ and ex situ characterizations, corroborated by DFT calculations, reveal that oxygen vacancies dynamically modulate the Ce electronic environment, enabling reversible Ce3+(4f1)/Ce4+(4f0) redox cycling and interfacial charge transfer. This vacancy&#8208;induced orbital hybridization between Ce&#8208;4f/S&#8208;3p and Li&#8208;2s/O&#8208;2p states enhances LiPS adsorption, lowers the barriers for Li2S nucleation and decomposition, and facilitates ion transport, thereby accelerating bidirectional sulfur conversion and ensuring stable redox reversibility. As a result, the designed cell achieves long&#8208;term durability (743.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5C), high&#8208;rate capability (up to 5C), and high energy density in pouch cells. This work establishes 4f&#8208;orbital&#8208;mediated defect engineering as a scalable and effective strategy for designing redox&#8208;regulating catalysts in high&#8208;performance Li&#9472;S batteries.

         <title>Spatially Matched C&#8211;N Coupling within Carbon Defect Confined Interlayer Fe Clusters for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, spatially matched interlayer Fe clusters (Feacs)&#160;is constructed via multiple layer defective graphite. Such as&#8208;synthesized interlayer Feacs catalyst achieves a high urea Faradaic efficiency (39.8%) and an outstanding intrinsic activity of 3643.65&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gFe&#8722;1. This work reveals that the spatial distribution of active sites is the key for C&#9472;N coupling electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Tailoring spatially matched multi&#8208;site structure to simultaneously coordinate CO2 and NO3&#8722; activation and coupling remains a significant challenge for urea electrosynthesis. Herein, interlayer Fe atomic clusters is constructed (Feacs) in expanded 2H&#8208;graphitic carbon via a carbon defect&#8208;confinement strategy, where spatially matched Feacs between graphite layers act as ideal nanoreactors for cooperative C&#9472;N coupling. These interlayer Feacs are achieved by kinetically modulating cascade reactions (FeOx reduction, H2/CO2&#8208;mediated carbon etching, and vacancy trapping) during pyrolysis under H2/Ar atmosphere with low flow rates. As a result, the interlayer Feacs catalyst exhibits a high urea Faradaic efficiency of 39.80% and a normalized production rate of 3643.65&#160;mm h&#8722;1 gFe&#8722;1, which is 7.98&#8208; and 9.88&#8208;fold higher than control samples (Fe particles without interlayer structure). In&#8208;situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the spatial matched interlayer Feacs structure promotes the adsorption of *CO intermediate and lowers energy barriers for the dehydration of NH2OH, while carbon defects favor water dissociation kinetics, accelerating subsequent hydrogenation steps and promoting C&#9472;N coupling within the interlayer Feacs. This work provides a paradigm for designing catalysts with spatial matched active sites for sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>Efficient Dark Current Suppression by Engineering PIET&#8208;Active Discrete Donor&#8211;Acceptor Architecture for High&#8208;Sensitivity Semiconductor Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a discrete donor&#8211;acceptor structure and employing photoinduced electron transfer, it is demonstrated that a viologen&#8208;based, bismuth&#8208;halide photochromic semiconductor significantly reduces the dark current by &#8776;94%. This reduction far surpasses those reported for external field&#8208;induced modification methods. Correspondingly, the detection sensitivity is doubled. This synergistic strategy provides an efficient pathway to ultra&#8209;high sensitivity photodetectors and intelligent semiconductor materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;sensitivity photodetectors are of paramount importance for astronomy, night vision, and bioimaging. Current methods for enhancing sensitivity still face the challenges of complex preparation processes and the dependence on low&#8208;temperature environments. This work demonstrates that constructing a discrete, donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A) structure and employing the photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) technique may simultaneously reduce dark current and increase photocurrent efficiently, thereby significantly enhancing the detection sensitivity. With this synergetic strategy, a viologen&#8208;based photochromic semiconductor with a discrete bismuth halide structure may reduce its dark current by &#8776;94% &#8212;a reduction far exceeding those reported using external field&#8208;induced modification methods&#8212;while simultaneously enhancing the photocurrent by &#8776;83% after PIET and coloration. This value corresponds to a two&#8208;fold increase of the detection sensitivity (S). This finding opens a new effective strategy to explore ultra&#8208;highsensitivity photodetectors and smart semiconductors.

         <title>In Situ 3D Conductive Networks and Interfacial Bonding to Stabilize Oxygen Vacancies for Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D Li1.3Al0.1Sc0.2Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LASTP) conductive network with a fast Li+ transport channel is in situ constructed at the SCNCM interface by using the uniform liquid film strategy. This network links SCNCM particles and LASTP through of Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds. The LASTP network promotes the rapid transport of Li+, Sc&#9472;O, and Al&#9472;O bonds, stabilizes oxygen vacancies to enhance the structural stability of the interface, slowing down the irreversible phase transition from layered structure (O3) to rock&#8208;salt (RS).








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal nickel&#8208;rich LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (SCNCM, x &#8805; 0.9) has emerged as a promising cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to high energy density and robust crystal structure. However, severe phase transitions contribute to performance degradation and mechanical instability during long&#8208;term cycling. To address these challenges, a uniform liquid film strategy is proposed for the in situ construction of a 3D Li1.3Al0.1Sc0.2Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LASTP) conductive network at (003) plane of SCNCM interface. This network establishes an interface bonding&#8212;via Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds&#8212;between SCNCM particles and LASTP. The LASTP framework facilitates rapid lithium&#8208;ion conduction, while the Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds stabilize oxygen vacancies, thereby suppressing oxygen evolution and enhancing interfacial structural integrity. This mitigates the irreversible phase transition (especially O3 to O1) and lattice deformation. The feasibility and effectiveness of this 3D network approach are substantiated through a combination of experimental investigations, DFT calculations, BEVL network analysis, and COMSOL simulations. As expected, the pouch&#8208;type full battery can achieve a satisfactory capacity retention of 83.7% after 1900 cycles (85.8% at 2.8&#8211;4.25&#160;V after 1200 cycles). Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 79.1% with 161.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles in 2.8&#8211;4.4&#160;V at 50&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;A 3D Li&lt;sub&gt;1.3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LASTP) conductive network with a fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channel is in situ constructed at the SCNCM interface by using the uniform liquid film strategy. This network links SCNCM particles and LASTP through of Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds. The LASTP network promotes the rapid transport of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Sc&#9472;O, and Al&#9472;O bonds, stabilizes oxygen vacancies to enhance the structural stability of the interface, slowing down the irreversible phase transition from layered structure (O3) to rock-salt (RS).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-crystal nickel-rich LiNi&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-x-y&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SCNCM, x &#8805; 0.9) has emerged as a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries, owing to high energy density and robust crystal structure. However, severe phase transitions contribute to performance degradation and mechanical instability during long-term cycling. To address these challenges, a uniform liquid film strategy is proposed for the in situ construction of a 3D Li&lt;sub&gt;1.3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1.7&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LASTP) conductive network at (003) plane of SCNCM interface. This network establishes an interface bonding&#8212;via Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds&#8212;between SCNCM particles and LASTP. The LASTP framework facilitates rapid lithium-ion conduction, while the Sc&#9472;O and Al&#9472;O bonds stabilize oxygen vacancies, thereby suppressing oxygen evolution and enhancing interfacial structural integrity. This mitigates the irreversible phase transition (especially O3 to O1) and lattice deformation. The feasibility and effectiveness of this 3D network approach are substantiated through a combination of experimental investigations, DFT calculations, BEVL network analysis, and COMSOL simulations. As expected, the pouch-type full battery can achieve a satisfactory capacity retention of 83.7% after 1900 cycles (85.8% at 2.8&#8211;4.25&#160;V after 1200 cycles). Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 79.1% with 161.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 800 cycles in 2.8&#8211;4.4&#160;V at 50&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Electron Coupling in Nonaromatic Architectures Drives Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;mediated through&#8208;space conjugation is proposed as a novel design strategy for organic semiconductors. This innovative approach addresses long&#8208;standing limitations in light harvesting and charge dynamics inherent to conventional organic semiconductors, enabling highly efficient hydrogen evolution across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum.








Abstract
The rational design of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic materials capable of simultaneously addressing sustainability challenges and performance demands represents a critical frontier in photocatalysis research. Herein, these finding are reported that nonaromatic biomass&#8208;derived architectures have exceptional visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infraredphotocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution via a novel 3D through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) mechanism, which leads to a transformative strategy for sustainable hydrogen production. It is identified that the oxygen&#8208;mediated 2p orbital hybridization in these biomass&#8208;derived materials constitutes semiconductor&#8208;like band structures with exceptionally broad band light absorption capabilities. Moreover, the inherent electronegativity gradient among carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms creates an asymmetric charge distribution, generating substantial molecular dipole moments (&gt;10 Debye) that leads to enhanced charge separation. The optimized materials achieve record&#8208;high apparent quantum yields of 44.63% (420 nm) and 1.58% (800 nm) for hydrogen production, rivaling state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. This revealed TSC mechanism fundamentally redefines the design paradigm for organic photocatalysts, creating a sustainable materials platform that concurrently enables biomass valorization and efficient solar fuel generation. These findings represent a conceptual breakthrough in the photocatalyst design, offering a vast opportunity for advancing next&#8208;generation solar fuel technologies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Afterglow of Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Metal Halides for Multi&#8208;Dimensional Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a rationally designed Mn2+&#8208;doped organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide is reported exhibiting dual&#8208;mode emission characteristics. The material demonstrates both UV&#8208;activated room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced long persistent luminescence. Leveraging these complementary photophysical properties, a multi&#8208;dimensional optical encryption platform is developed that operates across temporal, spatial, and energy domains, enabling sophisticated time&#8208;resolved information security applications.








Abstract
Organic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials exhibiting room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials have attracted growing attention for various time&#8208;resolved optoelectronic applications. To date, realizing intrinsically distinct RTP and LPL emissions within a single material system remains elusive, yet it is crucial for unlocking multifunctional applications such as multilevel optical encryption. Here, a Mn2+&#8208;doped organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide is presented that exhibits bright yellow phosphorescence under UV excitation and a long&#8208;lasting red afterglow persisting for over 600 s under X&#8208;ray irradiation. These contrasting emission behaviors originate from distinct recombination pathways: triplet exciton emission from the organic ligand governs RTP, while LPL arises from Mn2+&#8208;centered emission. The latter is enabled by the thermally activated release of charge carriers trapped at radiation&#8208;induced defects. This excitation&#8208;dependent divergence in luminescence offers temporal and spectral control over optical signals, enabling a multidimensional time&#8211;space&#8211;energy encoded optical encryption platform. The findings introduce a pathway&#8208;engineered strategy for multi&#8208;mode phosphorescent materials, paving the way for further materials design for emerging intelligent optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Tailoring Altermagnetic Spin Splitting via Strain&#8208;Induced Symmetry Reconstruction in CrSb Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering interfacial strain in 10 nm CrSb films via molecular beam epitaxy, we systematically tailored the crystal symmetry. High&#8208;resolution spin&#8208;ARPES measurements uncovered a transition to a spin&#8208;degenerate ground state throughout the entire Brillouin zone, demonstrating quantitative strain control over altermagnetic spin splitting. This approach establishes a new paradigm for controlling altermagnetic order through engineered symmetry.








Abstract
Altermagnets represent a novel class of quantum magnets that emerge from specific crystal symmetry operations, particularly rotations or mirror reflections, exhibiting unique momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split band structures within the antiferromagnetic regime. The spin textures of altermagnets are fundamentally governed by spin group symmetry, offering unique opportunities for magnetic property control. However, experimentally tuning their spin&#8208;splitting via symmetry engineering remains a key challenge. Here, interfacial strain in 10&#160;nm CrSb thin films by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is engineered to systematically modify its crystal symmetry. Remarkably, high&#8208;resolution spin&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (spin&#8208;ARPES) measurements revealed a transition to a spin&#8208;degenerate ground state throughout the entire Brillouin zone, quantitatively demonstrating strain control over altermagnetic spin splitting. Although bulk altermagnetic theory anticipates spin&#8208;splitting, thin films exhibit spin degeneracy instead, which this first&#8208;principles calculations trace to interfacial strain&#8208;mediated surface magnetic state stabilization. In CrSb thin films, strain&#8208;induced magnetic reconstruction preserves PT symmetry (spatial inversion followed by time reversal), thereby enforces spin degeneracy across the Brillouin zone, as evidenced by the quantitative agreement between calculated spin/electronic structures and spin&#8208;ARPES measurements. This strategy establishes a new paradigm for tailoring altermagnetic spin splitting through engineered symmetry, addressing a critical gap in spectroscopic investigations of altermagnetic systems.

         <title>In Situ Building Halide&#8208;Alloy Dual&#8208;Phase Interfaces for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interlayer is engineered through surface modification of Li6PS5Cl particles to mitigate dendrite propagation in argyrodite&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries. A continuous LiCl&#8208;rich electron blocking matrix interlaced with lithiophilic Li&#8208;Ga/Li&#8208;In alloys is in situ formed upon lithium contact. It simultaneously provides electrochemical, chemical, and physical functionalities, achieving exceptional cycling stability with an ultra&#8208;thin lithium anode and high&#8208;loading Ni&#8208;rich cathode.








Abstract
Argyrodite&#8209;type sulfide solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all&#8209;solid&#8209;state lithium&#8209;metal batteries due to their high Li&#8209;ion conductivity and favorable mechanical compliance. Nevertheless, their inherent chemical reactivity toward Li metal induces continuous interfacial degradation and filamentary Li growth, undermining their practical viability. Herein, a surface&#8208;modified Li6PS5Cl electrolyte is engineered via co&#8208;treatment with GaCl3 and InCl3, enabling the in situ formation of a multifunctional interphase upon contact with lithium metal. These conversion reactions produce a LiCl&#8208;rich, electronically insulating matrix interlaced with lithiophilic Li&#8208;Ga and Li&#8208;In alloys. The LiCl matrix enhances interfacial energy to inhibit dendrite formation, while the alloy network promotes continuous and uniform lithium&#8208;ion transport. Concurrently, this interfacial layer scavenges irregular Li deposits formed during initial plating and acts as a conformal interlayer to maintain intimate contact. Consequently, Li||Li symmetric cells achieve exceptional cycling stability (&gt;2600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2). Paired with a Nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.9Mn0.05Co0.05O2 cathode, full cells retain 80% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C with an ultra&#8208;thin 50 &#181;m Li anode. This study highlights the effectiveness of engineered surface coating layers in stabilizing the anode interface with minimal disruption to the sulfide electrolyte framework.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional interlayer is engineered through surface modification of Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl particles to mitigate dendrite propagation in argyrodite-based solid-state batteries. A continuous LiCl-rich electron blocking matrix interlaced with lithiophilic Li-Ga/Li-In alloys is in situ formed upon lithium contact. It simultaneously provides electrochemical, chemical, and physical functionalities, achieving exceptional cycling stability with an ultra-thin lithium anode and high-loading Ni-rich cathode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argyrodite&#8209;type sulfide solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all&#8209;solid&#8209;state lithium&#8209;metal batteries due to their high Li&#8209;ion conductivity and favorable mechanical compliance. Nevertheless, their inherent chemical reactivity toward Li metal induces continuous interfacial degradation and filamentary Li growth, undermining their practical viability. Herein, a surface-modified Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl electrolyte is engineered via co-treatment with GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and InCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling the in situ formation of a multifunctional interphase upon contact with lithium metal. These conversion reactions produce a LiCl-rich, electronically insulating matrix interlaced with lithiophilic Li-Ga and Li-In alloys. The LiCl matrix enhances interfacial energy to inhibit dendrite formation, while the alloy network promotes continuous and uniform lithium-ion transport. Concurrently, this interfacial layer scavenges irregular Li deposits formed during initial plating and acts as a conformal interlayer to maintain intimate contact. Consequently, Li||Li symmetric cells achieve exceptional cycling stability (&amp;gt;2600 h at 0.5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Paired with a Nickel-rich LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, full cells retain 80% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C with an ultra-thin 50 &#181;m Li anode. This study highlights the effectiveness of engineered surface coating layers in stabilizing the anode interface with minimal disruption to the sulfide electrolyte framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Azolate Framework&#8208;Derived Porous Carbon Nanocomposite Hydrogels Shielding Material with Tunable Dynamic Bonding&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>

This image demonstrates a multifunctional Fe@C/TPS nanocomposite hydrogel that concurrently offers enhanced ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, and 56.97 dB EMI shielding in the X&#8208;band with rapid strain sensing. The hydrogel, enabled by a water&#8208;ethylene glycol solvent, functions at low temperatures and is self&#8208;reparable, recovering over 92% of its shielding effectiveness after mechanical damage.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels are promising candidates for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in flexible and wearable electronics, yet their practical implementation remains hindered by low&#8208;temperature freezing and mechanical fragility. Although organohydrogels can enhance anti&#8208;freezing performance, their compromised conductivity often reduces shielding efficiency. Here, a multifunctional Fe@C/TPS nanocomposite hydrogel engineered through the incorporation of nitrogen&#8208;rich azolate framework&#8211;derived porous carbon is reported. The introduction of these nanomaterials simultaneously enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness through strong interfacial interactions. As a result, the hydrogel achieves an outstanding EMI shielding effectiveness of 56.97&#160;dB in the X&#8208;band, alongside rapid strain response (response time: 200&#160;ms, GF = 4.7). Remarkably, stable shielding and sensing performance are maintained even under harsh conditions, including &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and 60% tensile strain, owing to the binary water&#8211;ethylene glycol solvent system that sustains a robust conductive network. Moreover, the dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions impart excellent self&#8208;healing behavior, enabling over 92% recovery of the original shielding efficiency after mechanical damage.

         <title>Robust Metal and Semiconductor Phase Transition Memristor Using Ag&#8208;Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8314; intercalation in MoTe2 induces reversible 2H&#8211;1T/1T&#8242; phase transitions, as confirmed by microscopy and spectroscopy. The resulting Ag&#8314;MoTe2 PTMEM achieves a 200&#160;000 on/off ratio, enhanced retention, near&#8208;ideal linearity, and 91.7% MNIST accuracy. Compared to Li&#8314;&#8208;based PTMEMs, it offers superior stability and performance for advanced memory&#8208;based neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Metal (1T/1T')&#8208;semiconductor (2H) phase transition memristors (PTMEMs) based on intercalated alkali metal ions (Li+) in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit excellent electrical properties, including heterosynaptic plasticity. However, the low stability of Li+ ions limits retention and on/off ratios of the PTMEMs. Here, a phase transition in MoTe2 induced by intercalated Ag+ ions is demonstrated for the first time, enabling robust memristor operation. The migration of Ag+ ions, controlled by voltage biases, clearly realizes reversible 2H&#8208;1T/1T&#8217; phase transitions, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman mapping. The memristive mechanism of MoTe2 shifts from doping (4&#8211;8&#160;h) to phase transition (12&#160;h) as Ag intercalation time increases, achieving a 200&#160;000 on/off ratio at a 4&#160;nm thickness. MoTe2 exhibits the most evident phase transition due to its low transition barrier (0.84) compared to other TMDs (&gt;1.22). Intercalated Ag+ ions provide outstanding memristive performance over Li+ ions, with a 100 times higher on/off ratio, 300 times better retention, and 8 times lower non&#8208;linearity (&#946;Ag = 0.5&#8211;0.6, &#946;Li = 4.0). Ag+MoTe2 PTMEM achieves 91.7% accuracy in MNIST recognition, surpassing the 81.7% accuracy of Li+MoS2 PTMEM. These findings demonstrate that Ag+MoTe2 PTMEM holds great potential for advanced memory&#8208;based neural network applications.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Mediated Isotropic Lithium Diffusion on Electrocatalyst Surface for Efficient Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>

A new type of oxygen&#8208;mediated isotropic lithium diffusion on the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalyst surface is discovered, resulting in a breakthrough in dynamic rates and high&#8208;current performance in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
By combining renewable electricity storage with electrochemical CO2 recycling, Li&#8211;CO2 batteries offer a dual&#8208;purpose technology that is critical for carbon neutrality. However, their efficiency is severely limited by the sluggish reaction of insulating discharge products, including Li2CO3, which are dominated by Li+ diffusion and coupling process. In this study, a new type of oxygen&#8208;mediated isotropic lithium diffusion on the electrocatalyst surface is discovered, resulting in a breakthrough in dynamic rates and high&#8208;current performance in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. Using Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the oxygen isotropic mediation brings short&#8208;range oxygen coordination as Li+ jumping channels, and long&#8208;range isotropic structures for free Li+ diffusion pathways. The electrocatalyst achieved Li+ surface diffusion at 5.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;cm&#160;s&#8722;1, a tenfold improvement over rates measured on conventional electrocatalysts, and directly accelerated the Li2CO3 nucleation and decomposition. The electrocatalyst&#8208;based cells demonstrated the elevated discharge and charge voltage of 2.86 and 3.76&#160;V. This study provides guidelines for electrocatalyst design with ultrafast ion diffusion on the surface and accelerates the adoption of efficient Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Strain Engineering and Interfacial Energy Transfer Boosting Optoelectronic Properties in C60/WS2 van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, combining molecular semiconductors and atomically flat nanomaterials, offer vast opportunities to tailor optoelectronic properties at heterointerfaces. Heteroepitaxial growth of C60 on monolayer WS2 induces anisotropic compressive strain at the heterointerface due to lattice mismatch, driving the formation of 1D polymeric chains along the c&#8208;axis and activating otherwise symmetry&#8208;forbidden optical transitions. Coupled with interfacial energy transfer, photoluminescence of C60 film is enhanced by 310% over disordered aggregates, highlighting how heteroepitaxial growth, interfacial strain, and energy alignment can tailor the optoelectronic properties of vdW heterostructures.

Here, the heteroepitaxial assembly of C60 molecules on monolayer tungsten disulfide (ML&#8208;WS2), where an anisotropic compression strain within the C60 lattice at the heterointerface induces the formation of 1D polymeric C60 strings and activates otherwise symmetry&#8208;forbidden S1 &#8594; S0 optical transitions, is reported. This, coupled with interfacial energy transfer from ML&#8208;WS2 to C60, results in a remarkable 310% enhancement in the PL intensity compared to disordered C60 aggregates. The resulting C60/ML&#8208;WS2 transistors exhibit superior electrical and optoelectronic performance, achieving a charge carrier mobility of 10.4 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, facilitated by an ultralow 230 meV contact barrier with Au electrodes. These devices demonstrate a superior photoresponsivity of 46.4 A W&#8722;1 and a detectivity of 3.6 &#215; 1012 Jones, greatly outperforming pristine ML&#8208;WS2 counterpart devices.

Heteroepitaxial growth of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; on monolayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induces anisotropic compressive strain at the heterointerface due to lattice mismatch, driving the formation of 1D polymeric chains along the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis and activating otherwise symmetry-forbidden optical transitions. Coupled with interfacial energy transfer, photoluminescence of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; film is enhanced by 310% over disordered aggregates, highlighting how heteroepitaxial growth, interfacial strain, and energy alignment can tailor the optoelectronic properties of vdW heterostructures.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Solvation Structures Enable Long&#8208;Cycle Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N/O functional groups&#8208;rich NECS is proposed through the nitro&#8208;based solvents design and Na&#8208;ion solvation structure optimization to enhance the dual&#8208;electrode interfaces stability of SMBs. Exceptional cycling lifespan of coin cell (&gt;1000 cycles), and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell (&gt;200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) construction validate the feasibility of designing solvation structure for the advanced SMBs&#160;technologies.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) metal anode exhibits excellent prospects in rechargeable battery systems owing to its high theoretical capacity (1166 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) and its high abundance in the crust (2.3%). However, the electrochemical/mechanical unstable electrode interphases induce the rapid battery performance degradation and severely hinder the wide applications of Na metal batteries (SMBs). Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;enriched coordinated solvation structure (NECS) is designed to simultaneously stabilize both electrodes through the innovation of solvation&#8208;structure&#8208;derived interphases engineering. The NECS&#8208;derived N/O&#8208;rich inorganic solid electrolyte interphase enables uniform and dendrite&#8208;free Na plating/stripping for a working Na anode. NECS&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase, composed of NaNxOy, Na3N, and other Na containing compounds, significantly enhances the structural stability and electrochemical reversibility of the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode. The Na||Na symmetric cell with NECS electrolyte remains stable for more than 4000&#160;h. Besides, the Na||NFM full cell achieves 1000 cycles with 86.1% capacity retention using a high loading electrode of 7.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Na||NFM pouch cell configuration demonstrates a high energy density of 202.6&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, underscoring the practicality of the proposed electrolyte strategy. The strategy solvation structure modulation proposed in this work offers a universal approach to overcoming the challenge between high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;lifespan of SMBs.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made Solar Desalination and Salt Harvesting from Diverse Saline Water Enabled by Multi&#8208;Material Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>

Heterogeneous photothermal materials are developed via multi&#8208;material printing with modular design, and demonstrated for high&#8208;performance solar desalination and solute separation across a broad salinity range.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered interfacial evaporation offers a sustainable, low&#8208;carbon solution to freshwater scarcity. Aerogels, hydrogels, and foams are common photothermal materials, yet their isotropic 3D structures from conventional fabrication constrain performance optimization, integrated functionality, and user&#8208;defined applications. Herein, photothermal matrices are fabricated via multi&#8208;material 3D printing, precisely depositing diverse photothermal inks at designated spatial locations. Synergistic engineering of ink formulations, cation&#8208;modulated cross&#8208;linking, printing fidelity, hierarchical porosity, and matrix integration enables compositional, structural, and functional heterogeneity for high&#8208;performance solar desalination and solute separation across a broad salinity range (3.5&#8211;25%). Under 1 sun, 3D steam generators (SGs) attain the highest water evaporation rate of 17.9 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 in seawater under 2 m s&#8722;1 airflow &#8212; 10.5% higher than in freshwater and over six times that under calm air. Even in 25% brine, evaporation rates of 6.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 are retained. Strategic rearrangement of matrix units further produces 3D solar crystallizers (SCs) for localized salt harvesting. The work demonstrates, for the first time, the use of multi&#8208;material printing for the flexible fabrication of both SGs and SCs, delivering application&#8208;specific photothermal materials that not only enhance evaporation in seawater compared to freshwater, but also operate effectively under extreme salinity with record&#8208;level performance.

         <title>Synergistic Material&#8208;Interface Engineering: Unlocking Superior Performance in PbSe Thermoelectric Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic material&#8208;interface engineering strategy combining light Te alloying, trace Bi doping, and MgNi+Cu multilayer contacts unlocks superior thermoelectric performance in PbSe. The optimized modules exhibit an average ZT &gt;1.0 (300&#8211;773 K), 9.5% conversion efficiency, and a maximum cooling temperature difference of &#8776;63 K, enabling cost&#8208;effective power generation and thermoelectric cooling.








Abstract
The scarcity of tellurium (Te) critically restricts the large&#8208;scale deployment of advanced thermoelectric technologies. Here, Te&#8208;free PbSe is demonstrated as a cost&#8208;effective alternative for both power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling through crystal growth, a two&#8208;step compositional optimization, and multilayer interface engineering. Light Te alloying (&lt;1%) effectively suppresses lattice thermal conductivity while preserving high carrier mobility, and subsequent trace Bi substitution (&lt;0.2&#8240;) optimizes carrier concentration without degrading carrier mobility, yielding a high power factor of &#8776;37.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 and excellent thermoelectric performance (ZT&#8776;0.6 at 300&#160;K and a peak ZT&#8776;1.3 at 773&#160;K). Furthermore, replacing conventional Ni contacts with MgNi+Cu multilayers reduces interfacial resistivity by more than twofold. Benefiting from these advances, a segmented leg with an average ZT above 1.0 over 300&#8211;773&#160;K achieves a conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.5%, while a 7&#8208;pair module delivers a maximum cooling temperature difference of &#8776;63.2&#160;K. These results establish PbSe as a cost&#8208;effective and competitive candidate for high&#8208;performance thermoelectric power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling across wide operating temperatures.

A rapid glass&#8208;substrate 3D microfabrication method creates anatomically accurate carotid artery&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models from stroke patient scans in 2&#160;h. These miniaturized devices replicate patient&#8208;specific blood vessel geometry and flow patterns, enabling real&#8208;time imaging of clot formation under controlled injury. This rapid biomanufacturing approach represents a significant advance in patient&#8208;specific organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip technology, with applications in personalized medicine and vascular device development.








Abstract
Translating patient&#8208;specific vascular geometries into functional microfluidic devices remains challenging due to fabrication limitations and lengthy processing times. Here, an ultrafast microfabrication platform is introduced using glass&#8208;substrate digital light processing 3D printing for creating patient&#8208;specific carotid artery&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip&#160;devices. The optimized protocol employs treated glass slides as printing substrates and custom&#8208;designed mechanical clamping, reducing manufacturing time from over 10&#160;h to under 2&#160;h with &#8776;100% success rate. The system accurately reproduces complex anatomical features from CT angiography data of stroke patients, including stenoses, bifurcations, and ulcerations that conventional reconstruction methods often miss. Computational fluid dynamics validation confirms preserved hemodynamic similarity between patient&#8208;scale and chip&#8208;scale geometries, with matched wall shear rates maintaining physiological relevance despite 30&#8208;fold size reduction. The platform supports endothelialization and blood perfusion, enabling real&#8208;time visualization of thrombotic processes. Integration with laser ablation technology allows controlled endothelial injury modeling at patient&#8208;specific vulnerable sites. Quantitative analysis reveals 7&#8211;10&#8208;fold higher platelet translocation in the high shear zone (&gt;1000&#160;s&#8722;1), demonstrating the platform's capability to capture shear&#8208;dependent thrombotic mechanisms. This rapid biomanufacturing approach represents a significant advance in patient&#8208;specific organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip technology, with applications in personalized medicine and vascular device development.

         <title>Mechanically Assisted Li+&#8208;Conduction in Crown Ether&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) in covalent organic frameworks work as quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte in lithium metal batteries, achieving high ionic conductivity (3.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.60) at room temperature. Crown ether's mechanical motions are studied by multiscale computational modelling, operando techniques, etc. This study shows selective and rapid transport of alkali ions by MIMs for advanced batteries.








Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) enable controlled motions like rotation and shuttling, ideal for molecular machines. Heteroatom&#8208;containing MIMs, such as crown ethers, exhibit host&#8211;guest interactions, coordinating Li+ for transport. Crown ethers are integrated into nitrogen&#8208;rich 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to create a high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (Li+@Crown&#8208;COF) for lithium metal batteries. This electrolyte achieves exceptional ionic conductivity (3.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) and a Li+ transference number (0.60) at room temperature (r.t.). The mechanically assisted Li&#8314; conduction, driven by crown ether motion within the COF's porous framework, enhances ion transport and stabilizes the lithium anode, suppressing dendrite growth. Electrochemical tests show excellent cycling stability, with full cells using an LiFePO4 cathode retaining 95% capacity after 600 cycles at 0.5C and r.t. At 60&#160;&#176;C and 2C, the cell maintained 85% of its initial capacity after 300 cycles, with 99.99% Coulombic efficiency. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and computational studies confirm mechanical motions and strong Li&#8314; binding to COF's nitrogen and oxygen sites. This MIM&#8208;COF design, leveraging the chemical novelty of mechanically interlocked systems, paves the way for safe, stable, and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Learning Crystallographic Disorder: Bridging Prediction and Experiment in Materials Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning based computational materials discovery workflows have recently proposed thousands of potentially stable crystalline materials. However, the experimental realization of these predictions is often challenging because the models assume perfectly ordered structures. This work introduces machine learning classification models that predict how likely a novel material is to display crystallographic disorder, opening the door toward disorder&#8208;aware materials discovery workflows.








Abstract
Recent computational materials discovery efforts have led to an enormous number of predictions of previously unknown, potentially stable inorganic, crystalline compounds. In particular, both high&#8208;throughput screenings and generative models have benefited tremendously from recent advances in computational resources and available data. However, these efforts are currently limited to predicting pristine crystalline materials. As a consequence, many of these predictions cannot be realized in experiments, where kinetic effects, defects, and crystallographic disorder can be crucial. To address this shortcoming, the current work aims to introduce disorder into computational materials discovery with machine learning (ML) based classification models. Trained on the inorganic crystal structure database (ICSD), these classifiers capture the chemical trends of crystallographic disorder and estimate the prevalence of disorder in computational databases produced by the Materials Project or Graph Networks for Materials Science (GNoME) initiatives. This opens the door toward disorder&#8208;aware computational materials discovery workflows, bridging the gap between prediction and&#160;experiment.

         <title>Accessing Multi&#8208;Material Liquid Crystal Elastomers Via Digitally Programmable Network Topologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A digital programming strategy to control the network topology of liquid crystal elastomers is proposed. This approach utilizes sequential orthogonal reactions, namely digital light&#8208;triggered polymerization and thermal curing, to spatially tailor phase transition temperatures, actuation responses, and optical properties within a single material. Such programmable multi&#8208;material integration would open new design avenues for advanced LCE&#8208;based actuators.








Abstract
Biological systems achieve functional complexity through spatially organized material heterogeneity, a principle that holds great promise for soft robotics. Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are ideal candidates for soft robotic materials, yet their performance is limited by the challenge of achieving precise spatial control over material properties. Here, a digital programming strategy is introduced that enables multi&#8208;material integration in LCEs via controlled network topology design. The method leverages sequential orthogonal reactions triggered by light irradiation and thermal curing, allowing for programmable network topologies. By spatially and temporally regulating the curing process using digital light patterning, both discrete localized and gradient topological variations are achieved, resulting in heterogeneous phase transition temperatures, actuation responses, and optical properties within a single LCE material. This programmable topology strategy for multi&#8208;material integration would significantly expand the design possibilities for LCE&#8208;based actuators, paving the way for advanced soft robotic material systems.

         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free flow&#8208;through electrochemical system based on hierarchical FeCoNi&#8208;layered triple hydroxide nanosheets on porous nickel foam offers a high&#8208;capacity, energy&#8208;efficient solution for chloride ion removal. The system demonstrates superior desalination performance and remarkable cycling stability, with 100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. This work presents a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach for sustainable water purification, addressing the key challenges of traditional desalination technologies.








Abstract
The increasing demand for clean water and renewable energy drives the need for efficient chloride ion removal from saline water. Here, we present a membrane&#8208;free flow&#8208;through electrochemical system using hierarchical FeCoNi&#8208;layered triple hydroxide nanosheets grown directly on porous nickel foam (FeCoNi&#8208;LTH/NF). The ternary composition uniquely enhances chloride ion adsorption by modulating electronic structure and ion binding energy. The in situ electrode synthesis approach ensures direct, binder&#8208;free contact, enhancing charge transfer and ion storage. Consequently, the FeCoNi&#8208;LTH/NF electrode achieves outstanding chloride removal capacity (180.07 mg&#160;g&#8722;1), rapid adsorption rates, high energy efficiency, and exceptional stability (100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). This work demonstrates the potential of a hierarchical triple hydroxide electrode as a scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and energy&#8208;efficient solution for sustainable water purification.

This work presents a scalable, cost-effective approach for sustainable water purification, addressing the key challenges of traditional desalination technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing demand for clean water and renewable energy drives the need for efficient chloride ion removal from saline water. Here, we present a membrane-free flow-through electrochemical system using hierarchical FeCoNi-layered triple hydroxide nanosheets grown directly on porous nickel foam (FeCoNi-LTH/NF). The ternary composition uniquely enhances chloride ion adsorption by modulating electronic structure and ion binding energy. The in situ electrode synthesis approach ensures direct, binder-free contact, enhancing charge transfer and ion storage. Consequently, the FeCoNi-LTH/NF electrode achieves outstanding chloride removal capacity (180.07 mg&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), rapid adsorption rates, high energy efficiency, and exceptional stability (100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). This work demonstrates the potential of a hierarchical triple hydroxide electrode as a scalable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient solution for sustainable water purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Textile Anodes Using Interfacial Interaction&#8208;Mediated Ultrathin Metal Organic Framework Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is introduced that leverages an ultrathin, lithiophilic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) multilayer, applied onto textile current collectors through a coordination bonding&#8208;based layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly deposition for the development of a high&#8208;performance lithium metal textile anode. This method ensures uniform MOF architecture across the textile collectors via repeated depositions of Ag ions and trithiocyanuric acid, thus avoiding complex synthesis steps.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries are among the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery systems. Their wider adoption, however, is hindered by safety and stability issues, primarily due to the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites. Herein, a high&#8208;performance dendrite&#8208;free Li textile anode is introduced for high capacity and long&#8208;term stability using interfacial interaction&#8208;mediated ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) multilayers. The repeated coordination bonding&#8208;based layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) assembly of Ag ions and trithiocyanuric acid (TCA) generates uniform and ultrathin MOF multilayers with a thickness of less than 40&#160;nm on Ni&#8208;electroplated polyester textiles. During electrochemical operations, Ag ions in the MOF are chemically reduced in situ to form highly lithiophilic Ag nanoparticles (NPs) without requiring any additional treatment, which significantly lowers the Li nucleation energy barrier. Additionally, the organic TCA in the MOF structure promotes the formation of a Li3N&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer, thereby enhancing stability over 2000&#160;h (at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) in a symmetric cell configuration. Furthermore, a full cell with a LiFePO4 cathode demonstrates remarkable capacity retention of &#8776;96.5% after 1300 cycles at 1 C. The approach underscores the critical role of interfacial interactions and ultrathin lithiophilic layers in advancing the performance of Li metal batteries.

         <title>Ultrabright NIR&#8208;II Nanoparticles for High&#8208;Resolution In Vivo Imaging: From Systemic Vasculature Visualization to Pathological Microenvironment Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic molecular design strategy that suppresses &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and reduces intramolecular charge transfer in the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen TPE&#8208;Hexoxyl is developed to achieve record&#8208;high NIR&#8208;II quantum yield in aqueous nanoparticles for high&#8208;resolution dynamic mapping of vasculature and lymphatic networks and superior tumor/inflammation detection sensitivity.








Abstract
Highly emissive fluorescence probes are crucial for precise disease diagnosis. To overcome the persistent limitations of low quantum yield in near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) organic dyes, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen, TPE&#8208;Hexoxyl, has been strategically designed. By synergistically suppressing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and minimizing intramolecular charge transfer, we engineered NIR&#8208;II nanoparticles that rank among the brightest organic probes reported (absolute &#934;PL = 0.9%). In vitro studies demonstrated that TPE&#8208;Hexoxyl nanoparticles exhibit exceptional colloidal stability and remarkable photostability. In vivo imaging displayed its high spatial resolution and prolonged tissue retention, enabling dynamic high&#8208;contrast visualization of systemic vasculature, cerebral microvasculature, and lymphatic networks. Remarkably, TPE&#8208;Hexoxyl nanoparticles show superior sensitivity in detecting tumor lesions in orthotopic 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice models and achieve precise spatial mapping of inflammatory regions in inflammatory bowel disease models, underscoring their transformative potential for clinical pathological diagnostics. This work establishes a molecular modulation paradigm for designing high&#8208;brightness organic NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, providing an advanced molecular tool for further clinical diagnostic applications.

         <title>Synergistic Electric&#8208;Spin&#8208;Dipole Modulation for Bidirectional Polysulfide Conversion Toward Reliable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synergistic electric&#8208;spin&#8208;dipole modulation strategy, by introducing amorphous CoB to modulate built&#8208;in electric fields, spin states, and electrostatic effects in Co&#8208;CoP heterojunctions, enhances the confinement and conversion of LiPSs via synergy for superior Li&#9472;S batteries.








Abstract
Electric, spin, and dipole coupling effects are increasingly employed in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance reaction kinetics. However, the controllable modulation of the electric field, spin states, and dipole interactions and their effects on lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) remains not fully understood, especially the synergies between these factors. Herein, we deliberately incorporates amorphous CoB specifically into Co&#8208;CoP heterojunctions to coordinately regulate built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEF), spin states, and electrostatic coupling effects. The amorphous CoB phase effectively reduces the BIEF intensity of Co&#8208;CoP, facilitating bidirectional LiPSs migration across the heterointerface during the charging/discharging process. The doping of B induces the spin state of transition metal Co toward a low&#8208;spin configuration, which leads to increased localization of d&#8208;orbital electrons, reduces the d&#8208;p energy level gap, and optimizes d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between cobalt and sulfur atoms validated by theoretical calculations. Compared to the weak dipole moment in CoP,&#160;the uniform alignment of dipoles within CoB generates moderately enhanced electrostatic attraction, which enhances bonding effects with LiPSs and improves adsorption&#8208;hybridization performance. This work proposes a multi&#8208;dimensional cooperative regulation mechanism (BIEF, spin, and dipole) for enhancing the polysulfide confinement/conversion, which can be extended to other battery systems suffering from shuttle effects.

         <title>Proton Selective Nanoporous Atomically Thin Graphene Membranes for Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable high&#8208;performance proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane architecture is demonstrated that integrates monolayer CVD graphene with Ar plasma&#8208;engineered Angstrom&#8208;scale proton&#8208;selective pores, stacked to mitigate non&#8208;selective defects, and interfaced with an ultrathin (&#8776;300 nm) polybenzimidazole layer sandwiched between two Nafion 211 sheets. The layered architecture facilitates facile fabrication and stochastically isolates macroscopic defects through the stacking of two individual graphene layers&#8212;yielding exceptionally low VO2+; permeability and record&#8208;high membrane selectivity.








Abstract
Angstrom&#8208;scale proton&#8208;selective pores in atomically thin 2D materials present fundamentally new opportunities for advancing proton exchange membranes (PEMs). Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFBs) for grid&#8208;scale energy storage require PEMs with high areal proton conductance (&gt;1 S cm&#8722;2) and minimal vanadium ion (VO2+) crossover. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Nafion 212 membranes (N212 &#8776;50 &#181;m thick), suffer from persistent VO2+ crossover reducing performance and efficiency. Here, a layered PEM is demonstrated, comprising monolayer CVD graphene with Angstrom&#8208;scale proton&#8208;selective pores introduced via Ar plasma, integrated with an ultra&#8208;thin &#8776;300 nm polybenzimidazole (PBI) layer and sandwiched between two Nafion 211 (25 &#181;m thick) layers. The layered architecture facilitates scalable membrane fabrication by mitigating defects while processing and facile stacking of graphene layers allows stochastic non&#8208;selective defect isolation enabling exceptionally low VO2+ crossover (selectivity (H+ areal conductance / VO2+ permeability) &#8776;6709 &#215; 106 S min cm&#8722;4), with proton conductance &gt;8 S cm&#8722;2. Systematic transport experiments supported by resistance&#8208;based transport modelling elucidate the role of defect size, defect isolation, and sealing, as well as layering/stacking, to enable orders of magnitude (&gt;671&#215; over N212) improvements in selectivity, along with areal proton conductance &gt;8 S cm&#8722;2. This work highlights the potential of atomic&#8208;scale proton&#8208;selective defect engineering in 2D materials, in conjunction with facile stacking and layering of materials as strategies for scalable, high&#8208;performance advances in PEMs for energy, electrochemical, and separation applications beyond VRFBs.

However, state-of-the-art Nafion 212 membranes (N212 &#8776;50 &#181;m thick), suffer from persistent VO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; crossover reducing performance and efficiency. Here, a layered PEM is demonstrated, comprising monolayer CVD graphene with Angstrom-scale proton-selective pores introduced via Ar plasma, integrated with an ultra-thin &#8776;300 nm polybenzimidazole (PBI) layer and sandwiched between two Nafion 211 (25 &#181;m thick) layers. The layered architecture facilitates scalable membrane fabrication by mitigating defects while processing and facile stacking of graphene layers allows stochastic non-selective defect isolation enabling exceptionally low VO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; crossover (selectivity (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; areal conductance / VO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability) &#8776;6709 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; S min cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;), with proton conductance &amp;gt;8 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Systematic transport experiments supported by resistance-based transport modelling elucidate the role of defect size, defect isolation, and sealing, as well as layering/stacking, to enable orders of magnitude (&amp;gt;671&#215; over N212) improvements in selectivity, along with areal proton conductance &amp;gt;8 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work highlights the potential of atomic-scale proton-selective defect engineering in 2D materials, in conjunction with facile stacking and layering of materials as strategies for scalable, high-performance advances in PEMs for energy, electrochemical, and separation applications beyond VRFBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Plane Exposed Metal Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>

Introducing catalytically active metal atoms into the COF frameworks (M&#8208;COFs) can significantly enhance its electrochemical performance. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up molecular design strategy is proposed to construct M&#8208;COFs with in&#8208;plane exposed metal sites, enabling the full utilization of the metal active sites toward accelerating sulfur redox in Li&#8211;S batteries.









Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring structural tunability and high porosity, have attracted great interest and are being developed into metal&#8208;COFs (M&#8208;COFs) by introducing metal atoms to boost their electrocatalytic performance. However, current M&#8208;COFs in Li&#8211;S batteries are fully metal coordinated in&#8208;plane environments, showing less exposed metal sites due to eclipsed (AA/AA') stacking modes. Here, a bottom&#8208;up molecular design strategy is proposed to construct M&#8208;COFs with in&#8208;plane exposed metal sites by precisely incorporating pyridine N atom pairs into the COF framework. Comprehensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the in&#8208;plane exposed active sites significantly reduce activation barriers for polysulfides conversion, thereby achieving excellent rate performance (1412&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;C, 842&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C) and cycle stability (0.027% capacity fade per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1&#160;C).

         <title>Valence&#8208;Adaptable Ni/Co Catalysis for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Wide&#8208;Temperature Operation from &#8722;20 to 50&#160;&#176;C</title>

The valence&#8208;adaptable catalytic mechanism of Ni/Co enhances the kinetics of polysulfide conversion in Na&#9472;S batteries. The preferential adsorption of NiCo&#8208;LDH toward Na2S/Na2S2 and Ti3C2Ox toward Na2S4/Na2S6 endows the composite with a superior anti&#8208;shuttle effect. The as&#8208;prepared cathode then demonstrates exceptional rate performance and cycling stability across a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
To address the challenges posed by diverse global climates, the development of wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;operable batteries is essential. Here Ti3C2Ox is used as inner sheets to support the growth of NiCo&#8208;LDH wrinkles, forming a unique cavity&#8208;structured sulfur host. The resulting cathode demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;rate performance, delivering a remarkable capacity of 1130.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 over 1200 cycles. It also exhibits outstanding wide&#8208;temperature operation, maintaining capacities of 1150.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;&#176;C (5 A g&#8722;1) and 969.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (1 A g&#8722;1) after 600 cycles. This exceptional performance across temperatures is attributed to the reversible redox behavior of the Ni2.32+ &#8596; Ni2.54+ and Co2.46+ &#8596; Co2.84+ redox couples. These transition metals from NiCo&#8208;LDH act as electron donors during discharge (from S8 to Na2S) and as electron acceptors during charge (from Na2S to S8), thereby accelerating electron transfer and enabling efficient polysulfide conversion even at low temperatures. Furthermore, adsorption experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that NiCo&#8208;LDH preferentially adsorbs short&#8208;chain polysulfides (Na2S/Na2S2), while Ti3C2Ox exhibits stronger affinity for long&#8208;chain polysulfides (Na2S4/Na2S6). This synergistic adsorption behavior enhances polysulfide retention and mitigates the shuttle effect, contributing to excellent performance stability even at high temperatures.

         <title>Switching the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Mechanism through the Creation of Disordered NiOOH Induced by Electrochemical Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that combines amorphous structure engineering and sacrificial Mo6+ is developed to control the electrochemical reconstruction of nickel oxide, thereby generating disordered NiOOH. The disordered NiOOH with significantly enhanced metal&#8208;oxygen covalency triggers the switch of OER mechanism from the AEM to the LOM, and thus achieving an overpotential of 201 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical reconstruction behavior of electrocatalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key to determining their performance. Despite its critical role, precisely controlling and rationally guiding this reconstruction behavior remains an elusive challenge. Here, an efficient strategy is reported to manipulate the reconstruction behavior of nickel oxides by concurrently introducing amorphous structure and easily oxidizable elements (i.e., Mo6+). Specifically, the amorphous structure promotes the reconstruction at a low potential and the oxidative removal of Mo6+, enabling the generation of disordered NiOOH (d&#8208;NiOOH) with abundant defects. Notably, the d&#8208;NiOOH markedly enhances the Ni&#8211;O covalency and thus triggers the reaction mechanism transition from the adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) to the lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM). As a result, the d&#8208;NiOOH displays excellent performance for the OER with an overpotential of 201 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, surpassing the ordered NiOOH (o&#8208;NiOOH, 286 mV). Remarkably, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) assembled with a&#8208;NiMoO as the anodic catalyst can attain a large current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 at a small voltage of 1.79 V, outperforming most of the reported electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tuning the Surface State and Zeta Potential of Aged CuO Nanoparticles by Additive&#8208;Free Surface Treatments as Guided by XPS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging of CuO nanoparticles (NP) involves a surface reconstruction induced by hydroxylation and concurrent organic&#8208;O adsorption, which introduces O defects in the NP subsurface region. The defective surface results in a diffuse surface space region, as reflected by a low &#950;&#8208;potential of the aged NPs in ethanol solvent. Air&#8208;annealing or ozonation of the aged NPs successfully restores the pristine CuO surface state, resulting in a much higher &#950;&#8208;potential which enables the fabrication of nanoporous CuO coatings by electrophoretic deposition.








Abstract
Broad application of nanoparticles, for e.g., catalysis, antimicrobial coatings, medicine, electronics, batteries, and nanojoining technologies, is hindered by their limited shelf&#8208;life due to ambient aging. This study traces the changes in the surface chemistry of nanoparticles during atmospheric aging by monitoring the changes in the C 1s, O 1s, Cu&#160;2p core&#8208;level spectra using XPS. The atmospheric aging of nanoparticles proceeds via hydroxylation and the adsorption of organic&#8208;O surface species, which introduces defects in the subsurface region. The position and shape of the main Cu&#160;2p3/2 peak and its satellite provide a sensitive fingerprint of the nanoparticle surface state, while the O 1s spectra reveal the formation of subsurface O defect species. Air annealing at 300&#176;C and room&#8208;temperature ozonation provide additive&#8208;free, environmentally friendly surface treatments that can convert arbitrarily aged surface back to well&#8208;defined (pristine) CuO nanoparticle surface states. Thus, reproducible dispersion characteristics of CuO nanoparticles in ethanol can be obtained independently of the aging history. These findings help to extend the shelf&#8208;life of nanoparticles and enable reproducible processing routes for CuO nanopowders to be established for advancing nanotechnologies such as nanoporous oxide membranes, catalysts, functional coatings, and&#160;batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Aging of CuO nanoparticles (NP) involves a surface reconstruction induced by hydroxylation and concurrent organic-O adsorption, which introduces O defects in the NP subsurface region. The defective surface results in a diffuse surface space region, as reflected by a low &#950;-potential of the aged NPs in ethanol solvent. Air-annealing or ozonation of the aged NPs successfully restores the pristine CuO surface state, resulting in a much higher &#950;-potential which enables the fabrication of nanoporous CuO coatings by electrophoretic deposition.

&lt;/p&gt;

Ionothermal activation of eucalyptus waste constructs oxygen&#8208;rich confined domains, precisely generating carbon vacancies. These vacancies reconstruct pyridinic nitrogen coordination, redistributing electrons to balance *O/*OH adsorption&#8211;desorption and enhance ORR kinetics. Coupled with Ni&#8208;mediated self&#8208;oxidizing redox, reducing the voltage gap and stabilizing the interface, this synergy enables high&#8208;performance CZABs, achieving 82% energy efficiency and 77% after 400 h.








Abstract
Coupled zinc&#8208;air batteries (CZABs) are promising in future energy storage and conversion solutions because of their potential for enhanced energy efficiency and boosted power density. However, sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode remain a key challenge, leading to cycling instability and insufficient battery performance. In this study, a rational interfacial etching method is developed to fabricate nitrogen&#8208;doped and defect&#8208;rich carbon catalysts from the low&#8208;cost eucalyptus waste. The precise formation of carbon vacancies, driven by synergistic spatial confinement domains and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups exposed on eucalyptus precursors, promotes the reconstruction of pyridinic nitrogen (Py&#8208;N) coordination. This induces local electron redistribution, enhancing charge transfer efficiency at adjacent Py&#8208;N sites, and optimizing *O/*OH adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, thereby significantly boosting the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. Additionally, the integration of self&#8208;adaptive Ni2+/Ni3+ redox pair into the cathode effectively mitigates the oxygen evolution reaction and thus reduces voltage delay by 0.12&#160;V. The resulting CZABs achieve 82% energy efficiency at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 77% after 400&#160;h, which is rarely reported. This work elucidates the intricate mechanism of defect formation during biomass pyrolysis and presents a scalable, cost&#8208;effective strategy for producing high&#8208;efficiency catalysts, offering a promising strategy toward advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Spatial Decoupling Strategy Enhanced Ionic Liquid&#8208;Confined Porous MXene for Breakthrough Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid confined porous MXene (IPM) osmotic energy conversion system is constructed. The ion transport dynamics in the MXene nanofluidic channel are optimized at the microscopic level, and the spatial decoupling design is used at the macroscopic level to greatly suppress the ion concentration polarization effect. The maximum output power of a single device reached 3.47 &#181;W, which is nearly ten times higher than that of similar work.








Abstract
The potential of reverse electrodialysis for harvesting osmotic energy is severely limited by ion concentration polarization (ICP), a phenomenon that restricts power output and confines the technology to the laboratory scale (&lt; 0.4 &#181;W). This challenge is overcome with an ionic liquid confined porous MXene (IPM) system that integrates strategies across two scales. At the microscopic level, sub&#8208;nanometer channels are engineered using porous MXene and confined ionic liquids to reduce mass transfer resistance and optimize ion transport. Concurrently, at the macroscopic level, a micropore array design spatially decouples the diffusion interfaces to effectively suppress the ICP effect. This dual&#8208;scale approach increases power density by 53.6% and achieves a maximum output power of 3.47 &#181;W, which is nearly ten times higher than that of similar work. The work demonstrates a robust pathway for overcoming critical power limitations, advancing osmotic energy conversion toward industrial renewable energy applications.

Bi&#8208;salt hc&#8208;PEO SEs, with a 20 times increase in ionic conductivities, are designed by balancing anion&#8208;Li+&#8208;EO interactions, where anionic decompositions induce ionic conductive electrode/SE interfaces, enabling facilitated lithium&#8208;ion transport in the SE and across interfaces. An ultrahigh critical current density of 2 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 4.5 V Li//LiCoO2 ASSLBs with a capacity retention of 80% after 200 cycles are achieved.








Abstract
The sluggish lithium&#8208;ion transport in high&#8208;concentration polyethylene oxide (hc&#8208;PEO) solid electrolytes (SEs) and across the electrode/hc&#8208;PEO SE interface causes failure of high&#8208;voltage PEO&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Here, bi&#8208;salt hc&#8208;PEO SEs with TFSI&#8722; and PO2F2&#8722; are creatively fabricated, where PO2F2&#8722; possesses higher Li+&#9472;PO2F2&#8722; bonding energy, balancing anion&#8208;Li+&#8208;EO interactions by weakening Li+&#8208;EO interaction while strengthening Li+&#8208;anion interaction, and decomposes at electrode/SE interfaces, enabling facilitated lithium&#8208;ion transport in the SE and across interfaces. Li+ interactions in anion&#8208;Li+&#8208;EO aggregations are counterintuitively optimized when two anions reach an approximate molar ratio. Consequently, the ionic conductivity at 60&#160;&#176;C is enhanced by &#8776;20 times to 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, compared to hc&#8208;PEO SE with LiTFSI (5.8 &#215; 10&#8722;6 S&#160;cm&#8722;1) or dominated LiPO2F2 (5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;6 S&#160;cm&#8722;1). Using the bi&#8208;salt hc&#8208;PEO SE, Li//Li cells deliver an ultrahigh critical current density of 2 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 20 times enhanced exchange current, and 4.5 V Li//LiCoO2 ASSLBs exhibit a capacity retention of 80% after 200 cycles, superior to reported results. The synergistic anion decomposition, yielding pure lithium&#8208;ion conductive electrode/SE interfaces containing Li3PO4 and LixPOFy, depresses adverse side reactions and breaks sluggish ionic transport. This work explicitly demonstrates the utility of coordination regulations in achieving enhanced lithium&#8208;ion transport for long&#8208;lifespan high&#8208;voltage ASSLBs.

         <title>Nanoconfined Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Mo Asymmetric Sites Enable Ambient Spontaneous O2&#8208;to&#8208;1O2 Conversion for Sustainable Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Cu+&#9472;O&#9472;Mo6+ dual&#8208;site in a nanoconfined membrane turns O2 into singlet oxygen at ambient conditions with &#8776;95% selectivity, bypassing superoxide. It concentrates reactants for rapid pollutant removal, operates stably in continuous flow with ultra&#8208;low metal leaching and cost, efficiently purifying complex waters.








Abstract
The selective activation of molecular oxygen (O2) to singlet oxygen (1O2) represents a sustainable route for green oxidation yet remains fundamentally challenged by spin&#8208;forbidden transitions and kinetic trapping of superoxide intermediates. Here, an asymmetric Cu+&#9472;O&#9472;Mo6+ dual&#8208;site embedded within a nanoconfined membrane is constructed that drives spontaneous O2&#8208;to&#8208;1O2 conversion under ambient conditions, achieving 95.2% selectivity without additional energy inputs. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that electron&#8208;rich Cu+ sites facilitate spin&#8208;selective electron transfer to adsorbed O2 while adjacent Mo6+ sites stabilize Cu+ species and facilitate the direct formation of 1O2, bypassing the conventional superoxide desorption bottleneck. The nanoconfined environment further concentrates local reactants, yielding a 0.053 ms&#8722;1 degradation rate constant, exceeding most Fenton&#8208;like systems. The system maintains operational stability for 146&#160;h in continuous&#8208;flow filtration with ultralow metal leaching (&lt;0.02&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1) and operational cost (0.01 USD&#160;L&#8722;1), enabling over 95% removal of diverse micropollutants in complex water matrices. This work establishes a new catalytic paradigm merging atomic&#8208;scale asymmetric site design with nanoconfinement engineering for sustainable and selective O2 activation, providing an efficient and environmentally benign strategy for advanced water purification.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Chambered Branches of Hollow Nanoreactors Drive Spatiotemporal Regulation of *CO Intermediate for Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a multi&#8208;chambered branched hollow nanoreactor (HoNR) for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 photoreduction to CH4. The unique architecture regulates *CO intermediate coverage, promoting key *CH3O formation and achieving a high CH4 production rate of 215.5 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with 92% electron selectivity without noble metals, offering a novel paradigm for efficient cascade photocatalysis.








Abstract
The high&#8208;calorific value and gas infrastructure compatibility of methane (CH4) position it as a key target in artificial CO2 photoreduction. However, the challenge of manipulating the surface coverage of *CO intermediate on catalysts significantly impedes the efficiency and selectivity of CH4 production during the eight&#8208;electron reduction process. Here, a hollow nanoreactor (HoNR) photocatalyst (hS&#8208;ZnSe/CdSe) with multi&#8208;chambered branches is demonstrated, achieving efficient and selective CH4 production under visible light. In situ DRIFTS reveals that the branched mesoporous shell can effectively regulate the dispersion and concentration of *CO intermediate, thereby promoting methoxy (*CH3O) formation, which is a significantly kinetic determinant of CH4 generation. The HoNR photocatalyst demonstrates a superior CH4 production of 215.5 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with an electron selectivity of 92%, which surpasses most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts, especially without using any noble metal cocatalyst. Moreover, the relationship between intermediate diffusion kinetics and final product selectivity in complex geometries cavities is quantitatively established via systematic simulation. This work revolutionarily leverages chamber&#8208;branched topological architectures to drive spatiotemporally coupled cascade reactions, establishing a potential paradigm for achieving high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysis.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Artificial Antioxidases with &#960;&#8208;Electron Delocalization and Asymmetric Coordination Sites for Superior Inflammation Inhibition and Oral Bone Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully&#8208;condensed COF&#8208;based artificial antioxidase (TTf&#8208;Ru) featuring interlaminar Ru&#8208;N2Cl2 sites and extended electron delocalization, which synergistically optimizes oxygen intermediate binding and promotes efficient antioxidase&#8208;like ROS scavenging. By alleviating oxidative stress, regulating immune polarization, and maintaining stem cell osteogenesis, TTf&#8208;Ru establishes a regenerative microenvironment and mitigates inflammatory alveolar bone loss in murine periodontitis.








Abstract
Periodontitis&#8208;induced alveolar bone loss represents a complex therapeutic challenge that demands simultaneous resolution of chronic inflammation and restoration of bone homeostasis. Drawing inspiration from natural antioxidases, the de novo design of an interlaminar ruthenium&#8208;coordinated covalent organic framework (COF) is reported that functions as an artificial antioxidase system. This fully condensed COF architecture (TTf&#8208;Ru) combines extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization with precisely engineered asymmetric ruthenium coordination sites, thereby creating optimal electronic environments for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Spectroscopic and computational analyses reveal that TTf&#8208;Ru exhibits dual enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities, demonstrating both catalase&#8208; and superoxide dismutase&#8208;like functionality through tailored adsorption energetics for oxygen intermediates. At the cellular level, TTf&#8208;Ru effectively mitigates oxidative stress in mesenchymal stem cells, preserving their osteogenic differentiation capacity even under pro&#8208;inflammatory conditions. The artificial antioxidase simultaneously orchestrates an immunomodulatory response, suppressing pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophage polarization while promoting a tissue&#8208;reparative phenotype. In periodontitis models, this coordinated action translates to significant therapeutic outcomes, which reduce alveolar bone resorption and maintain periodontal tissue architecture. The findings establish a material design paradigm for COF&#8208;based enzyme mimics, highlighting how spatially organized biocatalytic centers can be engineered to address multifactorial diseases through integrated redox modulation and immune regulation, which provides new possibilities for treating ROS&#8208;mediated inflammatory disorders.

An 8 &#215; 8 photodetector array based on CuNiO2/SiC p&#8211;n junctions, enabled by a high&#8208;quality interface, strong built&#8208;in field, and tunneling transport, provides ultrafast response and ultralow detection limits.

Abstract
Self&#8208;powered ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) based on wide bandgap semiconductors (WBGSs) and their heterostructures face challenges in ultrasensitive and ultrafast weak&#8208;light detection capabilities. In this work, an 8 &#215; 8 UV photodetector array based on CuNiO2/SiC p&#8211;n heterojunctions is demonstrated to operate in both solar&#8208;blind and weak&#8208;light conditions. The device achieves a weak&#8208;light detection limit of 4.6 nW&#183;mm&#8722;2, a fast response time of 45&#160;ns, and a high responsivity of 104.2 mA&#183;W&#8722;1 and a detectivity of 3.4 &#215; 1012 Jones, outperforming self&#8208;powered UV PDs based on SiC and Ga2O3&#8208;based WBGSs and their heterostructures. This excellent performance of the device originates from the high interface quality, large built&#8208;in electric field, Fowler&#8208;Nordheim tunneling (FNT) of charge transport, and enhancing light absorption at the heterostructures. Moreover, the detector exhibits a low noise power density below 10&#8722;22 A2&#183;Hz&#8722;1 and a high cutoff frequency of 5&#160;kHz, enabling it to maintain high&#8208;contrast real&#8208;time reflection imaging capability under solar illumination.

         <title>Full Life Cycle Deicing and Efficient Anti&#8208;Icing Surface on Polymers with Triple Thermal Conversion Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic graphene@NiO/Ni surface on polymers with efficient anti&#8208;icing and photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;/magnetothermal deicing capabilities is proposed. Employing different deicing strategies at various stages endows it with full life cycle deicing functionality. This surface is patternable, applicable to various substrates, and scalable, offering guidance for designing and fabricating full life cycle deicing materials.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;/electrothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are promising for anti&#8208;icing and deicing, but their deicing ability often degrades with abrasion, thus failing to achieve full life cycle deicing. Herein, a superhydrophobic graphene@NiO/Ni&#160;surface on polymers with triple thermal conversion capability for efficient anti&#8208;icing/full life cycle deicing is prepared using laser activation, electroless plating, and electroplating. The hierarchical micro/nano structures of the uppermost graphene@NiO endow the surface with excellent hydrophobicity (162.9&#176; &#177; 2.3&#176;), delayed icing (1377.7 &#177; 180.3 s), photothermal deicing (150.0 &#177; 11.5 s), electrothermal deicing (141.3 &#177; 11.7 s), and mechanical robustness. The presence of the internal Ni layer results in the surface with superior magnetothermal deicing capability (41.0 &#177; 4.0 s). Importantly, prolonged use or abrasion can destroy the upper graphene@NiO layer, while the inner Ni layer remains unaffected. Consequently, the hydrophobicity and photo&#8208;/electrothermal deicing performance of the surface degrade after abrasion, but the magnetothermal deicing capability is enhanced. Employing different deicing methods at various stages endows the graphene@NiO/Ni surface with full life cycle deicing capability. The graphene@NiO/Ni surface is patternable, scalable, and compatible with various substrates, demonstrating successful applications in roofs and transmission lines. The method provides guidance for the design and preparation of full life cycle deicing materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Compaction Spherical Carbon with Tunable Rich Pore Structures for Efficient Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pre&#8208;pore engineered strategy was presented to tune pore structure of spherical hard carbon to balance sodium storage volume and compaction density. The obtained hard carbon achieves high initial Coulombic efficiency and simultaneous gains in gravimetric and volumetric capacities under high compaction. Multi&#8208;scale analysis clarifies how microscale electrochemistry, mesoscale packing, and fabrication methods dictate low&#8208;potential intercalation and pore&#8208;filling behaviors in lab&#8208;made versus practical electrodes.








Abstract
Hard carbon, owing to its tunable pore structure, is emerges as a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and holds a great potential to improve low&#8208;potential plateau capacity&#160;&#160;for boosting the energy density of full cells. However, a key challenge for large&#8208;scale SIBs applications is the trade&#8208;off between increasing sodium storage pore volume and maintaining high compaction density. Herein, a pre&#8208;pore engineering strategy is employed to fabricate high&#8208;compaction&#8208;density spherical hard carbon with tunable pore structures, realizing simultaneous enhancement of gravimetric and volumetric capacities. Importantly, it is found that pore structure regulation profoundly affects performance across multiple scales. Microscopically, adjusting pore structure alters intrinsic electrochemical properties, with a reversible capacity of 375.40 mAh g&#8722;1 and initial Coulombic efficiency of 90.1%. At the mesoscale, monodisperse spheres reduce packing voids and improve compaction. As a result, even under high compaction, the anode maintains a high reversible capacity of 359.49 mAh g&#8722;1 and exhibits an excellent volumetric capacity of 390.30 mAh cm&#8722;3. The assembly of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell further demonstrates its practical potential. In addition, fabrication methods determine electrode structure and sodium storage at the macroscopic scale, leading to clear differences in low&#8208;potential intercalation and pore&#8208;filling behaviors between lab&#8208;made and practical electrodes.

This study introduces an in situ encapsulated dual&#8208;nanograting structure combined with upconversion nanoparticles (NaYF4:20%Yb, 2%Er) to enhance the stability and NIR response of MAPbBr3 photodetectors. The approach significantly improves stability, extends spectral response to NIR, and achieves high responsivity (2915 mA&#183;W&#8722;1) and detectivity (1.3&#215;1011 Jones), with excellent flexibility.








Abstract
Potential applications of perovskite materials in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetectors are hindered by their instability and low absorption. In this study, dual nanogratings and upconversion nanoparticles (NaYF4:20%Yb, 2%Er) are introduced to enhance the stability of MAPbBr3 and extend its spectral response to the NIR range. A photodetector with responsivity of 2.9 A&#183;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 1.34&#215;1011 Jones at 980&#160;nm is developed using this approach. The device maintained 78.6% performance after 4 months of air exposure and 72.4% performance after 3000 bending cycles, demonstrating significant improvements in stability and flexibility.

         <title>V2O3 with Se&#8208;Enhanced d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization Toward Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries under 10 A g&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se doping causes d&#8208;p orbital hybridization and the generation of oxygen vacancies in the carbon skeleton supported V2O3@C, which shifts the V&#8208;d band center up and stabilizes the V&#9472;Se covalent network. This synergistic effect enables its high capacity to reach 460.87 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, and the retention rate is 73.8% after 20,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Vanadium&#8208;based compounds are a reliable and promising cathode material for aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, the rapid insertion/extraction of Zn2+ at high current densities triggers irreversible structural degradation and slow ion diffusion kinetics, leading to poor cycling stability. Herein, highly conductive Se is doped into a carbon skeleton of V2O3, realizing the orbital interaction between V 3d and Se 4p orbitals. Density functional theory calculations verify that the strong d&#8208;p orbital hybridization upshifts the d&#8208;band center of V, optimizes the charge distribution, and reduces the Zn2+ and H+ adsorption energies. Furthermore, the robust V&#9472;Se covalent network in the Se&#8208;V2O3@C electrode significantly enhances the electrode's redox activity and conductivity, resulting in high specific capacity and ultra&#8208;long cycle life. Therefore, the Se&#8208;V2O3@C&#8208;650 electrode exhibits a high capacity of 460.87 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. When the current density is 10 A g&#8722;1, the capacity reaches 168.32 mAh g&#8722;1 after 10&#160;000 cycles, with a 73.8% capacity retention after 20&#160;000 cycles, which exceeds the reported electrodes. This work presents new insights for constructing high&#8208;performance AZIB cathodes by establishing the mechanism of action between d&#8208;p orbital hybridization and electrochemical performance.

         <title>Sustainable All&#8208;Biomass Radiative Coolers with Biomimetic Thorny Fiber for Enhanced Thermoelectric Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Dendrocnide moroides, the biomimetic thorny fibers (BTFs) are designed by adjusting the stacking mode and orientation of nanocellulose for efficient radiative cooling. The direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing&#8208;printed BTFs integrated with thermoelectric generators can be used to efficiently convert waste heat from electronic components into electrical energy, providing a new pathway for development of sustainable energy.








Abstract
Biomass materials have garnered significant attention in radiative cooling due to their essential properties of infrared emissivity and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, the solar scattering of raw biomass exhibits inherent limitations, restricting the development of all&#8208;biomass radiative cooling materials. Hence, inspired by the silica needle structures of Dendrocnide moroides, fully cellulose&#8208;based biomimetic thorny fibers (BTFs) are developed as high&#8208;performance radiative cooling materials, demonstrating an ordered architecture with the micrometer&#8208;sized fibers and pores (&#8776;1&#8211;10 &#181;m). Ordered fibers in the hierarchical pores are mainly formed by stacking cellulose nanofibers on the templates of hydrothermal&#8208;treated cellulose nanocrystals, accompanied with the Na+&#8208;mediated electrostatic self&#8208;assembly strategy and the extrusion&#8208;induced alignment provided by direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing. The resulting BTFs exhibit an average reflectance of 91.0% in the visible spectrum and a high emissivity of 92.4% within the atmospheric window, enabling excellent daytime radiative cooling capability. Furthermore, the integration of DIW&#8208;printed BTFs into gradient&#8208;structured thermoelectric devices optimizes heat conduction, delivering an output power density of 7.61 W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of &#916;T = 30&#160;&#176;C by harvesting waste heat from electronic components. This study offers an innovative pathway for carbon&#8208;neutral cooling and sustainable energy applications.

         <title>24&#8208;h Bidirectional Thermal Energy Harvesting: From Light to Darkness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by ginkgo leaves, this study presents a 24&#8208;h bidirectional thermal energy harvesting approach by integrating spectrally selective aerogels with sisal&#8208;derived anisotropic composite phase change materials. Daytime solar harvesting achieves 87.5% energy storage efficiency and a peak temperature of 382.3&#160;K. Nighttime radiative cooling reaches 118.8&#160;W&#183;m&#8722;2, enabling sub&#8208;ambient cold energy storage (4 K below ambient). Annual energy saving potential reaches 5321.4 MJ&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;yr&#8722;1.








Abstract
Thermal energy, encompassing both heating and cooling demands, accounts for the largest share of global energy consumption. Harvesting thermal energy from the environment, including the Sun and darkness, holds promise for decarbonizing thermal sectors, but suffers from low efficiency and intermittency. Here, inspired by ginkgo leaves featuring wax&#8208;coated vertical palisade cells, a 24&#8208;h bidirectional thermal energy harvesting approach is developed by integrating spectrally selective aerogels with anisotropic composite phase change materials (CPCMs). During daytime, sunlight is captured, converted into heat, and stored in anisotropic CPCMs with high axial thermal conductivity (24.16 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1) and an anisotropy ratio of 3.7. Under one&#8208;sun irradiation, a high solar thermal energy storage efficiency of 87.5% with a peak temperature of 382.3 K is achieved by leveraging spectrally selective aerogels exhibiting &#8220;greenhouse effects&#8221;. At night, a maximum radiative cooling power of 118.8 W&#183;m&#8722;2 is attained, enabling cold energy storage at a temperature 4.0 K below ambient. The proposed leaf&#8208;inspired device operates continuously over 24 h, delivering annual thermal energy savings of 5321.4 MJ&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;yr&#8722;1, outperforming standalone solar thermal and radiative cooling systems by 44.8% and 223.3%, respectively. This bioinspired bidirectional energy harvesting strategy employing both solar and outer space resources, establishes a promising approach toward a carbon&#8208;neutral thermal energy supply.

         <title>Universal Water Transfer Printing Enables Scalable Structural Coloration of Responsive Textile Fibers for Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meter&#8208;long core&#8208;multishelled electronic fibers are judiciously fabricated via the integration of water transfer printing and coaxial extrusion, which consist of radially aligned CLC photonic sheath with highly saturated structural color, uniform liquid crystal elastomer actuation layer, and liquid metal sensing core. When woven into textiles, the strategically designed sensing gloves enable real&#8208;time visualization of stress distribution in the human hand and achieve unprecedented human&#8211;machine interaction for controlling robotic hand movements.








Abstract
Bioinspired structural coloration of&#160;responsive functional fibers&#160;is of paramount significance for smart wearable textiles and electronics. Advanced chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates, yet scalable self&#8208;assembly onto sophisticated surfaces of microscale curved fibers remains challenging. Here, water transfer printing (WTP) is pioneered as a universal strategy to judiciously transfer and radially align CLC&#8208;based structural color onto various fiber surfaces. Well&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of CLCs with radially aligned helical nanostructures onto fiber surfaces are achieved by elucidating the WTP hydrodynamics of CLCs at the air&#8208;water interface. Integrating WTP with coaxial extrusion, meter&#8208;long core&#8208;multishelled electronic fibers (StructroE&#8208;fibers) are continuously fabricated, which comprise a radially aligned CLC photonic sheath, a uniform liquid crystal elastomer actuation layer, and a liquid metal sensing core. StructroE&#8208;fibers demonstrate excellent mechano&#8208;thermo&#8208;electrochromic optical outputs under external stimuli. When woven into textiles, resulting sensing gloves enable real&#8208;time stress visualization in human hand and unprecedented human&#8211;machine interaction for controlling robot hand movements. This research can offer significant insights into bioinspired structural coloration of sophisticated fibers, and large&#8208;scale fabrication of StructroE&#8208;fibers for bridging&#160;optical and electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for their practical applications in smart textiles, wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, and beyond.

         <title>Prolonged&#8208;Nucleation Strategy via an Asymmetric Brominated Acceptor Enables &gt; 20% Efficiency in Five Different Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite efficient BTP&#8208;core acceptors, rapid nucleation limits device performance. An asymmetric acceptor, T10, is designed to regulate nucleation. Its extended core and bromination prolong nucleation time and optimize the fibrillar network. The resulting ternary device achieves a high efficiency of 19.91%, superior stability (T90 = 1609 h), and broad universality, with efficiency over 20% in five systems.








Abstract
Despite efficient charge transfer and molecular stacking in BTP&#8208;core acceptors, overly rapid nucleation often causes growth of unfavorable donor/acceptor (D/A) fibrillar networks and metastable morphologies, limiting device efficiency and stability. Herein, an asymmetric acceptor T10, featuring a brominated acenaphtho&#8208;quinoxaline central core, is developed as a nucleation&#8208;regulating ternary component. The extended 2D core promotes multi&#8208;site molecular stacking, prolonging nucleation time to 280 ms&#8212;twice that of classical eC9&#8208;4F. The strong non&#8208;covalent interactions between asymmetric T10 and PM6/eC9&#8208;4F suppress excessive D/A mixing while forming a tailored fibrillar network. Thus, the ternary device demonstrates an extended carrier lifetime (3.224 &#181;s) and a reduced defect density (1.37 &#215; 1015 cm&#8722;3), resulting in low energy disorder (21.82 meV). These effects enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage (0.873 V) and fill factor (80.68%), leading to a high efficiency of 19.91%. Additionally, the ternary device provides a superior photostability (T90 = 1609 h) compared with the two binary systems (127 and 726 h). More importantly, the T10&#8208;mediated prolonged nucleation has been successfully validated in five BTP&#8208;based acceptors, achieving PCEs of 20.07% (D18:eC9:T10), 20.40% (D18:BO&#8208;4Cl:T10), 20.47% (D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X:T10), 20.52% (D18:L8&#8208;BO:T10), and 20.67% (D18:eC9&#8208;4F:T10, certified 20.1%). This study demonstrates a molecularly engineered strategy with broad universality for extending nucleation kinetics in acceptor.

More importantly, the T10-mediated prolonged nucleation has been successfully validated in five BTP-based acceptors, achieving PCEs of 20.07% (D18:eC9:T10), 20.40% (D18:BO-4Cl:T10), 20.47% (D18:L8-BO-X:T10), 20.52% (D18:L8-BO:T10), and 20.67% (D18:eC9-4F:T10, certified 20.1%). This study demonstrates a molecularly engineered strategy with broad universality for extending nucleation kinetics in acceptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Insights into Solid&#8208;State Batteries Through Phase Modulations: Dielectric Phase and Liquid Crystal Phase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 5, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pursuit of safer, higher&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries has positioned all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) at the forefront of energy storage researches. Overcoming the ionic conductivity and interfacial challenges inherent in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) requires innovative phase&#8208;level design. This perspective offers new insights into how deliberate modulation of material phases (specifically, the dielectric phase and the liquid crystal (LC) phase) can synergistically guide ion transport and enhance interfacial stability. Dielectric materials, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), promote salt dissociation and provide intrinsic polarization, facilitating Li&#8314; migration. Meanwhile, liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) enable the formation of self&#8208;organized, highly ordered pathways that further accelerate ion conduction. By integrating these two concepts, a strategic framework for designing composite electrolytes that leverage both dielectric and mesogenic properties is presented. This perspective not only bridges fundamental material properties with electrochemical performances but also opens a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance SPEs. The strategy of modulating dielectric properties and phase structures provides a fundamental pathway to significantly enhance the performance of ASSBs, leveraging both tailored polarization and organized ion&#8208;conduction networks.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are widely regarded as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. Among the various components of ASSBs, solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted significant attention due to their excellent mechanical toughness, low densities, ease of processing, and good interfacial contact with electrodes. In recent years, liquid crystal polymer (LCP) electrolytes have emerged as a research hotspot. Unlike traditional classifications of dielectric and non&#8208;dielectric phases, the unique ordered self&#8208;assembled structures of LCP electrolytes can provide highly efficient ion transport pathways. This perspective presents a systematic perspective on regulating the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) (especially ASSBs) through the synergistic combination of dielectric and liquid crystal (LC) phases. The aim of this work is to offer detailed and timely insight into the advantages and disadvantages of polymers and their composite electrolytes from the perspectives of dielectric and ferroelectric phases, while also evaluating the potential of LCPs from the viewpoints of LC and non&#8208;LC phases. By combining the advantages of dielectric and LC phases, this work envisions a future for SPEs where ferroelectric LCPs and their composites emerge as a new class of SPEs.

         <title>Impact of Anode to Cathode Crossover in Lithium&#8208;metal Batteries With High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode chemical crossover is identified as a critical degradation mechanism in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Full&#8208;cell experiments with high&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes and localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes reveal accelerated cathode impedance growth and CEI thickening driven by lithium&#8208;metal anodes. The findings underscore the importance of cross&#8208;interface stability in high&#8208;energy battery design.








ABSTRACT
The advancement of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by the chemical instability of both lithium&#8208;metal anode and high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes. While cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode crossover is well&#8208;documented, the reverse process of anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode crossover remains underexplored. Here, we systematically investigate such crossovers and the degradation pathway in pouch cells with a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, comparing NMC622, NMC811, and NMC90 cathodes paired with lithium&#8208;metal and graphite anodes. Despite delivering higher initial capacities, LMBs exhibit faster capacity fade under long&#8208;term cycling at 45&#160;&#176;C. To isolate cathode&#8208;side degradation, galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (GEIS) measurements of cycled cathodes paired with delithiated lithium iron phosphate (LFP) counter electrodes reveal significantly higher charge&#8208;transfer resistance in cathodes cycled with lithium&#8208;metal. Surface characterization via X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) reveals greater electrolyte decomposition on cathodes cycled with lithium metal, leading to thicker, more organic&#8208;rich cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphases (CEIs), consistent with the elevated charge&#8208;transfer resistance observed in GEIS measurements. Notably, NMC90 shows the most pronounced CEI thickening, linking higher cathode surface reactivity to greater susceptibility to anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode crossover. This work presents compelling evidence of crosstalk degradation originating from lithium&#8208;metal anodes and underscores the importance of cross&#8208;interface stability for the design of durable LMBs.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction Through Frozen Phase of Organic Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;ion transport in frozen, single&#8208;solvent organic electrolytes was enabled via ion hopping. A 0.2 m LiTFSI in ethylene carbonate (EC) that remains frozen at room temperature delivers quasi&#8208;solid behavior: solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;like dendrite suppression with low interfacial resistance and reduced solvent decomposition and other parasitic reactions, enabling robust lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








ABSTRACT
Organic ice electrolytes in their frozen states are presented as molecular&#8208;solid Li+ conductors for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), challenging the notion that frozen electrolytes lack ionic conductivity. Ethylene carbonate, a cyclic carbonate, was predicted to form Li+&#8208;conductive channels in its frozen crystal structure. A room&#8208;temperature ice&#8208;phase electrolyte, EC0.2T (0.2&#160;m LiTFSI in ethylene carbonate), exhibited a high ionic conductivity (&#8764;0.64&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1) and a high Li+ transference number (&#8764;0.8) via hopping mechanism through solid matrix formed by immobilized solvent molecules. Frozen EC0.2T delivered liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;level capacity in LFP||Li cells and, more importantly, significantly extended cycle life with a solvent&#8208;derived, Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Block Copolymer Particles with Persistent Shape Memory and Programmable Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a light&#8208;responsive block copolymer (BCP) particle platform that exhibits semi&#8208;persistent shape memory and programmable reconfiguration. By integrating designed hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches featuring long&#8209;lived metastable states and exceptional fatigue resistance, we achieve robust BCP particles capable of reversible, photoswitchable changes in both shape and color.








ABSTRACT
Light&#8208;responsive polymeric particles provide a versatile platform that can undergo precisely programmed shape and color transformations, offering opportunities for advanced multi&#8208;level memory systems. We report a block copolymer (BCP) particle system that functions as a structural memory element by reversibly switching among distinct morphologies and retaining each state with long&#8208;term stability. The incorporation of hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches into polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP) particles enables reversible and light&#8208;programmed transformations, governed by (E)/(Z) isomerization under dual&#8208;wavelength irradiation at 410 and 365&#160;nm. The photoisomerization modulates the charge&#8208;transfer character of the N&#9472;Br interaction within P2VP domains, yielding three well&#8208;defined and distinct morphologies: lamellar ellipsoids (dark), networked lamellae (410&#160;nm), and surface&#8208;wrapped discs (365&#160;nm). These photoinduced morphologies can be reversibly switched over multiple cycles without detectable fatigue. Importantly, each programmed state persists as a metastable configuration over 30 days in the dark, retaining &gt; 97% of its original morphology. Furthermore, the incorporation of domain&#8208;selective fluorescent dyes enables the system to provide real&#8208;time, color&#8208;coded visual readout of its encoded states via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer modulation, opening new avenues for multi&#8208;level data storage with direct optical access.

         <title>Enhancement of Photoredox Activity by F/N Synergistic Co&#8208;Doping of Black Amorphous Carbon Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black amorphous carbon materials (aCMs) typically have extremely weak photocatalytic activity. In this study, we discovered that F/N co&#8208;doping enables aCMs to achieve more efficient charge carrier separation and transport, thereby imparting high photocatalytic performance. This enhancement originates from the polarization&#8208;facilitated separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs, which significantly improves photocatalytic performance.








ABSTRACT
Black carbon materials are widely used due to their low cost, abundance, and easy modification, but their photocatalytic application is limitedss by rapid solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion. Here, synergistic F/N co&#8208;doping was developed to enhance the photocatalytic performance of amorphous carbon materials (aCMs) by creating charge localization sites that promote electron&#8208;hole separation. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements indicate that F/N co&#8208;doping can establish a stronger internal electric field within the aCMs. A comprehensive suite of spectroscopic analyses reveal that the F/N&#8208;aCMs exhibits a lower exciton binding energy (14.60 meV), faster relaxation time of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band minimum to the exciton&#8208;mediated trap state (3.98&#160;ps), and a longer carrier lifetime (3.93&#160;ns), demonstrating significantly enhanced efficiency in charge carrier separation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm F/N co&#8208;doping reduces electron&#8208;hole overlap and lowers the energy barrier for superoxide radical (&#8226;O2&#8211;) generation. Remarkably, photocatalytic experiments not only confirm the high activity of F/N&#8208;aCMs in aldehyde oxidation (with 87%&#8211;99% yields across 22 substrates) but also demonstrate an acceptable apparent quantum yield (1.78%) and superior solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency (0.37%). This work opens up a new direction for the rational design of aCMs for photocatalytic organic synthesis.

         <title>4D Printing of Highly Maneuverable Robots: Controllable Power Amplification Behaviours of Stimulus&#8208;Response Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It provides an overview of the 4D&#8208;printed highly maneuverable robots. It focuses on the controllable power amplification behaviors of 4D&#8208;printed structures for breaking through speed and force limitations to generate highly maneuverable movements. It summarizes 4D printing and manufacturing technologies, biological power amplification mechanisms, power amplification structural designs, stimulus&#8208;response materials, motion control strategies, as well as future challenges and prospects.








ABSTRACT
Highly maneuverable robots can cross obstacles or move quickly with running, jumping, ejection, or multimodal combinations, exhibiting advantages in aerospace, agriculture, medical treatment, etc. Due to the behaviors of high&#8208;energy bursts and the huge vibrations during motions, these robots need to be simple and reliable. 4D printing of highly maneuverable robots addresses this challenge by combining the power amplification of stimulus&#8208;response materials and additive manufacturing technologies. It integrates actuation, sensing, and control modules into one component with a highly integrated structure and controllable high&#8208;mobility movement. Herein, this paper presents a review of highly maneuverable robots based on 4D printing, focusing on the key technologies from design to fabrication. Firstly, the manufacturing processes of 4D printing for highly maneuverable robots are overviewed. Then, from a biomimetic perspective, structural designs for power amplification are reviewed. After summarizing stimulus&#8208;response materials applicable to the 4D&#8208;printed highly maneuverable robots, the strategies employed to control the direction, speed, mode, and response time of robotic motion are elaborated. Finally, current challenges and the perspectives on 4D printing of highly maneuverable robots are highlighted.

         <title>A Gradient Functionalized Separator for Unlocking Latent Cathode Host Sites and Enhancing Zinc Anode DOD in Ultrahigh&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Static Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient cyano&#8208;functionalized separator is designed to regulate polyiodide distribution and zinc&#8208;ion flux in static Zn//I2 batteries. The cathode&#8208;facing dense layer confines polyiodides and activates latent host reaction sites via a reversed concentration gradient, while the anode&#8208;facing thin layer stabilizes Zn deposition. This synergy enables ultrahigh iodine utilization and record areal capacity under high I/C ratios.








ABSTRACT
The development of static aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (SAZIBs) is hindered by the polyiodide shuttling effect and poor zinc anode reversibility, issues that are exacerbated under high iodine loadings essential for high energy density. Herein, a gradient&#8208;structured separator (G&#8208;CCN@GF) is designed by modifying a glass fiber separator with 2D cyano&#8208;functionalized graphitic carbon nitride (CCN). Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the dense CCN layer facing the cathode effectively anchors polyiodides and unlocks latent electrochemical active sites, thereby facilitating conversion kinetics under high iodine loading and I/C ratio. Meanwhile, the thin and uniform CCN layer on the anode side promotes a uniform Zn2+ flux, significantly improving the zinc reversibility under high depth of discharge (DOD). Consequently, the Zn/G&#8208;CCN@GF/I2 battery with a conventional activated carbon (AC) host achieves exceptional performance under high I/C ratio (2:1) conditions, including a high areal capacity of 27.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 150.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 iodine loading and remarkable stability over 7200 cycles at 40&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. A 60 cm2 pouch cell further validates practicality, delivering 5.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 and retaining 85.87% capacity after 1100 cycles. This work provides a feasible separator&#8208;engineering strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SAZIBs.

         <title>Internal&#8208;Friction Network Piezoelectric Hydrogel Microspheres Achieve Physiological Electrical Adaptation to Regulate Mitochondrial Autophagy in Degenerative Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric hydrogel featuring an internal&#8208;friction network anchored by polyrotaxane as dynamic hubs. This unique architecture endows the system with the capability to synergistically regulate mechano&#8208;electrical conversion and energy dissipation. Specifically, by leveraging strain&#8208;dependent dynamic energy dissipation, the system buffers excessive mechanical inputs and limits electrical signal peaks, thereby adaptively maintaining the output within a physiological response threshold range conducive to tissue regeneration.








ABSTRACT
Mitochondrial autophagy imbalance critically drives apoptosis and tissue degeneration, requiring physiological electrical adaptation to meet cellular thresholds. However, degenerative tissues exhibit deficient endogenous electrical signals, disrupting cellular energy transfer. Using supramolecular engineering and microfluidic strategies, we constructed an internal&#8208;friction network hydrogel microsphere system through synergistic assembly of piezoelectric bismuth ferrite nanoparticles (BF) and sliding&#8208;ring&#8208;functionalized methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA), achieving physiological electrical adaptation in degenerative tissues. BF convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, while the stress&#8208;dependent internal&#8208;friction network regulates energy dissipation. Under low stress, sliding&#8208;ring movement produces low friction with mechanoelectrical conversion loss of 61.5&#160;kJ/m3, enhancing electrical generation. Under high stress, main chain straightening increases friction to 78.3&#160;kJ/m3, suppressing excessive signals and restoring physiological electrical adaptation. The microspheres generate stable electric fields (95&#8211;110&#160;mV/mm) under dynamic loading, promoting mitochondrial autophagy via PINK1/Parkin pathway activation, maintaining stable mitochondrial membrane potential (compared with OS group, the JC&#8208;1 ratio increases by 49.2%), and reducing nucleus pulposus apoptosis by 75%. In vivo experiments demonstrated that microsphere implantation restored the physiological electrical environment, enhanced mitochondrial autophagy, inhibited apoptosis, and delayed intervertebral disc degeneration progression, providing new insights for treating degenerative tissues through electrical adaptation restoration.

         <title>Spontaneously N&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Coatings Accelerate Electron Uptake in Shewanella Oneidensis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an n&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte, PNB, via green aldol condensation. Self&#8208;assembly with Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 forms biocompatible and conductive coatings that accelerate inward extracellular electron transfer. Inward current mapping down to single&#8208;cell resolution level reveals a &#8776;20&#8208;fold gain and &#8776;2.7&#8208;fold faster rate in per&#8208;cell uptake, translating to higher succinate output in microbial electrosynthesis.








ABSTRACT
Bioelectrochemical systems interconvert electrical and chemical energy using living microorganisms, but their efficiency remains limited by slow electron exchange across abiotic&#8208;biotic interfaces. Herein, a spontaneous n&#8208;doped water&#8208;dispersible conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE), PNB, is developed. The CPE self&#8208;assembles on the surface of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 to create biocompatible coatings that accelerate inward extracellular electron transfer. PNB is obtained via an aldol condensation reaction and is described by an acceptor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone bearing quaternary ammonium side chains. This molecular architecture enables stable n&#8208;doping in aqueous media and a broad reduction potential window. When integrated as a cathodic interlayer, PNB&#8208;S. oneidensis biohybrids exhibit a 14&#8208;fold enhancement in electron injection and a 4&#8208;fold increase in electro&#8208;driven succinate production, compared to unmodified cells. Single&#8208;cell electrochemical mapping confirms faster, more efficient per&#8208;cell electron influx. These findings demonstrate that n&#8208;type CPEs can bridge external electrodes with cellular metabolisms, opening a material&#8208;based route to high&#8208;performance bioelectronic and electrosynthetic systems.

&lt;p&gt;We developed an n-doped conjugated polyelectrolyte, PNB, via green aldol condensation. Self-assembly with &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; MR-1 forms biocompatible and conductive coatings that accelerate inward extracellular electron transfer. Inward current mapping down to single-cell resolution level reveals a &#8776;20-fold gain and &#8776;2.7-fold faster rate in per-cell uptake, translating to higher succinate output in microbial electrosynthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioelectrochemical systems interconvert electrical and chemical energy using living microorganisms, but their efficiency remains limited by slow electron exchange across abiotic-biotic interfaces. Herein, a spontaneous n-doped water-dispersible conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE), PNB, is developed. The CPE self-assembles on the surface of &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; MR-1 to create biocompatible coatings that accelerate inward extracellular electron transfer. PNB is obtained via an aldol condensation reaction and is described by an acceptor-acceptor &#960;-conjugated backbone bearing quaternary ammonium side chains. This molecular architecture enables stable n-doping in aqueous media and a broad reduction potential window. When integrated as a cathodic interlayer, PNB-&lt;i&gt;S. oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; biohybrids exhibit a 14-fold enhancement in electron injection and a 4-fold increase in electro-driven succinate production, compared to unmodified cells. Single-cell electrochemical mapping confirms faster, more efficient per-cell electron influx. These findings demonstrate that n-type CPEs can bridge external electrodes with cellular metabolisms, opening a material-based route to high-performance bioelectronic and electrosynthetic systems. By enabling more facile charge transfer between synthetic semiconductors and living catalysts, this work establishes a soft materials-driven framework for designing electronically coupled microbial systems with potential to advance sustainable bioelectronic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Organoselenization for Ultrastable Li&#8722;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing an electrophilic 2&#8722;benzothiazole diethyldithiocarbamate (BTZA) molecule, in situ organic transformation of inorganic selenium via intermolecular nucleophilic reactions with Li2Sen occurs. It fundamentally eliminates the shuttle of Li2Sen, enabling exceptional cycling stability. The organoselenium products exhibit high discharge voltages and fast kinetics, significantly enhancing the energy density and rate capability of Li&#8208;Se batteries.








ABSTRACT
The shuttle effect of lithium polyselenides (Li2Sen) seriously hinders the practical application of lithium&#8722;selenium (Li&#8722;Se) batteries. Traditional approaches for confining Li2Sen cannot fundamentally resolve this issue. In this work, we adopt a strategy of in situ conversion of inorganic selenium into organic forms, which utilizes the nucleophilic reaction between Li2Sen and 2&#8722;benzothiazole diethyldithiocarbamate (BTZA) to graft selenium atoms onto the organic framework. Upon charging, organic diselenides are generated, fundamentally eliminating the formation of Li2Sen. Furthermore, lithium benzothiazole sulfide (BTSLi) is concurrently produced during the organification process. It is converted to the redox&#8722;active 2,2&#8242;&#8722;dibenzothiazole disulfide (BTDS) during charging, compensating for the capacity loss resulting from the C&#8722;Se bond formation. Moreover, the organoselenium products exhibit high discharge voltages and strong lithium&#8722;ion transport capability, enhancing the energy density and reaction kinetics of the battery. The Li&#8722;Se cell with BTZA maintains a capacity retention of 92.87% after 1300 cycles at 2 C. The pouch cell with a capacity of 0.6 Ah can be stably operated for 30 cycles at 0.1 C. Excellent electrochemical performances are also achieved at high rates. This work presents a novel strategy for achieving highly stable Li&#8722;Se battery.

         <title>Exsolution&#8208;Driven Layered Perovskites for Stable Thermal Carbon Capture and Utilization of Waste Streams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable integrated carbon capture and utilization at high temperatures remains a challenge due to catalyst deactivation. This work shows that layered perovskite materials can release nickel nanoparticles in situ during operation. The dynamically anchored nickel stabilizes CO2 capture and waste&#8208;derived syngas production, offering a robust material strategy for high&#8208;temperature waste&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion.








ABSTRACT
Integrated carbon capture and utilization (ICCU) presents a sustainable route for simultaneous valorization of CO2 and solid waste, yet maintaining cyclic stability under high&#8208;temperature conditions remains challenging. Here, we construct dual&#8208;functional materials based on Ni&#8208;substituted layered perovskite Sr2TiO4, engineering to enhance Ni&#8208;substrate interactions, thereby stabilizing ICCU reactions via in situ exsolution. Systematic experiments and characterizations reveal that gradual Ni exsolution from the Sr2TiO4/SrTiO3 matrix during cyclic reactions yields well&#8208;dispersed, surface&#8208;anchored Ni nanoparticles. This dynamic process drives progressively increasing, then stabilized, CO2 uptakes and syngas productions across cycles, contrasting sharply with the deactivation of predeposited Ni system. Moreover, electronic structure analysis reveals that CO emissions from exsolved Ni&#8208;driven CO2 splitting are both more kinetically unfavorable than Sr2TiO4 carbonation and effectively suppressed by O2 in the flue gas. These findings demonstrate a robust strategy for efficient co&#8208;utilization of CO2 and solid waste under demanding thermochemical conditions.

         <title>Metal Single Atoms Beyond Catalysis as Quantum Modulators for Programmable Electronic Structures and Adaptive Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atoms anchored on 2D materials act as quantum modulators, reshaping local electronic structures through band flattening, van Hove singularities, and enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling. These atomically engineered effects enable voltage&#8208;controlled dielectric and electromagnetic modulation in ultrathin, flexible devices, establishing single&#8208;atom band engineering as a platform for adaptive electronics.








ABSTRACT
Metal single atoms have long been recognized for their catalytic activity through strong local interactions with host substrates. Beyond catalysis, their potential to reconfigure substrate electronic structures surpassing the host's intrinsic limits remains largely unexplored. Here, we develop an atomically engineered band&#8208;modulation strategy, in which representative d&#8208;series (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) and p&#8208;series (In, Sn, Sb, Te) atoms are anchored on 2D frameworks, including MXenes, graphene, g&#8208;C3N4, and MoS2. These atoms act as quantum modulators, precisely reconfiguring substrate structures and inducing anomalous quantum effects, which yield distinctive phenomena, including band inversion, flattening, and van Hove singularities, features rarely attainable through conventional band&#8208;engineering strategies. The tailored electronic landscape enables linear, voltage&#8208;driven tuning of electrical behavior, achieving several tens of times enhancement in dielectric permittivity and a dynamic and continuous transition from semiconducting to conductive states, all realized under an exceptionally low bias (&lt;1.0&#160;V). These functionalities are extended to a flexible electromagnetic switch that achieves programmable control of signal transmission, absorption, and reflection, overcoming the persistent difficulty of dynamic electromagnetic regulation while operating at a record&#8208;thin microscale thickness (&#8764;600&#160;&#181;m). This work establishes an atomically engineered band&#8208;modulation strategy as a versatile platform, paving the way for reconfigurable electronics and quantum devices.

         <title>Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging of Ferroelastic Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple scanning electron microscopy technique, electron channeling contrast imaging, unveils nanoscale ferroelastic domains and their coupling to functional properties in oxide heterostructures. The work demonstrates high&#8208;resolution mapping of both surface and buried domains, broadening the experimental toolbox for ferroic and quantum oxide systems.








ABSTRACT
Ferroelastic phase transitions lead to the formation of ferroelastic twins, resulting in spatial inhomogeneities in the crystal structures and functional properties of ferroelastic materials. Despite the importance of such nanoscale twins in oxide heterostructures, their direct, non&#8208;invasive observation has relied on cumbersome and low&#8208;throughput techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, or been restricted to materials with coexistence of ferroelectric and ferroelastic states, by detecting the coupled ferroelectric order. In this study, the application of electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) in a scanning electron microscope for imaging ferroelastic domains in various oxide heterostructures is demonstrated. These include systems where ferroelasticity is coupled with critical functional properties such as ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge transport. The versatility of this imaging method is highlighted across different heterostructure geometries, from bare thin films to multilayers, achieving an impressive resolution of 6&#160;nm. ECCI presents a powerful approach for exploring the rich spectrum of ferroelasticity&#8208;coupled phenomena in oxide heterostructures.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoconfined photothermal catalysis enhances solar fuel production (H2, CO2 conversion, CH4 reforming) via precise micro/nanostructures that boost photothermal efficiency and selectivity through localized fields, heat/mass transfer optimization, and reaction pathway regulation. Challenges include unclear multifield coupling, precision synthesis limitations, thermal&#8208;mass mismatches, complex reaction control, and scalability gaps. Advancements require novel materials, stability breakthroughs, and cross&#8208;scale system integration.








ABSTRACT
Nanoconfined photothermal catalysis enables tackling energy transition and carbon neutrality by constructing precise micro/nanoconfined spaces to boost photothermal efficiency and reaction selectivity. This review systematically examines the technology's core mechanisms, advanced material design strategies, and cutting&#8208;edge applications in solar fuel synthesis. We first elucidate how unique spatiotemporal field effects within confined microenvironments significantly improve photothermal efficiency and product selectivity, centered on efficient photothermal conversion, precise control of mass transfer&#8208;adsorption, optimized reaction pathways, and synergistic coupling of photo&#8208;thermal&#8208;mass multi&#8208;field interactions. Second, we detail key engineering strategies for high&#8208;performance catalysis: precise construction of confinement architectures, rational integration of efficient photothermal components, atomic&#8208;scale engineering of catalytic sites, and multifunctional interface optimization. The technology demonstrates transformative potential in light&#8208;driven hydrogen production, high&#8208;value CO2 conversion, CH4 dry/wet reforming, and directional transformation of light alkanes. However, critical challenges persist: unclear multi&#8208;physical&#8208;field coupling mechanisms; insufficient precision in sub&#8208;nanomaterial synthesis and long&#8208;term stability; thermal management&#8208;mass transfer mismatches; reaction kinetics&#8208;mass transfer trade&#8208;offs; difficulty controlling complex reaction networks; and absent scale&#8208;up pathways. This review clarifies the fundamental nature of confined catalysis to guide the development of novel multifunctional materials, break stability limits, achieve cross&#8208;scale process intensification and system integration, ultimately advancing industrial&#8208;scale, efficient, highly selective solar fuel synthesis technologies.

         <title>Atomic Eu&#8208;Mediated Acetonitrile Adsorption Configuration Switch Drives Long&#8208;Term and Ampere&#8208;Level Electrosynthesis of Ethylamine in AEM Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare&#8208;earth Eu&#8208;modified Cu2O electrocatalyst is developed to enable efficient and durable AN&#8208;ECH at ampere&#8208;level currents in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer (420 h at 2 A), representing the longest reported stability under such industrial&#8208;current conditions to date. The Eu doping induces an electronic restructuring that switches the AN adsorption from flat &#960;&#8208; to vertical N&#8208;end configuration, steering the desired proton transfer pathway while kinetically suppressing HER.








ABSTRACT
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetonitrile (AN&#8208;ECH) offers a sustainable pathway for ethylamine (EA) synthesis. However, achieving high selectivity in AN&#8208;ECH necessitates carefully balancing proton availability to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which often conflicts with the proton supply requirements under industrial&#8208;grade current densities. Herein, we design and develop a novel and effective AN&#8208;ECH catalyst consisting of rare&#8208;earth Eu atoms modified on Cu2O nanoneedles to drive efficient and durable AN&#8208;ECH at ampere&#8208;level currents. The optimized Eu&#8208;Cu2O catalyst achieves a high EA Faradaic efficiency of 98.1 % and an exceptional production rate of 2253.2 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 compared with pure Cu2O. Notably, the Eu&#8208;Cu2O can continuously operate 420 h at 2 A in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane electrolyzer for AN&#8208;ECH, representing the longest reported stability under the industrial&#8208;current conditions to date. Operando characterization and theoretical calculations elucidate that the Eu incorporation tailors the electronic structure of Cu sites, thus switching the adsorption configuration of AN from the flat&#8208;lying multi&#8208;site &#960;&#8208;adsorption to vertical N&#8208;end adsorption. This reconfiguration of the adsorption site lowers the energy barrier for the imine hydrogenation step, dictating the ideal proton addition pathway while enhancing the proton addition kinetics to suppress the HER. This work provides fundamental insights into rare&#8208;earth tuning of AN hydrogenation mechanisms and represents a critical advancement toward ampere&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of EA.

         <title>Parity&#8208;Time&#8208;Symmetric Bimorphic Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A parity&#8208;time (PT) symmetric bimorphic topological insulator is realized in a 2D photonic Floquet lattice with engineered dissipation. A four&#8208;step anomalous drive maintains an entirely real quasienergy spectrum while simultaneously supporting topological edge states (zero gap) and localized corner states (&#960;$\pi$ gap), even in the presence of optical loss. PT symmetry stabilizes the bimorphic topological insulator against long&#8208;time non&#8208;Hermitian dynamical instabilities.








ABSTRACT
We propose and experimentally realize a parity&#8208;time (PT$\mathcal {PT}$)&#8208;symmetric bimorphic topological insulator, characterized by the coexistence of first&#8208; and second&#8208;order topological phases. Our platform utilizes an anomalous Floquet model implemented in a 2D optical waveguide array, where PT$\mathcal {PT}$ symmetry is maintained via a four&#8208;step driving protocol with spatiotemporally engineered loss. Despite the presence of dissipation, we demonstrate that the PT$\mathcal {PT}$ symmetry ensures a purely real quasienergy spectrum across the topological regime, effectively stabilizing boundary modes against the dynamical instabilities and mode competition typical of non&#8208;Hermitian systems. Experimentally, we provide unambiguous evidence of this non&#8208;Hermitian bimorphic phase by observing unidirectional, clockwise edge transport in the zero gap and robust corner localization in the &#960;$\pi$ gap. Our findings pave the way for further exploration of PT$\mathcal {PT}$ &#8208;symmetric and non&#8208;Hermitian topological phases in nonlinear and many&#8208;body regimes and provide novel insights into the realization of topological insulators in open quantum&#160;systems.

         <title>Photonic Inverse Opal&#8208;Enabled Seamless Interface of Bilayer Structure for Color Regulation and Robust Passive Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A size&#8208;exclusion&#8208;assisted selective infiltration strategy is demonstrated for fabricating a seamless bilayer radiative&#8208;cooling sheet, which integrates an inverse opal photonic layer for tunable structural color with an h&#8208;BN/PMMA composite layer for high solar reflectance and broadband mid&#8208;infrared emissivity. The sheet exhibits a solar reflectance of &gt;96% and a mid&#8208;infrared emissivity of &gt;94%, enabling sub&#8208;ambient cooling of up to 7&#176;C while offering broad climate adaptability and high durability.








ABSTRACT
Colorful passive daytime radiative cooling has emerged as an attractive zero&#8208;energy&#8208;cooling technology that integrates aesthetic appeal with thermal management. However, achieving concurrent high cooling efficiency and mechanical robustness remains challenging, constrained either by the narrow solar reflection bandwidth and limited spectral tunability of monolayer photonic structures, or by interfacial heterogeneities in multilayer architectures. Here, we demonstrate a size&#8208;exclusion&#8208;assisted selective infiltration strategy for fabricating structurally colored daytime radiative cooling (SCDRC) sheets. A polymer phase exhibiting negligible solar absorption and high infrared emissivity permeates preassembled colloidal crystal templates, forming an ordered inverse opal layer upon etching, whereas microscale boron nitride platelets selectively excluded from the template organize into a packed solar&#8208;reflective microstructure. The resulting SCDRC sheets display tunable colors through pore geometry control, achieving &gt;96% solar reflectance, &gt;94% mid&#8208;infrared emissivity, a sub&#8208;ambient temperature reduction of 7&#176;C in outdoor environments, and an average cooling power reduction of 20.7% across diverse climatic zones in China. The photonic framework demonstrates exceptional stability under prolonged thermal and humidity exposure, guaranteeing persistent coloration and cooling performance. This seamless&#8208;interface bilayer fabrication strategy establishes a viable platform for developing durable colored cooling materials integrating aesthetic appeal with energy&#8208;saving functionality, showing significant potential for advanced architectural and industrial applications.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Molecular Design for Mitigating Non&#8208;Radiative Energy Loss in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission strategy is first used to overcome aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in Y&#8208;series acceptors. By integrating tetraphenylethylene, the dTPE exhibits three&#8208;fold PLQY enhancement and significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss. An ultra&#8208;low Eloss of 0.130&#160;eV and a record VOC of 0.93&#160;V are achieved, resulting in a PCE over 20.5%. This work establishes AIE design as a guiding principle for high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.








ABSTRACT
Non&#8208;radiative energy loss remains a critical bottleneck limiting the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we introduce a molecular design strategy that leverages aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) to suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and enhance solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), thereby mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination. A prototypical AIE motif, tetraphenylethylene, was incorporated into the terminal group of a Y&#8208;series non&#8208;fullerene acceptor to yield dTPE, which exhibits distinct AIE characteristics not previously observed in high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;series acceptors. Photoluminescence studies reveal that dTPE achieves a threefold enhancement in PLQY compared to L8BO&#8208;C4 in the film, leading to an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency more than an order of magnitude higher than that of D18:L8BO&#8208;C4. Consequently, the binary D18:dTPE device achieves a remarkably low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss of 0.130&#160;eV. When incorporated as a guest into D18:L8BO&#8208;C4 blends, dTPE enables a non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of only 0.190&#160;eV and an unprecedented VOC of 0.93&#160;V, yielding an efficiency of 20.5%. To our knowledge, this represents the highest VOC reported for OSCs with efficiencies above 20%. This work establishes AIE molecular design as an effective pathway to overcome intrinsic limitations of Y&#8208;series acceptors and provides guiding principles for mitigating non&#8208;radiative energy loss in next&#8208;generation OSCs.

     alt="Aggregation-Induced Emission Molecular Design for Mitigating Non-Radiative Energy Loss in Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation-induced emission strategy is first used to overcome aggregation-caused quenching in Y-series acceptors. By integrating tetraphenylethylene, the dTPE exhibits three-fold PLQY enhancement and significantly suppressed non-radiative energy loss. An ultra-low &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.130&#160;eV and a record &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.93&#160;V are achieved, resulting in a PCE over 20.5%. This work establishes AIE design as a guiding principle for high-performance organic photovoltaics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-radiative energy loss remains a critical bottleneck limiting the open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) and efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, we introduce a molecular design strategy that leverages aggregation-induced emission (AIE) to suppress aggregation-caused quenching and enhance solid-state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), thereby mitigating non-radiative recombination. A prototypical AIE motif, tetraphenylethylene, was incorporated into the terminal group of a Y-series non-fullerene acceptor to yield dTPE, which exhibits distinct AIE characteristics not previously observed in high-performance Y-series acceptors. Photoluminescence studies reveal that dTPE achieves a threefold enhancement in PLQY compared to L8BO-C4 in the film, leading to an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency more than an order of magnitude higher than that of D18:L8BO-C4. Consequently, the binary D18:dTPE device achieves a remarkably low non-radiative recombination loss of 0.130&#160;eV. When incorporated as a guest into D18:L8BO-C4 blends, dTPE enables a non-radiative voltage loss of only 0.190&#160;eV and an unprecedented &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.93&#160;V, yielding an efficiency of 20.5%. To our knowledge, this represents the highest &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; reported for OSCs with efficiencies above 20%. This work establishes AIE molecular design as an effective pathway to overcome intrinsic limitations of Y-series acceptors and provides guiding principles for mitigating non-radiative energy loss in next-generation OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Voltage Decay and Capacity Loss in Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese Oxide Cathodes: Atomic Origins, Mesoscopic Heterogeneities, and Macroscopic Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive, multi&#8208;scale analysis of the degradation pathways in lithium&#8208;rich manganese oxide (LRMO) cathode materials, spanning from atomic&#8208;level structural dynamics to mesoscopic heterogeneities and macroscopic particle evolution. Special focus is directed toward unraveling the synergistic interplay between oxygen anionic and cationic redox processes, oxygen release, transition metal ions (TMs) migration, irreversible phase transitions, heterogeneous electrochemical reactions, and operational conditions.









ABSTRACT
Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) cathode materials have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity and exceptional energy density. Nevertheless, their practical application is significantly hindered by pronounced voltage decay and capacity loss during cycling, which stem from complex and interrelated mechanisms. This review presents a comprehensive, multi&#8208;scale analysis of the degradation pathways in LRMO materials, spanning from atomic&#8208;level structural dynamics to mesoscopic heterogeneities and macroscopic particle evolution. Special focus is directed toward unraveling the synergistic interplay between oxygen anionic and cationic redox processes, oxygen release, transition metal ions (TMs) migration, irreversible phase transitions, heterogeneous electrochemical reactions, and operational conditions. By integrating insights from advanced characterization, theoretical modeling, and electrochemical analyses, this review establishes a cohesive framework that elucidates the intricate relationships among oxygen activity, TMs dynamics, and structural transformations. These mechanistic insights lay a critical foundation for the development of stabilization strategies aimed at mitigating voltage decay and capacity loss. Ultimately, this review bridges the gap between fundamental mechanistic understanding and practical engineering applications, offering actionable guidance for the design of durable and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LRMO cathode materials tailored for high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>2D MOF with Intrinsic Porosity for Colorimetric Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An uncommon 2D MOF with intrinsic in&#8208;plane porosity that can be mechanically exfoliated undergoes a distinct and reversible colour change upon exposure to various volatile organic compounds.








ABSTRACT
In this work, we report an uncommon 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with intrinsic in&#8208;plane porosity that undergoes a distinct and reversible colour change upon exposure to various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The presence of channels oriented parallel to the layers ensures permanent porosity that is preserved even after exfoliation into nanosheets with micron&#8208;scale lateral dimensions, thereby overcoming the conventional limitation of porosity loss in the monolayer regime. This unique combination of structural stability and responsive behaviour not only underscores the potential of 2D MOFs as versatile and tuneable platforms for chemical sensing, but also opens the door to channelled nanosheets, redefining the application landscape of 2D MOFs.

         <title>Li2S Anti&#8208;Passivation Deposition Guided by Electrochemically Self&#8208;Generated Thiophosphate Molecular Mediators for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective molecular mediator&#8208;guided strategy based on &#8220;in situ electrochemically generated Li3PS4 molecules&#8221; from a Ti3C2Tx nanosheet (TNS) anchored phosphorus&#8208;sulfur covalent inorganic framework (P&#8208;S CIF) is proposed to direct the nucleation and assembly of Li2S into a porous Li3PS4@Li2S hetero&#8208;cluster film, thereby overcoming Li2S passivation for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.








ABSTRACT
The practical deployment of high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is critically impeded by low sulfur utilization, primarily due to the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and, less investigated, the passivation of the deposited Li2S film. To address these challenges, we report an electrochemically in situ self&#8208;generated Li3PS4 molecules that serve as novel molecular mediators to guide the nucleation of Li2S preferentially on Li3PS4, forming a 3D assembly film composed of Li3PS4@Li2S molecular clusters with an optimized stoichiometry ratio (1:6), thereby effectively suppressing the aggregation and passivation of bulk Li2S. The Li3PS4 mediators were cyclically generated during discharge from a cathode composed of a 3D phosphorus&#8208;sulfur covalent inorganic framework (P&#8208;S CIF) grown on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (TNS). The P&#8208;S CIF features a tetrahedral architecture with phosphorus atoms at vertices interconnected by sulfur chains, spatially confining sulfur species to minimize long&#8208;chain polysulfides (Li2Sn, n&#8805;6) generation. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Li3PS4&#8208;mediated Li2S nucleation plus the spatial confinement provided by the P&#8208;S CIF, and the strong polysulfide anchoring capability of TNS, the TNS/P&#8208;S CIF cathode achieves exceptional stability and kinetics, delivering an initial capacity of 967 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and retaining 673 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 (decay rate: 0.022% per cycle). Notably, the electrode maintains an areal capacity of 6.24 mAh cm&#8722;2 under a high loading of 9.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, surpassing commercial benchmarks. This work establishes a molecular&#8208;level design paradigm for sulfur hosts, integrating structural precision with electrochemical functionality to advance the practical realization of high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Catalysts for Electrochemical Oxidation of Ammonia: A Comprehensive Review of Fundamentals and Optimization Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing robust catalysts for ammonia electrochemical oxidation (AOR) is essential for advancing NH3 utilization technologies. This review summarizes recent progress in catalyst design and mechanistic understanding of AOR. In addition, it systematically investigates strategies to improve AOR performance for various types of catalysts. Finally, an outlook in multiple disciplines related to the future directions is presented.








Abstract
The realization of a hydrogen (H2) economy confronts formidable challenges in storage, transportation, and logistics. To address these challenges, H2 carriers have been proposed as alternative solutions. Ammonia (NH3), as one of the most promising H2 carriers, becomes a game&#8208;changer, offering higher volumetric H2 density than compressed H2, simplified logistics, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, which thereby reduces costs and supply chain complexities. However, fully realizing NH3&#8217;s potential requires overcoming downstream inefficiencies associated with its conversion either back into H2 or into energy. Downstream processes primarily include thermal cracking, NH3 electrolysis, and direct NH3 fuel cells, two of which are electrochemical systems leveraging the NH3 oxidation reaction (AOR). The efficiency of these electrochemical systems is significantly limited by severe surface poisoning and poor AOR catalytic activity, underscoring the urgent need for advanced catalyst design. Here, a comprehensive review of AOR electrocatalysis is provided, with a focus on mechanistic insights into activity&#8208;governing steps and surface poisoning pathways. Recent advances in catalyst design are summarized, and overlooked factors are highlighted for performance enhancement. Finally, perspectives on future research directions are presented for AOR catalyst development to accelerate the integration of NH3&#8208;based technologies into the hydrogen economy.

Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), as one of the most promising H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carriers, becomes a game-changer, offering higher volumetric H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; density than compressed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, simplified logistics, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, which thereby reduces costs and supply chain complexities. However, fully realizing NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8217;s potential requires overcoming downstream inefficiencies associated with its conversion either back into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or into energy. Downstream processes primarily include thermal cracking, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis, and direct NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; fuel cells, two of which are electrochemical systems leveraging the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation reaction (AOR). The efficiency of these electrochemical systems is significantly limited by severe surface poisoning and poor AOR catalytic activity, underscoring the urgent need for advanced catalyst design. Here, a comprehensive review of AOR electrocatalysis is provided, with a focus on mechanistic insights into activity-governing steps and surface poisoning pathways. Recent advances in catalyst design are summarized, and overlooked factors are highlighted for performance enhancement. Finally, perspectives on future research directions are presented for AOR catalyst development to accelerate the integration of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based technologies into the hydrogen economy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Polymer Demixing Dynamics to Construct a Low&#8208;Tortuosity Host for Stable High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tortuosity&#8208;controlled hosts, fabricated via regulated polymer demixing, create vertically aligned, low&#8208;tortuosity (LT) frameworks with lithiophilicity gradients. The LT host enhances Li&#8208;ion transport kinetics, promotes homogeneous bottom&#8211;up Li deposition. When paired with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes, a double&#8208;stacked pouch&#8208;type full cell achieves high energy density (398.1&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, 1516.8&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1), retains 94.2% capacity after 80 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes, despite their exceptional theoretical capacity (3860&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), suffer from severe dendrite growth, electrolyte decomposition, and structural instability caused by uneven Li&#8208;ion flux and significant volume fluctuations. Here, a one&#8208;step, scalable fabrication of 3D hosts that synergistically couple tortuosity modulation with a spatially graded lithiophilicity via precise control of demixing kinetics in a nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation process is reported. Low&#8208;tortuosity (LT) hosts integrate vertically aligned channels for fast ion transport with a silver&#8208;gradient interface that directs bottom&#8211;up Li deposition, enabling concurrent suppression of dendrites and accommodation of plating&#8208;induced volume expansion (4.4% swelling). Finite element simulations confirm the cooperative role of structural alignment in mitigating ion depletion and of chemical gradients in guiding uniform deposition, jointly ensuring stable Li cycling. The LT host sustains &gt;5500&#160;h at 1C in symmetric cells and delivers superior durability in full cells with limited&#8208;Li anodes (4&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) paired with LiFePO4 and high&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes. Double&#8208;stacked pouch cells (N/P&#160;=&#160;0.8, E/C&#160;=&#160;2.5&#160;g&#160;Ah&#8722;1) achieve 398.1&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 1516.8&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1, retaining 94.2% capacity after 80 cycles. This structural&#8211;chemical integration strategy offers a practical, scalable route toward next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.

         <title>Tailoring Topological Network of Conductive Hydrogel for Electrochemically Mediated Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a regional assembly crosslinking (RAC) hydrogel fabricated via electric&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced phase separation. The process generates a unique polypyrrole:polystyrene sulfonate junction matrix that inherently translates topological randomness into unpredictable, unclonable electrochemical responses. RAC hydrogels demonstrate electrochemical encryption that shows exceptional resistance to machine learning attacks, establishing a novel paradigm for secure hydrogel&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
The sustainable development of an informatized and intelligent society relies on information security. Physical unclonable cryptographic primitives effectively secure information through random physical structures. However, the limited size of challenge&#8211;response pairs renders them vulnerable to machine learning attacks. This study proposes a regional assembly crosslinking (RAC) strategy to impart hydrogels with macroscopic, unclonable electrochemical behaviors derived from topological polymeric networks. An electric&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced phase separation approach is employed to create ion&#8211;electron transduction junctions based on polypyrrole:polystyrene sulfonate (PPy:PSS), forming a transduction junction matrix within the RAC hydrogel. The distinct transduction times of individual junctions enable pulsed electrical signals to convert the unique polymeric network topology into unpredictable and unclonable electrochemical responses. The RAC hydrogel&#8208;based encryption device generates over 1019 challenge&#8211;response pairs, significantly surpassing the standard requirement of 1010 for a strong physical unclonable cryptographic primitive. Additionally, the inherent nonlinear electrochemical characteristics of the ion&#8211;electron junction matrix significantly enhance the resistance of RAC hydrogels against machine learning attacks, including linear regression, multi&#8208;layer perceptrons, and Transformers. This study demonstrates that the electrochemical behavior of polymer networks in conductive hydrogels can emulate 3D electronic component matrices, establishing a novel paradigm for hydrogel phase engineering in information technology applications.

         <title>Ladder&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Frameworks with Highly Delocalized &#960;&#8208;Electrons and Dense Redox&#8208;Active Sites toward Robust Aqueous Iron Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) ladder&#8208;type covalent organic framework (HAQ&#8208;COF), featuring extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and densely packed carbonyl/imine redox sites, is synthesized, which represents the first application of COFs as cathodes in aqueous iron&#8208;ion batteries (AIIBs). Notably, HAQ&#8208;COF cathodes demonstrate high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability, enriching the application of BBL&#8208;ladder&#8208;type COFs in AIIBs.








Abstract
Aqueous iron&#8208;ion batteries (AIIBs) have demonstrated fascinating advantages in large&#8208;scale energy storage, whereas the development of high&#8208;performance Fe2+ hosting cathode materials is still at its infancy. Herein, two hexaazatrinaphthyalene (HATN)&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (namely HAQ&#8208;COF and HAB&#8208;COF) are synthesized and for the first time served them as cathodes for AIIBs. The rigid backbones and delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron networks endow them with stable structure and fast charge transport, while the dense arrangement of redox&#8208;active groups in HAQ&#8208;COF generates more chelating sites, which can facilitate the storage of multivalent metal ions. As a result, HAQ&#8208;COF cathodes for AIIBs delivers a high specific capacity of 226 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A&#160;g&#8722;1, excellent rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability with 87% capacity retention over 26&#160;000 cycles at 2 A&#160;g&#8722;1. Combined experimental (in situ/ex situ spectroscopy) analyses and DFT calculations uncover a dual&#8208;site 24&#8208;electron redox mechanism with Fe2+ sequentially coordination by carbonyl and imine moieties. This work not only establishes BBL&#8208;type COFs as high&#8208;performance cathodes for AIIBs but also provides mechanistic insight into Fe2+ storage, thereby informing rational design of sustainable and high&#8208;performance cathode materials for multivalent&#8208;ion energy storage systems.

         <title>Targeted Lipid Transfer Nanoshuttle via Lipid&#8208;Specific Transcytosis Induces Atherosclerotic Plaque Regression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) naturally facilitate lipid transport between membranes. The lipid&#8208;capturing shuttle (LipShuttle)&#160;mimics this activity by targeted lipid extraction and transcytosis&#8208;mediated lipid export, resulting in reversing lipid overload and reprogramming lipid catabolism of foam cells. Consequently, LipShuttle&#8208;based lipid transfer therapy promotes atherosclerosis regression by reducing lipid accumulation, exerting anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, and inducing a pro&#8208;efferocytic phenotype.








Abstract
Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) orchestrate inter&#8208;membrane lipid transport through hydrophobic cavities, but their therapeutic application is limited by the requirement to simultaneously maintain dual&#8208;membrane targeting and lipid&#8208;carrying structures. Inspired by LTPs, a therapeutic platform coupling &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) with gold nanoparticles as a lipid&#8208;capturing shuttle (LipShuttle) is proposed. The &#946;&#8208;CD specifically targets lipid droplets to sequester stored lipids, while the gold nanoparticles drive transcytotic lipid efflux. This dual mechanism enhances lipid removal, boosts neutral lipid catabolism, and reverses lipid overload in foam cells. Then LipShuttle's therapeutic efficacy is validated in high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;fed ApoE&#8722;/&#8722; mice with established atherosclerotic plaques. By combining ultrasound&#8208;enhanced lipid efflux with cell targeting, LipShuttle promotes plaque regression and reduces vulnerability. Mechanistically, LipShuttle&#8208;mediated lipid depletion suppresses arachidonic acid metabolism, attenuating inflammation, and reprograms plaque macrophages toward a pro&#8208;efferocytic phenotype. This dual action promotes plaque regression, demonstrating a promising lipid transfer&#8208;based therapeutic strategy for diseases driven by dysregulated lipid accumulation.

&lt;p&gt;Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) naturally facilitate lipid transport between membranes. The lipid-capturing shuttle (LipShuttle)&#160;mimics this activity by targeted lipid extraction and transcytosis-mediated lipid export, resulting in reversing lipid overload and reprogramming lipid catabolism of foam cells. Consequently, LipShuttle-based lipid transfer therapy promotes atherosclerosis regression by reducing lipid accumulation, exerting anti-inflammatory effects, and inducing a pro-efferocytic phenotype.

         <title>Vitrimer Nanocomposites from Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a materials design strategy that embeds spherical nanoparticles derived from polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) into recyclable networks to significantly reduce long&#8208;term deformation. By tuning nanostructures, the material gains enhanced durability without sacrificing reprocessability. This approach highlights how self&#8208;assembly can be harnessed to engineer robust, sustainable polymer networks through nanoscale control of structure and performance.








Abstract
Vitrimers, a class of covalent adaptable networks (CANs), promise sustainability through recyclability and reprocessability, yet suffer from creep under prolonged stress due to dynamic bond exchange. Here, a materials design strategy is reported that integrates polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) to embed core&#8208;crosslinked nanoparticles within vitrimer networks, yielding hierarchical dual&#8208;crosslinked systems with a reduction of creep susceptibility by up to 90% at 150 &#176;C yet good reprocessability at elevated temperatures (Ea = 246 kJ mol&#8722;1). These spherical nanostructures restrict chain mobility and act as rheological modifiers that can be synthetically tuned through core block length. This approach offers precise architectural control, leveraging nanoparticle phase morphology to direct bulk vitrimer properties. This study establishes a new paradigm for creep&#8208;resistant CANs and showcases how PISA can advance vitrimer performance by structurally encoding mechanical robustness and reprocessability.

         <title>Liberating Ca2+ Storage from Lattices: Amorphous FePOx Unveiling an Inside&#8208;Out Adaptive Cathode Paradigm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous FePOx enables superior Ca2+ storage through an internal&#8208;to&#8208;surface adaptive mechanism. Liberated from crystalline constraints, its flexible framework &#8220;volume breathing&#8221; effectively accommodating volume changes during Ca2+ cycling. During Ca2+ extraction, vacancies condense into nanopores that migrate to the surface, driven by thermodynamic imperatives to minimize energy. This self&#8208;optimization creates a textured, curvature&#8208;rich interface with continuously evolving ion pathways.








Abstract
Calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) offer a promising candidate within multivalent&#8208;ion batteries (MVIBs), but their advancement is impeded by the lack of cathode materials capable of efficiently accommodating large Ca2+ with rapid kinetics. Here, this study demonstrates how amorphous FePOx effectively liberates Ca2+ storage from such lattice restrictions by virtue of its inherently disordered and flexible framework, unveiling an adaptive storage mechanism in two distinct yet correlated aspects. First, its amorphous network not only revives electrochemical activity but also provides more open and isotropic ion transport pathways compared to rigid crystalline structures, enabling superior internal Ca2+ accommodation and yielding the optimal Ca2+ diffusion coefficient (3.24 &#215; 10&#8722;9 cm2 s&#8722;1) among the current CIBs inorganic cathode materials. Then, this inherent structural flexibility within the amorphous network further enables dynamic surface self&#8208;optimization process of amorphous FePOx via void migration from Ca2+ extraction. The evolving surface morphology provides more Ca2+ adsorption sites, enhancing decalciation/calciation kinetics. This synergistic adaptation yields a high capacity (124.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1), exceptional cyclability (92.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles), and high rate (&#8776;76% retention rate when increasing from 20 to 300&#160;mA g&#8722;1), demonstrating the broad advantages of amorphous architectures for advanced MVIBs.

         <title>Thermal Expansion Matching as a Key Criterion for Developing High&#8208;Performance Mn&#8208;based Mullite Cathodes in SOFCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to conventional perovskite cathodes, the mullite&#8208;type material has a closely matched thermal expansion coefficient with yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia (a deviation of 2.36% for SmMn2O5&#8208;Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 composite cathode), which enhances the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface bonding, prevents interfacial mismatch at high temperatures, and thereby contributes to the long&#8208;term stable operation of the solid oxide fuel cells.








Abstract
Thermal expansion matching is crucial for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) cathode design to prevent interfacial delamination or cracking. This work adopts thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) matching as the primary design principle to enable both structural stability and high catalytic activity. A Mn&#8208;based mullite&#8208;type cathode, SmMn2O5 (SMO), is developed, and composite electrodes with Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) are fabricated. To reveal the structure&#8211;property relationships, TEC and electrochemical performance measurements are combined with in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) analysis. SMO exhibited a low TEC (8.12 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) due to anisotropic lattice expansion and phonon scattering confirmed by XRD and Raman. The SMO&#8211;GDC composite displayed extremely well&#8208;matched TECs with yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia, with only 2.36% deviation across the operating range. Electrochemically, the composite cathode achieved 580.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 with polarization resistance of 0.193 &#937; cm2 and maintained stable operation for 300 h. DFT further revealed that GDC addition facilitated interfacial charge transfer and shortened Mn&#8211;Mn dimers, explaining the enhanced catalytic activity. This cathode material selection strategy, prioritizing TEC matching as the primary principle, provides a new insight into SOFC cathode development.

A dual&#8208;phase organic synaptic sensor detects human respiration and ambient UV light, enabling a wearable neuromorphic system for real&#8208;time exercise monitoring.








Abstract
With the advancement of wearable and mobile devices, demand for the real&#8208;time, low&#8208;power processing of physiological and environmental signals is growing rapidly. To achieve this, neuromorphic systems that employ artificial synapses for analog signal processing and parallel computing represent a promising strategy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advancement of wearable and mobile devices, demand for the real-time, low-power processing of physiological and environmental signals is growing rapidly. To achieve this, neuromorphic systems that employ artificial synapses for analog signal processing and parallel computing represent a promising strategy. In this study, a synaptic sensor is developed that simultaneously responds to human respiration and ambient ultraviolet (UV) light, enabling multimodal analog data processing. The proposed device is fabricated using the organic semiconductor 5,5&#8242;-Di(4-biphenylyl)-2,2&#8242;-bithiophene, which has distinct bulk and channel phases. Human respiration-induced airflow is converted into a synaptic current via charge trapping triggered by the interaction between molecules of water and the bulk phase, leading to real-time detection of the respiratory rate. The inherent photosensitivity of the device also allows for simultaneous UV detection, thus capturing the environmental exposure conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Green Hydrogen Production via Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC graphic highlights the newly fabricated PAA37 membrane, which exhibits exceptional ion selectivity. This membrane enables, for the first time, the practical application of using osmotic energy to directly power water electrolysis for hydrogen production. Furthermore, the PAA37 membrane can be mass&#8208;produced via a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process, demonstrating its significant potential for large&#8208;scale applications in osmotic power generation and hydrogen production.








Abstract
Harnessing renewable energy for green hydrogen production is critical for decarbonization. An ideal, sustainable route involves self&#8208;powered hydrogen production without additional energy input. Here, the osmotic energy between seawater and river water is used to continuously generate electricity to directly produce hydrogen. Efficient hydrogen production is successfully achieved by connecting the osmotic energy device composed of the polyamide acid PAA37 ion selective membrane and the water electrolysis device in series. The PAA37 membrane, featuring engineered sub&#8208;nanometer channels, exhibits an ultra&#8208;high cation transference number (t+ = 0.96). Targeting the critical challenge of scaling up osmotic power generation, the HLZ equation is introduced. It theoretically establishes that the decline in power density under large&#8208;area conditions is primarily attributed to the electrode impedance within the low&#8208;concentration zone. This finding offers a theoretical foundation for guiding the optimization of large&#8208;scale device designs. Consequently, the PAA37 membrane achieves a power density of 6.0 W m&#8722;2 over a macroscopic area of 3.14 mm2 under a 50&#8208;fold KCl. Furthermore, by stacking 110 RED units in series, a remarkable output voltage of 24.3 V is generated. By arranging this stack in series and parallel, the system successfully powers an electrolyzer for direct hydrogen production.

         <title>Janus Graphene Oxide Nanoplatform with Oppositely Functionalized Adhesion and Lubrication Enables Local Sustained Fenofibrate Release to Synergistically Halt Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a Janus graphene oxide&#8208;based nanoplatform to combat osteoarthritis. The system's efficacy is based on four synergistic functions: adhering stably to the cartilage surface, filling micro&#8208;damage to restore integrity, providing consistent lubrication to reduce friction, and delivering an anti&#8208;aging medication locally to cells. This integrated multifunctional approach represents a powerful and promising new strategy for osteoarthritis treatment.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) progresses via a destructive cycle involving cartilage damage, friction, lubrication loss, and chondrocyte senescence. Current therapies, limited to temporary lubrication or pain relief, fail to halt OA due to their inability to repair cartilage or restore innate lubrication. To address this challenge, an asymmetric Janus graphene oxide (MGO) nanoplatform is engineered and functionalized with the anti&#8208;senescence agent Fenofibrate (FN), creating the MGO&#8208;FN system. This integrated design features one side providing robust cartilage adhesion and the opposing side offering superior lubrication, while simultaneously delivering the therapeutic FN. Critically, the nanoscale MGO&#8208;FN effectively infiltrates and fills micro&#8208;damage on the cartilage surface, enabling localized and sustained FN release. This maximizes drug bioavailability at the target site by minimizing diffusion distances. In vitro, MGO&#8208;FN demonstrated potent synergistic effects, significantly enhancing chondrocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis, reducing senescence, and upregulating the lubrication marker PRG4 more effectively than either component alone. In vivo OA rat studies, supported by transcriptomics analysis, validated MGO&#8208;FN's potent therapeutic effects, including reduced cartilage degradation, mitigated inflammation, promoted matrix regeneration, and restored innate lubrication. These findings underscore MGO&#8208;FN as a promising multifaceted therapeutic strategy to halt OA progression by concurrently restoring cartilage integrity and lubricating function.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Negative Photoconductivity Transistors via Long&#8208;Afterglow Doping for All&#8208;Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance negative photoconductivity transistor is developed with the innovation of bulk doping of D/A long&#8208;afterglow materials into polymer semiconductors. The generation of long&#8208;lived charge separation states improves the device responsiveness, thus achieving organic optoelectronic synapse simulation and high&#8208;accuracy information encryption/decryption systems.








Abstract
Negative photoconductivity (NPC)&#8208;based devices, characterised by the light&#8208;induced suppression of electrical conduction, have garnered significant interest for their multifunctional optoelectronic applications, fast light response and broadband spectral adaptability. However, conventional planar heterostructured NPC&#8208;based devices exhibit poor device performance owing to interfacial defects that disrupt carrier transport and recombination dynamics. In this study, an innovative bulk doping strategy is presented that incorporates organic long&#8208;afterglow materials into polymer semiconductors to achieve high&#8208;performance negative photoconductivity transistors (NPTs). The long&#8208;afterglow dopants generate long&#8208;lived charge separation states that effectively trap gate&#8208;modulated majority carriers of polymer semiconductors, enabling persistent NPC with photosensitivity (5.29 &#215; 10&#8310;) and detectivity (3.40 &#215; 1013 Jones). In addition, this bulk doping strategy creates abundant trapping sites, which enable intralayer carrier recombination within the doped semiconductor film while maintaining an ultrahigh photosensitivity. Notably, this strategy can be generalised across diverse dopant&#8208;semiconductor systems. Furthermore, leveraging these exceptional NPTs, the negative synaptic functionalities are successfully emulated. To highlight its practical potential, system&#8208;level applicability is demonstrated by integrating NPTs into a recurrent neural network (RNN) for all&#8208;optical encryption/decryption, achieving up to 91% accuracy. This study establishes a general paradigm for high&#8208;performance NPC&#8208;based devices, unlocking their potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics and secure neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Oscillatory and Collective Dynamics of Gold&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Laden Droplets Driven by Photothermal&#8208;Induced Thermocapillarity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;driven photothermal heating of gold nanoparticles generates thermocapillary flows that induce droplet bouncing, clustering, and directional transport. The asymmetric ascent&#8211;descent dynamics guide neighboring droplets toward the illuminated droplet, leading to cooperative motion. This light&#8208;controlled strategy provides a robust and efficient approach for dynamic droplet manipulation, highlighting new opportunities in optofluidics and active matter research.








Abstract
Droplets have long intrigued researchers due to their ability to exhibit complex and fascinating behavior when subjected to external stimuli. Here, a coupled oscillatory behavior of gold&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;surfactant&#8208;laden aqueous droplets is investigated at an oil&#8211;oil interface stimulated by light. This study shows that the interaction between light and the droplets gives rise to a range of oscillatory modes, including bouncing and clustering, where droplets exhibit collective movement. From experiment and numerical simulations, this study elucidates the underlying mechanism: upon laser irradiation, gold nanoparticles convert light into heat, generating asymmetric thermal gradients that drive upward thermocapillary flows and a hydrodynamic force from photothermal convection. These forces compete with gravity and buoyancy to induce droplet bouncing, while the resulting asymmetric flow fields bias neighboring droplets toward the illuminated droplet, leading to clustering. These findings not only expand the library of dynamic droplet behavior but also offer insights into the potential applications of light&#8208;driven systems in materials science, soft robotics, and microfluidics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Elevated 3D Helical Oscillator with Addressable Eigenfrequency for Wearable Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on frequency division multiplexing and electromagnetic induction, a 3D self&#8208;elevated helical oscillating unit (SEHOU) for wearable high&#8208;capacity human&#8208;machine interactions is developed. Eigenfrequencies of multiple SEHOUs can be collected by one flexible coil upon triggering of oscillations. Crosstalk&#8208;free communications are achieved on a single piece of SEHOU&#8208;based interface without compromising the overall wearability.








Abstract
Equipped with 3D architecture, flexible electronic devices enable intuitive tactile sensing with enhanced spatial efficiency and skin conformity. However, realizing 3D metasurfaces on a flexible substrate remains laborious. Furthermore, conventional methodology often requires complex electrical connections and communication channels to realize tactile addressing. Leveraging magnetic repulsion among ferromagnetic microstructures, here, the spontaneous formation of a 3D self&#8208;elevated helical oscillating unit (SEHOU) on flexible films is presented. Through specific pattern design, the 3D morphology can be precisely tuned upon built&#8208;in magnetic moments that balance with the inherent elastic strength. Based on electromagnetic induction, axial vibrations of SEHOU generate sinusoidal electric signals with an intrinsic oscillating frequency. Along with the theoretical model, non&#8208;overlapping eigenfrequencies are customized, allowing convenient mapping of mechanical inputs from the received electrical signals. It is shown that crosstalk&#8208;free interactions can be achieved on a single piece of SEHOU&#8208;based interface, e.g., multi&#8208;touch recognition, without compromising the overall wearability. Further, the developed fabric coils and signal analysis modules showcase the potential for wireless Internet of Things. This methodology provides a valuable reference to establish reliable, scalable, and distributed tactile addressing for high&#8208;capacity human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>An Ionomer&#8208;Free Gapless Catalyst&#8208;Bridging Membrane Electrode Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Pure Water&#8208;Fed Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The GCB&#8208;AEMWE exhibits lower contact resistance, faster mass transfer kinetics, and stronger interfacial binding, thereby shows a high energy conversion efficiency of 85.7% at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and a voltage degradation rate of 65 &#181;V h&#8722;1 at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 after 1&#8201;000 h, being the lowest reported to date for pure water&#8208;fed AEMWEs.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are promising for hydrogen production due to low cost and high product purity. However, the performance of AEMWEs fed by pure water is unsatisfactory because of high ohmic resistance and sluggish reaction kinetics in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Here, an efficient ionomer&#8208;free gapless catalyst&#8208;bridging MEA (GCB&#8208;MEA) is developed for high&#8208;performance AEMWEs by confined directional deposition of the catalyst layer. The ionomer&#8208;free catalyst layer bridges the anion exchange membrane and the gas diffusion layer, creating robust interfaces at its both sides. Compared to conventional MEAs, the GCB&#8208;MEA exhibits more active sites, lower contact resistance, faster mass transfer kinetics, and stronger interfacial binding. The GCB&#8208;MEA&#8208;based AEMWE shows an energy conversion efficiency of 85.7% at 1 A cm&#8722;2 and a voltage degradation rate of 65 &#181;V h&#8722;1 at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 after 1&#8201;000 h, being the lowest reported to date for pure water&#8208;fed AEMWEs. Moreover, the electrolyzer exhibits stable responses under the fluctuating solar energy supply conditions. This work provides an efficient strategy to prepare MEAs for high&#8208;performance hydrogen production, especially under pure water condition.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Mediated Low&#8208;Frequency Phonon Suppression in Lead&#8208;free Manganese Halides for High&#8208;efficiency Green Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the transient photophysical mechanisms in manganese&#8208;based metal halides and designs A&#8208;site cations PPh4NBr and PPh4N2Br. The dimethylamino group suppresses low&#8208;frequency phonons, thereby minimizing non&#8208;radiative decay. The (PPh4N)2MnBr4 device achieves a 12.0% EQE, the highest reported among solution&#8208;processed, lead&#8208;free green&#8208;light devices, and enables the preparation of large&#8208;area electroluminescent devices (4 &#215; 4 cm2) in ambient conditions.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have emerged as promising materials in optoelectronics, yet concerns over lead toxicity drive the search for lead&#8208;free alternatives with efficient electroluminescence, especially in green&#8208;emitting applications. Here, the photophysical functions of A&#8208;site cations in manganese bromides are revealed, and design dimethylamino&#8208;functionalized A&#8208;site cations to modulate both phonon dynamics, film morphology, and energy level alignment, enabling unprecedented efficiency in solution&#8208;processed green&#8208;emitting lead&#8208;free metal halide devices. Appropriately attaching of dimethylamino groups to benzene rings not only builds p&#8211;&#960; conjugation that increases the rigidity of PPh4+ A&#8208;site cations, but also weakens hazardous van der Waals interaction, which suppresses A&#8208;site related nonradiative recombination. Importantly, methyl groups in dimethylamino groups enhance the flexibility of the A&#8208;site cation, which suppresses the formation of grain boundaries. Moreover, dimethylamino groups regulate the energy levels of PPh4+, reducing charge injection barriers. Notably, electroluminescent devices are achieved with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 12.0% and large&#8208;area emission of 4 &#215; 4 cm2, underscoring their potential for next&#8208;generation display technologies.

         <title>Harnessing Self&#8208;Sensitized Scintillation by Supramolecular Engineering of CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals in Dense Mesoporous Template Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystals exhibit bright emission, fast response, and solution processability, but their nanoscale size limits efficient radiation detection. Organizing them into porous SiO2 mesospheres enhances radioluminescence up to 40 times, achieving an optimal combination of light yield, fast scintillation, and processability, providing a pathway to high&#8208;performance, versatile nanoscintillators for imaging, space, and high&#8208;energy physics.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based nanoscintillators, such as CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs), are emerging as promising candidates for ionizing radiation detection, thanks to their high emission efficiency, rapid response, and facile synthesis. However, their nanoscale dimensions &#8212; smaller than the mean free path of secondary carriers &#8212; and relatively low emitter density per unit volume, limited by their high molecular weight and reabsorption losses, restrict efficient secondary carrier conversion and hamper their practical deployment. In this work, a strategy is introduced to enhance scintillation performance by organizing NCs into densely packed domains within porous SiO2 mesospheres (MSNs). This engineered architecture achieves up to a 40&#8208;fold increase in radioluminescence intensity compared to colloidal NCs, driven by improved retention and conversion of secondary charges, as corroborated by electron release measurements. This approach offers a promising pathway toward developing next&#8208;generation nanoscintillators with enhanced performance, with potential applications in high&#8208;energy physics, medical imaging, and space technologies.

         <title>Interfacial Synergistic Hydrogen Spillover and Electron Transfer for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR)&#160;can use renewable energy to produce green ammonia, while solving the problem of wastewater treatment. However, the simultaneous optimization of proton and electron transfer on copper&#8208;based catalysts is still challenging, leading to poor selectivity. In this work, interfacial synergism of hydrogen spillover and electron transfer of CoNi&#8211;LDH@Cu2O is adopted to for boosting NO3&#8722;RR, achieving remarkable performance.








Abstract
Nitrate overabundance in wastewater brings environmental pollution and health risks, while the traditional Haber&#8722;Bosch process for ammonia production is accompanied by huge energy consumption and carbon emissions. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) can use renewable energy to produce green ammonia and provide a sustainable route for wastewater treatment. Electrochemical NO3&#8722;RR process involves multiple proton&#8208;coupled&#8208;electron steps; however, simultaneous optimization of proton and electron transfer is still challenging, leading to poor selectivity for ammonia production. Here, the interfacial synergism of hydrogen spillover and electron transfer is demonstrated to boost electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia. Experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the interface hydrogen spillover of CoNi&#8211;layered double hydroxide (LDH) accelerates the hydrogenation step of NO3&#8722;RR, while the electron transfer to Cu2O promotes the reduction of adsorbed NO3&#8722;. Benefitting from the interfacial synergistic hydrogen spillover and electron transfer, the CoNi&#8211;LDH@Cu2O catalyst achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 97.8% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE, and a high NH3 yield rate of 75.2&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial&#8208;relevant current density &#8776;1 A cm&#8722;2. This work provides insights into the interface design strategy to enhance NO3&#8722;RR performance for waste nitrate treatment and green ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Polymerized Melamine Catalyzes Direct I&#8722;/I2 Conversion via &#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472; Motif for HighCapacity Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a catalytic cathode of in situ electropolymerized melamine (MA) deposited onto activated carbon (AC), denoted as pMA@AC, for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;I2 batteries is developed. Specifically, pMA tightly binds iodine species via &#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472; sites to significantly improve iodine storage ability and conversion efficiency. Moreover, extensive delocalized &#960; electron cloud within flexible PMA chains effectively accelerates charge transfer to catalyze direct I&#8722;/I2 conversion without polyiodide formation. Therefore, catalytic pMA@AC endows electrolytic Zn&#8208;I2 battery with a high capacity of 1.55 mAh cm&#8722;2 and ultra&#8208;long lifespan over 20&#160;000 cycles, achieving a 440&#160;mAh pouch cell with 183 Wh kg&#8722;1. Contributing to the pMA&#8208;iodine synergistic effect, a highly efficient I&#8722;/I2/I+ reaction is further investigated to construct a four&#8208;electron Zn&#8208;I2 battery with high capacity (410 mAh g&#8722;1) and durability over 10&#160;000 cycles, highlighting the potential of azo compounds in advanced Zn&#8208;halogen batteries.








Abstract
To fundamentally solve low iodine conversion efficiency and severe polyiodide shuttling, a high&#8208;performance catalytic organic cathode is developed by in situ polymerizing melamine (MA) on activated carbon (denoted as pMA@AC) for high&#8208;capacity Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. The pMA@AC cathode exhibits a high capacity of 1.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan over 20&#160;000 cycles, benefiting the stable pouch cell with 440 mAh and 183 Wh kg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. In/ex situ characterizations coupled with theoretical calculations demonstrate that polymelamine (pMA) catalyzed efficient I&#8722;/I2 conversion, suppressing polyiodide formation and avoiding consequent shuttling for high Coulombic efficiency and enhanced lifespan. The high catalytic activity of pMA is attributed to the delocalized &#960; electron cloud on &#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472; sites, which connect to electron&#8208;withdrawing triazine groups, with weaker physicochemical adsorption to I&#8722;/I2 than traditional carbon&#8208;based catalysts. It thus boosts the formation/desorption of resultant I2 molecules at higher potential for enhanced cycling stability. More importantly, pMA@AC exhibits robust catalytic ability for four&#8208;electron I&#8722;/I0/I+ chemistry with 405 mAh g&#8722;1 and 10&#160;000 cycles, further strengthening the potential application of such azo compounds for advanced Zn&#8208;halogen batteries.

         <title>Bridging Laboratory Catalysts with Industrial Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective critically examines the key challenges impeding the transition of laboratory&#8208;synthesized catalysts to industrial&#8208;scale PEMWE for sustainable hydrogen generation. A systematic roadmap is proposed to address the gap between electrocatalyst development and industrial implementation, emphasizing the design of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective, and stable catalysts tailored for practical industrial applications.








Abstract
The development of highly active catalysts has significantly advanced water electrolysis for green hydrogen production. However, translating these materials from laboratory&#8208;scale demonstrations to industrial proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) remains a major challenge. In this perspective, key gaps are identified between academic electrocatalyst research for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media and the stringent requirements of industrial PEMWEs. The scalability and industrial relevance of current catalyst synthesis and electrode fabrication techniques are critically analyzed, proposing scalable routes such as plasma&#8208;enhanced atomic layer deposition, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing, and electrodeposition. The discrepancies in testing protocols between three&#8208;electrode aqueous cells, membrane electrode assemblies and full electrolysis stacks are further discussed highlighting the challenges of making direct performance comparisons. To bridge this gap, relevant activity descriptors that connect catalyst properties with device&#8208;level performance under industrial conditions are introduced, and critically highlight the importance of conducting both operando characterization and techno&#8208;economic analysis. Finally, strategies to enhance both catalytic activity and durability, including electronic metal&#8208;support interactions, porosity engineering, and single&#8208;atom catalyst design, are highlighted. By integrating synthesis, testing, and mechanistic insights, this perspective offers a comprehensive roadmap to rationally design and implement next&#8208;generation catalysts tailored for scalable, durable, and efficient industrial green hydrogen production.

Tunable Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Devices
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202509228), Qi Lu, Bin Peng, Ming Liu, and co&#8208;authors present a large tunable and highly integrated spin&#8208;orbit torque device based on the standard silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology. The cover depicts the charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion process in the spin&#8208;orbitronic devices. The athletes in the cover represent elementary charges which are attempting to overcome the energy barrier and transform into the spin. The vaulting poles they grip symbolize the applied voltage across the ultrathin ferroelectric layer. Thanks to this voltage &#8220;vaulting pole&#8221;, this physical process becomes more easier and the charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced. The proposed integrated devices with hybrid architectures exhibit promising potential for low&#8208;power SOT&#8208;MRAM and other unconventional spin computing frameworks beyond Boolean logic.

Antifreeze Polypeptide
Freezing damage is a challenge in biomedicine and foods. Extremophiles like polar fish have evolved antifreeze proteins that prevent damage to their tissues. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202420504), Jessica R. Kramer and co&#8208;workers present ultra&#8208;economical protein mimetics that inhibit growth of large ice crystals and prevent freezing damage in sensitive enzymes, antibodies, and foods.

Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202511230), Hai Bi, Zhiheng Wang, and co&#8208;workers illustrate a chiral space conjugation (CSC) strategy, in which a [2.2]paracyclophane unit is integrated into a multi&#8208;resonance framework to construct C2&#8208;symmetric MR&#8208;TADF emitters. This design enables strong chiroptical responses, efficient through&#8208;space conjugation, and high&#8208;purity green circularly polarized electroluminescence in CP&#8208;OLEDs.

Magnetic Milli&#8208;Spinner
The magnetic milli&#8208;spinner is a fast&#8208;swimming, magnetically driven micro&#8208;robot designed to navigate tortuous blood vessels for minimally invasive endovascular surgery. It uniquely treats stroke by densifying the fibrin network, shrinking clots by up to 95%, and enables secure embolization of brain aneurysms through precise, magnetically controlled locomotion. More details can be found in the Research Article by Ruike Renee Zhao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508180).

Addressing the dual challenges of global water scarcity and carbon neutrality goals, this paper systematically reviews research progress on interfacial solar steam evaporation (ISSE) technology from the perspective of multi&#8208;scale energy transfer and mass transport. The content covers photothermal material selection, structural design, system integration, and multifunctional coupling strategies such as thermoelectric synergy, water&#8211;hydrogen co&#8208;production, and metal salt recovery. Ultimately, it proposes building an intelligent water circulation system integrating &#8220;water collection&#8208;purification&#8208;co&#8208;production&#8221; through AI&#8208;enabled and modular design.








Abstract
In response to the dual challenges posed by global water scarcity and carbon neutrality targets, conventional desalination technologies struggle to satisfy the requirements of high energy consumption and inherent limitations associated with centralized water supply systems. Within this context, interfacial solar steam evaporation (ISSE) technology has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources, owing to its advantages of highly efficient photothermal conversion, zero carbon emissions, and modular design. Although ISSE has been developed for tens of years, there are still many challenges to be faced, from fundamental research to practical applications. It is noticed that the energy conversion and mass transport are the core issues in multi&#8208;scale levels of ISSE, no matter of the material design or the system assembly, and the optimization of them is beneficial for the whole process of ISSE. Herein, the research progress is tried to understand and summarize from the material chosen, structural architecture, and system integration with the view of energy and mass transfer. Furthermore, the successful integration of thermoelectric conversion, simultaneous water&#8211;hydrogen cogeneration, and metal salt recovery has concurrently enhanced the efficiency of energy utilization. Furthermore, a collaborative operation framework integrating discrete water networks and ISSE technology has been predicted. Through AI empowerment and modularized design, it eventually forms a smart water cycle system with the trinity of &#8220;water collection&#8208;purification&#8208;cogeneration.&#8221; At the end of this review, the thoughts on the development of ISSE are also provided.

This review reports the research progress of zeolite&#8208;anchored SACs in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, and provides theoretical guidance for designing of zeolite&#8208;based catalysts at the atomic scale.








Abstract
Zeolite&#8208;anchored metal catalysts have shown promising applications in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. However, difficulties such as high synthesis costs, inherent diffusion limitations, and stability issues have limited their large&#8208;scale industrial application. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which provide the benefits of high atom utilization and excellent stability, have promising application prospects in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. This review systematically reports the research progress of zeolite&#8208;anchored SACs in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, summarizes the different synthesis methods, and proposes the regulation strategies to enhance the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, and provides theoretical guidance for designing of zeolite&#8208;based catalysts at the atomic scale. Finally, the potential opportunities and challenges of zeolite&#8208;anchored SACs in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions are prospected.

         <title>Reticular Frameworks for Advanced Polymer Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular frameworks (RFs) such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks offer versatile platforms for polymer materials innovation, enabling regulated polymerization, efficient macromolecular purification, and polymer functionalization. This review highlights recent achievements and prospects in creating advanced polymers using RFs, paving the way for next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
This review article aims to explore the innovative applications of reticular frameworks (RFs), particularly metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, for the development of advanced polymers. RFs, characterized by their crystalline porous structures and tunable properties, have significant advantages in polymer production and functionalization, improving their synthetic efficiency, structural regularity, stability, conductivity, mechanical properties, and overall performance through a combination of structural characteristics. Ordered nanopores in RFs act as structural scaffolds, guiding polymerization with spatial precision and enabling control over polymer structures and arrangement. RFs exhibit exceptional potential for macromolecular recognition and separation, affording scalable platforms for highly selective polymer processing and purification. Synergistic coupling of reticular chemistry with polymer engineering opens new avenues for the design of next&#8208;generation functional materials. Herein, recent developments in the synthesis of polymers in RFs, the separations and recognitions of polymers by RFs, and RF&#8211;polymer hybrids are evaluated, which further present a forward&#8208;looking perspective. The rapid progress in this field has led to breakthroughs in both fundamental science and materials applications, promoting future investigations to expand their potential in creating advanced polymer materials.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Urea Electrooxidation: From Mechanism to Catalysts and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), emphasizing molecular mechanisms, rational material design (doping, nanostructuring, defect and heterostructure engineering), and diverse engineering applications including urea sensors, hydrogen production, urea purification, and direct urea fuel cells (DUFCs) under various pH conditions.








Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) serves as a pivotal process for sustainable wastewater remediation and renewable energy conversion, yet its practical implementation faces pH&#8208;dependent challenges that demand systematic understanding. This review comprehensively examines UOR mechanisms across alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes, elucidating fundamental correlations between pH environments, catalytic activity, and reaction pathways. While alkaline media enhance kinetics via adsorbate evolution mechanisms, they often induce catalyst structural reconstruction that undermines stability; conversely, neutral and acidic media suffer from kinetic limitations due to inefficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. Based on these insights, this review outlines several key optimization strategies for catalyst development, tailored to each pH environment, and explores the potential for scaling up alkaline UOR for energy&#8208;related applications. Finally, several critical future research directions that provide a roadmap for overcoming existing limitations and advancing UOR toward practical applications are proposed, which can serve as a timely framework for future developments in pH&#8208;tailored UOR systems of both environmental and energy sectors.

         <title>Strategies for Lowering Hydrogen Permeation in Membranes for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers and Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the critical issue of hydrogen permeation in perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;based proton exchange membranes used in water electrolyzers and fuel cells. It explores hydrogen transport mechanisms, measurement techniques, and recent mitigation strategies, including advances in alternative hydrocarbon membranes. Remaining challenges and future directions are also discussed to guide safer and more efficient PEM design.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers and fuel cells are pivotal for renewable hydrogen technologies. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is a critical component in both technologies, with the PEM's core functionality&#8212;proton conduction coupled with gas impermeability&#8212;dictating overall cell performance and durability. One of the key challenges faced by the commercial perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;based PEMs is the high rate of hydrogen permeation, reducing efficiency and raising safety concerns due to hydrogen&#8211;oxygen mixing risks. Therefore, there is an urgent need to mitigate hydrogen crossover in PEMs to enhance operational efficiency and ensure cell safety, particularly for the high&#8208;pressure electrolyzers. This review commences by elucidating the hydrogen transport mechanisms in PFSA&#8208;based PEMs, along with the methodologies employed to measure hydrogen permeation. Subsequently, the recently developed strategies aimed at reducing hydrogen permeation in PEMs are summarized, with a primary focus on PFSA&#8208;based membranes, alongside considering advancements in alternative hydrocarbon polymer membranes. Finally, the challenges that remain are discussed, and potential solutions for addressing hydrogen permeation issues in PEM applications are proposed. This review seeks to provide valuable insights for both academic research and industrial applications, in the pursuit of low&#8208;hydrogen permeation PEMs specifically designed for water electrolysis and fuel cell technologies.

         <title>Non&#8208;Metallic Back Contacts for Indoor Perovskite Solar Cells: Material Criteria, Recent Progress, and Future Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;metallic back contacts, including carbon&#8208;based electrodes and transparent conductive electrodes are emerging as cost&#8208;effective and stable alternatives to noble metals in indoor perovskite solar cells. Their tunable conductivity, optical properties, and compatibility with scalable fabrication offer great promise for powering IoT sensors, wearables, and self&#8208;powered electronics under low&#8208;intensity indoor illumination.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a leading technology for indoor photovoltaics due to their high&#8208;power conversion efficiency, tunable bandgaps, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. While significant efforts are made in optimizing perovskite absorbers and charge extraction layers, the role of back contacts (BCs), particularly non&#8208;metallic alternatives, remains largely underexplored in indoor PSCs. BCs critically influence charge collection, device stability, and overall performance under low&#8208;intensity indoor illumination, yet most studies have historically prioritized metallic electrodes, overlooking cost&#8208;effective, stable, and flexible non&#8208;metallic options. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of BC materials in indoor PSCs, with a particular focus on non&#8208;metallic electrodes, including carbon&#8208;based electrodes and transparent conductive electrodes. It begins with an overview of indoor PSCs, covering indoor light sources, perovskite materials and bandgaps, and fundamental roles of BCs, followed by recent developments in non&#8208;metallic BCs. Key challenges related to performance and energy output density, processability and scalability, mechanical flexibility and durability, as well as different types of BC materials, are discussed along with promising strategies for interface engineering, low&#8208;temperature processing, and material innovation. By highlighting this critical research gap, the review offers actionable insights into advancing efficient, stable, and scalable indoor PSCs for self&#8208;powered electronics and IoT applications.

         <title>Metallene: &#197;ngstr&#246;m&#8208;Scale 2D Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin 2D metals exhibit unique structural, electronic, and physicochemical features distinct from conventional bulk or nanostructure counterparts. This review categorises their crystalline configurations, elaborates topotactic, top&#8208;down, and bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategies, and explores structure&#8208;property correlations through doping, heterostructures, and phase/strain engineering. These insights highlight emerging functionalities in catalysis, electronics, quantum transport, and biointerfaces enabled by &#229;ngstr&#246;m&#8208;scale design.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D metals, also termed metallenes, constitute a distinctive class of 2D materials in which metallic bonding is preserved at the &#229;ngstr&#246;m scale. Quantum confinement imparts ultrahigh carrier mobility, tunable plasmonic resonances, and exposed surfaces composed of low&#8208;coordination active sites. Although &#8220;2D metals&#8221; have historically encompassed various metallic nanostructures, recent breakthroughs have enabled the isolation of structurally well&#8208;defined metallenes with ambient stability and quantum&#8208;confined properties not observed in their bulk counterparts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of metallene research, focusing on their synthetic chemistry, low&#8208;dimensional metrics, and structure&#8208;function relationships. This unified framework provides cross&#8208;disciplinary insights for rational design in catalysis, plasmonics, electronics, and biomedical applications. Rigorous criteria are first established to distinguish true monolayer metals from quasi&#8208;2D nanosheets, emphasizing bonding anisotropy, lattice continuity, and spectroscopic fingerprints. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies are then benchmarked for scalability and technology readiness. Next, the engineering toolbox, including doping, hierarchical hetero&#8208;structuring, and defect/phase/strain modulation, is surveyed, which tailors these intrinsic traits and translates them into record performances across diverse applications. Finally, outstanding challenges, including thermodynamic metastability, limited synthetic precision, unclear dynamic structure&#8208;function relationships, and device integration, and delineate research directions aimed at accelerating the rational design and practical implementation of metallenes are outlined.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Driven Atomic Precision in Advanced Oxidation for Pollution Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines advances in metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;derived single&#8208;atom catalysts for advanced oxidation processes. It highlights atomic&#8208;level strategies&#8212;unsaturated metal centers, tailored organic linkers, and hierarchical confinement&#8212;along with synthesis methods such as heteroatom doping and atomization. Integrating density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and machine learning, it also considers sustainability through life cycle and techno&#8208;economic analyses. This framework guides the design of efficient, durable, and scalable catalysts for environmental applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks provide programmable platforms for designing heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision. By serving as precursors for single&#8208;atom catalysts, they enable maximized metal utilization and finely tuned coordination environments that are highly effective for advanced oxidation processes targeting aqueous organic pollutants. This review evaluates three central strategies that govern catalytic performance: engineering coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, tailoring organic linkers to stabilize reactive sites, and exploiting hierarchical pore confinement to regulate mass transfer. Emerging synthesis methods, including heteroatom doping and atomization, are assessed for their capacities to improve stability and pathway selectivity. From the comparative analysis of recent studies, several key findings emerge: atomic dispersion allows efficient regulation of radical and non&#8208;radical oxidation channels, electronic modulation strengthens interfacial charge transfer, and pore confinement enhances both pollutant accessibility and resistance to deactivation. Beyond material design, the integration of computational modeling, experimental validation, and sustainability assessments&#8212;such as life cycle and techno&#8208;economic analysis&#8212;provides a holistic framework for bridging fundamental mechanisms with engineering feasibility. The review concludes by outlining remaining challenges in redox stability, scalability, and environmental robustness, offering guidance for the development of efficient, durable, and sustainable catalysts for next&#8208;generation water treatment technologies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc (Zn)&#8208;based alloys have emerged as promising options for next&#8208;generation orthopedic implants, but their clinical acceptance faces significant challenges. This review critically evaluates the potential of Zn&#8208;based alloys for implant applications, examines current material modification strategies to improve their properties, assesses their clinical translation prospects, and outlines the key challenges that must be overcome to enable widespread therapeutic implementation.








Abstract
Orthopedic implants provide structural support, loading&#8208;bearing, or motion preservation to ensure surgical success. Zinc (Zn)&#8208;based alloys have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation orthopedic implants due to their suitable degradation rate, excellent mechanical properties, antibacterial activity, and complete degradability. However, the clinical application of Zn&#8208;based alloys is hindered by significant limitations, including mechanical instability, threshold&#8208;dependent bioactivity, an inadequate balance between antimicrobial and osteogenic effects, and variability in stress&#8208;induced degradation. This comprehensive review summarizes the feasibility of Zn&#8208;based alloys for orthopedic implants, focusing on the biocompatibility, biodegradation behavior, mechanical properties, and interactions with the resident cells. The engineering methods to modify properties of Zn&#8208;based materials are also discussed, and their translational applications are highlighted, while addressing the remaining challenges for future investigation. Collectively, advancing research in Zn&#8208;based alloys would pave the way for innovative orthopedic solutions that enhance patient outcomes.

         <title>Advances and Prospects in Multifunctional Composite Fibrous Materials Utilizing Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospinning transforms processability&#8208;limited porous organic polymers (POPs) into versatile fibrous architectures with enhanced mechanical robustness and tunable functionality. By integrating various classes of POPs with advanced electrospinning strategies, the resulting POP&#8208;incorporated fiber materials (POP&#8208;FMs) exhibit controllable nano&#8211;micro morphologies and hierarchical porosity, opening new avenues for catalysis, sensing, environmental remediation, and biomedical applications.








Abstract

Porous organic polymers (POPs) offer exceptional surface area, tunable pore sizes, and versatile chemical functionality, making them attractive for a range of advanced applications. However, their conventional powdered form limits processability, structural integration, and practical deployment. Integrating POPs into fibrous matrices through electrospinning, a scalable and versatile technique for producing nonwoven fibers, helps overcome these limitations and enables the creation of new material architecture. The resulting POP&#8208;incorporated fibrous materials (POP&#8208;FMs) combine the intrinsic advantages of POPs with enhanced mechanical integrity, tailored surface properties, and improved mass transport characteristics. These features expand the potential of POP&#8208;FMs in areas such as catalysis, environmental remediation, sensing, and biomedical fields. This review discusses recent progress in the design and synthesis of electrospinning&#8208;compatible POPs, strategies for fabricating POP&#8208;FM composites, and the structure&#8211;property relationships that govern their performance. Key challenges and future directions are also explored, underscoring the potential of POP&#8208;FMs as next&#8208;generation functional materials.

By integrating various classes of POPs with advanced electrospinning strategies, the resulting POP-incorporated fiber materials (POP-FMs) exhibit controllable nano&#8211;micro morphologies and hierarchical porosity, opening new avenues for catalysis, sensing, environmental remediation, and biomedical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Porous organic polymers (POPs) offer exceptional surface area, tunable pore sizes, and versatile chemical functionality, making them attractive for a range of advanced applications. However, their conventional powdered form limits processability, structural integration, and practical deployment. Integrating POPs into fibrous matrices through electrospinning, a scalable and versatile technique for producing nonwoven fibers, helps overcome these limitations and enables the creation of new material architecture. The resulting POP-incorporated fibrous materials (POP-FMs) combine the intrinsic advantages of POPs with enhanced mechanical integrity, tailored surface properties, and improved mass transport characteristics. These features expand the potential of POP-FMs in areas such as catalysis, environmental remediation, sensing, and biomedical fields. This review discusses recent progress in the design and synthesis of electrospinning-compatible POPs, strategies for fabricating POP-FM composites, and the structure&#8211;property relationships that govern their performance. Key challenges and future directions are also explored, underscoring the potential of POP-FMs as next-generation functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Widely Tunable Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Device through the Silicon Compatible CMOS Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable spin&#8208;orbit torque device compatible with CMOS platform is present with large tunability and low operating voltage through the ultrathin ferroelectric film. The proposed integrated devices with hybrid architectures exhibit promising potential for low&#8208;power SOT&#8208;MRAM and other unconventional spin computing frameworks beyond Boolean logic.








Abstract
Analogous to the manipulation of electrons in field&#8208;effect transistors, achieving the voltage&#8208;controlled spin&#8208;orbit torque and spin current will become indispensable to next&#8208;generation spintronic devices, enabling nonvolatile cache memory, spin logic, and other advanced functionalities. Recently, considerable progress has been realized in the electric field control of spin&#8208;orbit torques. Due to the limitations of integration and operating voltage, the practical use of voltage&#8208;controlled MRAM is still challenging. Here a tunable spin&#8208;orbit torque device fully integrated within CMOS technology is reported with large tunability and low operating voltage. The proposed integrated MRAM devices with hybrid architectures exhibit significant acceleration in write speed and lower current thresholds. This could potentially facilitate the commercial exploitation of tunable spin&#8208;orbitronic devices and is also promising for spin transistors and unconventional computing frameworks beyond Boolean logic.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Resolved Orbital Hall Effect in a Topological Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;space mapping of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transport is achieved using contact&#8208;free polarimetric terahertz spectroscopy. This principle is applied to the topological semimetal Td&#8208;WTe2, revealing the spatial separation of electrons into two distinct regions characterized by opposite out&#8208;of&#8208;plane OAM (&#177;Lz). This work provides a direct visualization of the orbital Hall effect, paving the way for future investigations of orbitronics.








Abstract
Orbital angular momentum (OAM), once considered a marginal property in solids, has recently gained importance in various physical phenomena. Although optical probes couple to OAM directly, comparable low&#8208;energy electrodynamic methods are still in the early stages of development. To exploit the potential of OAM for information science and technology, angular momentum&#8208;resolved transport methods must be established. Here, a principle is presented for an angular momentum&#8208;resolved method to observe orbital Hall effect (OHE) in real space. The orbital conduction in the topological semimetal Td&#8208;WTe2 is measured using contact&#8208;free polarimetric terahertz probe, showing that two distinct regions of &#177;Lz with a diffusion length of &#8776;130&#160;&#181;m due to the extremely low scattering rate of Weyl fermions form in real space. The observed orbital conduction can be explained by OHE, according to theoretical calculations. By altering the polarization and intensity of the terahertz electric field input, it is also demonstrated that this orbital conduction can be engineered. Using a spatiotemporal low&#8208;energy electrodynamic probe, the work reveals direct evidence of coherent OHE in an inversion&#8208;broken topological semimetal with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling&#8212;an experimentally elusive regime until now.

         <title>Magnetic Milli&#8208;Spinner for Robotic Endovascular Surgery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic milli&#8208;spinner, with its unique structural design, achieves rapid and stable navigation through complex vasculature at speeds up to 23 cm&#183;s&#8722;1. It further enables multifunctional treatment, including localized suction and shear for efficient clot removal, targeted drug delivery, and in situ embolization for aneurysm therapy, establishing it as a versatile platform for next&#8208;generation, untethered endovascular interventions.








Abstract
Navigating the complex and high&#8208;flow environment of human vasculature remains a major challenge for conventional endovascular tools and externally actuated tethered systems. While catheter&#8208;based approaches are the clinical standard, their limited steerability and force transmission hinder access to tortuous or distal vessels, especially in the brain. Untethered robotic systems have emerged as a promising alternative for enhanced flexibility and reachability. However, most designs struggle against the high, pulsatile blood flow in human arteries. Here, the study presents a magnetically actuated milli&#8208;spinner robot that overcomes existing limitations in navigating complex and high&#8208;flow vasculature. Capable of swimming at 23&#160;cm&#183;s&#8722;1 (73 body lengths per second), the milli&#8208;spinner enables rapid, stable navigation through complex vasculature. This performance is driven by its hollow cylindrical structure with integrated helical fins and slits, which together generate a spinning&#8208;induced flow field that enhances propulsion efficiency and allows the robot to maintain stability and control even in dynamic, pulsatile blood flow environments. In addition to its navigation capabilities, the milli&#8208;spinner enables multifunctional treatment, including localized suction and shear for efficient clot removal, targeted drug delivery, and in situ embolization for aneurysm treatment. These features establish the milli&#8208;spinner as a versatile and powerful platform for next&#8208;generation, untethered endovascular interventions.

         <title>Polyurethane Nonwovens Integrated with Nanocomposite as Twist&#8208;Assisted Healing Flexible Sensor for Ultrasensitive Room&#8208;Temperature NO2 Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a twist&#8208;assisted healing flexible NO2 sensor by integrating Au/Pd&amp;PEDOT@rGO on PU nonwoven. The sensor achieves ultra&#8208;sensitive detection, rapid response, and exceptional humidity resistance, as well as good mechanical robustness. Remarkably, fractured sensors restore functionality via twist&#8208;assisted healing. Integrated into wearable devices, it enables real&#8208;time gas monitoring in harsh conditions.








Abstract
A twist&#8208;assisted healing flexible sensor for ultrasensitive and selective detection of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at room temperature is developed by sequentially introducing the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) onto polyurethane (PU) nonwovens as the conducting medium, followed by decoration with the Au/Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and polythiophene (Au/Pd&amp;PEDOT) composites as the pivotal sensing layer. The optimized Au/Pd&amp;PEDOT@rGO@PU sensor exhibits outstanding performance across a wide NO2 concentration range (0.1&#8211;800&#160;ppm), demonstrating improved sensitivity (&#8776;27% to 1&#160;ppm), rapid response /recovery characteristics (7&#160;s/38&#160;s), ultralow detection limit (2&#160;ppb), and exceptional selectivity at 28&#160;&#176;C. Such superior NO2 sensing can be ascribed to the synergistic effect: the outer PEDOT coating exposes numerous sensing sites, the Au/Pd NPs exert excellent catalysis, and the rGO framework accelerates the charge transfer. More importantly, the sensor demonstrates remarkable mechanical properties, including good robustness, twist&#8208;assisted healing capability, and superior water resistance. Combining scalable fabrication, straightforward construction, and competitive detection metrics, this flexible sensor represents a promising platform for real NO2 monitoring applications.

         <title>Solvent Evaporation Induced Micelle Assembly for Continuous Mesoporous Amorphous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a facile and scalable micelle&#8208;assisted soft&#8208;templating strategy to fabricate continuous mesoporous amorphous MOF (aMOF) films via evaporation&#8208;induced deposition. By optimizing the co&#8208;solvent system, uniform low&#8208;roughness films are achieved. The approach is successfully applied to both spin&#8208;coating and spray&#8208;coating techniques, highlighting its versatility for producing high&#8208;quality aMOF films on diverse substrates.








Abstract
The thin films of nanoporous materials, including zeolites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and mesoporous materials, are promising for applications in electrodes, separations, catalysis, and sensing. While microporous materials offer high surface areas that expose numerous active sites, their limited diffusion pathways for reactants and products constrain performance. Hierarchically structured mesoporous&#8208;microporous materials offer an ideal solution by combining extensive surface areas with enhanced diffusion; however, the complexity of creating and integrating dual pore systems has hindered progress in this area, and reports on these materials remain scarce. Here, evaporation&#8208;induced methods (spin&#8208;coating and spray&#8208;coating) are introduced for the rapid synthesis of continuous mesoporous amorphous MOF thin films on solid substrates, achieved through the cooperative self&#8208;assembly of block copolymer micelles and MOF precursors (metal ions and organic linkers). The resulting mesoporous amorphous MOF films exhibit uniform pore distribution with low surface roughness. Furthermore, these films exhibit great potential for application on various substrates, benefiting from the versatility of this synthesis approach.

         <title>Magnetically Guided Flexible Bioelectronic Probe for Single&#8208;Cell Recordings in Multi&#8208;Scale Biosystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a flexible and magnetically actuated bioelectronic probe called Mag&#8208;N&#8208;Probe is developed for adaptive neural interfacing. It enables remote and real&#8208;time motion control across micrometer to centimeter scales. By integrating ferromagnetic nanoparticles into a soft mesh structure, the system allows precise single&#8208;cell targeting and multichannel recordings in complex in vitro environments with potential for in vivo applications.








Abstract
Bioelectronic systems enable label&#8208;free monitoring and modulation of cellular activity, providing essential tools for neuroscience and biomedical applications. Nevertheless, many current interfaces are structurally static and lack active positioning capabilities, limiting their adaptability in spatially complex environments. Here, Mag&#8208;N&#8208;Probe (Magnetically guided Neural&#8208;interfacing Probe), a flexible and magnetically actuated bioelectronic system is introduced that enables remote, real&#8208;time motion control with sub&#8208;micrometer precision and centimeter&#8208;scale navigation. The system incorporates ferromagnetic nanoparticles within a pliable mesh framework and utilizes both torque&#8208; and gradient force&#8208;driven actuation for controlled navigation in confined spaces. This capability permits the repeated targeting of individual neurons for compartment&#8208;specific electrophysiological recordings and conformal integration with brain organoids for reliable, multi&#8208;channel signal acquisition. By combining magnetic actuation with flexible bioelectronics, Mag&#8208;N&#8208;Probe provides a versatile and scalable solution for adaptive neural interfacing, applicable to both single&#8208;cell studies and 3D tissue environments, thus supporting a wide range of in vitro studies and promising prospects for minimally invasive in vivo applications.

         <title>Soft and Strong: Elastic Conductors with Bio&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general reverse&#8208;engineering approach is demonstrated for designing functional yarns that uses woven fabric architecture as a structural framework. The fabric&#8208;based stretchable conductive yarns combine flexibility, high elasticity, low stiffness, self&#8208;protection, and weavability with conventional textile processes. By fine&#8208;tuning the number of elastic fibers and electrode fibers, this fabric&#8208;based approach enables customized tuning of strain sensitivity in stretchable conductive yarns.








Abstract
Skin is soft yet strong &#8211; a combination achieved by integrating compliant elastin with stiff but wavy collagen, producing non&#8208;linear mechanical properties. Inspired by this structure, stiff conductive wires are engineered into sinusoidal patterns and mechanically interlocked them with highly elastic fibers using a reimagined woven fabric approach. The result is a highly conducting and stretchable yarn that also has high tensile strength &#8211; a combination that is attractive for wearable applications where comfort and durability are valued. With a diameter of &#8776;1 mm&#8212;comparable to many commercial yarns&#8212;the fabric&#8208;based yarn exhibits low stiffness across a broad strain range (up to 270% under 2 N of force) while demonstrating a self&#8208;protective transition to high stiffness and strength (up to 30 MPa) as it nears failure. Additionally, this yarn offers excellent flexibility, high strain tolerance (exceeding 500%), inherent breathability, and superior weavability. By tuning the number of elastic fibers and electrode fibers, it can further tailor these stretchable conductive yarns into strain&#8208;insensitive connecting yarns (low impedance at MHz frequencies, GF = 0.0003) and mechanical sensing yarns with dual strain and proximity sensing capabilities. The integration of these functional yarns enables system&#8208;level smart textile applications, such as wristband controllers.

Quantum dot (QD)&#8208;sensitized upconversion mixtures are encapsulated in droplets within a rigid polymer matrix, enabling liquid&#8208;like NIR&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II triplet&#8722;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) in a pseudo&#8208;solid format.

Abstract
Quantum&#8208;dot (QD) sensitized triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) offers a promising strategy for harvesting sub&#8208;bandgap photons in silicon photovoltaics and infrared photodetectors. However, translating solution&#8208;based upconversion to the solid state remains a major challenge due to severe efficiency losses. Here, a hybrid approach is reported that encapsulates QD&#8208;sensitized upconversion mixtures into mesoscale droplets within a rigid acrylate matrix, preserving liquid&#8208;like dynamics in a pseudo&#8208;solid form. Using a system of PbS sensitizer, carboxytetracene mediator, and TES&#8208;ADT annihilator, a normalized UC emission efficiency (&#951;UC) of 0.72% and upconverted singlet state generation efficiency (&#951;UCs${\eta _{U{C_s}}}$) of 18% in the NIR&#8208;I regime (785&#160;nm excitation) is achieved, record&#8208;high for solid&#8208;state QD&#8208;sensitized systems. A key advance lies in the rational design of a chemically compatible polymer system that enables spontaneous phase separation of QDs into nanodroplets while preserving QD surface chemistry, preventing an over 1000&#8208;fold drop in upconversion efficiency observed in chemically incompatible control systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms that PbS surface chemistry and dynamics are maintained within nanodroplets. Extending this approach to the NIR&#8208;II regime, the first quantifiable solid&#8208;state TTA&#8208;UC under 1064&#160;nm excitation is demonstrated, achieving &#951;UC of 0.022% (&#951;UCs${\eta _{U{C_s}}}$ of 0.55%). These findings represent a substantial step toward integrating QD&#8208;sensitized TTA&#8208;UC into Si&#8208;based optoelectronics.

However, achieving long&#8208;term memory retention and precise conductance modulation under ambient conditions remains a key challenge. Here, a solid&#8208;state OEST gated by a semi&#8208;solid ionic liquid gel, in which thermal annealing significantly enhances memory characteristics and operation reliability by tuning the thin film microstructure and ion&#8208;polymer interactions, is reported. The optimized devices exhibit stable multilevel conductance with 82% retention over 1000 s across five distinct states, and negligible drift over 20000 operation cycles under ambient conditions. These devices are integrated into non&#8208;volatile logic gates (NOT, NAND, NOR) and applied in high&#8208;fidelity recording and storage of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for up to 1200 s, with reusability over 7 days. They are also used for neuromorphic computing of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for activity classification. This work advances the development of reliable, high&#8208;performance bio&#8208;inspired neuromorphic devices, offering a route toward in&#8208;sensory processing and logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory architectures for bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable, Ladder&#8208;Branched Polyimides of Intrinsic Microporosity by [4+4] Cycloaddition for Membrane Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy utilizing [4+4] cycloaddition is demonstrated to fabricate ladder&#8208;branched polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;PIs) with significantly enhanced performance characteristics for membrane&#8208;based gas separation.








Abstract
Advancements in membrane&#8208;based gas separation have the potential to address global challenges related to energy and the environment. However, new membrane materials must have excellent separation performance, stability, and processability, and simultaneously achieving all three metrics is extremely challenging. To circumvent these issues, a post&#8208;synthetic modification of polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;PIs) synthesized with a UV light (UV)&#8208;reactive anthracene co&#8208;monomer is reported. UV irradiation on the PIM&#8208;PI solution converts the anthracene units into dianthracene linkages by [4+4] cycloaddition, while the resultant PIM&#8208;PI is still solution&#8208;processable due to the branched structure. The ladder&#8208;like dianthracene moieties significantly increased both microporosity (&lt;20 &#197;) and ultramicroporosity (&lt;7 &#197;) of the precursor PIM&#8208;PI. Notably, the UV&#8208;treated PIM&#8208;PI membrane exhibits a large boost in pure&#8208;gas CO2 permeability by up to 260%, reaching 376 barrer, while maintaining CO2/CH4 ideal selectivity of 35 at 1 bar. Moreover, the developed membrane material has enhanced stability against physical aging and plasticization and showcases excellent CO2/CH4 mixed&#8208;gas selectivity (&gt;30 up to 31 bar feed pressure), which surpasses the 2018 mixed&#8208;gas upper bound.

         <title>Enhancing Field Effects of Single&#8208;Atom Ru/Lignin Carbon Nanoreactors for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Continuous Heterogeneous Curvature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To meet the challenges of scarce&#160;active sites and sluggish catalytic kinetics arising from nanocurvature and tip&#8208;effect. Single&#8208;atom Ru/lignin carbon nanoreactors are prepared by optimizing uniform&#8208;nanocurvature with tip effects for excellent electrocatalytic HER. The HeterC&#8208;LCS depicts a lowest overpotential of 9.2&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 8.7&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, which outperforms all known carbon&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Local electric fields of the electrocatalysts can modulate adsorbate binding energies based on their polarizability and dipole moment, which directly influence the catalytic performance. Nevertheless, implementing the prevailing strategy remains challenging due to the scarcity of active sites and sluggish catalytic kinetics. Herein, a continuous heterogeneous&#8208;curvature nanoreactor (HeterC&#8208;LCS) is created to enhance local electric fields by optimizing the uniform&#8208;nanocurvature with tip effects. The H+ concentration and H2O transmission rate of HeterC&#8208;LCS are improved by about 2.1 and 1.7 times that of the homogeneous curvature structure (HomoC&#8208;LCS) during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Besides, HeterC&#8208;LCS demonstrates a rapid kinetics of intermediate transformation and an extremely low energy barrier. Such HeterC&#8208;LCS depicts a lowest overpotential of 9.2&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which outperforms all known carbon&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts. And the mass activity is approximately 60 times that of commercial Pt/C. This work proposes a novel strategy of uniform&#8208;nanocurvature optimized by tip effects toward industrially electrocatalytic HER.

         <title>Multifunctional Dithiol Crosslinking Additive Enables Highly Efficient and Stable Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;mercaptobutyryloxy)butane (BD1), significantly enhances inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes by simultaneously optimizing ink rheology, enabling defect passivation through dithiol and carbonyl interactions, and promoting cross&#8208;linking via thiol groups. These synergistic effects lead to the formation of robust and stable quantum dot film networks, resulting in a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 21.73%, highlighting BD1&#8217;s potential for high&#8208;performance quantum dot display applications.








Abstract
Inkjet printing provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach for fabricating perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs), particularly suited for high&#8208;resolution display applications. However, challenges such as poor ink printability and limited stability of perovskite quantum dots (Pe&#8208;QD) inks have impeded its widespread adoption. To overcome these limitations, 1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;mercaptobutyryloxy)butane (BD1), a dithiol&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkable additive is introduced to enable high&#8208;performance inkjet&#8208;printed Pe&#8208;QLEDs. BD1 serves three critical functions: i) it optimizes the rheological properties of the ink, promoting uniform droplet formation and adaptable inkjet printing process; ii) its thiol groups coordinate with under&#8208;coordinated Pb2&#8314; sites on the QD surface, mitigating ligand loss during ink formulation and deposition, thus reducing defect density and enhancing optical quality; and iii) it participates in a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction with oleic acid ligands, forming robust crosslinked networks that improve film integrity and device stability. By leveraging these synergistic effects, BD1&#8208;enabled Pe&#8208;QLEDs achieve a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.73%, a peak luminance of 30,637.82 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and an enhanced operational lifetime. This additive engineering strategy also demonstrates versatility across red and blue Pe&#8208;QLEDs, highlighting its broad applicability. Collectively, the findings position BD1 as a highly effective multifunctional additive for stabilizing and optimizing Pe&#8208;QD inks, paving the way for scalable production of high&#8208;resolution, full&#8208;color Pe&#8208;QLED displays and other printed optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Construction of Diverse Calcium&#8208;Based Nanomaterials through a&#160;Microemulsion Method for Pyroptosis&#8208;Initiated Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal microemulsion approach using calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate as surfactant and calcium source enables the synthesis of diverse calcium&#8208;based nanomaterials. Calcium succinate nanoparticles (PCS NPs) induce pyroptosis via calcium overload, and upregulate MHC&#8208;I expression, enhancing immune response and alleviating immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. This strategy offers a novel platform for tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;regulated immunotherapy with broad applications.








Abstract
Calcium&#8208;based nanomaterials have gained significant attention in biomedical fields due to their critical roles in biological processes and excellent biocompatibility. In this study, a universal and simple microemulsion approach is presented using calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate as both surfactant and calcium source, enabling the synthesis of diverse calcium&#8208;based nanomaterials (e.g., calcium succinate, calcium hypophosphite, calcium metatungstate, calcium gluconate, calcium formate, and calcium citrate). To address the challenges of inadequate immune response in tumor immunotherapy, calcium succinate nanoparticle&#160;(PCS NP) is&#160;investigated as an example. The PCS NP exhibit enhanced immunotherapeutic potential by activating the caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis pathway via calcium overload, which in turn enhanced the immune response. Additionally, the anionic succinate component upregulates major histocompatibility complex&#8208;I (MHC&#8208;I) expression, enhancing antigen presentation and alleviating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This microemulsion strategy provides a novel platform for calcium nanomaterial fabrication, opening new avenues for TME&#8208;regulated immunotherapy enhancement, demonstrating a broad application prospect.

&lt;p&gt;A universal microemulsion approach using calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate as surfactant and calcium source enables the synthesis of diverse calcium-based nanomaterials. Calcium succinate nanoparticles (PCS NPs) induce pyroptosis via calcium overload, and upregulate MHC-I expression, enhancing immune response and alleviating immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. This strategy offers a novel platform for tumor microenvironment (TME)-regulated immunotherapy with broad applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium-based nanomaterials have gained significant attention in biomedical fields due to their critical roles in biological processes and excellent biocompatibility. In this study, a universal and simple microemulsion approach is presented using calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate as both surfactant and calcium source, enabling the synthesis of diverse calcium-based nanomaterials (e.g., calcium succinate, calcium hypophosphite, calcium metatungstate, calcium gluconate, calcium formate, and calcium citrate). To address the challenges of inadequate immune response in tumor immunotherapy, calcium succinate nanoparticle&#160;(PCS NP) is&#160;investigated as an example. The PCS NP exhibit enhanced immunotherapeutic potential by activating the caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis pathway via calcium overload, which in turn enhanced the immune response. Additionally, the anionic succinate component upregulates major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) expression, enhancing antigen presentation and alleviating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).

         <title>THz&#8208;Driven Coherent Phonon Fingerprints of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in 2D Layered Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense THz pulses are employed to drive coherent phonons in 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper hybrid metal&#8208;halide perovskites (HOIPs) from the (PEA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnI3n+1 family, revealing mode&#8208;selective spectroscopic signatures of inversion symmetry breaking in those nominally centrosymmetric materials. These findings provide a handle to decode nonlinear phonon driving mechanisms toward ultrafast control of optoelectronic functionalities in low&#8208;dimensional HOIPs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs) emerged as a family of novel&#160;semiconductors with outstanding optoelectronic properties for applications in photovoltaics and light emission. Recently, they also attract interest as promising candidates for spintronics. In materials lacking inversion symmetry, spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) leads to the Rashba&#8208;Dresselhaus effect, offering a pathway for spin current control. Therefore, inversion symmetry breaking in MHPs, which are characterized by strong SOC, has crucial implications. Yet, in complex low&#8208;dimensional hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), the presence of and structural contributions to inversion symmetry breaking remain elusive. Here, employing intense THz fields, lattice dynamics carrying spectroscopic fingerprints of inversion symmetry breaking are coherently driven and observed in Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (PEA)2(MA)n&#8208;1PbnI3n+1 perovskites, which are globally assigned to a centrosymmetric space group. We demonstrante coherent control by THz pulses over specific phonons, which are assigned to either purely inorganic or highly anharmonic hybridized cage&#8208;ligand vibrations. By developing a general polarization analysis for THz&#8208;driven phonons, linear and nonlinear driving mechanisms are pinpointed. From this, simultaneous IR&#8208; and Raman&#8208;activity of inorganic cage modes below 1.5 THz is identified, indicating mode&#8208;selective inversion symmetry breaking. By exploring the driving pathways of these coherent phonons, the groundwork is laid for simultaneous ultrafast control of optoelectronic and spintronic properties in 2D HOIPs.

         <title>Dual Targeting of m7G tRNA Modification and Histone Acetylation using Carrier&#8208;Free Nano&#8208;Epidrugs to Evoke Osteosarcoma Chemosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aberrant overexpression of METTL1, a key m7G modulator, and HDAC1, are found to be associated with poor chemotherapeutic response in osteosarcoma. To target these epigenetic vulnerabilities, innovative carrier&#8208;free nano&#8208;epidrugs incorporating first&#8208;line doxorubicin with siMETTL1, FDA&#8208;approved HDAC inhibitor, and DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD are developed, synergistically regulating m7G&#8208;modified tRNA&#8208;mediated translation of DNA repair proteins, and HDAC&#8208;mediated histone deacetylation, amplifying DNA damage, thereby evoking osteosarcoma chemosensitization.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma has witnessed stagnant clinical outcomes over the past four decades, owing to the inevitable reduction in chemosensitivity during treatment. Although epigenetics offers promising strategies to augment chemosensitivity, its role in osteosarcoma remains elusive. Here, by analyzing clinical cohorts, it is found that the aberrant overexpression of methyltransferase 1 (METTL1), a key N7&#8208;methylguanosine (m7G) modulator, and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), associated with poor chemotherapeutic response in osteosarcoma. To target these epigenetic vulnerabilities, innovative carrier&#8208;free nano&#8208;epidrugs (siMBD&#8208;R NPs) are developed, incorporating first&#8208;line doxorubicin (DOX) with siRNA against METTL1 (siMETTL1), FDA&#8208;approved HDAC inhibitor belinostat (BEL), and DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;cRGD. With ultrahigh active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) loading content (&#8776;92.7 wt.%), tumor&#8208;specific targeting capability, and unique pH&#8208;responsive release characteristics, the siMBD&#8208;R NPs indicate remarkable tumor accumulation (15.2&#8208;fold enhancement) compared to free siMETTL1. Importantly, through dual&#8208;epigenetic regulation, the nano&#8208;epidrugs markedly amplify DOX&#8208;triggered DNA damage. Specifically, siMETTL1 selectively disrupts m7G&#8208;modified tRNA&#8208;mediated translation of DNA repair proteins, and BEL&#8208;induced HDAC inhibition remodels chromatin into a more accessible state, promoting DNA damage accumulation. In vivo studies demonstrate that siMBD&#8208;R NPs can significantly potentiate chemosensitivity, achieving an 81.5% relative increase in tumor inhibition, and can activate an immune response. This work highlights the potential benefits of leveraging dual&#8208;targeted epigenetic intervention to evoke osteosarcoma chemosensitization.

         <title>AC Current&#8208;Driven Magnetization Switching and Nonlinear Hall Rectification in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports alternating&#8208;current (AC) driven magnetization reversal in a semi&#8208;magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, with low current density. Time&#8208;domain Hall voltage measurements reveal a nonlinear and rectified Hall effect, along with higher&#8208;harmonic responses and hysteresis. These findings, including asymmetric frequency mixing, offer potential for spintronic applications like signal processing and frequency conversion.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque arising from the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled surface states of topological insulators enables current&#8208;induced control of magnetization with high efficiency. Here, alternating&#8208;current (AC) driven magnetization reversal is demonstrated in a semi&#8208;magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of 1.5 &#215; 109&#8197;A&#8197;m&#8722;2. Time&#8208;domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope reveal a strongly nonlinear and rectified Hall response during the magnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time&#8208;varying Hall voltage identifies higher&#8208;harmonic signals and a rectified direct&#8208;current (DC) component, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current, external magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic behavior in the current&#8208;voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing under dual&#8208;frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional polynomial&#8208;based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific frequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only switch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses, offering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential applications in energy&#8208;efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency conversion.

         <title>Facilely Accessible and Reusable High&#8208;Performance Poly(Thioester Amide) Adhesives with Exceptional Versatility and Environmental Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of poly(thioester amide) adhesives is facilely synthesized via spontaneous ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of N&#8208;alkyl aziridine and glutaric thioanhydride. In particular, the polymer with rigid benzyl side groups exhibits high&#8208;performance adhesion to diverse substrates, along with excellent reusability and resistance to low temperatures and water, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional adhesives in line with circular economy principles.








Abstract
Despite significant advancements in adhesive technology, developing adhesives that combine strong adhesion with reusability remains a formidable challenge. Current commercial adhesives often fail under cold or humid conditions, highlighting the need for next&#8208;generation systems with enhanced environmental resilience and reusability. In this study, a facile and robust polymer adhesive is developed and synthesized via the spontaneous, catalyst&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of N&#8208;alkyl aziridine and glutaric thioanhydride (GTA). The resulting cyclic alternating poly(thioester amide)s (PTEAs), particularly P(AzBn&#8208;GTA) derived from N&#8208;benzylaziridine (AzBn) and GTA, exhibit versatile adhesion across various substrates, including dissimilar materials, with a maximum adhesion strength of 17.8 MPa on steel. By introducing multiple interaction sites and tailoring side groups, a well&#8208;balanced combination of cohesive and interfacial adhesion energies is achieved, conferring the polymers with exceptional elasticity and toughness. Moreover, the incorporation of flexible backbones and hydrophobic moieties imparts remarkable resistance to ultralow temperature and water. Reversible adhesion is demonstrated through simple heating and cooling cycles, with stable performance maintained over 10 reprocessing cycles. Overall, the high performance and reusability of P(AzBn&#8208;GTA) surpass those of previously reported adhesives, positioning it as an advanced and sustainable alternative aligned with circular economy principles.

         <title>Liquid Jet&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid jet triboelectric nanogenerator driven by Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability (PR&#8208;TENG) is devised. Compared with droplet and continuous water flow, the liquid jet exhibits enhanced charge transfer efficiency, delivering over two orders of magnitude higher current output. The mechanism originates from high&#8208;frequency contact, efficient electron capture, and droplet recontact&#8208;assisted charge release.








Abstract
Although the solid&#8211;liquid triboelectric nanogenerators have made great progress in energy harvesting, their efficiency is fundamentally limited by the continuous shielding effect of the solid&#8211;liquid electric double layer (EDL). Herein, a liquid&#8208;jet triboelectric nanogenerator that exploits Plateau&#8208;Rayleigh instability (PR&#8208;TENG) is demonstrated to overcome this barrier. PR&#8208;TENG converts low&#8208;frequency water flow into high&#8208;frequency droplets, avoiding shielding effects from continuous flow and achieving a contact&#8208;separation frequency of &#8776;50 Hz. At a flow rate of 320 mL&#160;min&#8722;1, the PR&#8208;TENG generates an output current of over 100 &#181;A, &#8776;120 times the magnitude of conventional single&#8208;electrode droplet TENGs (D&#8208;TENGs) that rely on electrostatic induction. The operational mechanism of PR&#8208;TENG arises from droplet&#8208;fusion&#8208;induced triboelectrification, surface charge trapping, and charge redistribution, enabling energy harvesting from continuous water flow and water&#8208;level monitoring applications. This work significantly improves the electrical output performance of flow&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators and provides an effective solution for continuous flow&#8208;based energy harvesting.

         <title>A 2D Van Der Waals Molecular Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 2D van der Waals molecular ferroelectric is reported, in which coordination bonded molecule&#8208;based monolayers are knitted together by weak van der Waals forces. It can be mechanically exfoliated into ultrathin flake with room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity down to 9 nm, which has never been achieved in traditional molecular ferroelectrics.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics have aroused great interest for their novel structures and functionalities in many applications such as in&#8208;memory computing and ferroelectric detectors. However, the documented 2D ferroelectrics remain very rare, mainly limited to inorganic ones represented by transition metal thio/selenophosphates. Constructing new 2D vdW ferroelectric categories may bring interesting phenomena, but it has always been a challenge. Here, a molecular 2D vdW ferroelectric sodium 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropionate (2,2,3,3&#8208;TFPS) is successfully designed through H/F substitution, which adopts a unique stable layered structure where each coordination bonded molecule&#8208;based 2,2,3,3&#8208;TFPS monolayers knitted together by weak vdW forces between protruding (&#8722;CHF2) cantilevers in the adjacent two monolayers. More strikingly, it can show robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity even in a mechanically exfoliated ultrathin flake as thin as 9&#160;nm, which has never been achieved in traditional molecular ferroelectrics with ferroelectricity mainly in the bulk form and micron&#8208;scale thin film. To the best of the knowledge, 2,2,3,3&#8208;TFPS is the first molecular 2D vdWs ferroelectric showing robust ferroelectricity in sub&#8208;10&#160;nm thickness. This work expands the diversity of 2D vdW ferroelectrics and sheds light on the exploration of molecular 2D vdW ferroelectrics with promising low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectricity for applications in nanoscale devices.

         <title>Experimental Observation of Topological Transition in Optical Multimeron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the capability to manipulate the topology of spin texture by leveraging the inherent topology of the optical source, resulting in skyrmion numbers intricately locked to the chirality of the incident light. This work holds promise for advancing the applications and development of topology&#8208;protected optical systems capable of mitigating polarization fluctuations of the incident light.








Abstract
Topological textures exemplify matter and energy configuration governed by inherent physical laws. Recently skyrmion&#8208;like textures possessing fixed topology have been realized in diverse optical systems, ranging from evanescent fields, structured media to free space. Magnetic skyrmions, with their tunable topological features via external stimuli, hold promise for innovative devices, such as memory, logic gates, and neuromorphic computing. However, achieving dynamic control over non&#8208;trivial topological transitions in optical counterparts remains elusive, limiting their application in areas such as super&#8208;resolution imaging and information processing. In this study, a platform is proposed and demonstrated for producing optical spin multimerons via multiple plasmonic vortex interference. More importantly, to manipulate the multimeron topology is managed by tuning the topology of the incident light, experimentally observing a topological transition with a nontrivial swap of the skyrmion number. This work broadens the scope of optical topological textures or quasiparticles, providing insights into their formation and transition mechanisms.

         <title>Melt Spinning Preparation of Conductive, Elastic, and Harsh Condition&#8208;Tolerant Covalently Cross&#8208;Linked Fibers for Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently cross&#8208;linked polyurethane conductive fibers prepared by melt spinning are developed, which have excellent high temperature and solvent resistance. As a negative dielectric material, it can significantly enhance the output signal of triboelectric nanogenerators. These properties make it promising for a wide range of applications in robotics, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices.








Abstract
Elastic conductive fibers, owing to their flexibility, breathability, and integrability, are essential for smart textiles. While traditional covalently cross&#8208;linked fibers offer excellent performance, their high viscosity limits melt processing and impedes effective composite formation with conductive fillers. Currently, melt spinning technology based on dynamic covalent bonds remains in its infancy, and no studies have reported the successful fabrication of covalently cross&#8208;linked electronic conductive fibers using this technique. To this end, a covalently cross&#8208;linked polyurethane is developed that exhibits both high performance and excellent reprocessability. During the reprocessing, the small molecule cross&#8208;linker is released from the cross&#8208;linked network, which weakens the non&#8208;covalent interaction between linear molecular chains, playing a key role in plasticization and viscosity reduction. The synthesized polyurethane and conductive filler formed a homogeneous composite system, which is used to produce elastic conductive fibers through melt spinning. The resulting conductive fibers exhibited high tensile strength (7.8&#160;MPa), stretchability (53.5 %), high&#8208;temperature resistance (200 &#176;C), and solvent resistance. The fabricated fibers are integrated into a harsh condition&#8208;tolerant triboelectric nanogenerator and used for information transmission. Conductive fibers with negative dielectric constant properties enhanced signal output tenfold due to their unique polarization behavior, offering a new approach for constructing advanced triboelectric nanogenerators.

To this end, a covalently cross-linked polyurethane is developed that exhibits both high performance and excellent reprocessability. During the reprocessing, the small molecule cross-linker is released from the cross-linked network, which weakens the non-covalent interaction between linear molecular chains, playing a key role in plasticization and viscosity reduction. The synthesized polyurethane and conductive filler formed a homogeneous composite system, which is used to produce elastic conductive fibers through melt spinning. The resulting conductive fibers exhibited high tensile strength (7.8&#160;MPa), stretchability (53.5 %), high-temperature resistance (200 &#176;C), and solvent resistance. The fabricated fibers are integrated into a harsh condition-tolerant triboelectric nanogenerator and used for information transmission. Conductive fibers with negative dielectric constant properties enhanced signal output tenfold due to their unique polarization behavior, offering a new approach for constructing advanced triboelectric nanogenerators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Sonophage Synergizes Sonodynamic Therapy and Saltoptosis for Solid Tumor Eradication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy integrating saltoptosis with sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is proposed to enhance tumor treatment. Specifically, a M1 macrophage extracellular vesicles&#8208;liposome hybrid (Sonophage), encapsulating sonosensitizer (Ce6), oxygen&#8208;enriched perfluorocarbon, and salt solution (brine), is engineerd. This combination therapy, where sonodynamic waves in a sea of salt orchestrate a synergistic attack on tumors, offers a promising new avenue for advancing cancer treatment.








Abstract
Sodium overload has emerged as a novel antitumor approach, which is termed as &#8220;saltoptosis,&#8221; due to its significant therapeutic potential. However, its inherent limitations and related solid tumor treatment challenges have impeded clinical translation. A synergistic strategy integrating saltoptosis with sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is proposed to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, a M1 macrophage extracellular vesicle&#8208;liposome hybrid (termed &#8220;Sonophage&#8221;), encapsulating sonosensitizer (Ce6), oxygen&#8208;enriched perfluorocarbon (PFC&#8208;O2), and salt solution (brine), is engineered. This innovative design enables the simultaneous activation of sonodynamic saltoptosis. Under ultrasound, Sonophage directly damages tumor cells via SDT while inducing immunogenic cell death. Concurrently, sodium overload, paired with the biological functions of M1 macrophage extracellular vesicles, reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by polarizing macrophages to a pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 phenotype and enhancing T&#8208;cell activation, key drivers of antitumor immunity. Additionally, PFC&#8208;O2 alleviates tumor hypoxia, amplifying the combined therapeutic impact. Preclinical studies show that Sonophage selectively targets and penetrates tumors, significantly inhibiting progression, priming systemic immunity to prevent metastasis, and ultimately extending survival. Transcriptomic analysis further confirms its potential to enhance immune responses against tumors. Thus, this combination therapy, where sondynamic waves in a sea of salt orchestrate a synergistic attack on tumors, offers a promising new avenue for advancing cancer treatment.

         <title>Critical Thickness and Long&#8208;Term Ambient Stability in Superconducting LaPr2Ni2O7 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambient&#8208;pressure superconductivity persisting over 100 days is achieved in 11.8&#160;nm LaPr2Ni2O7 films grown on SrLaAlO4 substrates. Structural and transport analyses reveal spontaneous formation of a protective (La,Pr)4Ni3O10&#8208;dominant surface phase (&gt;10&#160;nm from the interface) that stabilizes superconductivity. Additional ex situ amorphous oxide capping further enhances ambient stability, marking a significant advance toward durable bilayer nickelate superconductors.








Abstract
The recent observation of ambient&#8208;pressure superconductivity in compressively strained (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 films marks a significant advance in nickelate superconductivity research. However, their fabrication remains challenging, with reported thickness limited to &lt;6.6&#160;nm and pronounced ambient degradation. In this study, LaPr2Ni2O7 films with nominal thicknesses ranging from 3.5 to 23.5&#160;nm are fabricated. Superconductivity is observed in all samples, with a maximum onset transition temperature (Tc) of 44 K. No systematic correlation between Tc and film thickness is identified. Angle&#8208;dependent Tc measurements under external magnetic fields and vortex anisotropy analysis indicate 2D superconductivity in all samples. Structural and transport measurements show that superconductivity in LaPr2Ni2O7 is confined to within 10&#160;nm of the interface, while thicker films develop a protective (La,Pr)4Ni3O10 surface layer that enhances stability. Ex situ amorphous oxide capping layers further suppress superconducting degradation, yielding 10&#8208;fold stability enhancement in ultrathin films (3 &#8776; 4&#160;nm) and prolonging stability from 30 to more than 100 days in thicker films.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Design of L12&#8208;Type Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic Compound for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
15 quinary L12&#8208;type Pt3M(4) high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds are designed, train a deep neural network to predict hydrogen adsorption energies across 20&#8201;000 microstates per composition, and establish a novel statistical evaluation framework by quantifying microstates within the active range. Site&#8208;specific analysis reveals that surface Co, Cr, and Fe optimize Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;M sites, while subsurface Ni and Co modulate Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;Pt configurations.








Abstract
Rational design of high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds (HEICs) remains challenging due to complex structure&#8208;property relationships and the lack of predictive tools. Here, a data&#8208;driven framework is presented to evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of L12&#8208;type quinary Pt3M(4) HEICs, where M comprises any four elements from six 3d transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn). Guided by the Pm&#8208;3m space group, 15 distinct compositions with numerous microstates are designed. A deep neural network, trained on 453 computed datasets, predicts hydrogen adsorption energy (&#8710;EH*) across 20&#8201;000 microstructures per composition, enabling statistical mapping of site&#8208;specific performance. To capture the effect of local atomic environments, a novel statistical evaluation approach is introduced that quantifies the number of microstates falling within the optimal &#8710;EH* range, advancing beyond conventional mean&#8208;based evaluations. Among all candidates, Pt3(CrMnFeCo) emerges as the most promising HER catalyst, validated experimentally over a wide pH range. Further in&#8208;depth data mining reveals that surface Co, Cr, and Fe optimize Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;M sites, while subsurface Ni and Co modulate Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;Pt interactions. This study establishes a new paradigm for HEIC catalyst design and deepens the mechanistic understanding of activity origin in complex multimetal systems.

         <title>Localized Water Confinement via Micellar Electrolyte for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Localized water confinement in the CTAB micellar electrolyte prevents cascade failure of vanadium&#8208;based AZIBs. The CTA+&#8208;expanded cathode spacing and CTA+/OTF&#8722;&#8208;formed EDL synergistically enhance pseudocapacitance of cathode and compensate for proton kinetic losses in the passivated electrolyte. Significantly, the balance between localized water confinement and rapid charge transfer enhances the cycle life of vanadium&#8208;based AZIBs at lower currents.








Abstract
Highly reactive water&#8208;induced cascade failures, including vanadium dissolution, proton intercalation, hydrogen evolution reactions, and interfacial side reactions, limit the recyclability of vanadium&#8208;based aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. These failures are more severe at low current densities (&lt; 0.5 A g&#8722;1). Current studies on electrolyte optimization stabilize the zinc anode but neglect the vanadium&#8208;based cathode. Here, from a vanadium&#8208;based cathode perspective, a micellar electrolyte is developed using the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), in which water is locally confined and Br&#8722; restructures Zn2+ solvation, collectively inhibiting the water&#8208;induced cascade failures. Concomitantly, electrostatic interactions enable CTA&#8314; intercalation into V&#9472;O layers (forming expanded&#8208;spacing cathode (CTA, Ca)VO) and cathode&#8208;surface electric double layer generation, which enhances pseudocapacitance to offset water confinement&#8208;induced kinetic losses. Additionally, cycling&#8208;induced CTA+ degradation participates in the formation of solid&#8208;state electrolyte interphases (CEI/SEI) to provide further effective cathode/anode interfacial protection. The micellar electrolyte balances water confinement and charge transfer to achieve breakthrough full&#8208;cell performance: 93.57%/98.78%/82.17% retention after 150/300/17 700 cycles at 0.1/0.2/4.0 A g&#8722;1 (25&#160;&#176;C) and 99.77% retention after 420 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C). This micellar electrolyte strategy can be extended to other vanadium&#8208;based cathodes (e.g., NaVO, BaVO), quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells, and anode&#8208;free cells, providing a viable paradigm for electrolyte design.

&lt;p&gt;Localized water confinement in the CTAB micellar electrolyte prevents cascade failure of vanadium-based AZIBs. The CTA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-expanded cathode spacing and CTA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/OTF&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-formed EDL synergistically enhance pseudocapacitance of cathode and compensate for proton kinetic losses in the passivated electrolyte. Significantly, the balance between localized water confinement and rapid charge transfer enhances the cycle life of vanadium-based AZIBs at lower currents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly reactive water-induced cascade failures, including vanadium dissolution, proton intercalation, hydrogen evolution reactions, and interfacial side reactions, limit the recyclability of vanadium-based aqueous zinc-ion batteries. These failures are more severe at low current densities (&amp;lt; 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Current studies on electrolyte optimization stabilize the zinc anode but neglect the vanadium-based cathode. Here, from a vanadium-based cathode perspective, a micellar electrolyte is developed using the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), in which water is locally confined and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; restructures Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation, collectively inhibiting the water-induced cascade failures. Concomitantly, electrostatic interactions enable CTA&#8314; intercalation into V&#9472;O layers (forming expanded-spacing cathode (CTA, Ca)VO) and cathode-surface electric double layer generation, which enhances pseudocapacitance to offset water confinement-induced kinetic losses. Additionally, cycling-induced CTA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; degradation participates in the formation of solid-state electrolyte interphases (CEI/SEI) to provide further effective cathode/anode interfacial protection. The micellar electrolyte balances water confinement and charge transfer to achieve breakthrough full-cell performance: 93.57%/98.78%/82.17% retention after 150/300/17 700 cycles at 0.1/0.2/4.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (25&#160;&#176;C) and 99.77% retention after 420 cycles at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C). This micellar electrolyte strategy can be extended to other vanadium-based cathodes (e.g., NaVO, BaVO), quasi-solid-state cells, and anode-free cells, providing a viable paradigm for electrolyte design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Injectable Conductive Hydrogel Patch with Spatiotemporally Tailored Asymmetric Adhesion for Myocardial Infarction Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable Janus hydrogel, as a variant of double&#8208;network systems, leverages decoupled ionic&#8208;covalent network formation for asymmetric interface construction. This strategy enables minimally invasive, glue&#8208;free cardiac repair with spatial precision, restoring redox balance and electrophysiological function, and promoting functional recovery.








Abstract
Conventional cardiac patches face critical limitations, including invasive surgical trauma, nonspecific adhesion, and inadequate electromechanical integration, collectively limiting their therapeutic efficacy in myocardial infarction (MI) repair. Here, GRAXe is presented as an injectable hydrogel patch with asymmetric adhesion, biomimetic conductivity, and inflammation&#8208;modulating capabilities. The Janus structure of GRAXe is established through sequential crosslinking, involving Ca2+&#8208;induced pre&#8208;gelation (trigger A) followed by spatially directed UV fixation (trigger B) to form an asymmetric interpenetrating ionic&#8208;covalent network. This gelation paradigm enables spatial control over interfacial network assembly, yielding a myocardium&#8208;adherent interface via MXene&#8208;enhanced catechol coupling and an anti&#8208;adhesive surface through dense polymer entanglement, resulting in a 60&#8212;150&#8208;fold adhesion contrast. The conductive architecture of GRAXe (1.18 mS cm&#8722;1) restores electrical synchrony across MI zones by re&#8208;establishing connexin&#8208;43&#8208;mediated intercellular coupling. Furthermore, the incorporation of reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive thioketal networks enables on&#8208;demand suppression of lipid peroxidation and modulates macrophage polarization. In rat MI models, GRAXe restores electromechanical coupling, attenuates ventricular remodeling, and enhances cardiac functional recovery. This modular strategy integrates structural programmability with functional performance, offering a promising direction for minimally invasive cardiac repair.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;angle Distortion Stabilized Antiferroelectricity in Engineered ZrO2&#8208;LSMO Laminate Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering ZrO2/LSMO epitaxial laminates on LSAT(110) substrates, this study stabilizes the antiferroelectric Pbca phase in ZrO2 through shear strain&#8211;induced &#946;&#8208;angle distortion by LSMO intercalation, and enables reversible switching with the ferroelectric Pca21 phase. Lattice analysis and DFT calculations identify &#946;&#8208;angle distortion as the key parameter governing phase control, establishing a stability map and guiding design strategies for fluorite&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Fluorite&#8208;structured thin films have drawn significant attention for their ferro&#8208;/anti&#8208;ferroelectric properties, due to their scale&#8208;free nature and excellent compatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. While epitaxial ferroelectric fluorite films have advanced mechanistic understanding and performance optimization, stabilizing antiferroelectricity in epitaxial fluorites remains challenging, limiting both fundamental insights and device potential. Here, stabilization of the antiferroelectric Pbca phase in ZrO2&#8208;LSMO laminate structures grown on LSAT (110) substrates is reported, with a reversible and non&#8208;volatile transition between Pbca and Pca21 phases. The discontinuous epitaxial interfaces introduced by LSMO intercalation generate a high&#8208;density of edge and screw dislocations, which impose shear strains and induce &#946;&#8208;angle distortion in ZrO2. Systematic lattice distortion analysis, supported by density functional theory, reveals the critical role of &#946;&#8208;angle distortion in stabilizing the Pbca phase and governing its phase transition. A phase stability map is further established for ZrO2 epitaxial films under varying strain states. This work bridges a long&#8208;standing knowledge gap regarding antiferroelectricity in epitaxial fluorite systems and demonstrates &#946;&#8208;angle distortion as a tunable design parameter for antiferroelectric properties, which offers new routes to optimize fluorite oxide&#8208;based information and energy storage devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel True Random Number Generator (TRNG) exploiting unpredictable conductive domain walls in single&#8208;crystal LiNbO3&#8208;on&#8208;insulator (LNOI) as a physical high&#8208;entropy source is demonstrated. The device achieves high&#8208;amplitude stochastic currents arising from the random nucleation and reconfiguration of conductive domain walls, enabling ultrafast output and flexible device scaling at comparable operating voltages.








Abstract
Random ferroelectric domain nucleation and growth lead to the generation of numerous unpredictable microscopic states that collectively form a natural high&#8208;entropy system. Conventional electrical methods can directly measure reversible domain switching currents, offering a viable platform for true random number generation (TRNG). However, TRNG based on random ferroelectric switching events is limited by the noise amplitudes in electrical signals. In this study, TRNG is realized via the stochastic formation of conductive domain walls in single&#8208;crystal LiNbO3 thin films bonded to SiO2/Si wafers. This approach achieves a noise amplitude and cycling endurance &gt;500&#160;nA and &gt;1010, respectively. The interfacial&#8208;layer&#8208;based device exhibits self&#8208;reinitialized stochastic sub&#8208;10&#8208;ns domain switching operations, enabling ultrafast generation of bit outputs and flexible device scaling. The generated random bitstreams, validated via National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)tests, exhibit robust resistance against machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based predictive attacks. This pioneering study establishes ferroelectric conductive domain walls as groundbreaking platforms for CMOS&#8208;compatible entropy source extraction, effectively addressing the long&#8208;standing challenges in amplifying entropy signals with operational robustness.

         <title>Symmetric Multi&#8208;Resonant TADF Emitters via Chiral Space Conjugation Toward Strong Chiroptical Responses and Narrowband Green Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a chiral space conjugation strategy, a highly efficient chiral multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter incorporating the [2.2]paracyclophane unit is prepared, realizing strong chiroptical responses with absorption dissymmetry factor over 0.02 and pure green emission with Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage y coordinate of 0.70. Furthermore, highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with remarkable luminance of 241k cd m&#8722;2, external quantum efficiency over 29% and ideal efficiency roll&#8208;off are achieved.








Abstract
Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with excellent chiroptical and photophysical properties is crucial for advancing optoelectronic applications. Herein, a chiral space conjugation strategy incorporating a typical [2.2]paracyclophane unit is proposed to construct a highly efficient chiral multi&#8208;resonant (MR) TADF emitter, R(S)&#8208;PCP&#8208;DBNO. Guided by the symmetry&#8208;matching rule, the molecular design achieves balanced contribution and optimal alignment of transition electric and magnetic dipole moments, resulting in a strong chiroptical response with a dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) exceeding 0.02. Meanwhile, owing to the special through&#8208;space conjugation, the enantiomer exhibits pure green emission with a peak at 526&#160;nm, a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 26&#160;nm, a Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage y coordinate of 0.70 and a quantum efficiency of 0.94 in toluene solution. When integrated into sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), R(S)&#8208;PCP&#8208;DBNO delivers a maximum luminance up to 241k&#160;cd&#183;m&#8722;2, a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 29.4% and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off. Furthermore, the devices demonstrate distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, confirming the utility of this strategy for chiral MR&#8208;TADF emitters and circularly polarized OLEDs with simultaneous color purity, efficiency, and chiroptical functionality.

&lt;p&gt;Through a chiral space conjugation strategy, a highly efficient chiral multi-resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter incorporating the [2.2]paracyclophane unit is prepared, realizing strong chiroptical responses with absorption dissymmetry factor over 0.02 and pure green emission with Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage y coordinate of 0.70. Furthermore, highly efficient circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes with remarkable luminance of 241k cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, external quantum efficiency over 29% and ideal efficiency roll-off are achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with excellent chiroptical and photophysical properties is crucial for advancing optoelectronic applications. Herein, a chiral space conjugation strategy incorporating a typical [2.2]paracyclophane unit is proposed to construct a highly efficient chiral multi-resonant (MR) TADF emitter, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-PCP-DBNO. Guided by the symmetry-matching rule, the molecular design achieves balanced contribution and optimal alignment of transition electric and magnetic dipole moments, resulting in a strong chiroptical response with a dissymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;|) exceeding 0.02. Meanwhile, owing to the special through-space conjugation, the enantiomer exhibits pure green emission with a peak at 526&#160;nm, a narrow full-width at half-maximum of 26&#160;nm, a Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage y coordinate of 0.70 and a quantum efficiency of 0.94 in toluene solution. When integrated into sensitized organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-PCP-DBNO delivers a maximum luminance up to 241k&#160;cd&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 29.4% and minimal efficiency roll-off. Furthermore, the devices demonstrate distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, confirming the utility of this strategy for chiral MR-TADF emitters and circularly polarized OLEDs with simultaneous color purity, efficiency, and chiroptical functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Scaffolded Bispecific Antibodies Enhance Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Therapy for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Y&#8208;shaped bispecific antibody enhances the homing efficiency of mesenchymal stromal cells and enables competitive binding to leukocyte receptors. Engineered cells preferentially accumulate in inflamed colonic tissue, suppress immune cell infiltration, and promote colonic tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are considered a promising cell&#8208;based therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), due to their potent immunomodulatory properties and robust regenerative potential. However, their therapeutic efficacy against IBD is hindered by poor homing capacity and excessive leukocyte infiltration at inflamed colonic sites. In this study, MSCs with a Y&#8208;shaped bispecific antibody (YMV) assembled via DNA nanotechnology, which integrates anti&#8208;vascular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;VCAM&#8208;1) and anti&#8208;mucosal addressing cell adhesion molecules&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;MAdCAM&#8208;1) antibodies are engineered, to enhance targeted delivery and inhibit leukocyte recruitment. YMV&#8208;modified MSCs show an approximately threefold enhancement in adhesion efficiency compared with native MSCs. Notably, they effectively compete for MAdCAM&#8208;1 binding sites and significantly suppress leukocyte adhesion. In a mouse model of IBD, YMV&#8208;MSCs demonstrate enhanced homing to the colon, promote mucosal repair, reduce leukocyte infiltration, and attenuate local inflammation. This DNA&#8208;mediated bispecific antibody modification strategy improves MSCs targeting and exerts anti&#8208;inflammatory effects by blocking leukocyte recruitment, offering a promising platform for MSC&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Imidazolate Cages as Porous Ionic Liquids: A Nitric Oxide Delivery Therapeutic Platform for Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;functionalized rhombic dodecahedral tetradecanuclear metal&#8208;imidazolate cages are obtained via subcomponent self&#8208;assembly of 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;imidazolecarboxaldehyde, Ni2+, and diethylene glycolamine (NH2&#8208;PEG2) or triethylene glycol monoamine (NH2&#8208;PEG3), which are porous ionic liquids at room temperature. The nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;loaded hydrogel films containing the liquid cages are fabricated, demonstrating accelerated burn wound healing through slow NO release, which enhances angiogenesis while providing anti&#8208;inflammatory and antibacterial effects.








Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) are a unique class of materials that combine intrinsic permanent porosity with fluidity, yet their synthesis remains challenging due to cost, sustainability, and scalability. In this work, two poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized rhombic dodecahedral tetradecanuclear metal&#8208;imidazolate cages (denoted as 1 and 2) are reported, modified with diethylene glycol (PEG2) and triethylene glycol (PEG3) chains, respectively. Both cages are liquids at room temperature and are obtained via subcomponent self&#8208;assembly of 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;imidazolecarboxaldehyde, Ni2+, and NH2&#8208;PEG2 or NH2&#8208;PEG3. Both ionic PLs demonstrate higher nitric oxide (NO) adsorption capacities than their solid&#8208;state counterparts, with 1 showing the highest performance, capturing approximately eight NO molecules per cage. Upon aqueous stimulation, the cages rapidly release NO, effectively killing Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. To achieve sustained NO release, cage 1 is incorporated into a sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel composite (1@SA), which exhibits prolonged antibacterial activity while promoting angiogenesis and modulating inflammation in vitro. NO&#8208;loaded hydrogel films (NO@1@SA) are fabricated, demonstrating accelerated burn wound healing through slow NO release, which enhances angiogenesis while providing anti&#8208;inflammatory and antibacterial effects. This work not only demonstrates the high potential of metal&#8208;imidazolate cage&#8208;based PLs as exogenous NO delivery platforms but also paves the way for biomedical applications of porous liquids.

         <title>All Solid State Battery with Soft Carbon&#8211;TiSi2 Multilayer Structure for Optimized LiSi Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries require high&#8208;capacity yet stable Si anodes, which still suffer from severe volume expansion and lithium dendrite growth. This article presents a soft carbon&#8208;TiSi2 multilayer anode that overcomes these challenges. The designed ST5/SC/Li structure enables ultra&#8208;long cycling over 64&#160;000 cycles at 10C with zero capacity decay and charge&#8211;discharge cycling time exceeding 10&#160;000 h. The multilayer architecture offers synergistic effects of stress buffering, dynamic lithium replenishment, and stable ion&#8208;electron dual conduction.








Abstract
Li metal and Si anodes are in urgent need for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) due to their high energy density. However, short&#8208;circuit caused by Li dendrite growth and rapid capacity fading due to severe volume expansion of Si still seriously limit their application. Herein, a Si&#8208;TiSi2&#8208;LPSCl/soft carbon/Li (ST5&#8208;SC&#8208;Li) three&#8208;layer structured anode is designed to overcome these challenges. Multi&#8208;layer structure restricts the anisotropic expansion of Si by using the rigid support of TiSi2 and the plastic deformation capability of LPSCl. The composite layer forms a continuous ionic channel through close contact between Si and sulfide electrolyte, and constructs an &#8220;ion&#8208;electron dual network&#8221; in addition to the high electronic conductivity of the Si&#8208;Ti alloy. The SC layer forms ion&#8208;conductive LiC6, further absorbing expansion stress and inhibiting dendrite penetration. The Li metal layer dynamically compensates for the irreversible capacity loss of Si. The LCO/LPSCl/ST5&#8208;SC&#8208;Li SASSBs achieves an ultra&#8208;long cycle of 64&#160;000 cycles at a high rate of 10C (6.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) with a capacity retention rate &gt;100%. Separately, a high reversible areal capacity of 19.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved at 0.1C under high loading.

         <title>Regulation of Interfacial Ion Transport via Honeycomb&#8208;Architected Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work fabricates honeycomb&#8208;like covalent organic frameworks vertically aligned on graphene oxide (HCCOF&#8208;GO) via one&#8208;pot colloidal assembly as an ASEI. The abundant binding sites significantly reduce the nucleation barrier, while the nanochannels enhance desolvation via confinement, anchor anions, and facilitate graded SEI formation, enabling homogeneous Li&#8314; flux and dendrite&#8208;free LMBs.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;This work fabricates honeycomb-like covalent organic frameworks vertically aligned on graphene oxide (HCCOF-GO) via one-pot colloidal assembly as an ASEI. The abundant binding sites significantly reduce the nucleation barrier, while the nanochannels enhance desolvation via confinement, anchor anions, and facilitate graded SEI formation, enabling homogeneous Li&#8314; flux and dendrite-free LMBs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Dependent Excitonic States in Twisted Bilayer WSe2/Fe5GeTe2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spin&#8208;dependent hybrid exciton T* is identified in both 3R and 2H&#8208;BL WSe2/FGT heterostructures. It originates from the coupling between the injected spin&#8208;polarized electrons from FGT and the neutral excitons in BL WSe2 under the spin&#8208;cross&#8208;polarized band mechanism. Furthermore, the T* exciton coupling strength variation stems from distinct twisted BL WSe2 stacking symmetries.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have generated diverse unusual electrical and optical phenomena and can provide a powerful platform for designing nanodevices with tunable interlayer interaction. Striving to explore novel excitons with spin response in these semiconductor systems is highly desirable, as they highlight the possibility to access complex electronic band structure and magneto&#8208;exciton effect, thereby facilitating efficient spin&#8208;based information storage via exciton degrees of freedom. Here, fabrication of bilayer WSe2/Fe5GeTe2 (FGT) heterostructures with different stacking phases is reported, and a new hybridized excitonic state T* is defined in both 3R and 2H bilayer WSe2, which exhibits strong correlations dependent on the FGT spin order. This spin&#8208;dependent hybridized exciton is demonstrated to originate from the coupling between injected spin&#8208;polarized electrons and neutral excitons, because of the spin&#8208;cross&#8208;polarized band that obstructs the normal electron&#8211;hole annihilation process. Besides, the difference in the coupling strength of the T* exciton attributed to the distinct stacking symmetries in twisted bilayer WSe2 is further unveiled. These findings open an accessible avenue for designing tailored excitonic states in twisted bilayers, thus offering prospects for the future applications of stacking&#8208;engineered opto&#8208;spintronics at the integration level.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Driven Co&#8208;Production of Ammonia, Formate, and Hydrogen From Nitrite Reduction Coupled Formaldehyde Oxidation System on Ultra&#8208;Stable AuCuRh Nanowires under Illumination</title>

Defect&#8208;rich AuCuRh nanowires with excellent self&#8208;stability enable the simultaneous nitrite electroreduction and formaldehyde electrooxidation, facilitating the co&#8208;production of ammonia, formate, and hydrogen at low operating potentials.








Abstract
The nitrite electroreduction reaction (NO2RR) offers a green and sustainable pathway for environmental wastewater treatment and ammonia (NH3) generation. Herein, defect&#8208;rich trimetallic AuCuRh nanowires (AuCuRh NWs) with a large number of grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and atomic steps are successfully synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction. Due to its self&#8208;stability and high activity, AuCuRh NWs can efficiently drive the stable NO2RR at 0&#160;V potential (Faradaic efficiency: 98.32%, NH3 yield rate: 20.49&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1). Moreover, AuCuRh NWs also reveal excellent electrocatalytic activity for the formaldehyde electrooxidation reaction (FOR), which can reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at only 0.35&#160;V potential. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system assembled with AuCuRh NWs requires only the electrolysis voltage of 0.38&#160;V to achieve the co&#8208;production of NH3, formate, and hydrogen and ultra&#8208;stable continuous electrolysis for 300&#160;hours. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system can be further decreased to only 0.29&#160;V under illumination due to plasmon&#8208;enhanced activity. This study provides an energy&#8208;efficient coupling strategy for the stable co&#8208;production of value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Synergistic Molecular Engineering of Crosslinked Polymer Dielectrics for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked polymers with decoupled non&#8208;conjugated backbones and polar moieties are designed through a modular molecular engineering to simultaneously optimize molecular polarity, topological crosslinking, and free volume in alicyclic polymers. The fully crosslinked P0&#8208;B300 delivers a record&#8208;high discharge energy density of 4.65 J cm&#8722;3 and superb insulation performance (breakdown strength greater than 700 MV m&#8722;1) at 250&#160;&#176;C, outperforming conventional dielectrics.








Abstract
Polymer dielectric capacitors are critical for high&#8208;temperature energy storage, yet current materials face a trade&#8208;off between thermal stability and capacitive performance due to conduction loss or insufficient polarization. Here, a modular molecular engineering to simultaneously optimize molecular polarity, topological crosslinking, and free volume in alicyclic polymers is designed. By incorporating thermally crosslinkable benzocyclobutene (BCB) and sulfone&#8208;methyl (&#9472;SO2CH3) groups into norbornene&#8208;based monomers via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), crosslinked networks with decoupled non&#8208;conjugated backbones and polar moieties are constructed. The polymers exhibit a wide optical bandgap (Eg &gt; 3.7&#160;eV), high thermal stability (Tg &gt; 350&#160;&#176;C), and suppressed dissipation (Df &#8776; 0.0006). Optimized P50&#8208;B250 delivers an exceptional discharged energy density (Ud) of 8.00 J cm&#8722;3 at 150&#160;&#176;C (&#8805;90% efficiency), while fully crosslinked P0&#8208;B300 retained Ud of 7.34 J cm&#8722;3 at 200&#160;&#176;C and 4.65 J cm&#8722;3 at 250&#160;&#176;C, outperforming conventional dielectrics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that crosslinking increases free volume fraction by &#8776;40%, inhibiting interchain charge transfer complexes (CTCs). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that sulfonyl&#8208;enhanced polarization and crosslinking collectively restrict charge migration. This work establishes a general framework for designing polymer dielectrics by integrating structural modularity and topological control, offering pathways for next&#8208;generation energy storage applications under extreme conditions.

         <title>From Self&#8208;Healing to Smart&#8208;Healing: A Self&#8208;Diagnosing and Self&#8208;Healing System Based on Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;perception&#8211;healing&#8211;feedback system that mimics biological healing is created by integrating a conductive polymer with an artificial intelligence. Using multi&#8208;terminal impedance sensing, the system self&#8208;perceives damage, triggers localized Joule heating to heal the crack, and provides feedback on the repair status. This work pioneers the leap from self&#8208;healing to smart&#8208;healing, introducing a new generation of intelligent, autonomous materials.








Abstract
Creating materials that can heal themselves while also being strong, stable, and quick to repair presents a major scientific challenge, as existing materials often sacrifice one of these properties for another. To address this limitation, a conductive composite is developed by incorporating ionic liquids into a common plastic. Measurable changes in the material's electrical properties enable damage detection. When a crack is detected, a small electric current is applied to the area, generating localized heat that melts the plastic to seamlessly seal the damage. This process is integrated with an artificial intelligence (AI) system that autonomously detects damage, triggers healing, and confirms repair completion. By establishing a complete perception&#8208;healing&#8208;feedback loop, this work realizes the conceptual leap from self&#8208;healing to smart&#8208;healing, pioneering a new generation of autonomous materials.

         <title>Ionizable Coenzyme&#8208;Engineered Lipid/Fiber Microplexes Boost Ribosomal Translation to Improve mRNA Therapy for Degenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an injectable ionizable coenzyme Q10 (iCoQ10)&#8208;engineered lipid/fiber microplexes&#160;formulation is developed for mRNA therapy targeting degenerative diseases. iCoQ10 can substitute for conventional ionizable lipids to achieve stable mRNA loading. More importantly, after endocytosis, it rapidly re&#8208;functionalizes the inner mitochondrial membrane, inhibits the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and suppresses eIF2&#945; phosphorylation to enhance ribosomal translation during mRNA delivery. This platform provides a novel strategy for mRNA therapy in degenerative diseases.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction&#8208;mediated ribosomal translation suppression is a hallmark of aging and a major driver of degenerative diseases, limiting mRNA therapy efficacy. Here, ionizable coenzyme Q10 (iCoQ10)&#8208;engineered lipid/fiber microplexes (iCLNP@SF) are developed that restore the mitochondrial&#8208;ribosomal axis to enhance mRNA translation. iCoQ10 replaces conventional ionizable lipids to form prodrugged lipid nanoparticles (iCLNP), stabilized by injectable polydopamine&#8209;modified short fibers for in situ administration. In vitro efficacy assessments showed that iCLNP@SF synergistically enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and mRNA translation in senescent cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that iCLNP stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, suppressed cGAS&#8208;STING activation, and reduced eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, thereby enhancing translation. In vivo, iCLNP@SF delivery of Gas6 mRNA increased hair follicle density by &#8776;50% in an androgenetic alopecia mouse model, while Runx2 mRNA delivery raised new bone formation (BV/TV) to &#8776;40% in defect models, both markedly outperforming conventional LNPs. Together, these findings highlight a strategy that improves mRNA therapy for degenerative diseases.

         <title>Exciton Localization Engineering in Thermally Evaporated Yb&#8208;Doped CsPbCl3 Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research paper presents the fabrication of CsPbCl3:Yb near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR&#8208;LEDs) via a thermal evaporation process. Bound excitons are designed and incorporated into the CsPbCl3:Yb film to facilitate the rapid and efficient transport of carriers. This design helped greatly enhance the device performance, ultimately achieving an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.9% and a radiance of 410 mW&#183;Sr&#8722;1&#183;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission underpins biomedical imaging, night vision, and optical communication. Yb3+&#8208;doped CsPbCl3 have demonstrated ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yields via quantum cutting, primarily enabled by a singular defect&#8208;assisted energy transfer pathway arising from the substitution of Pb2+ by Yb3+. However, whether additional pathways exist to facilitate visible (VIS)&#8208;to&#8208;NIR conversion, thereby further enhancing the performance of NIR&#8208;emissive devices, remains an open and compelling question. Here, strategic engineering of localized bound excitons (BEs) is proposed in the thermally evaporated CsPbCl3:Yb system. Assisted BEs significantly promote energy transfer from CsPbCl3 matrix to Yb dopants, unveiling a previously unknown excitonic energy transfer channel. Atomic&#8208;scale characterization combined with first&#8208;principles calculations uncovers a BE&#8208;driven excitonic transfer mechanism, specifically implicating Cs&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defects in mediating exciton behavior. These insights lead to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;LEDs with an 8.9% external quantum efficiency and 410 mW&#183;Sr&#8722;1&#183;m&#8722;2 radiance, marking a breakthrough in thermally evaporated NIR (&gt;950&#160;nm) light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Ductile Inorganic Ferromagnetic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current plastic inorganic semiconductors remain scarce, with functionalities limited to electrical and thermal properties. Herein, the first ductile inorganic ferromagnetic semiconductor CrSiTe3 with exceptional room&#8208;temperature plasticity (12% tensile strain) and robust ferromagnetism below 34&#160;K is reported. Theoretical calculations reveal that interlayer slip enables deformability while preserving magnetic order. This study significantly expands the functionality of plastic inorganic semiconductors. 








Abstract
Ductile/Plastic inorganic semiconductors have garnered significant attention for their potential in flexible electronics, yet their current diversity remains limited, with functionalities largely confined to thermal and/or electrical properties. Here, the first intrinsically ductile/plastic inorganic ferromagnetic semiconductor, bulk CrSiTe3 van der Waals (vdW) crystals, which combine excellent deformability with ferromagnetism, is reported. Mechanical characterization reveals excellent plasticity at room temperature, with CrSiTe3 crystals sustaining up to 12% tensile strain, surpassing many existing plastic bulk vdW semiconductors. Below the Curie temperature of 34&#160;K, the material retains ferromagnetic ordering, with plasticity exerting negligible effects on Curie temperature or saturation magnetization. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute the exceptional deformability to low interlayer slip energy barriers and high cleavage energy within Te&#8208;terminated vdW layers, enabling interlayer gliding without fracture. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that interlayer slip minimally perturbs magnetic interactions, preserving ferromagnetism. This work bridges the gap between mechanical plasticity, semiconductivity, and ferromagnetism in a single material, extending the functionality of plastic inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Enhanced High&#8208;Precision Wind Field Concurrent Triboelectric Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered MVTS enables 360&#176; wind sensing via vortex&#8208;induced vibration, magnetic tuning, and triboelectric transduction. Dual&#8208;channel frequency decoding and a Regression Transformer achieve &lt;5% wind speed and &lt;1&#176; direction errors. Material and charge stability are enhanced via interface optimization and electrostatic compensation. The system shows robust performance under &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C and sandstorm conditions, offering an integrated solution for intelligent wind monitoring in harsh environments.








Abstract
Reliable and real&#8208;time wind field sensing is critical for environmental monitoring and distributed meteorological forecasting. However, conventional solutions often suffer from structural complexity and poor adaptability to harsh environments. In this work, a magneto&#8208;vortex triboelectric sensing system (MVTS) is developed by coupling a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a vortex&#8208;induced vibration (VIV) structure and magnetically reinforced elastic elements. The system converts wind&#8208;induced oscillations into electrical signals and supports full 360&#176; wind direction decoding through a dual&#8208;channel frequency difference mechanism. Material&#8208;level optimization using FEP, nylon, and rabbit&#8208;fur electrostatic compensation enhances environmental resilience and long&#8208;term signal stability. A deep learning model, Regression Transformer (ReT), is constructed to extract temporal and frequency domain features from multichannel TENG signals, enabling high&#8208;accurate prediction of wind speed and direction.

&lt;p&gt;A self-powered MVTS enables 360&#176; wind sensing via vortex-induced vibration, magnetic tuning, and triboelectric transduction. Dual-channel frequency decoding and a Regression Transformer achieve &amp;lt;5% wind speed and &amp;lt;1&#176; direction errors. Material and charge stability are enhanced via interface optimization and electrostatic compensation. The system shows robust performance under &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C and sandstorm conditions, offering an integrated solution for intelligent wind monitoring in harsh environments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliable and real-time wind field sensing is critical for environmental monitoring and distributed meteorological forecasting. However, conventional solutions often suffer from structural complexity and poor adaptability to harsh environments. In this work, a magneto-vortex triboelectric sensing system (MVTS) is developed by coupling a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a vortex-induced vibration (VIV) structure and magnetically reinforced elastic elements. The system converts wind-induced oscillations into electrical signals and supports full 360&#176; wind direction decoding through a dual-channel frequency difference mechanism. Material-level optimization using FEP, nylon, and rabbit-fur electrostatic compensation enhances environmental resilience and long-term signal stability. A deep learning model, Regression Transformer (ReT), is constructed to extract temporal and frequency domain features from multichannel TENG signals, enabling high-accurate prediction of wind speed and direction. Controlled indoor experiments confirm a maximum wind speed error of 0.69&#160;m&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with prediction errors consistently below 5% and a wind direction error within 1&#176;. Additional validations under &#8722;28&#160;&#176;C low-temperature conditions and wind-sand environments demonstrate the system's robust operation and strong environmental adaptability.

         <title>Quantum Size Effect Synergizes Space&#8208;Limited Domain Action for Advanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>

A functionalized MOF, Al&#8208;TCPP(Fe), featuring micropores and Fe&#8208;N4 sites, acts as a superior iodine host for aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. This dual&#8208;function design synergistically confines polyiodides and catalyzes iodine redox through quantum&#8208;size&#8208;tuned Fe&#8208;N4 sites. The resulting battery achieves a remarkable cycling stability of over 54&#160;000 cycles at 50C and is demonstrated in a scalable 1.6 Ah flexible pouch cell, offering a new strategy for long&#8208;life energy storage.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs) demonstrate immense potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their high theoretical capacity, resource abundance, and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hampered by the notorious polyiodide shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, an Al&#8208;TCPP(Fe) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) is designed and synthesized with specific functional sites as an advanced iodine host. The unique microporous structure of this MOF provides significant spatial confinement, which effectively suppresses the dissolution and migration of polyiodide intermediates, thereby mitigating the shuttle effect. Furthermore, precisely engineered Fe&#8208;N4 catalytic sites embedded within the MOF framework induce a quantum size effect under nanoscale confinement, which significantly modulates the electronic structure of the Fe sites, dramatically accelerating the iodine redox kinetics. Benefiting from these structural merits, the resulting I2@Al&#8208;TCPP(Fe) cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 210.95 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1C, achieves an ultralong cycling lifespan of over 54&#160;000 cycles at a high rate of 50C, and enables the fabrication of an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level pouch cell. This work highlights a synergistic strategy of coupling the quantum size effect with spatial confinement to engineer advanced MOF&#8208;based hosts, paving the way for developing high&#8208;performance, long&#8208;lifespan aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Novel Sodium Rare Earth Silicate Solid Electrolyte with Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for Ultra&#8208;Durable Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>

Herein, a facile grain boundary modification strategy is conducted by introducing a second phase of Na1.5Y2.5F9 into the grain boundaries of the Na5YSi4O12 solid electrolyte. Thus, ultra&#8208;durable solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries are achieved.








Abstract
Sodium rare earth silicate is regarded as a novel and promising solid electrolyte (SE) for solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SSSMBs) because the merits of high ionic conductivity, low sintering temperature, and excellent chemical stability. However, impurity phases and voids induced by sintering always cause weak ion conduction and large electron conduction at grain boundaries, resulting in the growth of Na dendrites. Herein, a facile grain boundary modification strategy is conducted by introducing a second phase of Na1.5Y2.5F9 into the grain boundaries of Na5YSi4O12. The Na1.5Y2.5F9 phase can not only effectively impede the migration of electrons and reduce the bulk resistance and grain boundary resistance, but also improve the densification and mechanical strength of SE. Consequently, the Na/Na symmetric cell delivers a large critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 9000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.05 mAh cm&#8722;2 without dendrite formation. Moreover, the assembled full cell achieves excellent cycling stability at 1 C for 750 cycles with a capacity retention of 70.2% and enhanced rate capability of 113.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 C. This work lays a foundation to develop high&#8208;performance sodium rare earth silicate&#8208;based SE for ultra&#8208;durable SSSMBs.

The multi&#8208;functional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are proposed to address the critical issues of compositional heterogeneity and ion migration in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites for highly efficient and consistently stable pure&#8208;red emission.








Abstract
The bromine/iodine mixed halide perovskites have been extensively employed for pure&#8208;red emission. However, the issues of compositional heterogeneity and halide ion migration result in impure emission and compromised stability and efficiency for the perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Herein, a novel approach is proposed by incorporating multi&#8208;functional graphene quantum dots (GQDs) into the perovskites to address these critical problems. The new principles of composition reconstruction, perovskite phase isolation, and halide ion immobilization are revealed to address the unique and synergistic role of GQDs in achieving homogeneous perovskite films and suppressing halide ion migration, and clarify the formation of strong coordination and hydrogen bonding interaction between GQDs and the perovskites. As a result, high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red PeLEDs that showcase a fantastic efficiency of 27.9% with a narrow emission at 640&#160;nm and a remarkable lifetime of 110.3&#160;h with consistently stable EL spectra during tests, representing one of the best&#8208;performing pure&#8208;red PeLEDs, are demonstrated. This strategy contributes an effective approach to solve the critical concerns in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites for stable and efficient pure&#8208;red PeLEDs for the community.

This work designs a hybrid hygroelectric generator with enhanced electricity generation by synergistic water transport and ion migration in the multilayer structure. The device achieves a high voltage above 1.4 V in a wide range of humidity (0&#8211;85%) and an ultra&#8208;high current of 1.15 mA (4.6 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2) at 85% relative humidity.








Abstract
Hygroelectricity, converting chemical potential energy of abundant moisture from the atmosphere into electricity, is one of the most promising technologies in the development of next&#8208;generation sustainable energy. Here, a uniquely designed hygroelectric generator is proposed with a stable self&#8208;maintained water gradient and enhanced electricity generation by synergistic water transport in the multilayer structure, which boosts voltage and current outputs simultaneously as well as demonstrates a low environmental reliance. The devised multilayer structure facilitates charge separation of functional groups and boosts interfacial reactions with top electrodes, which first enabled a high voltage above 1.4&#160;V in a wide range of humidity (0&#8211;85%) and an ultra&#8208;high current of 1.15&#160;mA (4.6 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2) at 85% relative humidity due to hybrid energy contribution. The rechargeable moisture battery is achieved based on a hygroelectric generator and delivered a high Coulombic efficiency of 106%. The hygroelectric devices with high outputs are integrated into the self&#8208;powered systems to charge a commercial mobile phone and achieve wearable human activity monitoring.

&lt;p&gt;This work designs a hybrid hygroelectric generator with enhanced electricity generation by synergistic water transport and ion migration in the multilayer structure. The device achieves a high voltage above 1.4 V in a wide range of humidity (0&#8211;85%) and an ultra-high current of 1.15 mA (4.6 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 85% relative humidity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hygroelectricity, converting chemical potential energy of abundant moisture from the atmosphere into electricity, is one of the most promising technologies in the development of next-generation sustainable energy. Here, a uniquely designed hygroelectric generator is proposed with a stable self-maintained water gradient and enhanced electricity generation by synergistic water transport in the multilayer structure, which boosts voltage and current outputs simultaneously as well as demonstrates a low environmental reliance. The devised multilayer structure facilitates charge separation of functional groups and boosts interfacial reactions with top electrodes, which first enabled a high voltage above 1.4&#160;V in a wide range of humidity (0&#8211;85%) and an ultra-high current of 1.15&#160;mA (4.6 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at 85% relative humidity due to hybrid energy contribution. The rechargeable moisture battery is achieved based on a hygroelectric generator and delivered a high Coulombic efficiency of 106%. The hygroelectric devices with high outputs are integrated into the self-powered systems to charge a commercial mobile phone and achieve wearable human activity monitoring. Therefore, this work opens a bright prospect in achieving extremely high outputs with a low environmental reliance for sustainable energy generation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Efficient and Stable Triboelectric Nanogenerator Materials Based on Electrostatic Attraction Between Biomass and Metal Oxides for UAV Flight Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study is the first to report the preparation of biomass&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators by using the electrostatic attraction between positively charged CQAS and negatively charged oxygen&#8208;rich regions in metal oxides. Improve triboelectric electrical performance and environmental stability, and achieve unmanned aerial vehicle control.








Abstract
Biomass&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted attention in the fields of biomedical and wearable electronics. This study formed three stable frictional electric films, namely chitosan quaternary ammonium salt(CQAS)/Sc2O3, CQAS/MnO2, and CQAS/ZnO, through electrostatic attraction between positively charged CQAS and electron&#8208;rich oxygen atoms in metal oxides. Molecular dynamics simulations show negative interfacial binding energy, indicating structural stability. Density functional theory confirms the accumulation of electrons near oxygen atoms, especially in ZnO, where the average oxygen electron is &#8722;0.89, forming a strong negative potential. The electric hysteresis loop of CQAS/ZnO exhibits the best closure, and its potential shift response is stable. The leakage current of CQAS/ZnO is the lowest, at 37.2 &#181;A, indicating that ZnO easily forms a more stable structure with CQAS through electrostatic attraction. CQAS/ZnO exhibits the best triboelectric electrical performance, with an open circuit voltage of 1260&#160;V and a transferred charge density of 11.50 nC&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work proposes a theoretical model that supports the pairing of metal oxides and polymers, improving the triboelectric electrical performance and increasing the device quality factor of the TENGs from 0.26 for pure CQAS to 1.0, an increase of 3.85 times. Efficient energy conversion and human&#8208;machine interaction are achieved.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Phase Engineering of CuCo Nanoparticles for Enhanced Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8208;Co3Cu heterogeneous structure, constructed by means of in situ photoreduction, demonstrates highly efficient and durable catalytic performance for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation reactions through the development of a phase engineering strategy. As verified by experimental observations and theoretical simulations, the phase engineering strategy introduces dual&#8208;functional catalytic centers that enhance photothermal conversion, promoting CO2 and H2 activation and improving CO selectivity.








Abstract
Photothermal CO2 hydrogenation is a promising approach for the conversion and valorization of CO2 into value&#8208;added products. However, challenges remain in balancing catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, particularly for non&#8208;noble metal catalysts. In this work, a phase engineering strategy is introduced to synthesize CuCo heterophase nanoparticles via in situ photoreduction of oxide precursors under CO2 hydrogenation conditions. Experimental characterization reveals that the abundant Cu&#8208;Co3Cu interfaces act as atomic&#8208;level channels for photoelectron transfer and localized hot charge accumulation. These features synergistically improve full&#8208;spectrum light utilization and photothermal conversion efficiency. The optimal catalyst achieves a CO yield of 0.82&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under 3 W cm&#8722;2 full&#8208;spectrum light illumination and maintains &#8776;95% selectivity across 100 cycles. In situ spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations suggests that the phase engineering enhances CO2 adsorption and activation while weakening CO binding, thereby suppressing methanation and enabling an optimal Sabatier balance. This interfacial engineering approach in heterophase nanostructures improves both stability and activity of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts in CO2 conversion and offers an effective pathway for developing efficient photothermal systems through rational interfacial engineering.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Synthesis of V2O5 Single Crystals for Ultrahigh Doping of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, by synthesizing centimetre&#8208;sized V2O5 bulk single crystal and inch&#8208;sized V2O5 single crystalline films as 2D dopants, it successfully achieves uniform and efficient hole doping of graphene and TMDs, while preserving high carrier mobility. This approach offers a reliable method for constructing high&#8208;quality 2D heterostructures, enabling scalable integration of 2D materials into high&#8208;speed electronic and photonic devices.








Abstract
The controllable growth of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline 2D materials is foundational for future electronic and photonic applications. Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer integration enables the fabrication of 2D heterostructure with multiple functionalities, such as doping of 2D materials, which enhances the conductivity and tunes work function to improve electrical contacts. The synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline 2D dopants enables subsequent integration with other 2D materials, which can avoid lattice defects and interface scattering centers typically associated with heteroatom doping or amorphous dopant. However, the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline 2D dopants remains unexplored. Here, this study reports an effective approach to synthesize centimetre&#8208;sized V2O5 bulk single&#8208;crystal and inch&#8208;sized V2O5 single&#8208;crystalline films, which can efficiently dope graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Interfacing graphene with single&#8208;crystalline V2O5 enables hole doping of graphene, achieving a carrier density of &#8776;1013 cm&#8722;2 and carrier mobility of &#8776;4400 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The preservation of carrier mobility of graphene is enabled by a defect&#8208;free interface and large energies of surface optical phonon modes of V2O5. Combined with reliable wafer&#8208;scale synthesis and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking techniques for fabricating 2D materials/V2O5 heterostructure, the results provide a scalable method for uniform, stable and efficient doping, facilitating the integration of 2D heterostructure into high&#8208;speed logic circuits and photonics for optical communications.

         <title>Wrinkled Layered Sulfide With Tunable Channels Unlocks Precision in Rare Earth Extraction From Radioactive Wastewater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A revolutionary crystalline sulfide, GaSbS&#8208;1, emerges from the precise stacking of wrinkled layers governed by LEP&#8208;coordinated Sb3+ centers. This material features tunable channels, enabling dynamic interlayer expansion that enhances ion&#8208;exchange capacity toward large, hydrated rare earth cations. With record kinetics, selectivity, and removal efficiency, GaSbS&#8208;1 establishes a new benchmark for safeguarding water systems from radioactive contamination.








Abstract
Dimensionally adjustable channels are incorporated into a crystalline lattice via strategic stacking of wrinkled layers, boosting rare earth element (REE) ion exchange performance due to the eliminated energy&#8208;intensive dehydration and channel rigidity. In [(CH3)2NH2]2Ga2Sb2S7 (GaSbS&#8208;1), the lone electron pair (LEP) on Sb3+ in the trigonal pyramidal {SbS3} influences Ga&#9472;S bond orientations, creating wrinkled [Ga2Sb2S7]n2n&#8722; layers. Staggered stacking forms parallel channels occupied by [(CH3)2NH2]+ cations, facilitating outstanding exchange for REE3+ ions (Y3+, La3+&#8722;Lu3+). Dynamic interlamellar expansion endows GaSbS&#8208;1 with remarkable kinetics (R = 97.14%&#8211;99.40% within 5&#160;min; k2 = 2.592&#8211;3.462&#160;g mg&#8722;1 min&#8722;1) and capacities (63, 125, 143, and 138&#160;mg g&#8722;1) for Y3+, Ce3+, Eu3+, and Tm3+. It exhibits structural stability across pH = 2&#8211;12, with Kd values &gt;&#160;104&#8211;105&#160;mL g&#8722;1 at pH = 4&#8211;9, and superior selectivity for REE3+ over competing ions. Performance remains robust in real aqueous environments, including sea water, with maximum REE3+ removal rates &gt;90%.

     alt="Wrinkled Layered Sulfide With Tunable Channels Unlocks Precision in Rare Earth Extraction From Radioactive Wastewater"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A revolutionary crystalline sulfide, &lt;b&gt;GaSbS-1&lt;/b&gt;, emerges from the precise stacking of wrinkled layers governed by LEP-coordinated Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; centers. This material features tunable channels, enabling dynamic interlayer expansion that enhances ion-exchange capacity toward large, hydrated rare earth cations. With record kinetics, selectivity, and removal efficiency, &lt;b&gt;GaSbS-1&lt;/b&gt; establishes a new benchmark for safeguarding water systems from radioactive contamination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimensionally adjustable channels are incorporated into a crystalline lattice via strategic stacking of wrinkled layers, boosting rare earth element (REE) ion exchange performance due to the eliminated energy-intensive dehydration and channel rigidity. In [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;GaSbS-1&lt;/b&gt;), the lone electron pair (LEP) on Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the trigonal pyramidal {SbS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} influences Ga&#9472;S bond orientations, creating wrinkled [Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layers. Staggered stacking forms parallel channels occupied by [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, facilitating outstanding exchange for REE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Lu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). Dynamic interlamellar expansion endows &lt;b&gt;GaSbS-1&lt;/b&gt; with remarkable kinetics (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = 97.14%&#8211;99.40% within 5&#160;min; &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;

It exhibits structural stability across pH = 2&#8211;12, with &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; values &amp;gt;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mL g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at pH = 4&#8211;9, and superior selectivity for REE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; over competing ions. Performance remains robust in real aqueous environments, including sea water, with maximum REE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; removal rates &amp;gt;90%.

Addressing the scarcity of wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donors, this work develops a novel electron&#8208;accepting unit (BCE) via chlorination/esterification of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8220;:6,5&#8208;b&#8221;']trithiophene. Copolymerized with classical electron&#8208;donating unit (BDTT), an optimized copolymer, PBCE&#8208;2, demonstrates pronounced temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation characteristics and suitable energy levels. Finally, the PBCE&#8208;2&#8208;based device delivers an extremely high PCE of 20.4%, establishing PBCE&#8208;2 as a benchmark donor in the elite &#8220;20% Efficiency Club.&#8221;








Abstract
In the realm of high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), the scarcity of wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor materials poses a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, an innovative breakthrough is made by introducing a chlorine atom and an ester group into the benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:6,5&#8208;b&#8243;]trithiophene unit, namely BCE. Using BCE as the electron&#8208;accepting unit, benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene derivative (BDTT) as the electron&#8208;donating unit, and alkyl&#8208;substituted thiophene as the bridging unit, a new class of D&#8211;A type alternating conjugated polymers are successfully synthesized. Subsequently, after systematic optimizations of the side chain length of the BDTT unit and the proportion of fluorinated BDTT, a polymer donor material, PBCE&#8208;2 is ultimately obtained, which exhibits excellent solution processability, suitable energy levels, and temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation characteristics. The binary OSC based on PBCE&#8208;2 and the well&#8208;known acceptor L8&#8208;BO demonstrates an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.2%. When a fullerene acceptor, PC71BM, is incorporated to construct a ternary OSC, the corresponding PCE is further elevated to 20.4%. This achievement marks PBCE&#8208;2 as another promising polymer donor that has joined the exclusive &#8220;20% Efficiency Club,&#8221; following in the footsteps of notable&#160;polymer donors such as PM6, D18, and their derivatives.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Heterojunctions with Reversibly Photoactivated Structure Shift Alternately Decode Photocatalytic H2 Burst and Cascade Catalytic ROS Birth to Repress Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based dual&#8208;heterojunctions, i.e., N&#8208;doped carbon nanoribbons (N&#8208;CNB)/g&#8208;C3N4 and core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Au@Pd nanoparticles/g&#8208;C3N4, respectively, are constructed to decode alternate H2/ROS therapy.








Abstract
Single or combined ROS therapy will induce cancer resistance after long&#8208;term medication cure. Although currently concurrent H2/ROS therapy is a promising method, the mutual reaction between H2 and ROS dampens their efficiency. To address this issue, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based dual&#8208;heterojunctions, i.e., N&#8208;doped carbon nanoribbons (N&#8208;CNB)/g&#8208;C3N4 and core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured Au@Pd nanoparticles/g&#8208;C3N4, respectively, are constructed to decode alternate H2/ROS therapy. Therein, N&#8208;CNB/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunctions enhance near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoabsorption to unlock photocatalytic H2 evolution, and Au@Pd/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunctions unlock the inherent and newly&#8208;emerging bioenzymes&#8208;like catalytic ROS birth. In this alternate H2/ROS therapy, photocatalytic H2 evolution and multienzymically&#8208;catalytic ROS birth are alternately decoded under NIR &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221;, respectively, because the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered structural shift insensitive to photothermal effects is reversible in response to NIR &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221;, displaying a temporal controllability. The alternate H2/ROS therapy expedites the infiltrations and intratumoral proliferation of anti&#8208;tumor immune cells including CTLs and Th17, hampers the infiltrations of exhausted CD8+ T cells and Tregs, and downregulates resistance&#8208;associated proteins (PARP, EpCAM, and CD133). These actions cooperatively activate robust immune responses, attenuate anti&#8208;tumor immunity confinements, and cancer resistance to suppress common and Sorafenib&#8208;induced resistant liver cancer. This work offers distinctive insights into cancer resistance removal.

         <title>Regenerative Hydrovoltaic Power Generator with Remarkable Duration and Fast Power Generation Achieved by Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>

A biomass&#8208;derived processing strategy forms the Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex that realizes fast power generation and long&#8208;term duration as a hydrovoltaic power generator.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic power generators (HPGs) are pivotal for addressing the global energy crisis. However, most prevalent HPGs suffer from a conflict: either generating transient electricity or sustaining long&#8208;term output reliant on a continuous water supply, which would rapidly decay without water input, especially under low humidity. This severely restricts their environmental adaptability and durability, while the recyclability of HPGs is also highly concerned for reducing electronic waste. Herein, this work pioneers a biomass&#8208;derived processing strategy that forms a &#8220;Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex&#8221; (DEBC) via direct combining biomass macromolecules with choline chloride. The strategy constructed a stable yet sensitive hydrogen&#8208;bonded network that endows DEBC simultaneously realizing fast power generation and long&#8208;term duration as HPG. DEBC exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity to external humidity changes (&#8710;R/R&#8320;&#8776;265&#160;000%) and can spontaneously induce Grotthuss proton hopping under moisture flow, leading to rapid voltage generation (113.8 &#177; 11.5&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1). It also demonstrates exceptional durability that maintains an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc&#8805; 400 &#160;mV) at 30%RH for over 10500 s without water input, and sustains Voc in an open environment for 25 days during winter. This work proposes a feasible access for designing renewable HPG with superior durability and environmental adaptability, tackling the operational limitations and sustainability concerns.

&lt;p&gt;A biomass-derived processing strategy forms the Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex that realizes fast power generation and long-term duration as a hydrovoltaic power generator.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrovoltaic power generators (HPGs) are pivotal for addressing the global energy crisis. However, most prevalent HPGs suffer from a conflict: either generating transient electricity or sustaining long-term output reliant on a continuous water supply, which would rapidly decay without water input, especially under low humidity. This severely restricts their environmental adaptability and durability, while the recyclability of HPGs is also highly concerned for reducing electronic waste. Herein, this work pioneers a biomass-derived processing strategy that forms a &#8220;Deep Eutectic Biomass Complex&#8221; (DEBC) via direct combining biomass macromolecules with choline chloride. The strategy constructed a stable yet sensitive hydrogen-bonded network that endows DEBC simultaneously realizing fast power generation and long-term duration as HPG. DEBC exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity to external humidity changes (&#8710;R/R&#8320;&#8776;265&#160;000%) and can spontaneously induce Grotthuss proton hopping under moisture flow, leading to rapid voltage generation (113.8 &#177; 11.5&#160;mV&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). It also demonstrates exceptional durability that maintains an open-circuit voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;&#8805; 400 &#160;mV) at 30%RH for over 10500 s without water input, and sustains V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; in an open environment for 25 days during winter. This work proposes a feasible access for designing renewable HPG with superior durability and environmental adaptability, tackling the operational limitations and sustainability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrothermal Lattice Metamaterials for Concurrent Electric and Thermal Fields Control of Dual&#8208;Functional Meta&#8208;Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable electrothermal lattice metamaterial (ETLM) is proposed to simultaneously manipulate thermal and electrical fields via geometric reconfiguration. This versatile platform enables cloaking, concentration, and rotation, offering a unified design strategy for next&#8208;generation smart thermal management, adaptive electronics, and multifunctional field control in both micro&#8208;scale and macro&#8208;scale systems.








Abstract
Programmable electrothermal metamaterials offer a unified platform for the tailorable and concurrent control of electric and thermal fields, overcoming the inherent limitations of static multifunctional designs. However, independently manipulating these two intrinsically coupled fields remains a fundamental challenge, especially within systems constrained by fixed material properties or geometry&#8208;bound configurations. Here, an electrothermal lattice metamaterial (ETLM) system is proposed that enables concurrent control of electric and thermal field distributions through lattice geometrical patterns. By adopting a modular design strategy, the ETLM enables simultaneous shaping of electric and thermal fields via programmable lattice arrangements. Unlike traditional dual&#8208;field metamaterials, the ETLM supports a wide spectrum of field manipulations&#8212;including cloaking, concentration, and rotation&#8212;across both domains, all governed by a unified topological framework. Furthermore, through numerical simulations, spatial symmetry breaking and dynamically tailorable field states by locally adjusting lattice units and introducing anisotropic motifs are achieved. To validate these capabilities, metal&#8208;based 3D printing is leveraged to fabricate various ETLM configurations and experimentally demonstrated robust and simultaneous control of electric and thermal fields. This work establishes a geometry&#8208;driven paradigm for adaptive electrothermal control, offering powerful tools for intelligent energy systems, field&#8208;responsive electronics, and programmable meta&#8208;devices under complex multi&#8208;physical conditions.

         <title>An Ultrapotent, Ultraeconomical, Antifreeze Polypeptide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and inexpensive polypeptides composed of random copolymers of alanine and glutamic acid are effective antifreezes for applications in foods and biomedicine. The polypeptides, inspired by natural extremophile proteins, inhibit the growth of large ice crystals and prevent damage to sensitive biologics.








Abstract
The growth of large ice crystals during freeze and thaw events is a challenge in diverse settings from transportation and agriculture to foods and biomedicine. Design, synthesis, and evaluation of antifreeze polypeptides that inhibit ice crystal growth at &#181;g concentrations are reported herein. The polypeptides, composed of Ala and Glu, are prepared using economical methodology, are stable after thermal events, are biodegradable, and are nontoxic to human cells. Mirror&#8208;image polypeptides have resisted degradation and are suitable for applications with a longevity criterion. Their &#945;&#8208;helical conformation plays a role in antifreeze activity, but chirality does not. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments, the antifreeze polypeptides could prevent damage to model protein therapeutics during repeated freeze&#8211;thaw cycles and could be applied to prevent large ice crystals in a frozen food product. These simple, economical Ala/Glu polypeptides are promising materials for diverse antifreeze applications, particularly in biological settings.

         <title>Expanded InSe Crystal Structure with Reduced Intrinsic Defects for High&#8208;Performance Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a novel InSe crystal grown on the China Space Station, exhibiting an expanded lattice structure and reduced defects. These lattice variations contribute to unique electronic characteristics and facilitate carrier transport, significantly boosting electrical and photoelectrical performance. The findings offer valuable insights for developing promising electronic materials in the post&#8208;Moore era.









Abstract
Intrinsic defect plays a crucial role in the electrical and photoelectrical performance of InSe&#8208;based FETs. Here, a space&#8208;growth InSe on China Space Station with reduced intrinsic defects is reported and high&#8208;performance InSe field&#8208;effect transistors are developed. Spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscope analysis reveals that the space grown InSe presents lattice expansion of 1.29% along the intralayer direction (a,b plane) and 3.65% along the interlayer direction (c&#8208;axis). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the defect generation energy of expanded space InSe is larger than that of ground InSe, improving lattice integrity. The lattice variations in space InSe contribute to unique electronic properties with a narrower bandgap, smaller effective mass of electrons, and increased electronic states near the Fermi level, which reduces carrier scattering and facilitates electron transport. Space InSe FET presents better electrical characteristics (Ion of 6.0&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1, on/off ratio of 108 and hysteresis voltage of 0.6&#160;V) and photoelectrical performance (responsivity of 5316&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 1.38 &#215; 1012 Jones) than the ground InSe FET, in which InSe is grown on the ground. This study provides unique insights into the investigation of crystal structure and promotes the development of high&#8208;performance 2D FETs.

         <title>Robust Organic Photovoltaic Ternary Strategy Pairing Tunable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning the blend ratio of L8&#8208;BO to mBZS&#8208;4F acceptors in ternary OSCs, the bandgap is adjustable to match various wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite top subcells with a bandgap ranging from 1.80&#8211;1.88&#160;eV. This strategy enables high&#8208;performance P/OTSCs, with efficiencies over 25.5%, in which the best&#8208;performing tandem device achieves an impressive 26.08% efficiency.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (P/OTSCs) have attracted wide attention. However, insufficient near&#8208;infrared absorption of organic bottom subcells and poor compatibility with perovskite top subcells restrict their further development. Here, a ternary strategy of combining near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing mBZS&#8208;4F and crystalline L8&#8208;BO as mixed acceptors along with D18 donor is proposed to form an organic bottom absorber. This approach effectively extended the near&#8208;infrared absorption to 970&#160;nm while maintaining low voltage loss (0.54&#160;eV). By adjusting the L8&#8208;BO:mBZS&#8208;4F ratio to 2:1, a high&#8208;performance OSC is achieved with a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE)&#160;of 20.42% and an outstanding fill factor (FF) of 81.25%. This combination strategy exhibits robust compatibility with a 1.80, 1.86, and 1.88&#160;eV wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite top subcell, enabling their corresponding P/OTSCs with PCEs of 25.82, 25.50, and 26.08%, respectively. The work suggests that such a ternary strategy not only benefits single&#8208;junction OSC performance but also suits a wide range of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite subcells for efficient P/OTSCs.

         <title>Synthesizer: Chemistry&#8208;Aware Machine Learning for Precision Control of Nanocrystal Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, data&#8208;efficient approach to CsPbBr3 nanocrystal optimization combines chemical and physical insights with a Gaussian Process&#8208;based machine learning algorithm. Implementation of the &#8220;Synthesizer&#8221; enables nm&#8208;precise tuning of the emission wavelength while reducing experimental load in optimizing peak narrowness and photoluminescence quantum yield. The method demonstrates adaptability and transferability to other systems, underscoring its potential for broader material optimization.








Abstract
Precise and reproducible control over nanocrystal synthesis is essential for tailoring optical properties, yet remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in halide perovskites. A broadly adoptable machine learning&#8211;guided framework, the Synthesizer, is introduced that combines Gaussian Process regression and Bayesian optimization with chemistry&#8208;aware molecular encodings and systematic feature engineering. Rather than new algorithms, the advance lies in translating interpretable machine learning tools into a practical, benchtop platform for nanocrystal optimization under ambient conditions. Using CsPbBr3 as a model system, nm&#8208;level precision in photoluminescence peak tuning (430&#8201;nm&#8201;to&#8201;520&#8201;nm) is achieved, along with benchmark narrow linewidths down to 70&#8201;meV via lateral confinement control, and robust photoluminescence quantum yield optimization linked to surface trap density. Mapping the two&#8208;dimensional parameter space (Cs/PbBr2 and antisolvent/PbBr2 ratios) across multiple antisolvents enables predictive optimization and identifies the antisolvent/PbBr2 ratio as a previously underappreciated mechanistic parameter, offering a quantitative basis for antisolvent&#8208;accelerated nanocrystal growth. Transfer tests across distinct chemical spaces, including alcohols and cyclopentanone, confirm generalizability to unseen molecules, while application to CsPbI3 demonstrates extension to new material systems. These results establish an adoption&#8208;ready platform for data&#8208;efficient, uncertainty&#8208;aware synthesis design, providing reproducible pathways to accelerate materials discovery beyond halide&#160;perovskites.

         <title>Additively Manufacturable High&#8208;Strength Aluminum Alloys with Coarsening&#8208;Resistant Microstructures Achieved via Rapid Solidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid solidification in laser additive manufacturing facilitates the precipitation of metastable phases in aluminum alloys. These metastable phases significantly enhance the strength by forming a high&#8208;volume fraction of precipitates with an order of magnitude reduced sizes and smaller interspacing, effectively impeding dislocation motion. Consequestly, the strength of the additively manufactured alloy is five times greater than its cast counterpart.








Abstract
Additively manufactured aluminum (Al) alloys with high strength have broad industrial applications. Strength promotion necessitates a high&#8208;volume fraction of small, closely spaced precipitates to effectively impede dislocation motion. Here, it is shown that for certain compositions in the Al&#8208;Er&#8208;Zr&#8208;Y&#8208;Yb&#8208;Ni alloy class, L12&#8208;Al3M phases, the primary strength contributor, can initially precipitate as submicron&#8208;scale (&#8776;100 nm) metastable ternary phases under the rapid solidification of powder bed additive manufacturing; yet the subsequent coarsening&#8208;resistant L12&#8208;Al3M phases that precipitate during heat treatment remain at the nanometer scale, imparting high strength. A candidate alloy is designed using hybrid calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD)&#8208;based integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) and Bayesian optimization algorithms. Powder is manufactured for this alloy and is additively manufactured into crack&#8208;free macroscale specimens with a strength that is five&#8208;fold that of the equivalent cast alloy and comparable to wrought Al 7075. After aging at 400&#160;&#176;C for 8 h, the room&#8208;temperature tensile strength reaches 395 MPa, which is 50% stronger than the best&#8208;known benchmark printable Al alloy. This integrated computational&#8208;experimental workflow shows the considerable potential to exploit rapid solidification in additive manufacturing to design alloys with commercially deployable properties.

         <title>Synergistic Engineering of Nonmagnetic Ions Enables Decoupling of Magnetic Frustration and Structural Dynamics in Cobalt&#8208;Free High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a promising strategy to design high&#8208;performance cobalt&#8208;free high&#8208;nickel cathodes by introducing non&#8208;magnetic ions to suppress magnetic interactions and significantly strengthen metal&#8211;oxygen bonds. Multi&#8208;ion cooperative doping (B&#8211;Al&#8211;W) enables the formation of a fast&#8208;transport layered&#8208;spinel nano&#8208;heterostructure. Additionally, the B&#8208;enriched near&#8208;surface layer effectively stabilizes the interface and inhibits HF erosion.








Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;free high&#8208;nickel layered oxides have emerged as promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to their exceptional capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their large&#8209;scale application remains constrained by intrinsic deficiencies stemming from cobalt absence&#8212;namely, magnetic&#8209;ordering imbalance and sluggish structural dynamics. Here, a synergistic doping strategy involving nonmagnetic ions (B&#8211;Al&#8211;W) is presented to achieve atomic&#8208;scale coordination between bulk lattice stabilization (via Al/W doping) and near&#8208;surface interface passivation (through B enrichment). Precise substitution of non&#8209;magnetic cations effectively mitigates magnetic frustration and superexchange interactions, while strengthened metal&#8211;oxygen bonding alleviates anisotropic lattice strain. Simultaneously, the constructed layered&#8211;spinel mortise and tenon structure significantly enhances Li+ diffusion kinetics. The optimized cathode material delivers a reversible capacity of 162.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, retains 88.6% capacity after 100 cycles at 5 C, and markedly suppresses voltage fade. This work provides a novel design paradigm for the synergistic magnetic&#8211;electrochemical regulation of Co&#8209;free, high&#8208;Ni cathodes in next&#8209;generation, high&#8209;performance LIBs.

         <title>Taming Interfacial Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions With d&#8208;Orbital Delocalized Electron Catalysis Expediates Low&#8208;Temperature Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;dipole interactions within Li(solvents)x+ groups for fast interfacial Li+ desolvation/diffusion and dendrite&#8208;free deposition are reduced by taming various d&#8208;orbital electron&#8208;delocalized catalyzers under the low&#8208;temperature surroundings. Consequently, the cells with weak ion&#8208;dipole interaction delivers long&#8208;term cycling life with high environmental robustness from 25 to &#8722;50&#176;C, and the practical full cell stabilizes excellent capacity retention of &#8776;100% under 0&#176;C.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature lithium metal batteries (LT&#8208;LMBs) are increasingly desired for higher energy density and longer lifespan. However, due to organic electrolyte solidification, LT&#8208;LMBs are impeded by huge barriers resulting from the hindrance of larger solvation shells with strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions, leading to depressive Li kinetics and severe dendrite formation. Herein, interfacial catalysis by constructing electron delocalization d&#8208;orbital metal oxides toward the ion&#8208;dipole interactions is pioneered to accelerate the larger Li(solvents)x+ dissociation under the low&#8208;temperature environment. Specifically, various kinds of d&#8208;orbital metal oxides (M = Ti, V, Fe, Co) with oxygen defect modulation are systematically screened and investigated for breaking the ion&#8208;dipole interactions, and the prototyped titanium oxide with adjustable electron delocalization behave the best, as confirmed by electrochemical and theoretical experiments. Consequently, optimized Li electrodes withstand environmental robustness from 25 to &#8722;50&#176;C, and stabilize long&#8208;term cycling up to 1800 h and high Coulombic efficiency without any short&#8208;circuit under &#8722;20&#176;C. The as&#8208;fabricated Li&#8211;S full cell enables a high&#8208;capacity retention of 88% at 0.2 C over 200 cycles, and the high&#8208;loading Li&#8208;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell (&#8776;20 mg cm&#8722;2) demonstrates excellent capacity retention &#8776;100% under 0&#176;C, providing a new guideline for adopting a catalytic strategy for achieving advanced LT&#8208;LMBs.

The as-fabricated Li&#8211;S full cell enables a high-capacity retention of 88% at 0.2 C over 200 cycles, and the high-loading Li-LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell (&#8776;20 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) demonstrates excellent capacity retention &#8776;100% under 0&#176;C, providing a new guideline for adopting a catalytic strategy for achieving advanced LT-LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Water&#8208;Content yet Robust Hydrogels Enabled by Bioinspired Laminated Membranous Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels with more water&#8208;rich networks are typically less mechanically robust. Here, this issue is addressed by jellyfish mesoglea with a long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered laminated membranous network. Inspired by jellyfish mesoglea, a chitosan hydrogel with laminated membranous network is made by slow solution evaporation and combination of in&#8208;plane stretching and sodium hydroxide treatment, exhibiting high modulus, high strength and ultrahigh water content.








Abstract
Hydrogels, water&#8208;rich polymer networks, are important materials for application as structural biomaterials. More water&#8208;rich networks are typically less mechanically robust, which is manifested as softness and low stress to fracture. Unusually, jellyfish mesoglea exhibits paradoxical combination of high stiffness and strength with ultrahigh water content. Here, it is discovered that jellyfish mesoglea possesses a long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered laminated membranous network, which features crystal orientation along membrane plane and collagen chain spanning at the junction of membranes. Such a laminated membranous network is in favor of resistance to deformation, as well as transmission and dispersion of stress for culminating in good mechanical robustness. Fabrication of chitosan hydrogel with jellyfish mesoglea&#8208;like network is further demonstrated by pre&#8208;constructing a random membranous network via evaporation&#8208;induced phase separation, followed by aligning and crystallizing the membranes via combination of in&#8208;plane stretching and sodium hydroxide treatment. The obtained hydrogel exhibits a combination of high modulus (5.2&#160;MPa) and strength (6.5&#160;MPa) with ultrahigh water content (91.8&#160;wt.%), exceeding that of other synthetic and even biological hydrogels. This work offers not only a structural concept but also a feasible way for making hydrogels that overcome traditional trade&#8208;off between good mechanical robustness and ultrahigh water content.

         <title>Convenient DNA Hydrogel Synthesis via Self&#8208;Templated Primer&#8208;Driven Isothermal Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a template&#8208;free isothermal amplification using a self&#8208;templated primer. This ultrafast isothermal amplification can be initiated within 1 min at 65&#160;&#176;C and completed within 30 min. Besides, this primer can be easily integrated into a DNA self&#8208;assembly module to prepare strength adjustable and multifunctional DNA hydrogel for therapeutic applications.








Abstract
As emerging functional nanomaterials, DNA hydrogels demonstrate considerable potential in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Based on the composition, DNA hydrogels are classified into two distinct categories: those employing DNA molecules as the structural framework (DNA&#8208;framed hydrogels) and those cross&#8208;linked with other framework polymers. DNA&#8208;framed hydrogels demonstrate unique advantages in terms of biocompatibility and immunogenicity. Nevertheless, the lack of functional regulation strategies coupled with excessive preparation costs has significantly hindered research advancement in this field. To address these limitations, a self&#8208;templated primer is specifically designed. Remarkably, without template addition, at merely 50 nm, this primer can immediately trigger ultrafast nucleic acid tandem repeat replication at 65&#160;&#176;C, and the reaction completes in &#8776;30 min. Through the analysis of the reaction mechanism, it is demonstrated that this efficient isothermal amplification strategy is suitable for large&#8208;scale production of DNA nanomaterials. In addition, due to their relatively short length (e.g., 12 nt), self&#8208;templated primers can be easily integrated into DNA self&#8208;assembly modules to prepare strength adjustable and multifunctional DNA&#8208;framed hydrogels for therapeutic applications (e.g., bone tissue regeneration).

         <title>Choline Ionic Liquid for Long&#8208;Term Stable Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choline&#8208;based ionic liquid integrated organic electrochemical transistors (Chol&#8208;OECTs) for improvement of performance and prolonged lifetime is demonstrated. Introduction of the ionic liquid into PEDOT:PSS and gelatin creates choline acetate ionic liquid&#8208;infused PEDOT:PSS (CLiPS) and choline acetate&#8208;gelatin (CAGel) electrolyte. These materials are utilized for 3D array of Chol&#8208;OECTs and biosensors of biological signals for longer than 3 months.








Abstract
A choline&#8208;based ionic liquid is introduced into organic electrochemical transistors(OECTs) to achieve enhanced performance and long&#8208;term stability, and these OECTs can be used for sensing biological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electromyograms (EMGs) for up to 3 months. Spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical characterization focused on the ionic interactions between the choline&#8208;based ionic liquid and PEDOT:PSS, particularly the impact on device operation. Their strong ionic interactions result in enhanced OECT electrical performance, including 80&#160;ns of response time, faster than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. Furthermore, 3D arrays and ultrathin OECTs attached to skin with consistent performance are demonstrated for substantial applicability and potential in research for mapping biological signals of cells or tissues, and integration with wireless systems, enabling remote medical services.

         <title>Engineered Crystalline Heterostructure Interphase Enabling Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anodes with Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel triple&#8208;phase Ag/Ag2Na/Na3PO4 protection layer is fabricated via an in situ reaction between Ag3PO4 and sodium metal. This robust interphase suppresses dendrite growth by combining strong sodiphilicity, high conductivity, and reduced ion diffusion barriers. It enables uniform sodium deposition/stripping, enhancing cycling stability and performance of sodium metal anodes.








Abstract
The advancement of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) critically depends on the development of stable sodium metal anodes (SMAs). However, practical implementation remains hindered by uncontrollable dendritic growth and uneven Na stripping/plating behavior associated with pristine sodium metal. In this study, the design of a robust triphasic heterojunction artificial interphase is reported, formed via a spontaneous in situ reaction between Ag3PO4 and metallic sodium. The resulting Ag2Na/Ag/Na3PO4 interphase synergistically combines metallic, alloy, and ionic phases to simultaneously regulate ion transport and suppress dendrite formation. Specifically, the Ag2Na alloy and metallic Ag components ensure strong interfacial adhesion and enhanced electronic conductivity, while the Na3PO4 phase promotes homogeneous Na&#8314; ion flux and accelerates surface diffusion via its desolvation capability. Benefiting from this engineered interface, the Na/Ag3PO4 anode exhibits a remarkably low nucleation overpotential of 27 mV and delivers stable cycling performance exceeding 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 (1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in symmetric cells. Moreover, a full sodium metal pouch cell incorporating the Na/Ag3PO4 anode achieves a high energy density of 425.5 Wh kg&#8722;1, underscoring the practical viability of this interfacial design for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>Dilute Electrolyte with Vehicular Aggregates for Stable High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dilute electrolyte with a novel vehicular anion&#8211;solvent&#8211;Li&#8314; aggregates (AGG) mechanism is achieved using a pyrrolidine&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonyl fluoride with an optimal steric hindrance. It enables a high ionic conductivity of 4.9 mS cm&#8722;1, excellent Li&#8208;metal compatibility, and stable 4.6 V Li&#8208;metal batteries with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;nickel cathodes, achieving 228.4 mAh g&#8722;1, good rate capability, and cycling stability.








Abstract
Electrolyte design is critical for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) because it dictates the aggressive Li&#8211;electrolyte interphase that governs cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency (CE). However, traditional high&#8208; or locally high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, which achieve good Li&#8208;metal compatibility by the formation of anion&#8210;solvent&#8210;Li+ aggregates (AGG), typically suffer from poor ionic conductivity (e.g., &#8776;1 mS cm&#8722;1). Therefore, achieving both high ionic conductivity and AGG&#8208;dominated solvation structure under dilute conditions still remains a challenge. Herein, a novel dilute electrolyte with vehicular aggregates (DVA) mechanism is proposed by employing pyrrolidine&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonyl fluoride (PSF) solvent with optimal steric hindrance&#160;effect. Based on this DVA electrolyte, the uniquely AGG&#8208;dominated solvation structure under dilute conditions achieve high ionic conductivity (4.9 mS cm&#8722;1) featuring its vehicular ion&#8208;transport mechanism. It&#160;exhibits good Li&#8208;metal compatibility with high stripping&#8208;plating CE of &#8776;99.5% with inorganic (LiF, Li2O)&#8208;rich robust solid&#8210;electrolyte interphase. Furthermore, the electrolyte effectively suppresses the stress&#8208;corrosion cracking, transition&#8208;metal dissolution, gas evolution, and detrimental surface degradation on the cathode side, thus enabling 4.6&#8208;V&#8208;class LMBs with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;Ni cathodes to deliver a high discharge capacity of 228.4 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent rate capability up to 2C, and 87% capacity retention after 150 cycles. This work offers a promising approach for designing advanced electrolytes for high&#8208;energy LMBs.

         <title>Carrier Diffusion Links Single Crystal Quality and Photoluminescence in Halide Perovskite Radiation Detectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tracking bulk carrier diffusion both vertically and laterally, this study links photoluminescence behavior to crystal quality in CsPbBr3 &#947;&#8208;ray detectors. Vertical diffusion governs spectral redshift, with high&#8208;quality crystals exhibiting superior transport, while two&#8208;photon microscopy reveals microscale defects that hinder diffusion in low&#8208;quality crystals. These insights provide a quantitative framework for screening and optimizing crystals for radiation detection.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for next&#8208;generation radiation detectors, echoing their transformative impact on photovoltaics. Due to the long penetration depths of X&#8208;rays and &#947;&#8208;rays, thick single crystals are required to sufficiently attenuate the radiation, making bulk crystal quality critical for device performance. Photoluminescence properties, particularly long lifetimes and redshifted emission peaks, are commonly used as proxies for identifying high&#8208;quality CsPbBr3 crystals for high&#8208;performance detectors, yet the physical origin of this correlation remains unclear. Here, complementary photoluminescence techniques with a full&#8208;spectrum fit are combined to reveal the importance of vertical diffusion in governing photoluminescence response, ultimately shaping detector performance. High&#8208;quality crystals exhibit larger vertical diffusion coefficients (up to 0.65 cm2 s&#8722;1) and lower recombination rates (down to 1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1), leading to diffusion lengths up to 5 times greater than those in low&#8208;quality crystals. Using one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon photoluminescence microscopy, microscale defects are further visualized, with suppressed redshift and distributions throughout the bulk, in low&#8208;quality crystals. Two&#8208;photon diffusion mapping directly reveals how these defects hinder carrier transport. These findings establish a direct link between photoluminescence and carrier diffusion, providing a quantitative framework that connects crystal quality to charge transport and device performance in perovskite radiation detectors.

         <title>Quadruple Helix Inversions of Liquid Crystals Orchestrated by Direct Chirality Transmission of an Intrinsically Chiral Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular motor with four&#8208;state dynamic chirality is integrated into liquid crystals, enabling quadruple sequential helix inversions and high helical twisting power. Due to high motor efficiency, the supramolecular helicity can be controlled by near&#8208;infrared light via upconversion nanoparticles, resulting in a robust, multistate, photoresponsive soft matter. This concept provides new opportunities for programmable photonic smart materials.








Abstract
Endowing liquid crystal (LC) soft matter with stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is pivotal for programmable and dynamic photonics in the next generation of optical materials. However, suitable molecular candidates with intrinsic dynamic chirality that can twist LC helices using external stimuli in a multistate, distinct manner are still very rare. In this study, an elaborately designed intrinsically chiral molecular machine is presented with four&#8208;state dynamic chirality and mesogenic units. This design enables direct chirality transmission, leading to sequential quadruple helix inversions of the LC architecture via unidirectional rotary motion, achieving a high helical twisting power in all states. The inversion of the supramolecular helicity by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is demonstrated by NIR light&#8208;triggered isomerization of the molecular motor structure through an efficient radiative energy transfer pathway from upconversion nanoparticles in the LC film. Hence, these results demonstrate a unique photoresponsive LC system with high robustness, NIR light triggering, and multistate helix tunability with a fascinating potential for constructing smart optical devices.

         <title>Bidentate Anchoring Enables Concurrent Grain Orientation and Lattice Strain Mitigation in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

Bidentate malondiamidine hydrochloride enables oriented crystallization and strain relaxation in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites for 29.0% efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs).








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG&#8208;PSCs) are essential for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, their efficiency and stability are limited by inhomogeneous crystallization, which induces disordered crystal orientation and detrimental lattice strain. Herein, malondiamidine hydrochloride (MAMCl) is introduced as a new ligand that simultaneously controls crystal nucleation orientation and passivates grain boundaries in WBG perovskites while relieving lattice strain. MAMCl's unique molecular structure &#8211; featuring amide and amidine terminal groups connected by a short carbon chain, exhibits strong binding affinity with lead ions, promoting preferential (100)&#8208;oriented nucleation. The ligand's compact molecular structure, devoid of sterically hindering groups, facilitates charge extraction and transport at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface. During thermal processing, MAMCl preferentially anchors at grain boundaries through strong coordination bonding, effectively mitigating lattice strain and enhancing thermal stability. As a result, single&#8208;junction 1.77 eV WBG&#8208;PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.4% with an exceptional open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.369 V. When incorporated into tandem devices, a high PCE of 29.0% (certified 28.06%) is obtained. Notably, the encapsulated all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices retain 93% of initial efficiency after 700 h and over 80% after 1320 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Shear&#8208;Catalyzed Vacancy Engineering Enabling Rapid Synthesis of High&#8208;Crystallinity Magnetite via Microfluidic Ferrous Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative strategy is proposed that induces atomic defects in the intermediate phase through microfluidic shear forces, thereby significantly accelerating the rapid synthesis of high&#8208;crystallinity magnetite. As a result, the synthesis time of magnetite via conventional ferrous oxidation is reduced to just 30 min, demonstrating unprecedented efficiency and exceptional performance.








Abstract
Iron oxides are widely used in environmental and energy applications, with magnetite particularly favored for its excellent crystallinity and strong magnetic properties. However, synthesizing well&#8208;crystalline magnetite typically requires long reaction times due to the slow phase transition kinetics of goethite. Herein, a shear&#8208;catalyzed strategy in microchannels is proposed for the rapid and continuous synthesis of magnetite with excellent crystallinity. The preparation process is completed in just 30&#160;min, a 292&#8208;fold enhancement over batch reactors, which achieve 68.6 wt.% magnetite after 100&#160;h. Additionally, the resulting magnetite shows a significantly higher saturation magnetization of 59.5 emu&#160;g&#8722;1, compared to 48.4 emu&#160;g&#8722;1 from conventional batch reactors. The results demonstrate that Fe vacancies can be induced on goethite by shear stress in microchannels during magnetite nucleation, which not only creates more active sites for Fe2&#8314; adsorption but also significantly lowers Fe2+ diffusion barrier, thereby facilitating the transformation from goethite to magnetite by reducing the energy barrier for Fe2&#8314; migration. Additionally, the applicability is confirmed by the successful rapid synthesis of other oxide nanomaterials (SiO2, MnO2, and ZnO), demonstrating its versatility.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Phosphates Conformal Coating Enabling 5.0 V Graphite Cathodes Over 10,000 Cycles via Reinforced Mechanical Strength and Optimized Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;dependent phosphate conformal coating capable of effectively suppressing the electrolyte decomposition and considerably enhancing the mechanical stability of graphite cathode via a bonding interaction with binder enables 5.0 V graphite cathodes over 10,000 cycles with an exceptional capacity retention of 80.7% in dual&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) composed of a graphite cathode and a lithium anode are promising candidates for high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power energy storage systems. However, graphite cathode undergoes rapid failure during the extended cycling and rapid charge/discharge mainly because of its structural breakdown and drastic resistance rise of cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) arising from the violent electrolyte decomposition at high voltage (4.5&#8211;5.0 V). Unlike the mainstream CEI modification strategy solely solving the problem of electrolyte decomposition, this work proposes a bifunctional CEI construction strategy that not only inhibits the electrolyte decomposition but also enhances the mechanical stability of graphite cathodes. Three pH&#8208;variable phosphates (LiH2PO4, Li2HPO4 and Li3PO4) are artificially coated on the surface of natural graphite (NG) particles through a green and low&#8208;cost wet coating route. The acidic LiH2PO4 coating not only effectively suppresses the electrolyte decomposition through the formation of a conformal coating layer, but also considerably enhances the mechanical strength of NG cathode via a strong bonding between LiH2PO4 and binder. The underlying mechanisms are elucidated through both theoretical calculations and empirical experiments. The optimized NG cathode is able to withstand fast charge/discharge at 60 C and exhibits exceptional capacity retention of 80.7% after 10,000 cycles 2 C.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Arch Bridge&#8208;Inspired Stress Modulation at Buried Interface for Stable High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A arch&#8208;like FBI&#8208;PyAI molecule (4&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butan&#8208;1&#8208;ammonium iodide) is designed and synthesized, which forms an ordered interlayer that relieves buried interfacial stress and mismatch, thereby enhancing structural integrity of perovskite films and the stability of devices.








Abstract
Thermal instability remains a key barrier to the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), largely due to severe thermomechanical mismatch at the buried interface between the perovskite and transport layers. This mismatch induces interfacial strain, triggering deep&#8208;level defects, ion migration, and phase segregation that severely impair device stability. Here, a thermomechanical stress engineering strategy is introduced via rational molecular interface design. Specifically, a novel molecule, 4&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butan&#8208;1&#8208;ammonium iodide (FBI&#8208;PyAI) is synthesized, that anchors at the TiO2/perovskite interface likely in a unique &#8220;molecular bridge&#8221; configuration. This soft interface yields an extremely low modulus and significantly reduces the interfacial stress energy from 0.554 to 0.178 eV, thereby suppressing defect formation and minimizing phase segregation. Meanwhile, the functional groups in FBI&#8208;PyAI passivate defects and induce vertically oriented perovskite crystallization, forming compact films with fewer voids and improved structural uniformity. As a result, the modified devices achieve exceptional thermal stability, which maintains 88% of initial efficiency after 50 thermal cycles (&#8722;15 to 65&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the modified PSC delivers a competitive efficiency of 25.01% and outstanding photostability (95% retention after 800&#160;h illumination under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 protocol). This work offers mechanistic insight into interfacial stress modulation and underscores its importance for thermally stable PSCs.

         <title>Over 20.5% Efficiency of Halogen&#8208;Free Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells Achieved by Anti&#8208;Solvent Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative anti&#8208;solvent (AS) strategy is proposed to accelerate photovoltaic material precipitation while suppressing molecular over&#8208;aggregation through precise tuning of solvent solubility and volatilization dynamics, achieving record&#8208;high device efficiency. When scaling the AS strategy to methanol soaking for large&#8208;area fabrication, it effectively eliminates the coffee&#8208;ring effect, enabling OSC modules to reach an outstanding efficiency of 17.23%, exhibiting the excellent scalability.








Abstract
Halogen&#8208;free solvent processing is critical for the industrial&#8208;scale production of organic solar cells (OSCs) and environmental sustainability. However, such solvents typically result in suboptimal efficiency due to excessive molecular aggregation and unfavorable phase separation. To address this issue, an innovative anti&#8208;solvent (AS) strategy is proposed that accelerates photovoltaic material precipitation by timed introduction of orthogonal solvents to reduce solvent solubility and enhance volatilization, thereby avoiding prolonged aggregation. The resulting optimized phase separation and fibrous morphology facilitate exciton dissociation and charge utilization, enabling PM6:D18:L8BO&#8208;X&#8208;based OSCs to achieve a remarkable efficiency of 20.51% (certified as 20.12%), significantly higher than that of the conventional o&#8208;xylene&#8208;processed devices. The AS strategy also exhibits broad universality, with notable efficiency gains across diverse photovoltaic materials and solvent systems. Furthermore, scaling the AS strategy to methanol soaking for large&#8208;area fabrication yields a record module efficiency of 17.23%, which is one of the optimal performances reported for OSC modules with active areas exceeding 10.0&#160;cm2. This work not only provides a practical solution for high&#8208;efficiency, eco&#8208;friendly OSC fabrication but also opens up new possibilities for their industrial&#8208;scale deployment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Layered Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Ultrahigh Electricity Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance stacked triboelectric nanogenerator is designed by the self&#8208;layered method, achieving efficient fabrication, high durability, and high output, which is a huge breakthrough for traditional designs. A device with 100 layers achieves a record&#8208;high volume charge density of 49.39 &#177; 1.73 mC&#160;m&#8722;3, enabling sustainable high&#8208;power applications in smart agricultural monitoring.








Abstract
Capturing low&#8208;density ambient mechanical energy to power devices is a sustainable development pathway. In which, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a stacked design has garnered wide attention for its remarkable enhancement in output. However, the traditional layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method generally results in complex fabrication and low output density. Herein, a novel self&#8208;layered method is proposed for efficiently constructing high output stacked TENG based on sliding mode. With the stacked thin steel sheets serving as the stator, an insertable rotor consisting of long fibers in the radial direction can be easily inserted into the stator during the rotating process. This achieves a self&#8208;layered effect, greatly simplifying the fabrication and improving the output. Finally, a highly integrated TENG comprising 200 units is fabricated within a height of 16.05 cm, and the volume charge density reaches 49.39 &#177; 1.73 mC&#160;m&#8722;3, which is 4 times of the previous record. The high power enables 10 commercial LEDs in 90 W power or 46 wireless agricultural sensors to work continuously. Besides, the TENG of 40 units can continuously power 8 wireless agricultural sensors at 6 m&#160;s&#8722;1 wind speed. Overall, this work overcomes the limitations of traditional designs, and provides a novel approach toward large&#8208;scale energy applications in sustainable agriculture.

         <title>Liquid&#8211;Solid Interfacial Fusion Assembly Enables the Precision Fabrication of Block Copolymer Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8211;solid interfacial fusion assembly (LSIFA) involves the fusion of sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles at the solid&#8211;liquid interface to form continuous polymer membranes. Upon template removal, monodisperse vesicles with tunable dimensions, complex morphologies (e.g., rod&#8208;like, multilamellae), and light&#8208;responsive permeability are obtained. This robust strategy breaks through traditional limitations and significantly expands the design space for functional polymeric vesicles.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers in bulk or solution can lead to the formation of vesicles (polymersomes), which have a wide range of applications, including gene therapy, nanoreactors, and biosensing. Unfortunately, traditional self&#8208;assembly methods for producing these nanostructures often face challenges in terms of complexity, time efficiency, and structural control. Here we show a versatile and scalable approach, termed liquid&#8211;solid interfacial fusion assembly (LSIFA), for the synthesis of monodisperse block copolymer vesicles with tunable composition, size, morphology, and permeability. As revealed by kinetic studies, LSIFA involves gradual fusion assembly of block copolymer spheres adsorbed at liquid&#8211;solid interface. Systematic analyses identify key factors governing LSIFA and confirm its universality. Conventional self&#8208;assembly requires diblock copolymers with specific packing parameters to form vesicles. LSIFA overcomes this limitation, enabling precise fabrication of a wide range of well&#8208;defined vesicles&#8212;a significant advance with enormous potential for applications in drug delivery, materials science, and beyond.

         <title>Transition of N&#233;el&#8208;Type and Bloch&#8208;N&#233;el Hybrid Skyrmion in a Metallic Multilayer Material System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrated a framework for manipulating multiple skyrmion types in [Pt/Co/Cu]5 multilayers through bias&#8208;driven thermal effects. Distinct N&#233;el and hybrid skyrmion phases can be selectively stabilized, enabling binary encoding beyond chirality&#8208;based schemes. This study provides design rules for multi&#8208;type skyrmion platforms and highlights device concepts for robust, low&#8208;energy spintronic information storage.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions, which are stable, topologically protected spin structures, have garnered significant interest for their potential in revolutionizing spintronic applications. This study reveals the room&#8208;temperature coexistence of N&#233;el&#8208;type and Bloch&#8208;N&#233;el hybrid skyrmions in [Pt/Co/Cu] multilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Pulse current is used to switch the skyrmion type and modulate the stability of the skyrmions. The thermal effect on the stability of the skyrmions due to the current pulse is also investigated. The work unveils a broad magnetic phase space, offering unprecedented control over skyrmion states in metallic multilayers with broken inversion symmetry. These findings pave the way for diverse applications in spintronics, including binary data encoding, and provide a novel framework for the manipulation of multi&#8208;type skyrmions.

         <title>Crystalline Confinement of Dynamic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Hydrogels: A New Paradigm for Synergistic Enhancement between Lifetime and Flexibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating high toughness and persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in crystalline&#8208;induced dynamic RTP materials represents a fundamental challenge. Here, a crystalline confinement strategy is developed using ionic comonomers to precisely modulate crystalline domains. Hydration competition tailors crystalline domains to achieve exceptional toughness (12 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) while electrostatic anchoring stabilizes triplet excitons to extend phosphorescence lifetime to 598.79 ms, overcoming the intrinsic materials limitation. 








Abstract
Dynamic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials present promising applications in optoelectronic fields.&#160; However, conventional dynamic RTP hydrogels typically suffer from an inherent performance trade&#8208;off, where enhancement of flexibility comes at the expense of phosphorescence lifetime and vice versa. Herein, a universal crystalline confinement strategy is reported to overcome this fundamental limitation by employing ionic comonomers to regulate crystalline domains. By incorporating ionic comonomers such as 3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SPM), the hydration competition and disruption of crystalline packing enable precise control over crystal dimensions, yielding hydrogels with exceptional stretchability (634%) and toughness (12 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, 107&#8208;fold improvement). The ionic comonomers also serve as electrostatic anchoring sites for chromophores, stabilizing triplet excitons and significantly prolonging the phosphorescence lifetime to 598.79 ms. This approach overcomes traditional trade&#8208;offs between flexibility and phosphorescence lifetime, demonstrating broad applicability across various ionic comonomers with &#8776;100&#8208;fold toughness enhancements and prolonged phosphorescence lifetime. These results establish a generalizable framework linking crystalline domain dynamics with photophysical properties in dynamic hydrogels. The design opens avenues for advanced dynamic RTP materials in stretchable optoelectronics, dynamic encryption, smart sensors, and reagent thermal history monitoring.

         <title>Phosphine Interlayer Chemical Hardness Engineering via Crystallization Regulation for Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>

Interfacial modification with tris(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine at the Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite interface simultaneously fills SAM defects, passivates undercoordinated Pb&#178;&#8314;, and guides perovskite crystallization. This enables a 20.46%&#8208;efficient wide&#8208;bandgap (1.77 eV) cell and a two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell achieving a 29.71% efficiency with high operational stability, retaining 91.96% initial PCE after 850 h.








Abstract
In wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, light&#8208;induced phase segregation of the perovskite film and non&#8208;radiative recombination at the self&#8208;assembled monolayers/perovskite interface severely compromise device efficiency and stability. Herein, an interfacial engineering strategy utilizing controllable Lewis base small molecules is proposed to ameliorate the Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite interface, enabling effective interfacial defect suppression and high&#8208;quality perovskite crystallization. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the optimized tris(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (TPP) molecule can simultaneously fill defects in Me&#8208;4PACz self&#8208;assembly, passivate undercoordinated Pb2&#8314; at the perovskite bottom surface, and anchor [PbX6]&#8308;&#8722; to provide nucleation sites for inducing bottom&#8208;up homogeneous crystallization. Consequently, the TPP&#8208;treated single&#8208;junction cell (1.77 eV) achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.46% with a high VOC of 1.34 eV, representing one of the highest reported efficiencies for this bandgap. The corresponding two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells achieved a PCE of 29.71% (certified as 29.13%), with a VOC of 2.16 V and fill factor of 83.81%, meanwhile maintaining exceptional operational stability by retaining 91.96% of initial PCE after 850 h of maximum power point tracking under solar illumination.

&lt;p&gt;Interfacial modification with tris(2-pyridyl)phosphine at the Me-4PACz/perovskite interface simultaneously fills SAM defects, passivates undercoordinated Pb&#178;&#8314;, and guides perovskite crystallization. This enables a 20.46%-efficient wide-bandgap (1.77 eV) cell and a two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cell achieving a 29.71% efficiency with high operational stability, retaining 91.96% initial PCE after 850 h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In wide-bandgap perovskite solar cells, light-induced phase segregation of the perovskite film and non-radiative recombination at the self-assembled monolayers/perovskite interface severely compromise device efficiency and stability. Herein, an interfacial engineering strategy utilizing controllable Lewis base small molecules is proposed to ameliorate the Me-4PACz/perovskite interface, enabling effective interfacial defect suppression and high-quality perovskite crystallization. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the optimized tris(2-pyridyl)phosphine (TPP) molecule can simultaneously fill defects in Me-4PACz self-assembly, passivate undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; at the perovskite bottom surface, and anchor [PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8308;&#8722; to provide nucleation sites for inducing bottom-up homogeneous crystallization. Consequently, the TPP-treated single-junction cell (1.77 eV) achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.46% with a high V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.34 eV, representing one of the highest reported efficiencies for this bandgap. The corresponding two-terminal all-perovskite tandem solar cells achieved a PCE of 29.71% (certified as 29.13%), with a V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.16 V and fill factor of 83.81%, meanwhile maintaining exceptional operational stability by retaining 91.96% of initial PCE after 850 h of maximum power point tracking under solar illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;Buffering Interphase Enabled by Hierarchical Nanostructure Engineering of Gel Polymers for Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;buffering gel layer is fabricated through a facile and precisely controlled copolymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation strategy. The gel layer exhibits a mult&#8208;ilevel Zn2+&#8208;buffering capability that synergistically integrates hydrophobicity, nanoconfined ion transport, and highly efficient desolvation, achieving an ultra&#8208;stable electrode/electrolyte interface.








Abstract
The cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is hindered by the unstable Zn anode interface, causing uncontrolled dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, for the first time, a hierarchical nanostructure&#8208;engineered hydrogel interphase layer is developed via a facile and precisely controlled copolymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (CIMS) strategy, which enables multi&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;buffering to stabilize the Zn anode interface: 1) The nanoconfinement effect, combined with the hydrophobicity ofmethylacryloyloxypropyl cage&#8208;type polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (MP&#8208;POSS), facilitates [Zn(H2O)6]2+ desolvation while blocking water and SO42&#8722; penetration, achieving an optimal balance between enhanced Zn2+ transport and minimized side reactions; 2) CIMS between polar comonomers and MP&#8208;POSS creates hierarchical molecular clusters within the hydrogel. These self&#8208;assembled domains homogenize Zn2+ flux and reduce interfacial concentration polarization, realizing dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. After modification, symmetric cells achieve exceptionally long lifespan exceeding 5500&#160;h (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and 1500&#160;h (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Asymmetric cell demonstrates an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% after 3600 cycles. MnO2 and V2O5 full cells retain 85.4% and 84.7% capacity retention after 1000 (1 A g&#8722;1) and 2000 (5 A g&#8722;1) cycles, respectively. This research unveils a novel multi&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;buffering mechanism based on gel polymer hierarchical nanostructure engineering and provides a feasible strategy for advancing grid&#8208;scale AZIBs.

         <title>Tilted Crack&#8208;Engineered Photothermal Membranes Achieve Attenuation&#8208;Free Solar Evaporation and Oil Recovery From Emulsions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a tilted solar evaporation membrane with a cracked metal&#8211;phenolic coating for simultaneous water and oil recovery from emulsions. The cracked coating can optimize water supply pathways on the membrane and modulate water&#8208;water interactions, leading to a high evaporation rate. Tilted design prevents oil droplet adhesion and realizes oil collection, ensuring durable performance for continuous operation.








Abstract
While solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) presents a sustainable solution for water purification, its application to challenging oily wastewater has been severely limited by inadequate water transport, oil&#8208;fouling&#8208;induced evaporation attenuation, and the inability to efficiently recover oil. To overcome these fundamental barriers, a novel tilted photothermal membrane featuring cracked metal&#8211;phenolic networks (C&#8208;MPNs) integrated with an oil collector for simultaneous solar&#8208;driven recovery of both water and oil from emulsions is introduced. Through synergistic material and interfacial engineering, the unique C&#8208;MPNs&#160;structure enhances water evaporation by dual mechanisms: 1) modulating water&#8211;water interactions via tannic acid molecules and 2) optimizing water transport pathways via engineered cracks. This design achieves a high evaporation rate of 2.86 kg&#8201;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, ranking among the top&#8208;performing photothermal membranes. Critically, the network of cracks generates abundant submicron gates that selectively intercept oil droplets. Coupled with the tilted configuration, this system actively transports intercepted oil upward for efficient capture (90.6% recovery) while concurrently mitigating membrane fouling. Remarkably, the integrated system maintains an unprecedented evaporation rate of 2.6 kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1 for soybean oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions with zero attenuation over 42 h of continuous operation. Extended outdoor testing over 23 days confirms exceptional operational stability and sustained, high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;resource recovery.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Stabilized Superfine Pt Clusters Synergized with Single&#8208;Atom Ni&#8208;N4 Sites for Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>

         <dc:description>
Pt cluster and Ni single&#8208;atom composite systems are constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support for boosting hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution. The as&#8208;prepared electrocatalyst exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic activity, which requires an ultralow cell voltage of a mere 79&#160;mV to reach the current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in an overall hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted splitting electrolyzer.








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution represents a promising avenue for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the development of bifunctional catalysts with high atom economy and durability for both hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains challenging. Here, a design is reported that combines sulfur&#8208;stabilized Pt clusters and Ni&#8208;N4 sites on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Ptn&#8208;S/Ni1&#8208;NC) for boosting alkaline hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen evolution. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the pre&#8208;coordinated sulfur atoms on Pt clusters provide strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) for the homogeneous distribution of Pt clusters, allowing Pt clusters to remain ultrafine, which ensures high atom utilization and sufficient active sites. Moreover, the electronic interactions and synergistic adsorption mechanism of Pt clusters and adjacent Ni&#8208;N4 sites markedly accelerate the H2O dissociation and HzOR kinetics. As a result, the Ptn&#8208;S/Ni1&#8208;NC catalysts exhibit exceptional catalytic activity, achieving an ultrasmall HER overpotential of 19&#160;mV and an ultralow HzOR working potential of &#8722;21&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density. In addition, the overall hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer can reach 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a low cell voltage of 79&#160;mV and good long&#8208;term stability in 1.0&#160;m KOH/0.5&#160;m N2H4.

         <title>Flexible Graphene@Silica Fabric Metasurface for Electromagnetic Wave Absorption on High&#8208;Speed Aircraft</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, ultrathin (0.1 mm), and thermally robust graphene@silica fabric metasurface with tunable impedance for aerospace EMW absorption via chemical vapor deposition and laser &#8220;erasing&#8221; technique. This metasurface is directly integrated onto the aircraft thermal&#8208;insulation layer and ensures excellent durability under high temperatures, high&#8208;speed airflow scouring, and mechanical stress, making it ideal for aerospace applications.








Abstract
Modern high&#8208;speed aircraft require materials that can absorb electromagnetic waves (EMWs) while remaining lightweight, flexible, and resistant to extreme heat flux. Although graphene@silica fabric (G@SF) is a promising metasurface in this regard, its EMW dissipation capacity is limited by its uniform sheet resistance distribution, which leads to mismatched interfacial wave impedance. In this study, a subtractive laser &#8220;erasing&#8221; technique is applied to G@SF grown via chemical vapor deposition to develop a scalable, flexible, ultrathin (0.1&#160;mm), and thermally robust (up to 1000 &#176;C) metasurface with tunable impedance for aerospace EMW absorption. This metasurface is directly integrated onto the aircraft thermal&#8208;insulation layer to obtain an integrated absorber that minimizes radar reflection (down to &#8722;42&#160;dB) without adding significant weight or altering aircraft structure. The all&#8208;inorganic design ensures excellent durability under high temperatures, high&#8208;speed airflow scouring, and mechanical stress, making it ideal for aerospace applications. The proposed method is a promising approach for fabricating next&#8208;generation EMW&#8208;absorbing materials that combine performance, resilience, and manufacturability.

         <title>Bioprinted Constructs in the Regulatory Landscape: Current State and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 4, 16 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioprinting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technology in biomedical research, offering unprecedented potential to replicate complex tissues. Despite its promise, clinical translation remains limited due to regulatory hurdles. This review explores global regulatory frameworks, comparing approaches in the EU, U.S., China, and Australia, and outlines strategies for future developments.








Abstract
Bioprinting has become one of the leading topics in biomedical research in the past decade, as demonstrated by the great surge in publications and proliferation of bioprinting facilities worldwide. Bioprinting has gained widespread popularity because of its potential to replicate complex biological structures, revolutionize in vitro testing, and tissue engineering. However, the clinical translation of bioprinted products remains a challenge. The regulatory approval of tissue&#8208;engineered products requires extensive preclinical and clinical trials with different standards worldwide. The regulatory landscape for bioprinted products is examined in the European Union, United States, China, and Australia. The current regulatory status of bioprinting is traced by exploring parallels with existing categories such as 3D printed medical devices, injectable hydrogels, and tissue engineering products. This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and regulatory landscape of bioprinted constructs, envisioning challenges, and strategies for their future integration into clinical practice.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Mediated Metal Oxide Heterointerfaces: Roles of Substrates and Surface Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of local space charge, not only at heterointerfaces, but also at grain boundaries, influenced by surface acidity modulation is elucidated through model platforms composed of Pr&#8208;doped ceria (mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting oxide) nanowire arrays. The large potential impact of surface acidity on the electronic properties of nanostructured functional oxides is illustrated.








Abstract
Although strong modulation of interfacial electron concentrations by the relative acidity of surface additives is suggested, direct observation of corresponding changes in surface conductivity, crucial for understanding the role of local space charge, is lacking. Here, a model platform comprising well&#8208;aligned mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting Pr0.2Ce0.8O2&#8208;&#948; nanowire arrays (PCONA) is introduced to show that acidity&#8208;modulated heterointerfaces predict electron depletion or accumulation, resulting in tunable electrical properties. Three orders of magnitude increased PCONA conductivity are confirmed with basic Li2O infiltration. Moreover, the relative acidity of the insulating substrate supporting the PCONA strongly influences its electronic properties as well. This strategy is further validated in purely ionic&#8208;conducting nanostructured ceria as well as PCONA. It is suggested that observed conductivity changes stem not only from acidity&#8208;mediated space charge potentials at heterointerfaces but also from grain boundaries, chemically&#8208;modulated by cation in&#8208;diffusion. These findings have broad implications for how substrate and surface treatment choices can alter the conductive properties of nanostructured functional oxides.

         <title>Embedded Ir&#9472;Ru Single&#8208;Atom Alloy with Self&#8208;Limiting Motifs for Sustainable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lattice&#8208;embedded SAA catalyst, featuring strong metal&#8208;support interactions, facilitates rapid directional electron transfer and dramatically enhances anode corrosion resistance, and the unique Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ir motifs preserves inner metallic characteristics, providing a stable surface chemistry for sustainable proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.








Abstract
Designing acid&#8208;stable anodic electrocatalysts with low noble&#8208;metal loading is essential for the industrial&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, existing catalyst systems struggle to fully utilize the intrinsic properties of active sites. Here, a precisely engineered nanocatalyst is unveiled through a hierarchical atomic assembly strategy for synthesis, featuring an ultralow&#8208;content Ir&#9472;Ru single&#8208;atom alloy integrated into robust titanium dioxide nanowires (Ir1Ru/TiO2). This lattice&#8208;embedded structure induces the support to reduce the dissolution and excessive oxidation of Ru/Ir sites through strong interfacial coupling, significantly enhancing the corrosion resistance of catalysts. Moreover, atomically dispersed Ir induces the formation of uniquely shortened Ru&#9472;O ligand bonds, serving as stable self&#8208;limiting motifs, in contrast to the conventional formation of amorphous oxide layers. The Ir1Ru/TiO2 catalyst showcases an initial mass activity of 1971.5 A gIr+Ru&#8722;1${\mathrm{g}}_{{\mathrm{Ir + Ru}}}^{ - {\mathrm{1}}}$, enabling stable operation at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 3200 h and at the rated current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 for 2000 h in PEMWE.

mRNA Delivery
Apolipoprotein nanoparticles (aNPs) are composed of natural nanomaterials&#8212;including phospholipids, sterols, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A1&#8212;and contain rationally designed polyvalent ionizable cationic dendrimers for efficient mRNA complexation. After intravenous administration, aNPs functionally deliver mRNA to myeloid cells in the circulation and their progenitors in the bone marrow. More details can be found in the Research Article by Henk M. Janssen, Roy van der Meel, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202504830).

4D Printing of Human Vascularized Cardiac Tissues with Selective Fast&#8208;Shrinking Capillaries
The cover image depicting one&#8208;step 4D printing of vascularized cardiac tissue, driven by rapidly shrinking, self&#8208;organizing capillaries. This method enables precise control over microvascular architecture, creating dense, perfusable networks that promote functional integration within engineered heart constructs. The illustration showcases the seamless integration of bioinks, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, and digital design, highlighting how this coordinated approach enables rapid, reproducible fabrication of fully vascularized cardiac tissues with physiologically relevant microvasculature, from large vessels down to fine capillaries, advancing the frontier of regenerative medicine. More details can be found in the Research Article by Tal Dvir and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202512879).

In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202511392), Sai Liu, Shi&#8208;Jie Cao, and co&#8208;workers explore the vision of smart skin for zero energy buildings, where the building envelope acts like a living skin&#8212;able to sense temperature shifts and adaptively regulate solar light and thermal radiation. Focusing on smart windows and radiative coatings, the review highlights material innovations, spectral mechanisms, and integration strategies that enable this skin&#8208;like responsiveness, while pointing to challenges of durability, scalability, comfort&#8208;centered design, and other critical factors in shaping the next generation of climate&#8208;responsive architecture.

         <title>Mirror Life: Bridging Chirality, Ethics, and the Foundations of Life Creation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging chirality and materials science, this review charts how mirror&#8208;image building blocks enable stable biomaterials and therapeutics and propel efforts toward mirror cells. Applications in chiral biomaterials and therapeutics are surveyed, alongside engineering strategies toward mirror cells and protocells, and a pragmatic biosafety/ethics and containment roadmap for orthogonal, materials&#8208;based life systems.








Abstract
Biological homochirality, defined by the exclusive use of L&#8208;amino acids and D&#8208;sugars in terrestrial life, is essential for molecular recognition, enzymatic specificity, and cellular function. Recent advances in synthetic chemistry and molecular engineering have enabled the creation of mirror&#8208;image biomolecules such as D&#8208;peptides, L&#8208;DNA, and L&#8208;RNA, laying the foundation for orthogonal biological systems. These systems encompass engineered bacteria, viruses, and protocells composed entirely of D&#8208;amino acids and L&#8208;nucleotides. Mirror organisms represent a novel class of synthetic life with transformative potential in biomedicine. They may be used to develop protease&#8208;resistant drugs, nuclease&#8208;stable genetic elements, biosensors, and tissue engineering scaffolds, applications where biological durability and immune invisibility are advantageous. However, their unnatural chirality raises significant biosafety concerns. These organisms may escape immune detection, resist host antimicrobial defenses, and evade ecological regulators such as predation and microbial competition. This introduces the risk of uncontrolled proliferation in clinical or environmental settings. This review examines stereoselective synthesis of mirror biomolecules, construction of functional mirror subsystems, and engineering of mirror&#8208;life architectures. It also discusses recent progress in chiral biomaterials, including L&#8208;DNA hydrogels, nanostructures, and metamaterials, with potential applications in drug delivery, sensing, and regenerative medicine.

         <title>Leveraging Cross&#8208;Cutting Technologies to Unravel Light&#8208;Heat&#8208;Water Interactions at Solar Evaporation Interfaces: Propelling the Low&#8208;Carbon Water&#8208;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explains how advanced numerical simulation techniques can be utilized to analyze the light&#8208;heat&#8208;water interactions in solar evaporation systems. It objectively explores the underlying mechanisms and energy transfer processes behind clean water production. The study points out possible sources of errors and limitations in large&#8208;scale applications and provides a perspective on the future of low&#8208;carbon water&#8208;energy technologies.








Abstract
Multifunctional solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) systems have emerged as a critical technology for clean water production. Advances in evaporator design and component optimization have significantly enhanced their performance, enabling highly efficient operation in small&#8208;scale applications such as seawater desalination and steam sterilization, even under extreme environmental conditions. Nevertheless, critical mechanisms remain insufficiently resolved: light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion dynamics and interfacial interactions during evaporation, synergistic thermal confinement and management strategies, and water transport/activation mechanisms at solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;gas interfaces mediated by suspended materials. This review systematically examines unsystematized photothermal&#8208;water conversion processes and cross&#8208;disciplinary application scenarios through analysis of archetypal evaporator configurations. By adopting an integrated multi&#8208;scale analysis framework and leveraging advanced computational modeling techniques, the metrological significance of performance metrics, inherent measurement uncertainties, and fundamental value&#8208;translation mechanisms in specialized implementations is elucidated. Concurrently, intrinsic limitations hindering large&#8208;scale deployment are identified, providing critical insights into scalability challenges across diverse operational contexts. This approach establishes a comprehensive theoretical foundation for optimizing next&#8208;generation SDIE systems while providing data references for cross&#8208;disciplinary advancement in the sustainable application of thermophotovoltaic evaporation.

         <title>Multidimensional Additive Manufacturing for Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive manufacturing (AM) enables multidimensional (0D to 4D) perovskite optoelectronics, overcoming the limitations of conventional fabrication methods such as spin coating. This review covers nozzle&#8208;based deposition, light&#8208;assisted processing, and mechanical&#8208;based transfer printing, emphasizing ink rheology and energy&#8208;field parameters for tailored structures and high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation devices.








Abstract
Halide perovskite optoelectronics have experienced transformative progress in thin&#8208;film device performance over the past decade. With expanding application scenarios, tailored dimensionality control for perovskite structures is essential, from 0D nanocrystals and 1D nanowires for lasers to 2D films for displays/solar cells and 3D heterojunction arrays for broadband photodetectors. However, conventional methods such as spin coating and lithographic methods face inherent incompatibility in perovskite fabrication with multiple dimensions. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a versatile and cost&#8208;effective platform to address this challenge by leveraging low&#8208;temperature and spatially controlled crystallization processes. This review summarizes recent progress in AM techniques for multidimensional (from 0D to 4D architectures) perovskite optoelectronics, categorizing them into nozzle&#8208;based deposition (e.g., inkjet printing, direct ink writing), light&#8208;assisted processing (e.g., laser direct writing, photopolymerization), and mechanical transfer printing. Critical analysis focuses on printing resolution, dimensional scalability, and ink formulation strategies for increased printability and crystallinity. The interplay between ink rheology/energy&#8208;field parameters and device performance is elucidated to guide optimal AM method selection for the fabrication of unconventional architectures. The integration of AM methods enables the development of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics with multidimensional structures beyond traditional fabrication methods.

         <title>Beyond Enzyme Mimics: Engineering Photo&#8208;Responsive Nanozymes for Therapeutic Innovation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>

An overview of photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes, including structure&#8208;activity relationship, catalytic mechanism, and biomedical applications.








Abstract
Nanozymes, which mimic the catalytic functions of natural enzymes, have attracted increasing attention because of their high stability, low cost, and scalable synthesis. However, their clinical potential is often constrained by their limited catalytic efficiency and poor substrate specificity. Recent developments in photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes offer a promising solution by integrating photocatalytic and photo&#8208;synergistic mechanisms to enhance activity and spatiotemporal control. These systems utilize photo&#8208;induced charge separation, reactive oxygen species generation, and auxiliary photothermal or photodynamic effects to improve catalytic outcomes. By utilizing these photo&#8208;responsive mechanisms, various nanozyme systems comprising plasmonic metals, metal oxides, semiconductors, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks exhibit enhanced catalytic functions and outstanding therapeutic performance in cancer treatment, infection control, immune modulation, and tissue repair. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and application of photo&#8208;responsive nanozymes and highlights the remaining challenges for clinical translation, and thus positioning them as a next&#8208;generation strategy for precision biocatalysis and disease intervention.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Spinel Cathodes: A Promising Frontier for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;based spinel cathodes LiMn2O4 (LMO) and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), with the unique characteristics of low cost, structural stability, and 3D Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels, have presented great potential in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Here, a comprehensive understanding and valuable insights into the rational design and implications for the future development of Mn&#8208;based cathodes are provided.








Abstract
Recently, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLIBs), which exhibit improved safety and enhanced energy density compared to conventional commercialized lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), thereby have garnered extensive research interest. Among the promising cathode candidates, Mn&#8208;based spinel cathodes LiMn2O4 (LMO) and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), with the unique characteristics of low cost, structural stability, and 3D Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels, have demonstrated excellent performance in LIBs and presented great potential in ASSLIBs applications. However, several challenges, including structural degradations, poor interfacial contact, large interfacial resistance, and Mn&#8208;dissolution/diffusion during the electrochemical cycling, hinder their practical applications and commercialization in the ASSLIBs. Particularly, the high&#8208;voltage LNMO cathodes suffer from the challenge of electrochemical incompatibility with most of the solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Herein, the spinel structure, the electrochemical behavior, and the structural degradation of the LMO/LNMO are explored. The characteristics and recent progress of the mitigating strategies to the challenges of various SSEs, including polymer&#8208;, oxide&#8208;, composite&#8208;, sulfide&#8208;, halide&#8208;, and LiPON&#8208;based SSEs, are introduced when paired with LMO/LNMO. Finally, the directions for future research to advance Mn&#8208;based spinel cathodes and fulfill the requirements of the next&#8208;generation ASSLIBs are also discussed.

         <title>From Ambiguity to Application: Deciphering Non&#8208;Radical Pathways in Heterogeneous Persulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review deciphers the complexity of non&#8208;radical pathways in persulfate&#8208;based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes. By integrating singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal&#8211;oxo species, electron transfer and polymerization mechanisms, it establishes a unified framework linking catalyst design, pollutant properties and operation parameters, providing a unified framework to tune pathway selectivity and guide application&#8208;oriented water treatment.








Abstract
Non&#8208;radical pathways have emerged as a critical research frontier in persulfate&#8208;based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;HAOPs), offering superior selectivity and thereby resistance to background interference compared to conventional radical&#8208;based routes. However, the practical implementation remains hindered by mechanistic ambiguities, stemming from the coexistence of multiple reactive species and difficulty in direct verification. Current studies remain fragmented, lacking a unified framework to connect catalyst properties, operational parameters, and dominant oxidation mechanisms. This review examines the formation mechanism, identification methodologies, and reactivity patterns of non&#8208;radical species, such as singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal oxide species, and electron transfer pathways. Particular emphasis is placed on rational catalyst design strategies, including spin&#8208;state tuning, coordination environment manipulation, and structural engineering, which directly modulate the steric and electronic structures of active sites and thereby influence the dominant oxidation pathway and overall catalytic efficiency. By integrating insights into temporal evolution, multi&#8208;pathway coupling, and polymerization behavior, a comprehensive model that links catalyst properties, operational conditions, and pollutant characteristics to pathway selectivity is formulated.

     alt="From Ambiguity to Application: Deciphering Non-Radical Pathways in Heterogeneous Persulfate Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review deciphers the complexity of non-radical pathways in persulfate-based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes. By integrating singlet oxygen, high-valent metal&#8211;oxo species, electron transfer and polymerization mechanisms, it establishes a unified framework linking catalyst design, pollutant properties and operation parameters, providing a unified framework to tune pathway selectivity and guide application-oriented water treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-radical pathways have emerged as a critical research frontier in persulfate-based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (PS-HAOPs), offering superior selectivity and thereby resistance to background interference compared to conventional radical-based routes. However, the practical implementation remains hindered by mechanistic ambiguities, stemming from the coexistence of multiple reactive species and difficulty in direct verification. Current studies remain fragmented, lacking a unified framework to connect catalyst properties, operational parameters, and dominant oxidation mechanisms. This review examines the formation mechanism, identification methodologies, and reactivity patterns of non-radical species, such as singlet oxygen, high-valent metal oxide species, and electron transfer pathways. Particular emphasis is placed on rational catalyst design strategies, including spin-state tuning, coordination environment manipulation, and structural engineering, which directly modulate the steric and electronic structures of active sites and thereby influence the dominant oxidation pathway and overall catalytic efficiency. By integrating insights into temporal evolution, multi-pathway coupling, and polymerization behavior, a comprehensive model that links catalyst properties, operational conditions, and pollutant characteristics to pathway selectivity is formulated. This review provides mechanistic clarity and design principles to guide the future development of controllable, efficient, and application-oriented non-radical PS-HAOPs systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Smart Skin for Zero Energy Buildings: A Review of Thermoresponsive Spectral&#8208;Adaptive Envelopes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in thermoresponsive spectral&#8208;adaptive building envelopes that passively regulate light and heat across multiple wavelengths. Focusing on smart windows and radiative coatings, it explores material systems, spectral mechanisms, and architectural integration, while identifying key challenges in achieving scalable, durable, and comfort&#8208;centered solutions for next&#8208;generation climate&#8208;responsive buildings.








Abstract
Buildings are increasingly being conceived as dynamic systems that interact with their surroundings to optimize energy performance and enhance occupant comfort. This evolution in architectural thinking draws inspiration from biological systems, where the building envelope functions like a thermally responsive &#8220;skin&#8221; that can autonomously adjust its optical and thermal properties in response to environmental temperature changes. Among the many approaches developed for smart building envelopes, passive thermoresponsive spectral modulation systems have attracted growing interest due to their structural simplicity and low energy demand. By dynamically tuning solar radiation transmission and thermal emission across different spectral ranges, these systems reduce the reliance of buildings on mechanical heating, cooling, and lighting, thereby enhancing overall energy efficiency and climate responsiveness. This review offers a comprehensive and unified perspective on thermoresponsive building envelope technologies, bridging transparent and opaque components&#8212;including thermochromic smart windows and tunable radiative wall coatings&#8212;within the architectural context. It places particular emphasis on multiband spectral control, material&#8208;structure integration, and performance under diverse environmental conditions. Finally, it outlines key challenges and future research directions in advancing spectral control capabilities, aesthetic integration, all&#8208;weather adaptability, user&#8208;centered design, and practical applicability of thermoresponsive envelopes for next&#8208;generation sustainable buildings.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based ROS&#8208;Regulating Strategy: Reprogramming the Oxidative Stress Imbalance in Advanced Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically explores the critical role of ROS in diabetic wound progression and highlights advanced hydrogel&#8208;based strategies for smart spatiotemporal ROS modulation. It discusses how engineered hydrogels respond to internal or external stimuli to resolve infection, oxidative stress, inhibit inflammation, and promote vascularization, neural and cutaneous appendages repair, offering innovative solutions for diabetic wound therapy.








Abstract
Due to hyperglycemia and redox imbalance, diabetic wounds are prone to recurrent ulceration and non&#8208;healing, severely affecting patients' quality of life. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in wounds impede repair by damaging proteins and nucleic acids, activating inflammation, and suppressing immunity. A growing body of evidence suggests that harnessing the high oxidative stress within the microenvironment and modulating ROS levels to overcome repair barriers has become a breakthrough in treating chronic diabetic wounds. Hydrogels, with excellent biocompatibility and designability, are key for intelligent ROS regulation. Here, the role of ROS in the progression of diabetic skin wounds is detailed, which includes inducing oxidative damage, exacerbating inflammation and immune imbalance, as well as degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM), hindering neovascularization, and inhibiting nerve repair. Then, the ROS&#8208;regulating strategy based on the hydrogel platform is discussed. Engineered hydrogels adjust ROS levels via external stimulus such as light, ultrasound, and electricity, or the microenvironment of hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and acidity in wounds, and even bidirectionally in specific spatiotemporal contexts. Furthermore, the therapeutic and repair potential of ROS&#8208;regulated hydrogels in the healing process of diabetic wounds is outlined, the current deficiencies in the field of diabetic wounds treatment are addressed, and prospects for the future are proposed.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Carbon&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells: Scalable Fabrication, Performance Optimization, and Industrialization Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines recent progress in large&#8208;scale carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs), mainly focusing on scalable fabrication techniques and performance enhancement strategies in both high&#8208;temperature carbon electrode (HT&#8208;CE) and low&#8208;temperature carbon electrode (LT&#8208;CE) photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, the encapsulation technologies and cost of C&#8208;PSCs are also discussed and analyzed. Finally, the commercial challenges and opportunities for large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PSCs are briefly outlined.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered significant attention as promising contenders in the photovoltaic industry, owing to their compelling combination of low cost, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), and tunable bandgap properties. Among these, carbon&#8208;based PSCs (C&#8208;PSCs) have presented a unique industrial potential in addressing the &#8220;efficiency&#8208;lifetime&#8208;cost&#8221; challenge due to its high stability and low cost. However, the high&#8208;defect density and severe interface energy loss, which caused by the deposition process compatibility during the expansion of small&#8208;scale devices to large&#8208;scale devices, greatly limit the development of large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PSCs. Hence, this review systematically examines recent progress in large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PSCs and modules, mainly focusing on scalable fabrication techniques and performance enhancement strategies in both high&#8208;temperature carbon electrode (HT&#8208;CE) and low&#8208;temperature carbon electrode (LT&#8208;CE) photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, the encapsulation technologies and cost of C&#8208;PSCs are also discussed and analyzed. Finally, this work gives a brief outlook on the commercialization challenges and opportunities of large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PSCs.

It begins with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms and critical performance parameters of these scintillators. Subsequently, effective strategies to enhance scintillation performance are systematically summarized. The review also delves into various preparation methods for metal cluster scintillator screens. Lastly, it identifies the opportunities and challenges that the field currently faces. This review aims to serve as a theoretical foundation and a methodological guide for future studies focused on the structural design and performance optimization of coinage metal cluster scintillators, advancing X&#8208;ray imaging technologies to address application challenges in this evolving field.

         <title>Tunable and Persistent Macroscopic Polarization in Nominally Centrosymmetric Defective Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an approach to defect&#8208;mediated symmetry breaking and built&#8208;in polarization in nominally centrosymmetric defective oxides, Gd&#8208;doped CeO2&#8208;&#948; films, by controlling macroscopic charge asymmetry. Electric field&#8208;driven asymmetric redistribution of oxygen vacancies induces a switchable, stable polarization, leading to a notable, persistent pyroelectricity with a coefficient of 180 &#181;C&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;K&#8722;1. These findings open new opportunities for expanding the range of environmentally friendly, sustainable, high&#8208;performance polar materials.








Abstract
Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non&#8208;zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, a conceptual approach is demonstrated to defects&#8208;mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built&#8208;in polarization in a nominally centrosymmetric defective oxide, GdxCe1&#8208;xO2&#8208;&#948; (CGO) films by&#160;creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. These results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the electric field&#8208;driven redistribution of oxygen vacancies with a critical field strength of &#8776;0.5 MV&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effect with a coefficient of &#8776;180 &#181;C&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;K&#8722;1. These findings highlight the potential to develop high&#8208;performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand the range of&#160;polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.

         <title>Manipulating Individual Topological Solitons and Bisolitons in an Electronic System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
While localized topological modes in quantum materials promise loss&#8208;less delivery of classical and quantum information, manipulating them individually has been challenging. This work succeeded in manipulating topological solitons formed along atomic wires on silicon surfaces with high reproducibility in various ways, including translating, transforming into a different type of solitons, fissioning into two solitons, and fusing and dissociating two solitons.








Abstract
While localized topological modes in quantum materials, such as topological solitons and Majorana fermions, promise loss&#8208;less delivery of classical and quantum information, manipulating individual topological modes has been highly challenging. The manipulation of Z4 topological solitons is reported in a 1D charge density wave (CDW) insulator of indium atomic wires on a silicon surface. Using the current injection from a scanning tunneling microscopy tip, individual defects&#8208;pinned solitons can be created, translated, and annihilated. Moreover, this method is applied to induce bi&#8208;soliton processes such as transforming a soliton into a different soliton, fissioning one into two solitons, and fusing and dissociating two solitons, where soliton topological charges are manipulated. The theoretical calculations attribute the mechanism of manipulation to local destabilization of the CDW structure by hole doping. This work demonstrates addressable control over most of the possible operations between individual and paired Z4 solitons and secures a way to investigating dynamics of quantum solitons and to processing topologically&#8208;protected multi&#8208;valued information in electronic&#160;systems.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Reservoir Computing with a Reconfigurable Multifunctional Memristor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a hardware physical reservoir computing system using a tri&#8208;modal memristive crossbar array. Stochastic masking, bistable nonlinear activation, and analog readout enable fully in&#8208;memory spatiotemporal processing. Demonstrations on cellular automata, Lorenz prediction, ADHD EEG classification, and chaotic KS modeling highlight its multifunctionality and potential for compact, reconfigurable reservoir&#8208;computing hardware.








Abstract
The existing physical implementations of reservoir computing are constrained mainly by time&#8208;delay architectures that lack capabilities for spatial data processing. This study presents a multifunctional memristor&#8208;based reservoir computing system, the memristive echo state network (MESN), which enables spatiotemporal computation within a single device crossbar array. Utilizing a reconfigurable Ta/HfO2/RuO2 memristor, three distinct switching modes are realized: stochastic for input masking, bistable for sigmoidal activation, and analog for precise readout. A full in&#8208;memory implementation is experimentally demonstrated using a one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;resistor crossbar array integrated with indium oxide thin&#8208;film transistors. Spatial inference is validated through cellular automata, confirming reliable hardware operation. High&#8208;level simulations based on the hardware results demonstrate the performance of the proposed MESN, achieving high accuracy in predicting the Lorenz attractor and classifying attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The system also predicted the Kuramoto&#8211;Sivashinsky equation, representing the first memristor&#8208;based reservoir to model complex spatiotemporal partial differential equations. These results highlight the potential of multifunctional memristor arrays for scalable in&#8208;memory spatiotemporal computing.

         <title>Self&#8208;Switching Dynamic Infrared Radiative Cooler Enabling Triple&#8208;Mode Temperature Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;switching dynamic infrared radiative cooler is proposed that enables adapting selective and broadband infrared emission spectrum conversion through temperature&#8208;regulated molecular vibrations engineering without external energy input. The dynamic infrared radiative cooler achieves triple&#8208;mode temperature regulation, including sub&#8208;ambient building cooling, near&#8208;ambient personal comfort cooling, and above&#8208;ambient solar panels cooling.








Abstract
Passive radiative cooling offers zero&#8208;energy heat dissipation, yet static photonic structures fail in multi&#8208;scenario applications due to distinct or even incompatible requirements of infrared emission spectra across different thermal environments. Herein, a self&#8208;switching dynamic infrared radiative cooler (DIRC) is proposed that achieves triple&#8208;mode temperature regulation, including sub&#8208;ambient, near&#8208;ambient, and above&#8208;ambient cooling application. By leveraging temperature&#8208;triggered directional migration of broadband emission water molecules within thermoresponsive hydrogel, the spectral conversion between infrared selective emission for sub&#8208;ambient cooling and broadband emission for above&#8208;ambient cooling is realized. The resulting DIRC exhibits an average broadband emissivity of 94.1% across 2.5&#8211;25&#160;&#181;m and adaptively switches to a selective emissivity of 81.6% within the 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m, solar reflectivity maintains &#8776;90% during spectral conversion. The spectral transition is rapid and autonomous, with response times between 85.6 and 37.3 s across 35&#8211;45&#160;&#176;C temperature range. Notably, triple&#8208;mode thermal&#8208;regulated DIRC achieves a sub&#8208;ambient cooling of 9.5&#160;&#176;C for building thermal management, near&#8208;ambient cooling of 7.0&#160;&#176;C for enhanced personal comfort, and above&#8208;ambient cooling of 6.9&#160;&#176;C for photovoltaic panels. By overcoming the single&#8208;scenario and weather conditions limitations of static designs, the proposed DIRC represents a versatile strategy for triple&#8208;mode thermal regulation across a wide applications.

The resulting DIRC exhibits an average broadband emissivity of 94.1% across 2.5&#8211;25&#160;&#181;m and adaptively switches to a selective emissivity of 81.6% within the 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m, solar reflectivity maintains &#8776;90% during spectral conversion. The spectral transition is rapid and autonomous, with response times between 85.6 and 37.3 s across 35&#8211;45&#160;&#176;C temperature range. Notably, triple-mode thermal-regulated DIRC achieves a sub-ambient cooling of 9.5&#160;&#176;C for building thermal management, near-ambient cooling of 7.0&#160;&#176;C for enhanced personal comfort, and above-ambient cooling of 6.9&#160;&#176;C for photovoltaic panels. By overcoming the single-scenario and weather conditions limitations of static designs, the proposed DIRC represents a versatile strategy for triple-mode thermal regulation across a wide applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heat&#8208;Responsive Phase&#8208;Change Cream Broadly Enhances Transdermal Delivery Through a Mild Photothermal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transdermal cream containing phase&#8208;change materials, polydopamine nanoparticles, and glycerin capable of carrying various drugs is developed. The phase&#8208;change material maintains skin temperature at &#8764;40 &#176;C during the photothermal treatment. This mild photothermal strategy with temperature control offers a general yet versatile platform to enhance the transdermal delivery of various drugs for treating diverse diseases.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated transdermal delivery often relies on extreme heating to disrupt the skin barrier, but these approaches risk tissue damage and drug denaturation. Mild thermal stimulation promises safer uptake, yet achieving precise temperature control is inconvenient, and its transdermal efficacy and mechanisms remain unclear. A heat&#8208;responsive cream made from a stearic acid&#8208;lauric acid eutectic, polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles, glycerin, and drugs is introduced. This cream maintains skin temperature &#8764;40&#160;&#176;C under simulated sunlight by absorbing excess heat through phase change, preventing overheating while preserving the effectiveness of the drug without requiring manual adjustments. Mild photothermal treatment boosted penetration of PDA nanoparticles (2.4&#8211;406.9&#160;nm) by 5.5&#8211;7.1&#8208;fold, and achieved 28.9&#8208;, 24.6&#8208;, and 10.7&#8208;fold increase of fluorescent signals in dermis for rhodamine B (RB), RB&#8208;labeled 5 or 20&#160;kDa dextran versus nonheated controls, respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that the photothermal effect enhances transdermal delivery by inducing micropores on the skin and through the transappendageal route. Moreover, insulin delivered through this strategy reduced blood glucose by 75% in diabetic mice, and co&#8208;delivery of PDA NPs with methotrexate significantly improved psoriasis lesions. This self&#8208;regulating platform uniquely unites precise thermal control and dual&#8208;pathway enhancement, offering a generalizable route for enhancing transdermal delivery efficiency.

         <title>Colossal Cryogenic Electro&#8208;Optic Response Through Metastability in Strained BaTiO3 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a colossal cryogenic electro&#8208;optic response in BaTiO3 thin films is designed and demonstrated by stabilizing a low symmetry metastable monoclinic phase via epitaxial strain tuning with an electro&#8208;optic response reaching &#8776;2516 pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at 5 K. This approach represents a new paradigm for engineering large property enhancements in materials applied toward cryogenic photonics.








Abstract
The search for thin film electro&#8208;optic materials that can retain superior performance under cryogenic conditions has become critical for quantum computing. Barium titanate thin films show large linear electro&#8208;optic coefficients in the tetragonal phase at room temperature, which is severely degraded down to &#8776;200&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 in the rhombohedral phase at cryogenic temperatures. There is immense interest in manipulating these phase transformations and retaining superior electro&#8208;optic properties down to liquid helium temperature. Utilizing the thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a large low&#8208;temperature electro&#8208;optic response is designed by engineering the energetic competition between different ferroelectric phases, leading to a low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic phase with a massive electro&#8208;optic response. The existence of this phase is demonstrated in a strain&#8208;tuned BaTiO3 thin film that exhibits a linear electro&#8208;optic coefficient of 2516 &#177; 100&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at 5&#160;K, which is an order of magnitude higher than the best reported performance thus far. Importantly, the electro&#8208;optic coefficient increases by 100 &#215; during cooling, unlike the conventional films, where it degrades. Further, at the lowest temperature, significant higher order electro&#8208;optic responses also emerge. These results represent a new framework for designing materials with property enhancements by stabilizing highly tunable metastable phases with strain.

         <title>Biocompatible Nanozyme Shell&#8208;Armed Probiotic with Inflammation Targeting and Scavenging Properties Enables Effective Treatment of Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanozyme shell for probiotics is constructed through a self&#8208;modulated surface modification strategy with rapid modification and good biocompatibility. By integrating inflammation targeting, ROS scavenging, and microbiome remodeling, the nanozyme shell&#8208;armed probiotics can significantly reduce inflammation levels and promote healing of the mucosal barrier in a mouse colitis model.








Abstract
Coupling probiotics with lesion targeting and inflammation control properties without complex chemical modifications is crucial for preserving their native bioactivity, but remains challenging. Herein, metformin&#160;as a functional self&#8208;modulated alkaline reagent is&#160;incorporated to achieve the rapid and biocompatible construction of a polydopamine&#8208;based&#160;nanozyme shell (DMCe) on the surface of probiotics, thus avoiding the biological toxicity caused by traditional triggering methods. DMCe can not only serve as a robust physical barrier to protect probiotics from the invasion of digestive juices and antibiotics, but also synergistically scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) at colitis lesions via the intrinsic antioxidant property of catechol and the catalase&#8208;mimicking activity of cerium oxide. It is worth noting that during the process of scavenging ROS, the originally harmful ROS can be utilized by DMCe as reactive components to facilitate chemical reactions between the modified probiotics and colitis lesions, thus achieving prolonged inflammation targeting for up to 7 days. In addition, nanozyme shell&#8208;armed probiotics can improve microbial community composition and increase the levels of short&#8208;chain fatty acids. By integrating inflammation targeting, ROS scavenging, and microbiome remodeling, nanozyme shell&#8208;armed probiotics can significantly reduce inflammation levels and promote healing of the mucosal barrier in a mouse colitis model.

         <title>High Iontronic Performance in Organic Electrochemical Transistors Enabled by Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited transconductance of OECTs has hindered their development in bioelectronics. To address this issue, a molecular design strategy is developed involving finely tuning the intramolecular noncovalent interactions within the active layer. Consequently, transconductance increases with increasing the interaction strength, with a record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 being achieved.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show great potential in bioelectronics due to their iontronic coupling, low driving voltages (&lt;1&#8201;V), and biocompatibility. Nevertheless, their low iontronic performance, particularly in terms of transconductance (gm), limits their ability to acquire high&#8208;precision biosignals. To address this issue, a series of poly(bithiophene)s (opg2T&#8208;O, opg2T&#8208;S, and opg2T&#8208;Se) bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;position glycol side chains are synthesized. Upon varying furan, thiophene, and selenophene comonomers, the intramolecular noncovalent interactions are systematically tuned. Comprehensive theoretical analyses reveal that opg2T&#8208;Se demonstrates stronger intramolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent interactions than the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions in opg2T&#8208;S and opg2T&#8208;O, affording a more planar and rigid molecular configuration in opg2T&#8208;Se. Meanwhile, opg2T&#8208;Se exhibits closer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and lamellar&#8208;packing and prefers an edge&#8208;on orientation. Consequently, a record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,n) of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, along with remarkable hole mobility (&#181; = 2.99&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and volumetric capacitance (C* = 423.3&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) are achieved in opg2T&#8208;Se based OECTs. Importantly, the opg2T&#8208;Se&#8208;based devices exhibits much higher signal fidelity in in&#8208;vitro human electrocardiogram (ECG) than the other two devices. This study highlights the importance of intramolecular noncovalent interaction in the channel layer materials for achieving high&#8208;performance OECTs.

Comprehensive theoretical analyses reveal that opg2T-Se demonstrates stronger intramolecular Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O noncovalent interactions than the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions in opg2T-S and opg2T-O, affording a more planar and rigid molecular configuration in opg2T-Se. Meanwhile, opg2T-Se exhibits closer &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking and lamellar-packing and prefers an edge-on orientation. Consequently, a record-high geometry-normalized transconductance (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;) of 415&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, along with remarkable hole mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt; = 2.99&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and volumetric capacitance (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;* = 423.3&#160;F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are achieved in opg2T-Se based OECTs. Importantly, the opg2T-Se-based devices exhibits much higher signal fidelity in in-vitro human electrocardiogram (ECG) than the other two devices. This study highlights the importance of intramolecular noncovalent interaction in the channel layer materials for achieving high-performance OECTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticle&#8208;Immobilized Macrophage&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicle Nanohybrid Facilitates Diabetic Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomineralization, a calcium phosphate nanoparticle&#8208;immobilized macrophage&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle nanohybrid (M2EV@CaP) is developed through in situ crystallization on the vesicle surface. This strategy stabilizes vesicles and enables pH&#8208;responsive release of calcium, phosphorus, and bioactive components, promoting M2 macrophage polarization and osteogenesis under high&#8208;glucose inflammatory conditions. Hydrogel&#8208;assisted M2EV@CaP delivery significantly enhances bone regeneration via synergistic immunomodulation and osteoinduction.








Abstract
Diabetes significantly hinders bone regeneration, and existing tissue engineering therapies struggle to improve the hyperglycemia&#8208;induced inflammatory microenvironment, resulting in unbalanced bone remodeling. M2&#8208;macrophage&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (M2EVs) possess inherent immunomodulatory properties and promote stem cell differentiation; however, their therapeutic potential in diabetic bone regeneration is significantly limited by poor stability and insufficient osteoinductive capacity. Inspired by biomineralization, a calcium phosphate nanoparticle&#8208;immobilized macrophage&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicle nanohybrid (M2EV@CaP) is developed by in situ growth of inorganic nanocrystals on M2EV surfaces. In the nanohybrid system, the chemically inert CaP&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;reinforced shell provides structural protection for M2EV, inhibiting vesicle aggregation caused by membrane protein denaturation/cross&#8208;linking or lipid phase transition through physical barrier. More importantly, M2EV@CaP provides bioavailable calcium/phosphorus ion reservoirs and signaling molecules for bone regeneration and releases responsively under inflammation&#8208;induced acidic conditions. In vitro, M2EV@CaP significantly enhances macrophage polarization toward a reparative M2 phenotype, and promotes stem cell osteogenic differentiation under high&#8208;glucose inflammatory conditions by activating the Ca2+&#8211;Akt signaling axis. In vivo, hydrogel&#8208;assisted delivery of M2EV@CaP significantly promotes bone regeneration in diabetic rat calvarial defects through immunomodulation and osteoinduction. This study proposes a nanohybridization strategy based on inorganic nanoparticles reinforcing biostructures, offering a promising extracellular vesicle therapy for complex pathological conditions.

         <title>2D Chitin Sub&#8208;Nanosheets with Extreme Ion Transport for Nanofluidic Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study exfoliates chitin sub&#8208;nanosheets (&#8776;0.7 nm) via acid&#8208;directed stripping and&#160;mechanical dispersion, enabling&#160; an ultrathin nanofluidic membrane (&lt;2 &#181;m) through vacuum&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly. Applied to environmental sensing, it shows ultrahigh sensitivity. In osmotic energy harvesting, it achieves 12.95 W&#160;m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold gradient&#8212;the highest reported for bio&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
Nanofluidic membranes possess unique ion&#8208;selective transport properties, offering considerable potential for energy harvesting and sensing applications. However, the scarcity of anion&#8208;selective membranes has significantly hindered progress in these fields. Herein, the energy disparities among chitin crystalline planes are exploited to selectively cleave the low&#8208;energy (020) plane, facilitating the directional exfoliation of Bouligand&#8208;structured chitin into 2D sub&#8208;nanosheets (CSs) with an average thickness of 0.7 nm and lateral dimensions of 50&#8211;100 nm. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that a reduction in thickness significantly enhances both the ion transport flux (1.53 times) and selectivity (1.14 times), which in turn boosts the power output density to 12.95 W&#160;m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient surpassing all&#8208;existing biomass&#8208;based nanofluidic membranes (max. 2.87&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2) and the commercial benchmark (5.0 W&#160;m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the membranes' extreme ion management capabilities facilitate real&#8208;time nanofluidic sensing, as demonstrated in jellyfish cultivation monitoring. This study presents a cost&#8208;effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, positively&#8208;charged nanofluidic membranes with exceptional energy harvesting and sensing capabilities, laying the foundation for advanced energy and sensing technologies.

         <title>A Promising Biomimetic Hydrogen Sulfide System for Advancing Inflammatory Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by endogenous enzymatic H2S production, a biomimetic H2S supply system is developed. This system sustainably produces H2S at a constant rate throughout the dosing period, ensuring therapeutic efficacy while avoiding toxicity. This strategy also presents a versatile platform for delivering other highly reactive gasotransmitters with great therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exhibits a Janus&#8208;faced nature in the regulation of inflammatory diseases, acting as both a therapeutic agent and a pathological aggravator. Effectively harnessing its beneficial effects while mitigating its harmful impacts is pivotal for advancing H2S&#8208;based therapies. Here, an innovative H2S supply system is introduced that enables H2S to primarily exhibit its therapeutic effects. Unlike conventional synthetic H2S donor&#8208;based strategies, a biomimetic H2S supply system (termed CP) is presented that mimics endogenous enzymatic H2S production. The CP sustainably produces H2S at a constant rate throughout the dosing period, ensuring therapeutic benefits while avoiding toxicity. Furthermore, by functionalizing CP with hyaluronic acid, the resulting system (CPH) not only achieves targeted delivery to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) tissues but also provides controllable H2S production within the diseased microenvironment. Consequently, CPH significantly mitigates immune inflammation, promotes intestinal epithelial barrier repair, and modulates gut microbiota by sustainably and constantly supplying the multifunctional H2S. This study revolutionizes the H2S supply strategies and provides new insights into gas&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Field&#8208;Induced Structural Dynamics of Polarization Switching in HfxZr1&#8208;xO2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;induced structural dynamics of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric HfxZr1&#8208;xO2 (HZO) thin films are directly observed for the first time. Using in situ &#181;GIXRD and simulations, a direct correlation between structural changes and electrical behavior is established. The study reveals a unified switching mechanism driven by evolving tetragonal&#8208;orthorhombic phase stability. This research provides crucial insights for designing more efficient electronic devices.








Abstract
The polarization characteristics of HfxZr1&#8208;xO2 (HZO) are intrinsically linked to its crystal structure. Optimizing its functionality in ferroelectric (FE) and antiferroelectric (AFE) devices requires understanding the structural evolution during polarization switching, which remains insufficiently understood. Here, the switching mechanism in HZO thin films is elucidated by combining in situ microbeam grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction and first&#8208;principles&#8208;based metadynamics simulations, providing unambiguous evidence of phase evolution. Across compositions (x = 0 to 0.5),&#160;switching involves reversible transitions between the nonpolar tetragonal (t) P42/nmc and polar orthorhombic (o) Pca21 phases. Zr&#8208;rich AFE compounds undergo a complete t&#8208;phase transition during polarization reversal, while in Hf&#8208;rich FE compounds, transient t&#8208;phase formation facilitates the nucleation and growth of o&#8208;phase domains with reversed polarization. This study promotes engineering phase evolution in HZO for advanced devices.

Across compositions (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0 to 0.5),&#160;switching involves reversible transitions between the nonpolar tetragonal (t) &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;4&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;nmc&lt;/i&gt; and polar orthorhombic (o) &lt;i&gt;Pca&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phases. Zr-rich AFE compounds undergo a complete t-phase transition during polarization reversal, while in Hf-rich FE compounds, transient t-phase formation facilitates the nucleation and growth of o-phase domains with reversed polarization. This study promotes engineering phase evolution in HZO for advanced devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>"Green" Lead&#8208;Free Tellurite Glasses Used for Stable and Efficient X&#8208;Ray Detection and Array Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
Tellurate glass is widely regarded as a practical acousto&#8208;optic material, but it is not used for X&#8208;ray detection. The BTM and BTW glass resoundingly achieve a high efficiency detector with a maximum sensitivity of 316 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a detection limit of 5.4 nGyair&#8722;1. Glass&#8208;based array detector is finally showing the potential of imaging detection.








Abstract
Glass with the advantages of low cost, large area preparation, simple preparation process, and shape&#8208;controllable, has been widely used in the electric and optical fields. In this work, two novel sensitive X&#8208;ray detectors are reported using BaO&#8208;TeO2&#8208;MoO3 (BTM) glass and BaO&#8208;TeO2&#8208;WO3 (BTW) glass. Under 120 keV hard X&#8208;ray radiation, the BTM glass and BTW glass X&#8208;ray detectors exhibit sensitivities of 309 and 316 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, with minimum detection limits of 7.3 and 5.4 nGyair s&#8722;1, respectively. Although the BTM glass and BTW glass X&#8208;ray detectors are determined to be 239 and 287 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under the 40 keV soft X&#8208;ray radiation, the minimum detection limits are decreased to 5.7 and 3.2 nGyair s&#8722;1, which are 1000 times lower than the medical detection limit (5.5 &#181;Gyair s&#8722;1). The array detector assembled with drawn glass used as an isolated pixel without signal crosstalk displays uniform dark current and X&#8208;ray photocurrent, resulting in clear edge X&#8208;ray imaging patterns. In our work, a novel glass application has been realized and provides a potential commercial X&#8208;ray detector.

         <title>Independent Wavefront Multiplexing with Metasurfaces via Non&#8208;Injective Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a universal metasurface multiplexing strategy is presented based on non&#8208;injective transformation. By jointly optimizing two metasurfaces, multiplexed channels achieve independent wavefront control, overcoming crosstalk limits of single&#8208;layer designs. Experiments demonstrate ultra&#8208;compact orbital angular momentum (OAM) sorters and 10&#8208;channel holography without post&#8208;processing. This approach enables scalable, precise, and high&#8208;capacity wavefront manipulation for advanced photonic applications.








Abstract
Metasurface holography offers a powerful approach for manipulating wavefronts at the nano and micro scale. Extensive research has been conducted to enhance the multiplexing capacity for diverse wavefronts. However, the independence of multiplexed channels is fundamentally restricted in techniques using single&#8208;layer metasurfaces, resulting in unavoidable crosstalk and the need for post&#8208;filtering of the output wavefronts. Here, a universal wavefront multiplexing concept is presented based on non&#8208;injective transformation. By employing joint optimization on two metasurfaces, different channels can be independently designed without any constraints on the output wavefronts. To validate this approach, ultra&#8208;compact orbital angular momentum (OAM) sorters are designed. In these experiments, the output beams from different channels can be independently mapped to 2D positions with high fineness. In another application of wavefront&#8208;multiplexed holography, 10&#8208;channel multiplexing is experimentally achieved with minimal crosstalk and without the need for post&#8208;processing. These results demonstrate the independence between channels enabled by the non&#8208;injective transformation in the method. The precise wavefront control and high multiplexing capacity underscore its potential for scalable wavefront manipulation devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Anchored on Perovskite With Strong Metal&#8208;Oxide Interaction for Efficient High Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to in situ exsolution, surface single&#8208;atom engineering may play a more significant role in enhancing both the electrocatalytic activity and stability of cathodes in CO2RR. Accordingly, Ir atoms anchoring on the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8208;&#948; (SFM) are stabilized in a four&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Fe/Mo motif through strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). This structure drives interfacial charge redistribution and reduces the CO2RR activation barrier.








Abstract
Efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction remains a grand challenge in advancing carbon&#8208;neutral energy technologies. Here, an efficient solid&#8208;state approach for the fabrication of a novel single&#8208;atom Ir anchored Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8208;&#948; (SFM) perovskite electrocatalyst, designed for high temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) is reported. The resulting four&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Fe/Mo configuration induces pronounced interfacial electronic reconstruction and strong metal&#8208;oxide interaction, substantially lowering the energy barrier for CO2 electrolysis, as indicated by extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. When employed as a cathode in SOECs, the 2Ir/SFM (2 wt.% Ir) electrocatalyst achieves a high current density of 1.63 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.5 V and 800&#160;&#176;C, along with excellent Faradaic efficiency and long&#8208;term operational stability. These findings offer atomistic insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of single&#8208;atom/perovskite heterostructures, underscoring the commercial potential of SOECs for CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Ultralong and Thermally Enhanced Persistent Luminescence in Printable Recycled Polymers for Advanced Thermal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using BICz and BPCz embedded in recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), achieving remarkable long persistent luminescence (LPL) with ambient lifetimes exceeding 12 h and over 56 times thermally enhanced LPL at 500 K. Leveraging PET's excellent processability, the pioneering fabrication of complex 3D&#8208;printed luminescent structures that retain LPL functionality, enabling spatially resolved thermal sensing and real&#8208;time damage detection.








Abstract
Achieving long persistent luminescence (LPL) in fully organic materials with both hour&#8208;level duration and high thermal stability remains a fundamental challenge attributable to rapid exciton quenching and poor resistance to thermal disturbances. Herein, a trap engineering strategy is reported based on rigidified triphenylamine derivatives and boronic ester functionalization embedded in recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), enabling the first fully organic polymer&#8208;based LPL system that exhibits simultaneously ultralong LPL and exceptional thermal robustness. Molecular conformation locking and optimized donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer lead to deep trap states (&#8776;1.03&#160;eV), resulting in ambient LPL lifetimes exceeding 12 h. Remarkably, the luminescence is thermally enhanced by over 56 times at 500&#160;K, rivaling high&#8208;performance inorganic phosphors. In addition, 980&#160;nm near&#8208;infrared photo excitation further amplifies the emission, showcasing strong photo&#8208;stimulated luminescence capability. Taking advantage of PET's processability, 3D&#8208;printed luminescent structures are fabricated that retain LPL functionality and enable spatially resolved thermal sensing and real&#8208;time damage detection. This work not only introduces a sustainable and scalable platform for advanced thermal imaging and optoelectronics, but also sets a new benchmark in the design of heat&#8208;resistant organic LPL materials, bridging the gap between high&#8208;performance functionality and environmental compatibility.

Molecular conformation locking and optimized donor&#8211;acceptor charge transfer lead to deep trap states (&#8776;1.03&#160;eV), resulting in ambient LPL lifetimes exceeding 12 h. Remarkably, the luminescence is thermally enhanced by over 56 times at 500&#160;K, rivaling high-performance inorganic phosphors. In addition, 980&#160;nm near-infrared photo excitation further amplifies the emission, showcasing strong photo-stimulated luminescence capability. Taking advantage of PET's processability, 3D-printed luminescent structures are fabricated that retain LPL functionality and enable spatially resolved thermal sensing and real-time damage detection. This work not only introduces a sustainable and scalable platform for advanced thermal imaging and optoelectronics, but also sets a new benchmark in the design of heat-resistant organic LPL materials, bridging the gap between high-performance functionality and environmental compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chloroaluminate Molten Salts for Low&#8208;Temperature Electrochemical Recycling of Layered Metal Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point alkali chloroaluminate (AlCl3&#8211;LiCl) melt electrolyte, a low&#8208;temperature electrochemical recycling (LTMS&#8208;ECR) approach is developed, operating at only 150&#160;&#176;C. High O2&#8722; solubility in the melt facilitates the reductive de&#8208;structuring of cathodes, while the insolubility of resulting products enables their facile separation via water leaching. The LTMS&#8208;ECR approach is energy&#8208;saving and offers a 97.3% cobalt recovery rate with high economic viability.








Abstract
Electrochemical recycling (ECR) offers a promising strategy that harnesses renewable energy to deconstruct spent layered metal oxides (LMOs). However, current ECR approaches are limited to high&#8208;temperature operation (up to 750&#160;&#176;C) employing alkali carbonate or chloride melts as electrolytes, leading to high energy consumption for heat input. Here, this study proposes a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point alkali chloroaluminate melt electrolyte composed of AlCl3&#8211;LiCl, enabling ECR electrolysis at a temperature as low as 150&#160;&#176;C. Owing to the high solubility of O2&#8722; charge carrier in alkali chloroaluminate melt, LMO cathode undergoes electrochemical reductive de&#8208;structuring to yield elemental transition metals and lithium chloride (LiCl). Importantly, two products are insoluble in the Li2O&#8208;added melt and can be separated by a facile water leaching treatment. Notably, by incorporating an inert TiN anode, CO2 emission during the electrolysis is eliminated by instead generating O2, further contributing to carbon neutrality. With the low&#8208;temperature molten salt electrolyte ECR (LTMS&#8208;ECR) approach, a high cobalt recovery rate of 97.3% is achieved for LiCoO2. Technoeconomic analyses project that the LTMS&#8208;ECR technology reduces energy consumption and CO2 emission by &#8776;20% and is nearly ten times more profitable compared to conventional methods. The approach represents a revolutionary alternative for energy&#8208;effective, sustainable and economically viable recycling of spent LIBs.

         <title>Bisphosphonate&#8208;Embedded a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Passivator Enable Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells with Low&#8208;Polarity Solvent Processing</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;polarity solvent&#8208;soluble bisphosphate molecule, named DCTP, is introduced into n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs as a surface passivator. The DCTP&#8208;controlled device achieves a champion PCE of 26.07% with excellent reproducibility. Moreover, the DCTP&#8208;controlled device retains 90.1% of its initial PCE after 900 h of maximum power point tracking with 1&#8208;sun illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Interface passivators play a critical role in improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the conventional passivators often require processing in high&#8208;polarity solvents that can cause additional surface defects on the perovskite film, thereby reducing the efficiency and stability of n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. Herein, a bisphosphate molecule (named DCTP) is designed and synthesized to simultaneously address solvent compatibility, defect passivation, and hole extraction. DCTP has good solubility in low&#8208;polarity solvents such as toluene, chlorobenzene, and chloroform without damaging the perovskite surface. The chlorobenzene&#8208;processed DCTP interlayer can sufficiently passivate the defects on the perovskite surface and improve the energy level arrangement at the perovskite/hole transporting layer interface. Meanwhile, the DCTP layer effectively inhibits interlayer diffusion of formamidine (FA+), iodide (I&#8722;), and lithium (Li+) and ions under thermal stress. As a result, the DCTP&#8208;controlled device produces a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.07% with excellent reproducibility, compared to 24.28% for the reference device. More importantly, the operational stability of the device is significantly improved. The DCTP&#8208;treated device retains 90.1% of its initial PCE after 900 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at 65&#160;&#176;C under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol.

         <title>Engineering B&#8210;N Covalent Bond&#8208;Fused Naphthalene Derivatives for Narrowband Yellow Emission and Power&#8208;Efficient White OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double B&#9472;N covalent bond fusion on naphthalene has been proposed to design novel yellow fluorophores, showing a considerable bathochromic shift, decreased FWHM, and improved photoluminescent quantum yield. The corresponding white OLEDs achieve an unprecedented warm white light with a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 101.4 lm W&#8722;1@1000 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
The doping of B&#8210;N covalent bond into multiple resonance (MR) emitters is believed to enable easy synthesis while maintaining the intrinsic narrow spectral profile for high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, there is still an unexplored spot if the residual MR section is further removed. Herein, the molecular engineering of B&#8210;N covalent bond&#8208;fused naphthalene derivatives is demonstrated that are free of MR for yellow emission with a reduced spectral bandwidth and power&#8208;efficient white OLEDs. Starting from the BN&#8208;nap1 reference, a dual fusion strategy is proposed to design two new yellow emitters, BN&#8208;nap2 and BN&#8208;nap3, by integrating B&#8210;N bonds with naphthalene via a centro and axial symmetry, respectively. Both of them exhibit significantly red&#8208;shifted light to the yellow region, decreased full width at half maximum, improved photoluminescent quantum yield, due to the B&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;B conjugation and suppressed high&#8208;frequency vibrations. As a result, the corresponding warm white devices achieve a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 101.4 lm W&#8722;1 at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.342, 0.542). Further device optimization leads to a standard white electroluminescence with CIE coordinates of (0.334, 0.342). The unprecedented performance indicates the great potential of B&#8210;N covalent bond&#8208;fused naphthalene derivatives in power&#8208;efficient white OLEDs.

         <title>Mechanically Induced Bridged Interlayer Enabling Highly Reversible All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sulfur Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical mechanically induced bridged interlayer formation approach that enables highly reversible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sulfur cathodes is proposed. The mechanochemically formed LPSI interlayer simultaneously establishes an efficient and durable ionic conducting network through reduced Li&#8314; diffusion energy barrier and reinforced solid&#8211;solid interfacial contact, while functioning as redox mediators to facilitate spontaneous sulfur species activation and utilization.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density, low cost, and enhanced safety features. However, constrained solid&#8208;state sulfur conversion severely limits their cycling stability and rate performance, presenting significant obstacles to industrial implementation. Here, a mechanochemical synthesis approach is developed that simultaneously addresses multiscale kinetic limitations of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sulfur cathodes across molecular, interfacial, and electrode levels. The in situ generated amorphous lithium iodothiophosphate (LPSI) interlayer, chemically bridged between sulfur active materials and sulfide catholytes, establishes effective and durable Li&#8208;ion conduction pathways through reduced diffusion resistance and reinforced interfacial contact. Moreover, the LPSI functions as percolated redox mediators that modulate sulfur redox pathways and electrochemically activate sulfur species, facilitating rapid sulfur redox kinetics. The developed sulfur cathode (S@LPSI/LPSC) demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, maintaining 93.8% capacity retention, exceeding 1600 cycles at a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and an elevated current density of 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Pouch cells incorporating the S@LPSI/LPSC cathode demonstrate gravimetric energy densities exceeding 420&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.

     alt="Mechanically Induced Bridged Interlayer Enabling Highly Reversible All-Solid-State Sulfur Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A practical mechanically induced bridged interlayer formation approach that enables highly reversible all-solid-state sulfur cathodes is proposed. The mechanochemically formed LPSI interlayer simultaneously establishes an efficient and durable ionic conducting network through reduced Li&#8314; diffusion energy barrier and reinforced solid&#8211;solid interfacial contact, while functioning as redox mediators to facilitate spontaneous sulfur species activation and utilization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) show great promise for next-generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density, low cost, and enhanced safety features. However, constrained solid-state sulfur conversion severely limits their cycling stability and rate performance, presenting significant obstacles to industrial implementation. Here, a mechanochemical synthesis approach is developed that simultaneously addresses multiscale kinetic limitations of all-solid-state sulfur cathodes across molecular, interfacial, and electrode levels. The in situ generated amorphous lithium iodothiophosphate (LPSI) interlayer, chemically bridged between sulfur active materials and sulfide catholytes, establishes effective and durable Li-ion conduction pathways through reduced diffusion resistance and reinforced interfacial contact. Moreover, the LPSI functions as percolated redox mediators that modulate sulfur redox pathways and electrochemically activate sulfur species, facilitating rapid sulfur redox kinetics. The developed sulfur cathode (S@LPSI/LPSC) demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, maintaining 93.8% capacity retention, exceeding 1600 cycles at a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an elevated current density of 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Pouch cells incorporating the S@LPSI/LPSC cathode demonstrate gravimetric energy densities exceeding 420&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides valuable insights into highly reversible all-solid-state sulfur cathodes, significantly advancing the industrialization of ASSLSB technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Horn&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Tubular Composites for Recoverable High&#8208;Energy Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A horn&#8208;inspired composite is fabricated by integrating a concentric lamellar&#8208;aligned scaffold with a dynamic covalent epoxy matrix. This material achieves high recoverable energy absorption (10 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), compressive strength (&gt;50 MPa), and cyclic mechanical recovery. This scalable biomimetic strategy provides a pathway toward lightweight, reusable protective systems with exceptional energy dissipation.








Abstract
Recoverable energy&#8208;absorbing materials are crucial for advancing impact&#8208;resistant systems; however, they are typically limited by low energy dissipation (&lt;1 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3). The horn of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) exhibits outstanding energy dissipation and shape recovery, enabled by multiscale mechanisms including aligned tubules and lamellar keratin cells, along with hydration&#8208;driven self&#8208;recovery. Inspired by this hierarchical architecture, a recoverable porous energy&#8208;absorbing composite through a modified gelation&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly method is fabricated to construct a microtubular scaffold with lamellar&#8208;aligned nanoplatelets, which is subsequently infiltrated with a dynamic covalent epoxy matrix. The optimized composite exhibits exceptional energy absorption (10 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), exceeding conventional recoverable architected materials by an order of magnitude, while simultaneously achieving high compressive strength (&gt; 50 MPa), low density (1.1 g&#183;cm&#8722;3), and stable cyclic shape recovery performance. These mechanical properties arise from synergistic multiscale toughening mechanisms, including tubular buckling (macroscale), lamellar crack deflection and interfacial delamination (microscale), and matrix viscoelasticity (nanoscale). The epoxy matrix further contributes to reversible deformation and cyclic damage recovery. This study establishes a scalable biomimetic strategy for engineering lightweight, high&#8208;strength, and reusable materials with high energy dissipation, addressing critical challenges in potential protective applications.

         <title>Heterogenized Copper(II) Phenanthroline Catalysts for Electroreduction of CO2 to C2 Compounds: Substitution on the Ligand Causes Structural Changes to the Molecular Framework and Stability Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a previously reported binuclear Cu(II) phenanthroline catalyst, a structurally modified version with enhanced stability for electrochemical reduction of CO2 is developed. The second&#8208;generation system allows for stable operation in an MEA electrolyzer with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;70% for C2 products at elevated current densities. In situ XAS spectroscopy provided mechanistic insights.








Abstract
Molecular Cu catalysts have shown promise for electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon products. Unlike metallic Cu facets, they offer precise control over the active site's electronic and steric configuration. However, prior studies identified critical challenges related to irreversible potential&#8208;induced formation of Cu particles, which participate in the eCO2RR and obscure the role of molecular motifs. Based on a previously reported binuclear Cu(II) phenanthroline catalyst, a structurally modified second&#8208;generation system with enhanced stability is developed. By introducing methoxy groups to the phenanthroline ligand, the molecular framework changes from a binuclear complex to an oligonuclear step&#8208;like structure consisting of Cu(II) ions linked by &#181;2&#8208; and &#181;3&#8208;OH groups. When immobilized on a gas diffusion electrode, stable operation with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;70% for C2 products is achieved at elevated current densities. In situ XAS spectroscopy shows only negligible changes of the Cu coordination environment up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. When approaching 250 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, partial and reversible phase evolution occurs under Cu2+ valence state reduction, followed by phase recovery upon bias removal. This system combines structural robustness with adaptive redox behavior, demonstrating a route for implementing molecular electrocatalysts in eCO2RR processes at industrial current densities.

         <title>Deterministic Printing of Single Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method has been developed for the additive manufacturing of single photon&#8208;emitting quantum dots and their deterministic positioning and heterointegration with photonic systems: single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing. Using dielectrophoretics, polarizability contrast, and surface energetics, SPEED introduces a new, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and single photon&#8208;emitting quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.








Abstract
The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size&#8208;tunable emission, and high quantum yield make them ideal candidates for applications in secure quantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single&#8208;cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum device architectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model is presented, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, a near&#8208;zero&#8208;waste nanomanufacturing process, overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub&#8208;zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity&#8208;QD integration and single&#8208;photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Encapsulated FeNi3 in Wood&#8208;Derived N&#8208;Doped CNTs Arrays for Efficient and Stable AEM Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, self&#8208;standing, and sustainable electrocatalyst that integrates tip&#8208;encapsulated FeNi3 alloys in N&#8208;doped CNTs arrays with 3D low&#8208;tortuosity porous structure of delignified wood carbon (FeNi3&#8208;NCNTs@DWC) is demonstrated to achieve efficient and stable natural seawater electrolysis for &gt;2000&#160;h at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 (decay rate &lt;0.0188&#160;mV h&#8722;1).








Abstract
While anion exchange membrane seawater electrolysis (AEMSE) is a promising green hydrogen generation technology, its industrial implementation remains hindered by the lack of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts. Here, an innovative electrocatalyst featuring tip&#8208;encapsulated FeNi3 alloy nanoparticles within N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes arrays in situ grown on delignified wood carbon (FeNi3&#8208;NCNTs@DWC), integrating tip effect&#8208;induced electron metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) with structural advantages of wood&#8208;based carbon is reported. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong EMSI between FeNi3 alloys and NCNTs@DWC optimizes the interfacial electron configuration and reduces the reaction barrier, thereby enhancing activity and stability. Notably, the dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;repelling layer formed by the tip effect and Ni(Fe)OOH species inhibits Cl&#8722;, while selectively adsorbing OH&#8722;. Consequently, when integrated into an AEMSE cell, it delivers impressive industrial&#8208;level performance, achieving a cell voltage of 1.88&#160;V at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 with over 2000&#160;h durability (decay rate &lt;0.0188&#160;mV h&#8722;1) in alkaline natural seawater. This corresponds to a 98% electrolysis efficiency, an energy consumption of 49.4&#160;kWh kg&#8722;1 H2, and a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 19.6%. This strategy advances AEMSE toward practical implementation by coupling the tip effect with wood&#8208;derived structural engineering, thereby achieving high activity, selectivity, and long&#8208;term operational stability.

&lt;p&gt;A low-cost, self-standing, and sustainable electrocatalyst that integrates tip-encapsulated FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alloys in N-doped CNTs arrays with 3D low-tortuosity porous structure of delignified wood carbon (FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NCNTs@DWC) is demonstrated to achieve efficient and stable natural seawater electrolysis for &amp;gt;2000&#160;h at 2.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (decay rate &amp;lt;0.0188&#160;mV h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anion exchange membrane seawater electrolysis (AEMSE) is a promising green hydrogen generation technology, its industrial implementation remains hindered by the lack of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts. Here, an innovative electrocatalyst featuring tip-encapsulated FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alloy nanoparticles within N-doped carbon nanotubes arrays in situ grown on delignified wood carbon (FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-NCNTs@DWC), integrating tip effect-induced electron metal-support interactions (EMSI) with structural advantages of wood-based carbon is reported. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong EMSI between FeNi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alloys and NCNTs@DWC optimizes the interfacial electron configuration and reduces the reaction barrier, thereby enhancing activity and stability. Notably, the dual Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-repelling layer formed by the tip effect and Ni(Fe)OOH species inhibits Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, while selectively adsorbing OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, when integrated into an AEMSE cell, it delivers impressive industrial-level performance, achieving a cell voltage of 1.88&#160;V at 2.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with over 2000&#160;h durability (decay rate &amp;lt;0.0188&#160;mV h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in alkaline natural seawater. This corresponds to a 98% electrolysis efficiency, an energy consumption of 49.4&#160;kWh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a record solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 19.6%. This strategy advances AEMSE toward practical implementation by coupling the tip effect with wood-derived structural engineering, thereby achieving high activity, selectivity, and long-term operational stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Chiral Recognition of Biothiols by Enantiomeric Nanoclusters in Plasma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral silver nanoclusters with a twisted octahedral framework enable the enantioselective recognition, quantification, and differentiation of biothiols in plasma through circular dichroism, owing to their hierarchical enantioselectivity and intrinsic chirality. These properties facilitate the formation of supramolecular aggregates with distinct binding affinities and assembly structures, enhancing the sensitivity and specificity in biothiol detection.








Abstract
The biomimetic chiral recognition and detection of biothiols, such as cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione, in plasma present significant challenges due to the limited understanding of chiral recognition mechanisms beyond the molecular level. Herein, enantiomeric and twisted octahedron silver nanoclusters (D&#8208;/L&#8208;Ag6SP6), featuring bichirality at both the molecular and nanoscopic scales, are designed and synthesized by employing a chiral bidentate ligand of thiazolethione enantiomer (D&#8208; or L&#8208;4&#8208;phenylthiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione, abbreviated as D&#8208;SP or L&#8208;SP) in conjunction with silver acetate. The resulting nanoclusters are further modified with PEG2000 to produce water&#8208;dispersible D&#8208;Ag6SP6@PEG and L&#8208;Ag6SP6@PEG nanoparticles, enabling enantioselective recognition and quantitative determination of various biothiols in plasma through circular dichroism measurements. The study also elucidates the bichiral recognition and determination of biothiols through a ligand&#8208;induced disassembly&#8208;assembly mechanism. Both D&#8208; and L&#8208;type Ag6SP6@PEG nanoparticles demonstrate excellent anti&#8208;interference properties for discriminating biothiols using principal component analysis. The bichirality of nanoclusters shows high enantioselectivity in chiral recognition of biothiols and their corresponding enantiomers. This work not only provides a convenient strategy for bichiral recognition and quantitative determination of biothiols in plasma, but also holds promise for developing hierarchically chiral nanomaterials applicable in biomedical engineering, nanomedicine, and drug screening.

         <title>Tandem Restriction Between Spatial Confinement and Dipole Interaction for Suppressing Thermal Quenching of Phosphorescence from Cycloolefin Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefited from the chain segment motion restriction, moisture barrier characteristic and chemical resistance of cycloolefin polymer matrix, multicolored and quaternary&#8208;integrated dynamic phosphorescence is generated. The phosphorescence shows outstanding resistance to elevated temperature, high humidity, strong acid and alkali environment.








Abstract
Construction of a rigid environment is a well&#8208;developed strategy for suppressing non&#8208;radiative deactivation of organic chromophores and generating long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). However, it is challenging for the formed rigid networks to maintain their stability at elevated temperature. In this work, a series of ester&#8208;rich cycloolefin polymers (COPs) are synthesized via controlled copolymerization procedure. The dipole interactions originated from ester groups show efficient suppressing effects on the non&#8208;radiative deactivation of multi&#8208;cyclic chromophores, achieving irradiation&#8208;dependent and multi&#8208;colored RTP. These COPs can also emit decent high&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP). The investigation about the phosphorescence thermal quenching reveals that the spatial confinement of the cyclic skeleton in COPs can suppress the dissociation of dipole interactions of ester. By further incorporating bulky adamantyl groups, a breakthrough in red, yellow, and green HTP from common multi&#8208;cyclic chromophores is successfully achieved, even under hygrothermal exposure. Benefiting from the irradiation&#8208;dependent RTP and HTP performance, the obtained COPs are successfully applied in imaging under hygrothermal exposure, temperature monitoring of chemical reactions, and hydrogen peroxide detection.

         <title>Positive and Negative Triboelectricity Checkered Board Design for Friction Force and Heat Suppression in Triboelectrification Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed to suppress strong interface electrostatic adhesion and heat generation in triboelectrification process by material arrangement and structure design.








Abstract
Interfacial electrostatic attraction during the triboelectrification process inevitably increases frictional resistance and heat loss. However, rational strategies to mitigate these strong electrostatic forces at the triboelectric interface remain lacking. Herein, a positive and negative triboelectricity checkered board design is proposed to suppress both friction and heat generation in sliding triboelectric nanogenrator (TENG). The continuous balance of interfacial charge attraction and repulsion forces is maintained during the sliding process. By systematically investigating the friction and adhesion force, frictional heating, and electrical outputs of various types of sliding&#8208;mode TENGs, this checkered board design TENG (CB&#8208;TENG) reduces the sliding friction force and static friction force by more than 30% and 80% compared with the lock&#8208;free TENG, and exhibits a maximum temperature reduction of 69.5% as that of the freestanding TENG (FS&#8208;TENG). Besides, the CB&#8208;TENG achieves 220% enhancement in transferred charge and fourfold enhancement in output energy of FS&#8208;TENG over the same sliding distance. Moreover, the segmented electrode design and phase difference in dual&#8208;channel AC outputs also enable it function as a direction and displacement sensor for intelligent driving systems. The proposed novel strategy to solve friction resistance and heat loss must lead TENG with high output and durability to more mature applications.

         <title>Beyond Transistor Miniaturization: A Single&#8208;Device Approach to Reconfigurable Logic Gates in 2D Organic Single&#8208;Crystalline Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;device platform integrating transistors, rectifiers, and logic gates using 2D organic single&#8208;crystalline heterojunctions is reported. The device achieves a record rectification ratio of 1.1 &#215;&#160;108 and enables real&#8208;time reconfiguration between AND and OR logic operations through polarity&#8208;controlled charge injection and bias&#8208;modulated photoresponse.








Abstract
Reconfigurable device architectures are crucial for overcoming the scaling limitations of organic electronics. In this study, a single&#8208;device platform is presented that integrates transistor, rectifier, and logic gate functionalities using molecularly thin 2D organic single&#8208;crystalline heterojunctions. The reconfigurable asymmetric heterojunction (RAH), featuring a drain&#8208;aligned p&#8211;n interface, enables polarity&#8208;controlled switching between Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling and thermally activated injection, achieving a record rectification ratio of 1.1 &#215;&#160;108 and a dynamic rectification window spanning eight orders of magnitude. The asymmetric injection also induces a significant bias&#8208;polarity&#8208;dependent photoresponse, with a maximum photoresponsivity of 788&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a specific detectivity of 1.17 &#215;&#160;1014 Jones under positive bias, and a substantially suppressed photoresponse due to heterointerface recombination under negative bias. The synergistic interplay between electrostatic gating and bias&#8208;modulated photocarrier transport further enables real&#8208;time reconfiguration between AND and OR logic operations within a single device, effectively doubling functional density. These results position 2D RAHs as building blocks for compact, reconfigurable optoelectronic circuits.

These results position 2D RAHs as building blocks for compact, reconfigurable optoelectronic circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Pa&#8208;Level Persistent Mechanoluminescent Material Toward All&#8208;Optical Neural Synapses for Tactile&#8208;Visual Information Recognition and Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents an ultrasensitive Pa&#8208;Level persistent mechanoluminescent material via Li+/Dy3+ co&#8208;doping&#8208;mediated defect engineering of a Sr2SiO4:Eu2+, achieving dual breakthroughs in sensitivity and signal clarity enabled by synergistic oxygen vacancy optimization and strontium vacancy suppression. Simultaneously, it enables multi&#8208;stimuli response to solar light, mechanical force, and thermal input, replicating diverse synaptic functionalities such as tactile nerve perception, optic nerve imaging, short&#8208;term potentiation, and information memory.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML), a self&#8208;recovering and passive luminescent modality, offers a promising path toward tactile&#8208;visual all&#8208;optical neuromorphic computing, potentially overcoming the inefficiency of von Neumann architecture. However, existing ML materials are hindered by high response thresholds and single&#8208;mode luminescence, preventing sub&#8208;kPa perception and multilevel neural transmission. Here, we employ Li+/Dy3+ co&#8208;doping in Sr2SiO4:Eu2+ (LSSO) to implement a defect engineering strategy that synergistically optimizes oxygen vacancies and suppresses strontium vacancies, achieving dual breakthroughs in sensitivity and signal clarity. This approach yields a record&#8208;low ML threshold of 72 Pa&#8212;the only Pa&#8208;level system achieved without external electricity or elastomeric structural modifications. This material also responds to sunlight, force, and heat, emulating diverse synaptic functions like tactile/optic nerve perception, short&#8208;term potentiation, and memory. It exhibits a 7&#8208;s persistent ML with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 20.57 which is 15.6 times higher than commercial SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+, a micron&#8208;scale imaging resolution (&#8776;200 &#181;m), and a 36&#8208;hour memory capacity. These properties enable thermal&#8208;activated information awakening and visual imaging over 1000 cycles, with a memory accuracy 209% superior to the Ebbinghaus curve. This work not only advances the design of all&#8208;optical synapses but also forges a pivotal connection between ML and neuromorphic engineering, propelling energy&#8208;efficient, light&#8208;driven artificial intelligence.

         <title>Highly Tunable Synaptic Modulation in Photo&#8208;Activated Remote Charge Trap Memory for Hardware&#8208;Based Fault&#8208;Tolerant Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photo&#8208;activated remote charge&#8208;trap memory utilizing defect&#8208;engineered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), achieving a synaptic tunability ratio (STR) of 4,380. This device enables optical control of the learning rate, facilitating fault&#8208;tolerant training on mislabeled datasets and enhancing recognition accuracy while reducing peripheral overhead in in&#8208;memory computing systems.









Abstract
The rapid expansion of deep learning applications for unstructured data analysis has led to a substantial increase in energy consumption. This increase is primarily due to matrix&#8208;vector multiplication operations, which dominate the energy usage during inference. Although in&#8208;memory computing technologies have alleviated some inefficiencies caused by parallel computing, they still face challenges with broader computational algorithms required for advanced deep learning models. In real&#8208;world data collection scenarios, datasets often contain &#8220;noisy labels&#8221; (errors in annotations), which cause recognition inefficiencies in conventional in&#8208;memory computing. Here, a hardware&#8208;based fault&#8208;tolerant learning algorithm designed for artificial synapses with tunable synaptic operation is proposed. In this scheme, the devices simultaneously process both learning and regulatory signals, enabling selective attenuation of weight updates induced by mistraining signals. Utilizing a high synaptic tunability ratio of 4380 realized in photo&#8208;activated remote charge trap memory devices based on defect&#8208;engineered hexagonal boron nitride(h&#8208;BN), the system nearly completely suppresses weight update signals from mislabeled data, which leads to improved recognition accuracy on the mislabeled Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset. These results demonstrate that tunable synaptic devices can enhance training efficiency in in&#8208;memory computing systems for mislabeled datasets, thereby reducing the need for extensive data cleansing and preparation.

         <title>Ultrafast Preparation of 10&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;Thick Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Au (111) Foils</title>

         <dc:description>
10&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Au (111) foils are rapidly prepared by annealing commercial polycrystalline Au foils in air at 1040 &#176;C. The mechanism of multiple abnormal grains growth is revealed by combining experiments and phase&#8208;field simulation. During the annealing, oxygen plays an important role in inhibiting thermal grooves of grain boundaries, thereby reducing the resistance to abnormal grain growth.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal Au foils are widely used in mechanics, catalysis, and as substrates for 2D material growth. However, the preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Au foils, particularly thin foils, remains challenging because of the inhibition of abnormal grain growth by thermal grooves caused by surface self&#8208;diffusion. Here, an oxygen&#8208;promoted annealing method is reported for the preparation of 10&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick single&#8208;crystal Au (111) foils. The nonuniform distribution of residual stress in the polycrystalline Au foil accelerates the growth and coalescence of multiple abnormal grains, so that a single&#8208;crystal Au (111) foil with an area of up to 100&#8208;cm2 can be obtained within a 10 min annealing process. This method demonstrates superior preparation efficiency compared to current techniques. Mechanistic analysis confirms that oxygen incorporation effectively inhibits the formation of thermal grooves, and the resulting reduction in groove depth enhances abnormal grain growth. Furthermore, bulk single&#8208;crystal Au (111) foils can be prepared using the as&#8208;obtained foils as an epitaxial template. This method is also applicable for the preparation of single&#8208;crystal Pt (111) foils. The findings open new pathways for the scalable production and application of single&#8208;crystal noble metal foils.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Debye&#8208;Type Relaxor Ferroelectric Crystals Enable Broadband Photo&#8208;Pyroelectric Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Debye&#8208;type relaxation is unlocked in a metal&#8208;free molecular ferroelectric, of which large pyroelectric figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit enable wide&#8208;spectral photodetection covering UV to NIR&#8208;II wavelengths.








Abstract
Relaxor ferroelectrics have shown promising potential for various device applications, such as medical ultrasound transducers, pyroelectric infrared detectors, and electro&#8208;optic elements. Currently, relaxor ferroelectrics primarily consist of inorganic oxides, while achieving a pronounced relaxation in metal&#8208;free molecular ferroelectrics remains challenging due to the strong coupling between the relaxation mechanism and molecular dipole dynamics under applied electric fields. Consequently, this constraint leads to limited studies on their relaxation behavior and hinders progress in high&#8208;sensitivity applications, such as photo&#8208;pyroelectric detection. Here, Debye&#8208;type relaxation is unlocked in the molecular ferroelectric of bis(imidazolium) L&#8208;tartrate. In contrast to inorganic counterparts, this metal&#8208;free transparent single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric exhibits rare Debye&#8208;type dielectric relaxation arising from the molecular dipole reorientation that relates to the dynamic motion of organic imidazolium. Exceptionally, broadband photo&#8208;pyroelectric effects allow inch&#8208;size crystals for wide&#8208;spectral photodetection spanning UV to NIR&#8208;II wavelengths (266&#8211;1950 nm), breaking the conventional bandgap constraint on conventional materials. This work demonstrates that Debye&#8208;type relaxor molecular ferroelectrics are promising candidates for high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;pyroelectric detectors.

         <title>Tailoring Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfaces via Electrolyte Additive Engineering for Reliable 5&#160;V&#8208;Class 500&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1 Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A major obstacle for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) lies in electrode interfacial instability and the intrinsic flammability of electrolytes. An innovative additive engineering strategy along with facile fire&#8208;retardant mixing is smartly developed to efficiently tackle these long&#8208;standing stability and safety challenges in high&#8208;voltage LMBs, while enabling a high energy density exceeding 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
The inherent incompatibility of nonaqueous electrolytes with highly reactive cathodes, along with their high flammability, severely impedes the development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, functional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes are designed by incorporating 1,2&#8208;bis(bromoacetoxy)ethane (BBAE) additive, demonstrating the intrinsic nonflammability and remarkable operation of 5.0&#160;V cells. Experimental results and theoretical simulations uncover that the addition of BBAE induces a self&#8208;absorption plane and modifies the solvation structure, leading to the in situ formation of reinforced hybrid halide electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (EEIs), which suppress surface parasitic reactions under high&#8208;voltage conditions above 4.5&#160;V while inhibiting lithium dendrite growth on the lithium metal anode. Moreover, the optimized electrolytes exhibit enhanced fire retardancy thanks to the contribution from the bromine functionality within BBAE and the effective combination with nonflammable triethyl phosphate. Consequently, LMBs equipped with typical cathodes including LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM90), high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2, etc., exhibit exceptional deep cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerant capability over a broad voltage window of 4.1 &#8722; 5.0&#160;V. Additionally, 520&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 NCM90||Li pouch cells surprisingly pass the nail penetration tests, highlighting the prominent safety. This straightforward and cost&#8208;effective approach provides an inspirational strategy for the safe application of LMBs by reinforcing the interface stability and reconciling the electrolyte flame retardancy.

         <title>A Pupillary Light Reflex Inspired Self&#8208;Adaptive Spiking Visual Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a self&#8208;adaptive spiking visual neuron (SASVN) to enable active visual adaptation, extend the perception range, and facilitate frequency&#8208;modulated encoding in neuromorphic electronics. Such devices achieve spike&#8208;encoded and self&#8208;adaptive vision with a 160 dB dynamic range and light&#8208;intensity regimes spanning over 6 orders of magnitude (0.2 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 to 1.64 W/cm&#8722;2), outperforming previous artificial adaptive visual neurons.








Abstract
The development of neuromorphic visual systems aims to address the energy&#8208;efficiency and adaptability constraints in machine vision. However, artificial visual neurons in these systems mostly encode amplitude&#8208;modulated signals and adjust the perception range through passive gate voltage modulation, resulting in low biological fidelity. A pupillary&#8208;light&#8208;reflex&#8208;inspired self&#8208;adaptive spiking visual neuron with a superior perception range and active visual adaptation is proposed. The device functionally emulates the hierarchical visual adaptation process of human eyes through the active optical regulation of a photochromic film, photoelectric conversion through an IGCdO&#8208;based transistor, and spiking encoding through a TaOX&#8208;based memristor&#8208;based memristor). This configuration possesses a perception range of 160 dB and active visual adaptation under extreme light intensity conditions ranging from 0.2 &#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 to 1.64 W&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming previous artificial visual neurons. The advantage of active visual adaptation has been validated by integration with a spiking neural network, achieving an 86% recognition accuracy in classification tasks, a 66% improvement over non&#8208;adaptive counterparts. This bio&#8208;inspired design would endow machine vision systems with a high&#8208;level of biological fidelity.

         <title>Probing and Tuning Strain&#8208;Localized Exciton Emission in 2D Material Bubbles at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an approach: 1) to directly visualize the associated exciton properties, revealing an intrinsic emission wavelength shift, and 2) actively modify local strain, enabling further exciton emission tuning. These findings provide direct insights into the strain&#8208;localized emission dynamics in bubbles and establish a robust framework for non&#8208;destructive, reversible, and predictable nanoscale emission control, presenting a potential avenue for developing next&#8208;generation tunable quantum optical sources.








Abstract
In monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides bubbles&#8212;nanoscale deformations typically exhibiting a dome&#8208;like shape&#8212;Excitons are confined by the strain effect, which exhibits extraordinary emission properties, such as single photon generation, enhanced light emission, and spectrally tunable excitonic states. While the strain profiles of these bubbles are extensively studied, this work provides an approach 1) to directly visualize the associated exciton properties in bubbles formed in WSe2 monolayer, revealing an intrinsic emission wavelength shift of &#8776;40 nm, and 2) actively modify local strain, enabling further exciton emission tuning over a range of 50 nm. These are achieved by emission mapping and nanoindentation using a dielectric near&#8208;field probe, which enables the detection of local emission spectra and emission lifetimes within individual bubbles. Statistical analysis of 67 bubbles uncovers an emission wavelength distribution centered around 780 nm. Furthermore, saturation behavior in the power&#8208;dependent studies and the associated lifetime change reveal the localized nature of the strain&#8208;induced states. These findings provide direct insights into the strain&#8208;localized emission dynamics in bubbles and establish a robust framework for non&#8208;destructive, reversible, and predictable nanoscale emission control, presenting a potential avenue for developing next&#8208;generation tunable quantum optical sources.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Monolithic Multi&#8208;Band LEDs for Simultaneous Short&#8208;Wavelength and Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic multi&#8208;band LED capable of simultaneously emitting short&#8208; and mid&#8208;wavelength infrared light is demonstrated, enabled by Sb doping&#8211;driven strain engineering that achieves balanced strain compensation and coherent epitaxy in the quantum wells. The device is experimentally validated to adjust the emission wavelength via a simulation&#8208;based fabrication feasibility map, providing an innovative platform for multi&#8208;spectral analysis in future optoelectronic devices. 








Abstract
Multiple quantum well (MQW) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) provide precise wavelength control, making them ideal light sources. However, achieving simultaneous short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR, 1&#8211;3&#160;&#181;m) and mid&#8208;wavelength infrared (MWIR, 3&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m) emission from a single LED presents significant technical challenges due to lattice mismatch and reduced quantum efficiency when MQW structures with distinct bandgap energies are integrated onto a single substrate. As a result, most LEDs typically operate in only one IR band. In this study, monolithic multi&#8208;band MQW LEDs capable of simultaneous SWIR and MWIR emission are demonstrated. Strain engineering via Sb doping in the QWs induces well&#8208;distributed local lattice distortions, such as modulations of atomic bond angles and lengths, leading to balanced strain compensation and coherent epitaxy with atomically sharp interfaces within the MQWs. Reducing the QW thickness of InAsSb enhances quantum confinement, enabling simultaneous SWIR and MWIR emission at 2.87 and 3.18&#160;&#181;m. To further extend the emission range, a simulation&#8208;based fabrication feasibility map is developed, and an additional monolithic LED that emits simultaneously at 2.63 and 3.34&#160;&#181;m is fabricated. The monolithic integration of multi&#8208;band emission into a single device not only reduces size and complexity but also facilitates multispectral analysis for future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Organic Cation Methylation Design of Hybrid Eu(II)&#8208;based Halide Scintillators for Improved X&#8208;Ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>

An organic cation methylation strategy is proposed to design PMIMEuX3 (PMIM&#8208;X, PMIM = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium, X = Br, I) and PDMIMEuX3 (PDMIM&#8208;X, PDMIM = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium). PDMIM&#8208;X scintillator with a low detection limit and ultra&#8208;high light output effectively suppresses nonradiative recombination between luminescent centers and the halogen vacancy defects. Moreover, highly transparent, large&#8208;area PDMIM&#8208;Br@film with a resolution of 21.1 lp mm&#8722;1 is prepared by rapid in situ solution processing for X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid scintillators (OIHSs) have emerged as promising candidates for X&#8208;ray imaging. However, inhibiting the concentration quenching effect and reducing vacancy defects remain major challenges for high&#8208;performance OIHSs. Herein, a modification strategy of organic cation methylation is introduced to prepare PDMIMEuX3 (PDMIM&#8208;X, PDMIM = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium, X = Br, I) upon PMIMEuX3 (PMIM&#8208;X, PMIM = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium). Benefiting from the increased Eu&#8208;Eu chain spacing and structural rigidity by the steric effect of inserted cationic methylation, PDMIM&#8208;X suppresses nonradiative recombination between luminescent centers and the halogen vacancy defects. Particularly, PDMIM&#8208;Br designed via such a cation methylation exhibits high light output, which is 3.57 and 9.7 times higher than that of commercial Lu3Al5O12:Ce and original PMIM&#8208;Br, respectively, and thus it also demonstrates a low detection limit of 42.61 nGy s&#8722;1. Moreover, leveraging the capability of rapid in situ solution processing, a transparent and large&#8208;area PDMIM&#8208;Br@film is prepared with a spatial resolution of 21.1 lp mm&#8722;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging. This study developed high&#8208;performance OIHSs and further provided an effective strategy via materials design to improve the detection and imaging capabilities.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Driven Nanomotors Integrating With Platelet&#8208;Thylakoid Hybrid Membranes for Synchronized Thrombolysis and Vascular Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;responsive nanomotors PSr@PT NPs, which integrate thylakoid and platelet membranes on strontium&#8208;doped mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles, can transform transient thrombus removal into self&#8208;sustained vascular repair through biology&#8208;inspired actuation mechanisms.








Abstract
The pathological interplay of oxidative stress, inflammation, and thrombosis driven by endothelial injury creates a self&#8208;perpetuating cycle that undermines conventional thrombolytic therapies. Herein, near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive nanomotors are constructed by integrating thylakoid and platelet membranes on strontium&#8208;doped mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (PSr@PT NPs), which enables synchronized thrombus dissolution and vascular microenvironment restoration. Following intravenous administration, PSr@PT nanomotors exhibited preferential accumulation within thrombi and were internalized by injured endothelial cells. Meanwhile, thylakoid&#8208;embedded catalase catalyzed endogenous hydrogen peroxide to oxygen, which can not only suppress oxidative damage and neutralize to disrupt platelet&#8208;endothelium interactions, but also generate self&#8208;propulsive forces via gas propulsion, facilitating deep intrathrombus penetration of PSr@PT NPs. Proteomic analysis revealed that PSr@PT NPs inhibited thrombosis progression by downregulating platelet activation and modulating JAK&#8208;STAT/PI3K&#8208;Akt signaling pathways, thereby reducing inflammation and fostering angiogenesis. Local NIR irradiation induced mild photothermal conversion of PSr@PT NPs, which softened fibrin networks, enhanced intrathrombus infiltration, and accelerated localized thrombolysis. In both FeCl3&#8208;induced murine carotid thrombosis and arachidonic acid&#8208;induced zebrafish thrombosis models, the PSr@PT NPs effectively resolved occlusions and restored endothelial function. By coupling ROS&#8208;powered propulsion with adaptive microenvironment remodeling, this nanomotor transcends conventional 1D clot lysis, offering a dynamic strategy to prevent thrombosis recurrence and accelerate functional vascular recovery.

         <title>MoO2&#8208;Mediated Ni&#9472;Fe Bond Contraction and Electronic Modulation in Ni3Fe Alloy for Efficient Water Electrolysis at High&#8208;Current&#8208;Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoO2 effectively modulates the electronic structure of Ni3Fe and optimizes the Ni&#9472;Fe bonding configuration, thereby enabling dual regulation of the Volmer&#8208;Heyrovsky steps and the evolution pathways of reaction intermediates during the water electrolysis process, which collectively accelerates&#160;both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction; in addition, the catalyst exhibits superhydrophilic/superaerophobic properties, facilitating electrolyte exchange and bubble release.








Abstract
Ni3Fe alloy electrocatalysts show promising activity for water electrolysis but are limited by sluggish hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) kinetics, and inefficient gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer under high&#8208;current&#8208;densities. Here, a superhydrophilic/superaerophobic 3D carbonized wood&#8208;loaded Ni3Fe&#8208;MoO2 (Ni3Fe/MoO2/CW) heterojunction is designed to address these challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of MoO2 shortens the Ni&#9472;Fe bond length, induces electron transfer from Ni3Fe to MoO2, and regulates the d&#8208;band center of Ni/Fe. These optimized Ni&#9472;Fe bonds and electronic structure enhance H&#9472;OH bond dissociation and H* adsorption/desorption, thereby accelerating the HER Volmer&#8208;Heyrovsky step. Simultaneously, for the OER adsorption evolution mechanism on Ni3Fe (1.462 eV), the strengthened Ni&#9472;O&#9472;Mo bond on Ni3Fe&#8208;MoO2 heterojunction reduces the energy barrier (1.092 eV) of the rate&#8208;determining step, significantly improving catalytic efficiency. Thus, Ni3Fe/MoO2/CW displays good activity (HER: &#951;&#8722;10/&#8722;750 = 45/342 mV; OER: &#951;300/1000 = 251/306 mV). Notably, the large specific area of Ni3Fe/MoO2/CW from its nanosheet&#8208;particle structure enhances the electrolyte/bubble exchange at the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface, enabling stable operation at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 for 24 h in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer. This work demonstrates a MoO2&#8208;driven strategy for electronic modulation and metal bond regulation to boost HER/OER kinetics, advancing Ni3Fe&#8208;based catalysts toward practical high&#8208;current&#8208;densities water electrolysis.

         <title>Integrating High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanocatalysts with Aligned Porous Air Electrode for High&#8208;Power Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>

An integrated, aligned porous air electrode is developed featuring high bifunctional intrinsic activity, abundant active sites, and efficient mass transport, achieving high power density in zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) hold great promise as next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies thanks to their high energy density, low cost, and good safety. However, developing air electrodes that can achieve high power density in ZABs remains a grand challenge. Herein, an integrated air electrode comprising an aligned porous carbon film uniformly and densely decorated with ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) is presented. This design simultaneously meets the stringent requirements for fast reaction kinetics and efficient mass/electron transport imposed by high&#8208;rate operation. Comprehensive structural and electrochemical analyses reveal that the air electrode's tailored pore size distribution and vertically aligned channels furnish unimpeded pathways for the transport of ions, gases, and electrons. Meanwhile, the HEA&#8208;NPs, with high bifunctional catalytic activity and an enriched number of active sites, dramatically accelerate the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Consequently, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB employing this air electrode achieves an outstanding power density of 545&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and stable operation for over 165&#160;h at a high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. By elucidating a clear structure&#8208;performance relationship, this study offers a valuable guideline for the rational design of porous electrodes for high&#8208;power&#8208;density ZABs and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;Zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) hold great promise as next-generation energy storage technologies thanks to their high energy density, low cost, and good safety. However, developing air electrodes that can achieve high power density in ZABs remains a grand challenge. Herein, an integrated air electrode comprising an aligned porous carbon film uniformly and densely decorated with ultrasmall high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA-NPs) is presented. This design simultaneously meets the stringent requirements for fast reaction kinetics and efficient mass/electron transport imposed by high-rate operation. Comprehensive structural and electrochemical analyses reveal that the air electrode's tailored pore size distribution and vertically aligned channels furnish unimpeded pathways for the transport of ions, gases, and electrons. Meanwhile, the HEA-NPs, with high bifunctional catalytic activity and an enriched number of active sites, dramatically accelerate the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Consequently, a quasi-solid-state ZAB employing this air electrode achieves an outstanding power density of 545&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and stable operation for over 165&#160;h at a high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By elucidating a clear structure-performance relationship, this study offers a valuable guideline for the rational design of porous electrodes for high-power-density ZABs and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Charged Gold Nanoparticles: A New Powerful Tool for Lithium Delivery and Modulation of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces glutathione&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles for targeted lithium delivery (LiG&#8208;AuNPs), enabling the controlled modulation of Glycogen Synthase Kinase&#8208;3&#160;(GSK&#8208;3&#946;).&#160;These non&#8208;toxic, 2&#8208;nm particles release lithium intracellularly, effectively inhibiting GSK&#8208;3&#946; in the brain without significant plasma lithium alterations. LiG&#8208;AuNPs show potential for treating GSK&#8208;3&#946;&#8208;related conditions like mood disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and viral infections through prolonged, targeted administration.








Abstract
&#8220;A Trojan Horse for Lithium Delivery&#8221;. Lithium has important pharmacological applications, although its use is severely limited due to its narrow therapeutic window of administrable concentrations. This study presents a novel nanocarrier for this metal cation based on glutathione&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (LiG&#8208;AuNPs), which enable targeted release of lithium. LiG&#8208;AuNPs are easily synthesized, with dimensions of &#8776;2&#160;nm, with a lithium loading of 2 wt%. These particles show a tendency to aggregate and a narrow size distribution. Aggregates of LiG&#8208;AuNPs (a&#8208;LiG&#8208;AuNPs) are non&#8208;toxic to cells at concentrations lower than 2&#160;mg mL&#8722;1 and are rapidly internalized into cells, where they release lithium in the cytosol through cation exchange, effectively modulating Glycogen Synthase Kinase&#8208;3 (GSK&#8208;3&#946;) activity, especially the &#946; isoform. Administration of a&#8208;LiG&#8208;AuNPs in murine models increased the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK&#8208;3&#946; at Ser9. Intranasal administration of a&#8208;LiG&#8208;AuNPs modulated GSK&#8208;3&#946; activity in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, without significantly altering plasma lithium levels, even when the administration lasted several months. LiG&#8208;AuNPs thus represent a powerful tool for the targeted administration of lithium, enhancing its therapeutic effects in modulating GSK&#8208;3&#946;. They have potential applications for treating illnesses depending on GSK&#8208;3&#946; (hyper)activation, such as mood disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and viral infections.

         <title>Neuromorphic Visual Receptive Field Hardware with Vertically Integrated Indium&#8208;Gallium&#8208;Zinc&#8208;Oxide Optoelectronic Memristors over Silicon Neuron Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes neuromorphic visual receptive field hardware with vertically integrated amorphous In&#8208;Ga&#8208;Zn&#8208;O optoelectronic memristors and Si neuron transistors for retina&#8208;inspired visual processing. The visual receptive field array, comprising ON&#8208; and OFF&#8208;type cells, facilitates edge detection, thereby enhancing perception in complex images, such as fingerprints. This demonstrates the potential of neuromorphic visual systems to extract critical features from intricate visual data efficiently.








Abstract
Event&#8208;driven processing in neuromorphic vision systems, utilizing spiking neural networks, can offer improved energy efficiency compared to conventional von Neumann systems. This study proposes an artificial retinal neuron with a vertically integrated optoelectronic memristor (optomemristor) and a neuron transistor (neuristor), inspired by the visual receptive field (VRF) of the biological retina. This design performs pre&#8208;processing in the sensor to extract essential image features, such as edges. The optomemristor on top consists of an In&#8208;Ga&#8208;Zn&#8208;O thin film, which detects light, while the neuristor at the bottom is made of a Si field&#8208;effect transistor (FET), converting the spikes into an electrical signal. The VRF hardware comprises excitatory (ON&#8208;type) and inhibitory (OFF&#8208;type) cells. The spiking frequency of the Si FET increases in response to light exposure for ON&#8208;type cells, which are composed of a serially connected optomemristor and neuristor. In contrast, OFF&#8208;type cells, composed of parallelly connected devices, decrease the spiking frequency under light exposure. The dual&#8208;type configuration, which incorporates both ON&#8208; and OFF&#8208;type cells, achieves a remarkable 99.8% accuracy in fingerprint pattern classification due to the efficient extraction of edge information. This represents a significant improvement over the 56.1% accuracy of the single&#8208;type configuration that relies solely on ON&#8208;type cells.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Zone Chloride Engineering to Enable Ultra&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the polyiodide desorption effect induced by high&#8208;concentration ZnCl2 electrolytes within organic iodine hosts is elucidated. By coupling hydrophobic chloride salt&#8208;reconstructed cathodes with high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;deficient electrolytes, this effect is effectively eliminated while solving the limited reversibility of two&#8208;electron iodine conversion process, thereby realizing ultra&#8208;stable high&#8208;energy zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (up to 35,000 cycles).








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) with organic iodine hosts that harness the I&#8722;/I+ conversion offer a promising route to high&#8208;energy storage but remain limited by rapid capacity decay. Conventional approaches employing high&#8208;concentration ZnCl2 electrolytes effectively activate I&#8722;/I+ conversion in carbon hosts but prove incompatible with organic systems. Here, its excess free Cl&#8722; is identified to displace polyiodide from organic iodine hosts, thereby triggering an irreversible I&#8722;/I+ process. To address this, a dual&#8208;zone chloride engineering strategy is introduced that spatially separates chloride environments into complementary domains. At the cathode, a non&#8208;dissociative hydrophobic salt (trioctylmethylammonium chloride) establishes a confined Cl&#8722;&#8208;rich, water&#8208;deficient environment, suppressing polyiodide desorption and preventing hydrolytic I&#8314; decomposition. In the electrolyte, a chloride&#8208;liberating salt (0.2 m ZnCl2) dissolved in a glycerol&#8208;water solvent replenishes free Cl&#8722; to fully activate I0/I&#8314; conversion while enhancing high&#8208;voltage tolerance. This cooperative design delivers an organic&#8208;based two&#8208;electron ZIB with 87.0% capacity retention over 11,000 cycles, and validates its universality in a carbon&#8208;based ZIB retaining 87.2% capacity after 35,000 cycles. By uniting cathodic confinement with electrolyte liberation, dual&#8208;zone chloride engineering establishes a generalizable framework for stabilizing two&#8208;electron iodine redox chemistry, paving the way toward durable, high&#8208;energy aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Dendrimers Improve Apolipoprotein Nanoparticle mRNA Delivery to Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Apolipoprotein nanoparticle (aNP) platform technology efficiently delivers RNA to immune cells following systemic administration. Here, it is demonstrated that incorporating polyvalent ionizable cationic dendrimers in aNPs enables robust mRNA complexation and functional delivery. Dendrimer&#8208;based aNP&#8208;mRNA formulations outperform formulations containing a clinically approved ionizable cationic lipid regarding gene expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow after intravenous administration.








Abstract
Employing messenger RNA (mRNA) for protein production in the liver or for vaccine purposes is a promising therapeutic approach. However, unlocking mRNA's full therapeutic potential requires systemic delivery platform technology with controllable biodistribution features. Apolipoprotein nanoparticles (aNP) containing monovalent ionizable cationic lipids have been shown to functionally deliver mRNA to myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow after intravenous administration. Here, the development of polyvalent ionizable cationic dendrimers is reported for incorporation in aNPs to enable efficient mRNA complexation and functional delivery. A library of dendrimers is first rationally designed with diverse hydrophobic core units, a number of branching units, and functionalized terminal units. Upon incorporation, eleven distinct dendrimer&#8208;based aNP&#8208;mRNA formulations are screened and characterized in vitro for their properties. Based on the screening outcome, four formulations are selected and evaluated their ability to induce functional gene expression in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;Apolipoprotein nanoparticle (aNP) platform technology efficiently delivers RNA to immune cells following systemic administration. Here, it is demonstrated that incorporating polyvalent ionizable cationic dendrimers in aNPs enables robust mRNA complexation and functional delivery. Dendrimer-based aNP-mRNA formulations outperform formulations containing a clinically approved ionizable cationic lipid regarding gene expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow after intravenous administration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing messenger RNA (mRNA) for protein production in the liver or for vaccine purposes is a promising therapeutic approach. However, unlocking mRNA's full therapeutic potential requires systemic delivery platform technology with controllable biodistribution features. Apolipoprotein nanoparticles (aNP) containing monovalent ionizable cationic lipids have been shown to functionally deliver mRNA to myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow after intravenous administration. Here, the development of polyvalent ionizable cationic dendrimers is reported for incorporation in aNPs to enable efficient mRNA complexation and functional delivery. A library of dendrimers is first rationally designed with diverse hydrophobic core units, a number of branching units, and functionalized terminal units. Upon incorporation, eleven distinct dendrimer-based aNP-mRNA formulations are screened and characterized in vitro for their properties. Based on the screening outcome, four formulations are selected and evaluated their ability to induce functional gene expression in vivo. The results indicate that the lead polyvalent dendrimer-based aNP formulation outperformed formulations containing a clinically approved ionizable cationic lipid regarding gene expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow after intravenous administration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering the Quantitative Relationship Between the Photocatalytic Activity and the Built&#8208;In Electric Field of Heterojunction</title>

Existence of the linear dependence between BIEF intensity and photocatalytic activity for heterojunction photocatalyst.








Abstract
The principle of heterojunction in physics has been extensively referenced in heterogeneous photocatalysis, but it appears to have been utilized qualitatively more as a concept than as a method. The reason is that the quantitative correlation between the intensity of the built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) and photocatalytic activity has not been established, primarily due to the challenges in directly measuring the BIEF of nanosized photocatalysts. To address this, both powder&#8208;type and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;type SiC@WO3&#8208;x&#8208;T heterostructures are prepared to quantitatively investigate the dependence of photocatalytic CO2 reduction activities on BIEF intensity. A strong linear correlation between the effective photoelectron number (NEPN) for CO2 reduction and the BIEF intensity is revealed for the first time. Specifically, NEPN increases by 0.25 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 when Vbi (built&#8208;in potential) increases by 1 kV for the powder sample. In contrast, for the single&#8208;crystal sample, NEPN rises by 0.16 &#181;mol with a 1 kV cm&#8722;1 increase in Ebi (built&#8208;in electric field). This study not only bridges a critical gap in heterojunction photocatalysis research but also demonstrates a method to amplify the built&#8208;in electric field by engineering the interface species, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Inhalable Nanovaccine Based on Bioengineered Bacteria&#8208;Derived Membrane Vesicles Against Lung Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
BMVax is an innovative inhalable nanovaccine crafted from bioengineered bacterial membrane vesicles expressing OVA257&#8208;264 antigen. Upon direct lung delivery, these vesicles are efficiently taken up by alveolar APCs, which then migrate to the tracheobronchial lymph nodes, initiating germinal center reactions, robust antigen&#8208;specific T and B cell responses, mucosal immunity, and the formation of lung tissue&#8208;resident memory T cell, collectively providing superior protection against lung metastasis.








Abstract
Lung metastases pose a challenge in cancer treatment due to the lung's vascular network and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Conventional subcutaneous vaccines typically fail to elicit localized immune responses at metastatic sites. To address this, an inhalable nanovaccine, BMVax (bacterial membrane&#8208;based vaccine), is developed using bacterial membrane vesicles from engineered E. coli expressing ClyA&#8208;OVA257&#8208;264. Proteomics with retention of immunostimulatory membrane proteins, enabled efficient antigen co&#8208;delivery. BMVax ensured antigen cross&#8208;presentation (2.2&#8208;fold increase compared to the antigen + BMV mixture), driving robust antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell proliferation. Inhaling triggers strong immune responses in tracheobronchial lymph nodes, boosting germinal center B cells (&#8776;5.8&#8208;fold), follicular helper T cells (&#8776;4.9&#8208;fold), and mature dendritic cells (&#8776;2.5&#8208;fold), achieving 83.3% complete prevention of lung metastasis. In B16&#8208;OVA lung metastasis model, inhaled BMVax demonstrates superior tumor suppression compared to subcutaneous administration. It induces doubling germinal center B cells and 2.9&#8208;fold more follicular helper T cells in the lymph nodes, as well as 2.9&#8208;fold more antigen&#8208;specific T cells in lung tissue than subcutaneous immunization. Tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity and proliferation, reinforcing its therapeutic advantage over subcutaneous immunization. These findings highlight BMVax's potential as an inhalable cancer vaccine, capable of inducing strong immune responses, to effectively combat lung metastatic malignancies.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Distribution and Microenvironment Dual Regulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work rationally synthesized a series of COFs from co&#8208;controlling ET by skeletons and PT by pore microenvironment, and successfully used them as efficient catalysts for photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 and H2O&#8208;to&#8208;H2 reaction, which put forward a new method for the dual regulation of COFs for enhancing photocatalytic reactions.








Abstract
The proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process which related to charge&#8208;distribution and proton environment of photocatalysts play a key role in the photocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, there is short of systematic studies on the influences of photocatalytic PCET process by regarding the above two factors at the molecular level. Herein, a series of covalent organic framework (COFs)&#160;(Py&#8208;Bd COF, Py&#8208;Sa COF and Py&#8208;OH&#8208;Sa COF) were synthesized by co&#8208;controlling charge&#8208;distribution of skeletons and microenvironment of pores, and were used as photocatalysts for O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 and H2O&#8208;to&#8208;H2 reaction. Particularly, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone groups and strong electron&#8208;rich hydroxy groups in Py&#8208;OH&#8208;Sa COF boosted photo&#8208;generated charge separation, also triggered more hydrophilic pores, thus enabling efficient transfer of the photo&#8208;induced electrons and protons to catalytic sites. By the above dual regulation, Py&#8208;OH&#8208;Sa COF showed high photocatalytic H2O2 yield (4.78&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and H2 production (64.21&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Moreover, the Py&#8208;OH&#8208;Sa COF exhibits an extraordinary apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 6.52% and 8.25% at 380 nm for H2O2 and H2 production. This work develops an important strategy for precise regulating PECT by co&#8208;regulation of charge&#8208;distribution and microenvironment of photocatalyst to enhance catalytic activity, which also offers novel insights for the design anddevelopment of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Engineered Apoptotic Extracellular Vesicles for Programmable Regulation of Neutrophil&#8208;Macrophage&#8208;ROS Pathogenic Axis to Reconstruct Rheumatoid Arthritis Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered apoptotic extracellular vesicles (D@ApoEVFasL&#8745;L) are developed to actively target the inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and reconstruct RA microenvironment (RAM) through blocking neutrophil recruitment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)&#160;binding to P&#8208;selectin, inducing neutrophil apoptosis via the Fas/FasL pathway, reprogramming macrophages by efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and finally clearing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which enhanced multifaceted immunotherapy of RA.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis microenvironment (RAM) contains complex pathogenic mediators that interact dynamically to drive the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, most current RA treatments are single&#8208;target interventions, exerting limited impact on RAM. Herein, apoptotic extracellular vesicles (ApoEV) are constructed for programmable regulation of the neutrophil&#8208;macrophage&#8208;ROS pathogenic axis, aiming to reconstruct RAM and improve RA therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pretreated with dexamethasone (Dex) and induced apoptosis to produce Dex&#8208;loaded and FasL&#8208;overexpressing ApoEV (D@ApoEVFasL), which is further modified with low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight heparin (LMWH) through a ROS&#8208;responsive cleavage linker to form D@ApoEVFasL&#8745;L. After intravenous injection into RA mice, D@ApoEVFasL&#8745;L targeted the inflamed joints based on their MSC&#8208;derived feature and blocked neutrophil recruitment through binding to P&#8208;selectin on vascular endothelial cells. In response to high ROS, D@ApoEVFasL&#8745;L shed LMWH and exposed FasL, inducing neutrophil apoptosis through the Fas/FasL signaling pathway. Subsequently, the apoptotic neutrophils triggered macrophage reprogramming from M1 to M2 phenotype, and the released Dex significantly reduced the oxidative damage. Various in vitro and in vivo assessments have confirmed that D@ApoEVFasL&#8745;L can effectively regulate neutrophils, macrophages, and ROS, trigger an immune cascade, and restore intra&#8208;articular immune homeostasis, exhibiting an effective RAM reconstruction ability and a promising therapeutic effect for RA.

&lt;p&gt;Engineered apoptotic extracellular vesicles (D@ApoEV&lt;sup&gt;FasL&lt;/sup&gt;&#8745;L) are developed to actively target the inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and reconstruct RA microenvironment (RAM) through blocking neutrophil recruitment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)&#160;binding to P-selectin, inducing neutrophil apoptosis via the Fas/FasL pathway, reprogramming macrophages by efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and finally clearing excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which enhanced multifaceted immunotherapy of RA.

         <title>High Efficiency (&#8764;18%) Organic Solar Cells with 500 nm&#8208;Thick Toluene Cast Active Layer by Aggregation Manipulation and Additive Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, additive engineering is successfully applied to reduce the free volume of the strongly aggregated active layer, suppressing the electron&#8208;phonon coupling, thus promoting thick&#8208;film OSC performance.








Abstract
Thick&#8208;film organic solar cells (OSCs) are crucial for mass&#8208;production: however, the efficiency of such cells is limited by the lack of morphological control afforded by methods that rely on high&#8208;vapor&#8208;pressure solvents. Herein, a systematic solvent and additive engineering strategy is reported for improving the performance of thick&#8208;film (&gt;300&#160;nm) OSCs through aggregation modulation via solidification acceleration and electronic property enhancement. Two oligomers derived from the polymer donors PM6 and D18&#8208;Fu are employed as solid additives to prepare the active layer. Characterizations&#160;reveal that the D18&#8208;Fu&#8208;derived oligomer exhibits stronger interactions with both the benzodifuran donor (D18&#8208;Fu) and the acceptor (L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X), resulting in suppressed electron&#8208;phonon coupling, more balanced donor&#8211;acceptor fibrillation, and enhanced face&#8208;on molecular orientation. Devices treated with the D18&#8208;Fu&#8208;derived oligomer achieve a greater improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Both additives enhance thickness&#8208;&#160;tolerance of the device owing to their structural compatibility with the D18&#8208;Fu&#8208;derived oligomer,&#8208; yielding superior performance. Notably, devices processed from toluene, a nonhalogenated solvent, demonstrate high PCEs with excellent thickness tolerance; the thick&#8208;film device (500&#160;nm active layer) exhibits an independently certified PCE of &#8764;18%, a record for thick&#8208;film OSCs, with no significant loss in performance compared to its thin&#8208;film (100&#160;nm) counterparts (&gt;19%).

         <title>Photosystem II&#8208;Carbon Nitride Photoanodes for Scalable Biophotoelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spray&#8208;freeze method is developed to fabricate large&#8208;area (up to 33 cm2) macroporous carbon nitride photoanodes integrated with photosystem II enzymes for biophotoelectrochemical systems. The photoanodes reach a Faradaic efficiency of 93.5% for O2 evolution. Bias&#8208;free tandem biophotovoltaic devices with a total photoactive area of 72 cm2 drive low&#8208;power electronics, highlighting the promise of PSII&#8208;based platforms for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
Photosystem II (PSII) is a vital photosynthetic enzyme with the potential for sustainable bioelectricity and fuel generation. However, interfacing PSII with intricate, small&#8208;scale electrodes for practical applications has been challenging. This study addresses this by creating protonated macroporous carbon nitride (MCN) as support and developing a scalable spray&#8208;freeze method to wire PSII with MCN. This facilitates the production of large&#8208;area MCN&#8208;PSII photoanodes up to 33 cm2 for biophotoelectrochemical water oxidation to O2, achieving efficient interfacial charge transfer and initial photocurrents in the mA range with Faradaic yield of 93.5&#160;&#177;&#160;8.5% over 5&#160;h. A bias&#8208;free biophotoelectrochemical (BPEC) device is designed by connecting the MCN&#8208;PSII photoanode to a carbon nanotube cathode loaded with bilirubin oxidase. An array of eight tandem BPEC cells with a photoactive area of 72 cm2 successfully powers low&#8208;power electronics, such as LEDs. This work paves an efficient way for bioelectrode fabrication, showcasing the potential of PSII&#8208;based semi&#8208;artificial systems for BPEC and biophotovoltaic applications.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Trirelaxor Ferroelectrics: High Energy Storage Capacity in the Paraelectric State and Broad Operating Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a&#160;trirelaxor&#8212;a state composed of polar nanoregions with coexisting tetragonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral symmetries&#8212;that exhibits high energy storage performance above&#160;TB. This work uncovers a mechanism for achieving high energy storage performance in the paraelectric state, providing new insights into the design of dielectrics with high energy storage performance over a wide temperature range. 








Abstract
The development of lead&#8208;free dielectric capacitors capable of reliable operation across extreme temperatures is crucial for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. While relaxor ferroelectrics below the Burns temperature (TB) have demonstrated promising energy storage characteristics via polar nanoregions (PNRs), their performance typically deteriorates above TB. Surprisingly, a trirelaxor&#8212;a state composed of PNRs is reported with three coexisting symmetries (tetragonal, orthorhombic, and rhombohedral)&#8212;that exhibits high energy storage performance in the paraelectric state above&#160;TB. In lead&#8208;free Bi(Mg2/3Nb1/3)O3&#8208;doped Ba(Zr,Ti)O3&#8208;(Ba,Ca)TiO3 perovskite ceramics, the trirelaxor above&#160;TB achieves a remarkable energy storage density of 9.3 J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;and an efficiency of 93%, which is comparable to the performance of other lead&#8208;free dielectrics measured below&#160;TB. More importantly, the high energy storage properties of trirelaxor above TB enable the material to exhibit excellent comprehensive energy storage performance over a broad operating temperature range of &#8722;90 to 200&#160;&#176;C, which outperforms existing lead&#8208;free perovskite dielectric materials. This work provides new insights into developing desirable energy&#8208;storage dielectrics with high energy storage performance over an extended operating temperature range.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weakly assembled peptide amphiphile nanostructures disassemble in circulation and reassemble with blood biomolecules, mainly lipoproteins. Binding to blood biomolecules prolongs blood circulation and improves accumulation in solid tumors. In the tumor microenvironment, peptide amphiphiles assemble with cholesterol&#8208;rich domains of cell membranes, allowing them to selectively internalize in cancer cells and effectively deliver chemotherapies conjugated to them.








Abstract
The interactions of nanomaterials with biomolecules in vivo determine their biological fate. Here, it is shown that self&#8208;assembled peptide amphiphile (PA) nanostructures can dynamically interact with endogenous biomolecules and take advantage of naturally occurring processes to target a broad range of solid tumors. In circulation, self&#8208;assembled PA nanostructures disassemble and reassemble mainly with lipoproteins, which prolongs blood circulation and dramatically improves tumor accumulation and retention. Mechanistic studies suggested that PAs internalize into cancer cells by assembling with their cell membranes and independently of specific receptors. By exploiting these interactions, a PA developed in this study (namely Self&#8208;Assembly &#8208; Glutamic acid, SA&#8208;E) demonstrates specific accumulation in various xenograft, syngeneic, patient&#8208;derived xenograft, or transgenic rodent models. In addition, SA&#8208;E enabled the effective delivery of highly potent chemotherapy to different syngeneic and xenografted tumors with reduced side effects. With its simple and modular design and universal tumor accumulation mechanism, SA&#8208;E represents a promising platform for broad applications in cancer imaging and therapy.

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Gated Moisture&#8208;Electric Therapy via Dual&#8208;Modal Eelectrostimulation for Adaptive Bioelectronic Interventions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a humidity&#8208;responsive moisture&#8208;electric generator (MEG) that autonomously delivers dual&#8208;mode electrostimulation tailored to dynamic physiological environments, addressing a long&#8208;standing challenge in adaptive bioelectronic therapy. This humidity&#8208;adaptive platform represents a closed&#8208;loop, self&#8208;powered therapeutic system that couples environmental sensing with intelligent bioelectronic output.








Abstract
With the development of bioelectronic devices, achieving adaptive therapy in dynamic environments remains challenging. Traditional electrostimulation struggles with external power dependence, insufficient responsiveness, and lack of environmental adaptability. This study presents a humidity&#8208;responsive moisture&#8208;electric generator (MEG) that autonomously delivers dual&#8208;mode electrostimulation tailored to dynamic physiological environments, addressing a long&#8208;standing challenge in adaptive bioelectronic therapy. The MEG is engineered using 3D&#8208;printed nanocomposites integrating a hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS/graphene oxide core and a mechanically robust polycaprolactone structure, enabling humidity&#8208;gated voltage modulation. Under low&#8208;humidity conditions (&lt;60% RH), the device generates subthreshold voltages (&lt;500&#160;mV) that activate transient receptor potential vanilloid&#8208;1 (TRPV1)&#8208;mediated calcium signaling, enhancing fibroblast migration, angiogenesis, and M2 macrophage polarization&#8212;leading to a 33.17% acceleration in wound healing. Conversely, in high&#8208;humidity tumor microenvironments (&gt;95% RH), the MEG produces therapeutic voltages (&gt;500&#160;mV) that disrupt cytoskeletal integrity, improve chemotherapeutic drug penetration, and activate TNF&#8208;&#945;/NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling, resulting in immunogenic cell death and 88.34% tumor suppression. Transcriptomic analyses reveal distinct pathway engagement&#8212;calcium signaling dominates regenerative responses, while TNF cascades mediate antitumor immunity. This humidity&#8208;adaptive platform represents a closed&#8208;loop, self&#8208;powered therapeutic system that couples environmental sensing with intelligent bioelectronic output. Beyond its dual applications, the MEG introduces a transformative paradigm for autonomous, personalized medical intervention.

         <title>Smart Curtains for Spontaneous Solar Modulation via Natural Light&#8208;Triggered Deformable Shading and Chromogenic Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a comprehensive approach is proposed for the development of deformable and optically modulated smart curtains, integrating stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic nanomaterials with photothermal actuators. By responding to external signals, the smart curtains can effectively regulate solar radiation by dynamically altering their shape while simultaneously modifying their optical properties, which solves the problem of persistent sunlight absorption caused by the installation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state smart windows.








Abstract
Smart windows, fabricated from stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic materials, can modulate the transparency of a window toward sunlight to control room temperature. The widespread implementation of this technology can improve indoor comfort and effectively reduce energy consumption. However, due to their initial optical properties, chromogenic materials in solid&#8208;state smart windows continue to absorb sunlight, causing overcooling and temperature instability. Here, stimulus&#8208;responsive chromogenic nanowires (NWs) and photothermal actuators are combined to create flexible, macro&#8208;deformed smart curtains. The difference in thermal expansion coefficient between bacterial cellulose and polyethylene in actuators allows the smart curtains to keep curled at low light intensities (off&#8208;state) and unroll under intense light (on&#8208;state). The solar modulation efficiency is further enhanced by the synergy of chromogenic (thermochromic or photochromic) NWs. When rolled up, the smart curtains allow ample sunlight to pass through ordinary windows (92.0% of solar radiation) for heating. They can achieve temperature reductions exceeding 6.0&#160;&#176;C, attributed to the regulation of solar radiation, with 62.3% for thermochromic smart curtains and 79.1% for photochromic smart curtains. Besides, the smart curtains can be mounted directly on the building frame without replacing existing windows. These results illustrate the feasibility of smart curtains and represent a conspicuous step toward sustainable building technologies.

         <title>D&#8208;Band Width Rationally Broadened by Configuring Nearest Coordination of Metal Site for Enhanced Active Site&#8208;Intermediate Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational coordination engineering broadens the d&#8208;band width of metal sites, establishing a linear relationship with intermediate adsorption. An optimal window of broadening achieves peak hydrogen evolution activity, while deviations induce performance loss. This strategy transcends conventional valence&#8208;state modulation and offers a universal framework for designing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based site, as an important type of active site, plays the benchmarking role in the redox and charge transfer processes in the heterogeneous catalysis. Modulating the valence state of metal site as a promising and simple strategy theoretically enables control over the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates. However, this strategy is intrinsically limited by the local atomic configuration, often leading to unpredictable catalytic failures. Here, it is reported that the intermediate adsorption strength of platinum active site with different valence states exhibits a linear relationship with the d&#8208;band width of Pt (Wd&#8208;Pt). Adjusting the nearest&#8208;neighbor coordination environment of Pt sites by changing the transition metals bonded to Pt effectively modulates the Wd&#8208;Pt, which offers a high activity (&#951;10 = 14 mV) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Wd&#8208;Pt broadening elevates the Pt&#9472;H anti&#8208;bonding states across the Fermi level, strengthening active site&#8208;absorbate interactions and thereby tuning HER catalytic activity. In addition, this d&#8208;band width engineering strategy can be expanded to other catalysts with the metal active site. The present study transcends limitations in valence state modulation and sheds light on deeper understanding of d&#8208;band structure of metal sites and a methodology to boost the activity of metal sites in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Integrating High&#8208;Efficient Delamination and Structural Reconstruction Boosting Direct Regeneration of Spent Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a synergistic strategy for delaminating cathode active materials from current collectors of spent cathodes within 2 min, and reconstructing the surface structure that boosts the lithium replenishment to achieve efficient direct regeneration of NCM523 by catalytically activating potassium peroxymonosulfate. The regenerated material exhibits commercial&#8208;level capacity and remarkable cycling stability, advancing sustainable recycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Direct regeneration presents a promising solution for tackling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its environmental and economic advantages. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of direct regeneration hinges on the efficient and precise separation of cathode materials from current collectors. Current separation methods not only suffer from incomplete separation and low delamination efficiency but also risk inflicting damage to the already degraded surface structure of cathode materials, which further renders the direct regeneration less effective. Herein, an approach is introduced that synergistically achieves high&#8208;efficient delamination and surface reconstruction of spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) by catalytically activating potassium peroxymonosulfate. This approach achieves delamination of cathode materials from current collectors with a separation efficiency over 99% within only 2 min. Moreover, the surface reconstruction is simultaneously accomplished during the delamination process, building fast lithium&#8208;ion diffusion pathway, greatly reducing the lithium&#8208;ion migration barrier.

     alt="Integrating High-Efficient Delamination and Structural Reconstruction Boosting Direct Regeneration of Spent Cathode Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents a synergistic strategy for delaminating cathode active materials from current collectors of spent cathodes within 2 min, and reconstructing the surface structure that boosts the lithium replenishment to achieve efficient direct regeneration of NCM523 by catalytically activating potassium peroxymonosulfate. The regenerated material exhibits commercial-level capacity and remarkable cycling stability, advancing sustainable recycling of lithium-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct regeneration presents a promising solution for tackling spent lithium-ion batteries due to its environmental and economic advantages. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of direct regeneration hinges on the efficient and precise separation of cathode materials from current collectors. Current separation methods not only suffer from incomplete separation and low delamination efficiency but also risk inflicting damage to the already degraded surface structure of cathode materials, which further renders the direct regeneration less effective. Herein, an approach is introduced that synergistically achieves high-efficient delamination and surface reconstruction of spent LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM523) by catalytically activating potassium peroxymonosulfate. This approach achieves delamination of cathode materials from current collectors with a separation efficiency over 99% within only 2 min. Moreover, the surface reconstruction is simultaneously accomplished during the delamination process, building fast lithium-ion diffusion pathway, greatly reducing the lithium-ion migration barrier. Consequently, the NCM523 regenerated through this method successfully restores its capacity to commercial level at 152 mAh&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains outstanding cycling stability, retaining 75% of its capacity after 1000 cycles. The findings underscore the necessity of complete separation of cathode materials from current collectors and surface structural reconstruction in direct regeneration and offer critical insights into optimizing sustainable recycling processes for spent lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triplet Exciton&#8208;Enhanced Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by Topologically Tuned Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel triplet exciton&#8208;singlet oxygen (1O2) H2O2 photosynthesis pathway is achieved using a topological tuning strategy and demonstrates a reduction in the generation barrier compared to typical electron/hole&#8208;mediated photosynthesis pathways. This work circumvents the limitations of water oxidation reactions and paves the way for future advancements in electro&#8208;, photoelectron&#8208;, organo&#8208;, and environmental catalysis using triplet excitons.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis technology can utilize water, oxygen, and solar energy to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an environmentally friendly oxidant and a clean fuel. However, H2O2 photosynthesis mainly follows photogenerated electrons/holes pathway, which suffers from high thermodynamic barriers and competing reactions. Triplet excitons can spontaneously convert O2 into singlet oxygen (1O2) intermediate and bypass these challenges, but demonstrating its effects on photocatalysis is still scarce. Here, this study designs twist pyrimidine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with excellent triplet exciton production using a topological tuning strategy. The twist configuration modulates the molecular orbital overlap between singlet and triplet states and achieves a 1.8 &#215; 107 enhancement in the intersystem crossing rate, obtaining excitation of triplet excitons and the generation of 1O2, rather than exciting photogenerated electrons and holes. A novel triplet exciton&#8208;1O2 H2O2 photosynthesis pathway is achieved and demonstrates a 38.6% reduction in the generation barrier compared to typical redox pathway, obtaining record activity with rates of 10.80&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in an O2 atmosphere and 7.82&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, without the need for a sacrificial agent. The solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is 1.25%.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Protonated Porphyrin Dimer Nanoparticles with an 83.7% Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation&#8208;manipulation molecular self&#8208;assembly of TAPP leads to the formation of protonated dimer that facilitate the transition from a saddle&#8208;shaped conformation to a quinone&#8208;like resonance structure. These structures enhance intermolecular exciton coupling, significantly improving NIR absorption and efficiently converting light into heat for TAPP NIR&#8208;NPs. This process achieves an impressive PCE of up to 83.7%, surpassing that of traditional porphyrin&#8208;derived PTAs.








Abstract
Despite the immense potential of near&#8208;infrared photothermal therapy (NIR PTT) for tumor treatment, the development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) remains a substantial challenge. Here, a &#8220;protonation&#8208;manipulation molecular self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy is presented that precisely regulates the protonation of the pyrrole nitrogen in 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP), while maintaining the availability of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atoms in the aniline substituents. The resulting protonated dimers facilitate the formation of a robust saddle&#8208;shaped conformation and a quinone&#8208;like resonance structure, which subsequently self&#8208;assemble into near&#8208;infrared nanoparticles (NIR NPs). These protonated dimers enhance intermolecular exciton coupling, significantly improving absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region. The photoexcitation process of TAPP NIR NPs is primarily governed by non&#8208;radiative transitions, achieving an impressive PCE of up to 83.7%, markedly surpassing that of organic PTAs such as dopamine and traditional porphyrin derivatives. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that NIR NPs effectively eliminate tumor cells while exhibiting excellent biocompatibility. This work represents a significant advancement in performance optimization from the spectral regulation of supramolecular photosensitizers, introducing innovative methodologies for the design of aromatic nitrogen&#8208;containing PTAs functional molecules.

A tungsten&#8208;based amorphous alloy (FeNiWPB) supported adjacent Platinum single&#8208;atom catalyst (PtASSA@FeNiWPB) is designed to enable all&#8208;round enhancement of hydrogen evolution across broad pH ranges, in which metal&#8208;metal synergy constructed by adjacent Pt atoms, robust M&#9472;W bonds (M = Pt, Fe, Ni), electron redistribution induced by Pt&#8208;W/Fe/Ni polarized pairs contribute to the catalyst outstanding HER performance and remarkable stability in both acidic and alkaline environments.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting based on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) offers a sustainable route for hydrogen production. However, conventional SACs suffer from weak synergistic effects in harsh electrolytes. Here, we report a tungsten&#8208;based amorphous alloy (FeNiWPB) supported adjacent Platinum single&#8208;atom catalyst (PtASSA@FeNiWPB). Spectroscopic and computational analyses disclose that the amorphous W&#8208;based alloy matrix provides abundant defect sites to anchor and mediate adjacent Pt atoms, thereby boosting multiple H conversions via metal&#8208;metal synergy. Additionally, the catalyst's corrosion resistance is significantly enhanced through the formation of robust M&#9472;W bonds (M&#9552;Pt, Fe, Ni), which effectively suppress metal leaching across broad pH ranges. Furthermore, the formation of Pt&#8208;W/Fe/Ni polarized pairs at the alloy surface via Pt&#8208;support interactions induces electron redistribution and accelerates H*/OH* adsorption kinetics, thereby enhancing multiple H2O* dissociation pathways. Consequently, PtASSA@FeNiWPB exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 17 mV (acidic) and 18 mV (alkaline) at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2, with mass activities 5.8 times (acidic) and 63.6 times (alkaline) higher than commercial Pt/C. Notably, it maintains performance for 600 h in both acidic and alkaline environments, far exceeding W&#8208;free counterparts (&lt;50 h) and previous reports, positioning it at the forefront of HER performance. This work establishes a universal strategy for engineering durable electrocatalysts.Electrochemical water splitting based on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) offers a sustainable route for hydrogen production.

         <title>Anisotropic 3D&#8208;Printed Carbon Fiber&#8208;Reinforced Liquid Metal Elastomer for Synergistic Enhancement of Electrical Conductivity, Thermal Performance, and Leakage Resistance</title>

         <dc:description>
To address the trade&#8208;off between conductivity/thermal performance and anti&#8208;leakage in liquid metal elastomer, this work develops carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced liquid metal elastomer (CFLME) via 3D&#8208;printed directional fiber alignment and Ni plating for interfacial wetting. CFLME integrates high conductivity, thermal efficiency, and anti&#8208;leakage capability for applications in electromagnetic shielding, biosensing, and thermal management.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional composites with high electrical/thermal conductivity and excellent flexibility remains a critical challenge for flexible electronics and thermal management systems. While liquid metal elastomers offer intrinsic softness and conductivity, their real&#8208;world application is hindered by the trade&#8208;off between outstanding dual conductivity (electrical and thermal) and leakage resistance. To tackle this issue, high&#8208;stability carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced liquid metal elastomer (CFLME) is fabricated via an integrated method: Ni plating on carbon fiber to enhance reactive wetting with liquid metal, followed by composite formation with elastomer and 3D printing for directional fiber alignment, yielding anisotropic CFLME. Such anisotropic architecture enables efficient conductive pathways along fiber axes, reducing the electrical percolation threshold to 25%, achieving a high electrical conductivity of 3.44 &#215; 10&#8309; S/m, and a thermal conductivity of 7.26 W/(m&#8729;K). The fiber network securely locks liquid metal, enabling zero leakage under 400% strain, 1000&#8208;cycle stretching, or 833 kPa compression. For practical applications, CFLME exhibits exceptional electromagnetic shielding (93.74 dB), high&#8208;sensitivity biosensing with an 82.62 dB signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and efficient thermal management (16&#160;&#176;C reduction vs liquid metal elastomer). This work demonstrates a dual&#8208;innovation strategy of structural design and interfacial regulation, providing a robust solution for flexible electronics and thermal management applications with balanced performance.

         <title>Synergistic Sustained Cooling and Adaptive Moisture Regulation Enabled by Core&#8211;Shell Structured Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>

A thermal and moisture regulating textile (TMRT) integrated with exceptional sustained cooling and moisture&#8211;regulating properties is developed via coaxial electrospinning. The TMRT features a rationally designed core&#8211;shell micro/nanofiber structure, comprising a moisture&#8211;regulating polymer sheath and thermal&#8211;responsive polymer core, which addresses critical limitations in mitigating thermal and humidity accumulation during prolonged wear.








Abstract
Thermal and moisture balance in the body&#8211;textile microclimate is critical for human comfort, health management, and prolonged wearability. However, designing a textile system capable of simultaneously achieving sustained cooling and dynamic moisture regulation remains an unaddressed and significant challenge. Herein, a thermal and moisture regulating textile (TMRT) is developed via coaxial electrospinning, featuring a rationally designed core&#8211;shell micro/nanofiber structure with a moisture&#8211;regulating polymer sheath and a thermal&#8211;responsive polymer core. The resulting TMRT exhibits exceptional mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) emissivity (99.82%) and low solar reflectivity (7.71%), an outstanding contact cooling coefficient (0.43 W cm&#8722;2), and ultralow thermal resistance (0.08 m2 K W&#8722;1), enabling &#8776; 6.6 &#176;C reduction in skin temperature at 40 &#176;C. Remarkably, the TMRT demonstrates low moisture resistance (2.49 m2 K W&#8722;1) and a high water evaporation rate (0.59 g h&#8722;1). Furthermore, it possesses favorable moisture regulation performance and rapid humidity response, achieving a humidity&#8211;sensing resolution of 0.5% relative humidity (RH). The TMRT&#8211;based protective clothing displays a comfortable microenvironment for the human body. This work establishes a groundbreaking paradigm for advanced textiles with synergistic thermal and moisture management, addressing critical limitations in conventional protective gear, particularly in mitigating heat and humidity accumulation during prolonged use.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Cathode Additive Enables Highly Reversible Four&#8208;Electron I&#8722;/I0/I+ Conversion in Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid BMICl/CNTs additive addresses dual challenges in four&#8208;electron zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (4eZIBs). It suppresses polyiodide shuttling via bonding in the I&#8722;/I0 step and enhances I+ kinetics while curbing hydrolysis via Cl&#8722; immobilization and BMI&#8208;ICl2 complex formation in the I0/I+ step. This enables 418.9 mA h&#160;g&#8722;1 capacity at 0.5C and 93.4% retention after 600 cycles at 1C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries with four&#8208;electron (4e) I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion (4eZIBs) offer high energy density but face both&#8208;step I&#8722;/I0 and I0/I+ challenges, including the polyiodide shuttle effect, sluggish I0/I+ conversion kinetics, and severe I+ hydrolysis. To mitigate these issues, a quasi&#8208;solid additive composed of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride (BMICl) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is introduced into the cathode. Specifically, by co&#8208;grinding BMICl with CNTs, a homogeneous quasi&#8208;solid additive is formed due to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between CNTs and imidazole rings. This additive not only suppresses the shuttle effect by binding with polyiodides in the first&#8208;step I&#8722;/I0 conversion, but also enhances I+ conversion kinetics by immobilizing Cl&#8722; inside the electrode and curbs I+ hydrolysis through forming a BMI&#8208;ICl2 complex in the second&#8208;step conversion. This innovative approach enables the 4eZIBs to achieve a near&#8208;theoretical specific capacity of 418.9&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5C, while maintaining a robust lifespan of over 600 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.4% at 1C. Moreover, pouch cells under a high areal capacity of 7.1&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2 for each side of the cathode demonstrate a high&#8208;capacity retention of 95.8% after 150 cycles at 6.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (&#8776;0.5C).

         <title>Backbone Tailoring Enables High&#8208;Performance and Stable n&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Synaptic Simulation and Biosensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By meticulously tailoring the molecular lengths of bithiophene imide derivatives with tunable imide group numbers, it is found that the medium&#8208;sized fused bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based PBTI2g&#8208;DTCN demonstrates significantly improved film structural order and enhanced ion/electron transport properties, thus leading to high&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors, which have been successfully applied in synaptic simulations and biosensing.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance and stable n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are crucial for advancing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, yet their development remains a great challenge. Herein, the study presents a series of donor&#8208;acceptor polymers incorporating bithiophene (BTI) and fused BTI derivatives with varying conjugation backbone lengths as acceptors. The mid&#8208;size fused BTI dimer enables polymer PBTI2g&#8208;DTCN with simultaneously improved ion&#8208;uptake capability, film structural order, and ion/electron transport capability. Consequently, an impressive electron mobility of 0.84 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a record figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) of 287.8 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are achieved for PBTI2g&#8208;DTCN&#8208;based n&#8208;type conventional OECT in accumulation mode, while the vertical OECTs (vOECTs) attain a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art area&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,A) of 71.8 &#181;S &#181;m&#8722;2 with remarkable operational stability. Through finely manipulating the channel components, the vOECTs demonstrate dual&#8208;mode operation, switching between non&#8208;volatile and volatile states. In non&#8208;volatile mode, vOECT&#8208;based artificial synapses with excellent ambient stability enable dynamic learning and are employed in convolutional neural networks for image recognition. In volatile mode, they excel in biosensing, monitoring electrocardiography and electromyography signals. These remarkable results demonstrate that backbone tailoring is a powerful strategy for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OMIECs for synaptic and sensor applications.

Herein, the study presents a series of donor-acceptor polymers incorporating bithiophene (BTI) and fused BTI derivatives with varying conjugation backbone lengths as acceptors. The mid-size fused BTI dimer enables polymer PBTI2g-DTCN with simultaneously improved ion-uptake capability, film structural order, and ion/electron transport capability. Consequently, an impressive electron mobility of 0.84 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a record figure-of-merit (&lt;i&gt;&#181;C&lt;/i&gt;*) of 287.8 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved for PBTI2g-DTCN-based n-type conventional OECT in accumulation mode, while the vertical OECTs (vOECTs) attain a state-of-the-art area-normalized transconductance (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m,A&lt;/sub&gt;) of 71.8 &#181;S &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with remarkable operational stability. Through finely manipulating the channel components, the vOECTs demonstrate dual-mode operation, switching between non-volatile and volatile states. In non-volatile mode, vOECT-based artificial synapses with excellent ambient stability enable dynamic learning and are employed in convolutional neural networks for image recognition. In volatile mode, they excel in biosensing, monitoring electrocardiography and electromyography signals. These remarkable results demonstrate that backbone tailoring is a powerful strategy for developing high-performance n-type OMIECs for synaptic and sensor applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multichannel Immune Nanoregulators Suppress Lactic Acid Metabolism and Lactic Acid&#8208;Shaped Acidic Microenvironment to Uproot Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multichannel immune nanoregulator is engineered to attenuate acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) via depleting H+ and releasing O2 to inhibit anaerobic glycolysis and lactic acid (LA) production. Acidic TME reversion eliminates the pre&#8208;existing non&#8208;inflammatory macrophages and coincidently cut off their source, eventually uprooting the symptom and origin of cancer immunosuppression induced by LA and LA&#8208;reshaped acidic tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Lactic acid (LA) itself and the LA&#8208;shaped acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) are identified as root causes of cancer immunosuppression, and no effective strategies address them. Here a multichannel immune nanoregulator is engineered to dampen acidic TME and repolarize non&#8208;inflammatory macrophages to uproot this source of cancer immunosuppression, wherein fluorocarbon chains (FC)&#8208;modified mesoporous silica (FM) serves as nanoreactors and carriers to in situ synthesize CaO2 and load R848, respectively, followed by liposome coating, anti&#8208;CD105 modification and FC&#8208;mediated O2 binding in sequence. Both liposome shell and intraparticle FC ensure safe CaO2 delivery. Ultrasound&#8208;triggered FC&#8208;binding O2 burst and liposomes&#8208;destruction&#8208;enhanced CaO2 reactions with H+ and H2O produce O2. This process depletes pre&#8208;existing H+ and inhibits glycolysis LA production to cut off acidic TME source, and uproots their actions in reshaping cancer immunosuppression, e.g., removing the polarization impetus toward non&#8208;inflammatory M2 ones, addressing both symptoms and root causes of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and PD1+ T cells inactivation, etc. The cancer immunosuppression uprooting encourages the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of cancer calcification and intratumoral H2O2 accumulation in the immune nanoregulators especially after anti&#8208;CD105&#8208;mediated active targeting accumulation. Collectively, this work presents a solution to uproot LA and non&#8208;inflammatory macrophages&#8208;induced cancer immunosuppression.

         <title>Al Pinning Effect in Birnessite for High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al pinning effect is proposed to simultaneously mitigate the cooperative J&#8211;T distortion and enhance the NH4+ ionic diffusion kinetics in birnessite, which significantly strengthens the Mn&#9472;O bonds and hinders the collinear elongation or compression direction of the [Mn3+O6] octahedra. A robust cycling stability over 5, 000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 and an accelerated NH4+ ion diffusion coefficient of 1.58 &#215; 10&#8722;9 cm2 s&#8722;1 is achieved in the optimal Na0.7Al0.1Mn0.9O2.








Abstract
Layered birnessite has attracted considerable attention for its cathode potential in various aqueous energy storage devices owing to its two&#8208;electron transfer reaction (Mn2+/Mn4+), open diffusion channels, and tunable interlayer spacings. However, birnessite for reversible ammonium (NH4+) ion storage generally suffers from irreversible structural collapse originated from Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) effect of Mn3+ and the intrinsic slow ionic diffusion kinetics. Herein, an Al pinning effect in birnessite is found to address these two issues simultaneously, which promoted enhanced structural stability and resulted in fast ionic diffusion kinetics for excellent high&#8208;rate capability. Strikingly, a robust cycling stability over 5, 000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 is achieved in the optimal Na0.7Al0.1Mn0.9O2, which surpasses that of most previously reported ammonium&#8208;ion batteries. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the pinned [Al3+O6] octahedra not only decrease the Mn3+ content in birnessite, but also strengthen the covalency of Mn&#9472;O bonds to resist the collinear elongation/compression direction of the [Mn3+O6] octahedra. Furthermore, Al pinning in birnessite can increase the interlayer spacing due to the regulation of Mn3+&#9472;O/Mn4+&#9472;O bond length and decrease the diffusion barrier for NH4+ ion in the interlayer of birnessite. Thus, an accelerated NH4+ ion diffusion coefficient of 1.58 &#215; 10&#8722;9 cm2 s&#8722;1 has been achieved, which is &#8776;5 times higher than of the pristine one and also higher than that in other cathode materials. The findings demonstrate that layered Na0.7Al0.1Mn0.9O2 is a very promising cathode candidate for NH4+ ion battery, and the Al pinning effect in birnessite can effectively suppress the J&#8211;T effect and enhance the NH4+ ion diffusion kinetics simultaneously.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupling Electron Transfer Kinetics Modulation via Substitution Isomerism of Amino Groups in MOFs to Switch CO2 Photoreduction Pathways from HCOOH to CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino&#8208;isomerous CPB@Fe/UiO&#8208;67&#8208;X (X = &#8208;m&#8208;NH2, &#8208;o&#8208;NH2, and &#8208;o&#8208;2NH2) are prepared for achieving unprecedented switchable product selectivity from HCOOH to CH3COOH during CO2 photoreduction. CPB@Fe/UiO&#8208;67&#8208;o&#8208;2NH2 achieves record&#8208;breaking CH3COOH productivity (257.22 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) and near&#8208;perfect selectivity (98.72%). Comprehensive analyses reveal that the cooperative interaction of polarized ZrFe dual sites with o&#8208;NH2 groups significantly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining *HOOC&#8208;CO, facilitating efficient CH3COOH production.








Abstract
Selective photoreduction of CO2 into high&#8208;value C2 products is highly desirable but challenging due to the high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier C&#8208;C coupling and sluggish proton&#8208;coupling electron transfers (PCET). Herein, CsPbBr3 (CPB) quantum dots are in&#8208;situ encapsulated within amino&#8208;functionalized Fe/UiO&#8208;67&#8208;X (X = meta&#8208;NH2, ortho&#8208;NH2, ortho&#8208;2NH2) frameworks for efficient CO2 photoreduction. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the presence of charge&#8208;asymmetrical ZrFe sites that promote C&#8208;C coupling and the covalently&#8208;connected Pb&#8208;N electron&#8208;transfer &#8220;bridge&#8221; that enhances carrier kinetics. Notably, the o&#8208;2NH2&#8208;functionalized CPB@Fe/UiO&#8208;67&#8208;o&#8208;2NH2 achieves a CH3COOH productivity of 257.22 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with 98.72% selectivity, whereas the m&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted analog (CPB@Fe/UiO&#8208;67&#8208;m&#8208;NH2) exclusively produces HCOOH. Comprehensive analyses demonstrate that the o&#8208;NH2 groups facilitate ultrafast electron transfer via a near Pb&#8211;N bridge and organize interfacial H2O into proton&#8208;conducting networks to ensure synchronized proton&#8208;supply. In&#8208;situ DRIFT and DFT calculations confirm that the o&#8208;NH2&#8208;induced rapid PCETdrives the conversion of *COOH at Zr sites to *CO, which subsequently couples with stabilized *COOH at Fe sites to form the critical *OC&#8208;COOH with the lowest energy barrier compared to *HOOC&#8208;COOH or *OC&#8208;CO pathways. This work establishes a design paradigm that necessitates the &#8220;temporal alignment&#8221; and &#8220;spatial coupling&#8221; of H&#8314; and e&#8722; at active sites for achieving high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 photoreduction by modulating interfacial electron&#8208;proton dynamics through simple group isomerism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into high-value C2 products is highly desirable but challenging due to the high-energy-barrier C-C coupling and sluggish proton-coupling electron transfers (PCET). Herein, CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CPB) quantum dots are in-situ encapsulated within amino-functionalized Fe/UiO-67-X (X = &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-2NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) frameworks for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the presence of charge-asymmetrical ZrFe sites that promote C-C coupling and the covalently-connected Pb-N electron-transfer &#8220;bridge&#8221; that enhances carrier kinetics. Notably, the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-2NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-functionalized CPB@Fe/UiO-67-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-2NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; achieves a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH productivity of 257.22 &#181;mol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 98.72% selectivity, whereas the &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-substituted analog (CPB@Fe/UiO-67-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) exclusively produces HCOOH. Comprehensive analyses demonstrate that the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups facilitate ultrafast electron transfer via a near Pb&#8211;N bridge and organize interfacial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into proton-conducting networks to ensure synchronized proton-supply. In-situ DRIFT and DFT calculations confirm that the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced rapid PCETdrives the conversion of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;COOH at Zr sites to &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO, which subsequently couples with stabilized &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;COOH at Fe sites to form the critical &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OC-COOH with the lowest energy barrier compared to &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;HOOC-COOH or &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OC-CO pathways. This work establishes a design paradigm that necessitates the &#8220;temporal alignment&#8221; and &#8220;spatial coupling&#8221; of H&#8314; and e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; at active sites for achieving high-performance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C2 photoreduction by modulating interfacial electron-proton dynamics through simple group isomerism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Environmental Response Temporal Release Injectable Hydrogel for Controlled Growth Factor Release to Enhance Inflammatory Periodontal Bone Defect Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops an injectable, multifunctional hydrogel integrating antioxidative, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and osteogenic properties. Responsive degradation enables staged release of concentrated growth factors (CGF) and low&#8208;dose bone morphogenetic protein&#8208;2 (BMP&#8208;2), efficiently regenerating periodontal bone defects. The system reduces BMP&#8208;2 dosage while maintaining efficacy, offering a precise strategy for inflammation&#8208;associated tissue repair.








Abstract
Regeneration of periodontal bone defects in an inflammatory microenvironment remains challenging due to oxidative stress and excessive bone resorption. Although various biomaterials have been developed, current strategies often fail to address the combined obstacles of immune dysregulation, oxidative damage, and bone loss. An injectable multifunctional hydrogel (HTF@HA) with a dynamic borate ester cross&#8208;linked network is designed to provide environmental responsiveness and temporal release of bioactive factors. Under acidic and oxidative conditions, the hydrogel degrades more rapidly and preferentially releases antioxidative and anti&#8208;inflammatory components, facilitating macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and alleviating inflammation. During the subsequent repair phase, calcium&#8208;phosphate interactions mediate the sustained release of concentrated growth factors (CGF) and low&#8208;dose bone morphogenetic protein&#8208;2 (BMP&#8208;2), supporting osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis. In vitro, HTF@HA exhibits high biocompatibility, antioxidative capacity, anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, and significant enhancement of periodontal ligament stem cell osteogenesis and endothelial cell angiogenesis under inflammatory conditions. Animal studies confirm that the hydrogel promoted new bone and vessel formation (p &lt; 0.001), and at a BMP&#8208;2 dose of 50&#160;&#181;g/L, it achieved bone regeneration comparable to high&#8208;dose BMP&#8208;2 (500&#160;&#181;g/L, p &gt; 0.05). Overall, HTF@HA provides a promising injectable biomaterial with &#8220;anti&#8208;inflammatory&#8208;antioxidant&#8208;regenerative&#8221; synergy for treating inflammation&#8208;associated periodontal bone defects.

         <title>Synergistic Microstructure and Composition Engineering via Na2S Enables High&#8208;Performance Porous PbTe Thermoelectrics with Ultrahigh Device Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2S&#8208;driven microstructure and composition co&#8208;design enables the simultaneous formation of hierarchical porosity and effective Na incorporation in PbTe&#8208;based thermoelectrics, promoting enhanced phonon scattering and optimized carrier transport properties. This integrated approach yields a record&#8208;high power density of 2.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#916;T&#160;=&#160;375&#160;K in thermoelectric modules, establishing a scalable route toward efficient and cost&#8208;effective mid&#8208;temperature energy conversion.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) materials, capable of directly converting heat into electricity, offer a promising route for sustainable energy recovery. However, practical deployment is limited by the difficulty in simultaneously optimizing electrical and thermal transport properties. In this study, a synergistic microstructure&#8208;composition co&#8208;design strategy for enhancing the performance of PbTe&#8208;based TEs via Na2S&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;state synthesis is presented. The thermal decomposition of Na2S not only introduces hierarchical porosity but also facilitates initial Na doping, enabling the concurrent optimization of phonon scattering, carrier concentration, and band convergence. The optimized composition, Pb0.97Na0.03Te&#8208;1.0%Na2S, exhibits refined grains, dispersed Na2Te nanoprecipitates, and a high density of dislocations, leading to ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.50&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 750&#160;K) while preserving excellent electrical transport. A peak TE figure of merit zT&#8776;2.2 at 823&#160;K and a high average zT &#8776;1.9 across 623&#8211;823&#160;K are achieved. To validate the device&#8208;level applicability, single&#8208;leg TE modules are fabricated, achieving a high conversion efficiency of 13.4% at &#916;T&#160;= 395&#160;K, which is among the best reported for a PbTe&#8208;based system. Furthermore, a unicouple module integrated with n&#8208;type skutterudite reaches a record power density of 2.2&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#916;T&#160;=&#160;375&#160;K. This study highlights a scalable pathway for advancing mid&#8208;temperature TE materials and devices through structural and compositional engineering.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Coordinated Multi&#8208;Kinetic 4D Printing of Human Vascularized Cardiac Tissues with Selective Fast&#8208;Shrinking Capillaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel 4D bioprinting technique for fabricating cardiac tissues with complex microvasculature. Unlike traditional 3D printing, it enables capillary&#8208;scale structure formation via selective post&#8208;printing shrinkage. This approach overcomes resolution limits of printing cell&#8208;laden hydrogels, allowing the creation of functional, vascularized tissues with fine structural details essential for regenerative medicine applications.








Abstract
The field of 3D bioprinting has made substantial progress in recent years, enabling the fabrication of vascular networks within engineered tissues to support the efficient transfer of oxygen and nutrients. However, a critical limitation remains: the restricted resolution of cell&#8208;laden bioink hydrogels, which impedes the precise formation of microscale structures such as capillaries. In this study, a novel, sequential, one&#8208;step bioprinting approach is introduced that enables the deposition of multiple cell&#8208;laden bioinks, facilitating the fabrication of functional, complex cardiac tissues with hierarchical microvasculature. Remarkably, this strategy enables pre&#8208;designed blood vessels to undergo selective shrinkage to capillary&#8208;scale dimensions within the parenchymal tissue under physiological conditions. Engineered cardiac tissues with perfusable, endothelialized vascular networks exhibit robust contractile function, and in vivo implantation demonstrate successful anastomosis of the vasculature with the host. This bioprinting strategy represents a significant advancement in the engineering of physiologically relevant tissue architectures, paving the way for the development of functional organotypic constructs for regenerative medicine and transplantation.

         <title>Revealing Capacitive Slope Capacity of Open Pore Carbon for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from the well&#8208;investigated intercalation/filling reactions, this work demonstrates an interesting sodium&#8208;ion storage mechanism: an ultrahigh&#8208;rate electric double&#8208;layer capacitive sodium&#8208;ion storage in disordered, open&#8208;pore carbon in a large potential window of 3&#8211;0.01 V vs Na+/Na, resulting in an exceptionally high initial coulombic efficiency of 92.4% and ultrahigh&#8208;rate capabilities.








Abstract
Disordered carbon materials exhibit slope and plateau Na+ storage capacities.

&lt;p&gt;Different from the well-investigated intercalation/filling reactions, this work demonstrates an interesting sodium-ion storage mechanism: an ultrahigh-rate electric double-layer capacitive sodium-ion storage in disordered, open-pore carbon in a large potential window of 3&#8211;0.01 V vs Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na, resulting in an exceptionally high initial coulombic efficiency of 92.4% and ultrahigh-rate capabilities.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by In Situ Solidified Polyphosphoester&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>

Dual&#8208;ion regulated polyphosphoester&#8208;based electrolyte (PPUM&#8208;PE) achieves dendrite&#8208;free uniform lithium(Li) deposition, constructing a protected anode with robust bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Assembled LiFePO4 batteries deliver 1000 cycles at 1C alongside significantly enhanced safety.








Abstract
The practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by the imbalanced periodic oscillatory distribution of cations/anions in liquid electrolytes (LEs) and thus the formed mechanically vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which collectively exacerbate lithium (Li) dendrite formation and degrade electrochemical stability. To overcome these issues, a polyphosphoester electrolyte (PPUM&#8208;PE) is designed through a dual&#8208;ion regulation strategy. The &#8210;NH&#8210; moieties in PPUM polymer effectively anchor anions, while its P&#9552;O/C&#9552;O functional groups reconstruct Li+ solvation architecture, collectively enabling an exceptional Li+ transference number (0.82) and improved reductive stability of the solvation sheath. A bilayer SEI layer formed on Li anodes&#8212;composed of an outer lithium&#8208;containing alkyl phosphate polymer and an inner LiF&#8208;enriched inorganic phase&#8212;exhibits high Young's modulus, effectively suppressing Li dendrite propagation and continuous electrolyte decomposition. Impressively, the as&#8208;assembled LMBs employing LiFePO4 cathodes retain 91.28% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1C. The electrolyte also demonstrates good compatibility with high&#8208;voltage cathodes (LiCoO2, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) and substantially improves battery thermal safety. This dual&#8208;ion synergistic regulation provides a scalable pathway toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Graphene&#8211;Vanadium Oxide Heterojunction Boosting Electron&#8211;Ion Coupling for Ultrahigh Energy Density Carbon Fiber Structural Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers the design of ultrahigh&#8208;energy&#8208;density carbon fiber structural supercapacitors using H2V3O8/rGO electrode coating. Density functional theory calculations and kinetic analyses reveales the underlying mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations highly relevant to practical applications are carried out, including mechanical tensile tests, as well as electrochemical behavior under compressive loading (0&#8211;120&#160;kPa) and even structural damage conditions. 








Abstract
The rapid advancement of drone logistics and electric aviation has created a growing demand for carbon fiber structural supercapacitors (CF&#8211;SSCs) that combine energy storage with lightweight and structural functionality. However, achieving high energy density remains challenging due to the chemical inertness of carbon fiber. In this work, it is demonstrated that H2V3O8/rGO is a promising and high&#8208;performance electrode coating for carbon fiber structural supercapacitors that possess both ultrahigh energy density and load&#8208;bearing functionality. Herein, a simple and efficient one&#8208;step high&#8208;temperature mixing hydrothermal method is developed to synthesize H2V3O8/rGO. Density functional theory calculations reveal that strong interfacial synergy between rGO and H2V3O8 promotes electron transport and Li+ diffusion, boosting efficient electron&#8211;ion coupling. The device exhibits high capacitance (964&#160;mF&#160;g&#8722;1) and exceptional energy density (502.1&#160;mWh&#160;kg&#8722;1), exceeding previously reported values. Remarkably, it maintains 88% capacitance retention after 5&#8201;000 cycles at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 under a compressive load of 120&#160;kPa, exceeding the 83% retention without load, demonstrating excellent electrochemical load&#8208;bearing stability. In addition, the device shows robust mechanical properties (127.2&#160;MPa tensile strength, 6.95&#160;GPa tensile modulus) and high safety, offering strong potential for practical application. This study proposes a promising strategy for designing CF&#8211;SSCs with high energy density.

         <title>Probing Local Asymmetric Site Anchored Anion Based on Multifunctional Polymer Electrolyte for Sustainable Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Metal Battery</title>

This work reveals an asymmetric Na+ transport mechanism in the PDNC electrolyte, in which nanocellulose selectively coordinates Na+, immobilizes anions, and promotes fast ion conduction, ultimately enabling stable sodium metal battery operation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SSMBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their inherent safety and high energy density. Among these various SSMBs, however, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) suffer from low room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity, poor mechanical stability, and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. To alleviate the detrimental effects, the study has designed a multifunctional polymer electrolyte based on localized asymmetric anion anchoring sites. After introducing nanocellulose (NC) fillers to form asymmetric PVDF&#8208;NC (PDNC)&#160;surface sites locally, the PDNC matrix can effectively coordinate TFSI&#8722; and Na+. This coordination facilitates the rapid transport of Na+, enabling effective regulation of sodium ion migration pathways and anion behavior. Specifically, &#8208;CF2&#8208;, F&#8722;, and N3&#8722; species stemming from the decomposition of CF3SO2NSO22&#8722; and CF3&#8208; groups through cleavage and reduction processes combine with Na to form NaF and Na3N, thereby enhancing interfacial stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that the asymmetric sites facilitate charge exchange and enhance interactions between the electrolyte and different molecules. The system demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and universality when paired with diverse cathodes (layered oxides and polyanion compounds). This work provides a sustainable strategy for designing high&#8208;performance SPEs, thus paving the way for safe and scalable SSMBs.

         <title>Acetylene&#8208;Triggered Gate&#8208;Opening Behavior in a Stable Rigid&#8208;Flexible MOF for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>

Zn&#8208;btb&#8208;dmtrz features a stable, rigid&#8208;flexible and 2&#8208;fold interpenetrating structure, which enables gate&#8208;opening effects for C2H2, achieving an optimal balance between flexibility and robustness.








Abstract
High&#8208;purity acetylene (C2H2) is indispensable in the chemical industry. However, C2H2 produced via the calcium carbide process contains trace CO2 impurities, necessitating purification. Due to their comparable molecular dimensions (3.3 &#215; 3.3 &#215; 5.7 &#197;3 for C2H2 vs 3.2 &#215; 3.3 &#215; 5.4 &#197;3 for CO2), achieving effective separation remains a challenge. For the first time, this work achieves efficient C2H2/CO2 separation in an ultra&#8208;stable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) featuring a synergistic rigid&#8208;flexible structure, characterized by a 2&#8208;fold interpenetrating MOF that incorporates an unprecedented [Zn4N9]n chain. The rigid molecular chains ensure stability, as the structure is retained after immersion in strong acidic environments for one month. The 2&#8208;fold interpenetration architecture imparts controlled structural flexibility to the framework, triggering a stimuli&#8208;responsive gate&#8208;opening phenomenon upon C2H2 adsorption. This dynamic structural transformation induces a significant pore environment modulation, as quantified by the expansion of the pore limiting diameter (PLD) from 3.09 to 3.34 &#197;. The precisely tuned aperture demonstrates exceptional molecular sieving capabilities, permitting selective C2H2 permeation while effectively rejecting CO2 molecules due to their differential kinetic diameters. Integrated analysis of gas adsorption isotherms, theoretical calculations, breakthrough experiments, and stability assessments synergistically confirm the structural robustness and selective separation efficacy of this interpenetrated framework.

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Configurations of Hybrid Self&#8208;assembled Molecules Enables High&#8208;performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;sulfanylbenzoic acid (BSCA) incorporation induces a reorientation of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Ph&#8208;4PACz)&#160;molecules on substrate from a lying&#8208;down to a standing&#8208;up geometry. The co&#8208;adsorption strategy not only resulted in a more homogeneous Ph&#8208;4PACz coverage with optimized energy alignment, but also improved the uniformity of the buried surface of perovskite films with inhibited interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, a high efficiency&#160;of 26.72% (certified 26.75%) is realized for the BSCA&#8208;based device.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) as hole&#8208;selective layers have achieved tremendous success in perovskite solar cells. However, the effective modulation of the adsorption configuration of hybrid SAMs on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates remains a challenge, which essentially influences the SAM's orientation and homogeneity. Herein, the adsorption configuration of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Ph&#8208;4PACz) on the ITO surface is modulated with co&#8208;assembled molecules 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (BCA) or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;4&#8208;sulfanylbenzoic acid (BSCA). Specifically, planar BCA molecules anchored via bi&#8208;carboxylic groups stabilize Ph&#8208;4PACz in a tilted configuration, forming an angle of approximately 54.03&#176; relative to the ITO surface, whereas tilted BSCA molecules anchored via mono&#8208;carboxylic groups induce Ph&#8208;4PACz to adopt an almost perpendicular orientation relative to the ITO surface. Upon BSCA introduction, the Ph&#8208;4PACz film becomes more uniform with better energy level alignment, which further results in the enhanced homogeneity of the buried surface of perovskite films with enhanced charge transport and reduced interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination losses. Consequently, the resultant BSCA&#8208;based devices achieve a high efficiency of 26.72% (certified 26.75%) for devices with the active area of 0.0717 cm2 and 25.21% for 1 cm2, respectively, maintaining over 90% of their initial efficiencies after 1,500 h operational tracking under illumination or 1000 h at 85 &#176;C heating.

         <title>Embedded Fe&#8208;Cu Pairs Enable Tandem Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem Fe&#8208;Cu pair catalyst, composing a single copper atom (Cu&#8211;N3) coordinated to adjacent iron clusters (Fe3N8), is designed. The electron&#8208;deficient copper sites markedly enhance nitrate adsorption, while the electron&#8208;rich iron clusters facilitate nitrite adsorption and water activation, thereby accelerating the electroreduction of nitrate and ultimately enabling efficient ammonia production.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction (e&#8208;NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3)&#160;represents a transformative technology that seamlessly integrates environmental remediation with resource regeneration. This approach is crucial for restoring equilibrium in the global nitrogen cycling, advancing green chemistry, and accelerating the transition toward a sustainable circular economy. However, under pH&#8208;neutral conditions, the simultaneous occurrence of two competing reactions (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction and NO3RR) at the same active sites results in considerable interference, significantly limiting the catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Here a Fe&#8208;Cu pair (Cu&#8208;N3/Fe3&#8208;N8) electrocatalyst is meticulously designed, achieving a NH3 production rate of 18.83 mg&#8729;h&#8210;1&#8729;mgcat&#8210;1 at &#8722;0.65&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), accompanied with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.1%. This as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;Cu pair overcomes the limitations of conventional bimetallic catalysts, which typically rely on direct atomic coupling. The electron&#8208;deficient region formed by Cu&#8211;N3 enhances the adsorption of nitrate, while the electron&#8208;rich domain generated by the Fe3&#8211;N8 cluster facilitates the adsorption of nitrite and promotes water activation. The spatially separated charge gradient optimizes the adsorption energies of multi&#8208;step reaction intermediates, thereby establishing a relay mechanism. The work provides valuable insights into the design of multi&#8208;active&#8208;site electrocatalysts and offers a promising approach to addressing critical challenges in nitrogen resource conversion.

         <title>Synergistic Isothiourea&#8211;Guanidine Additive for Achieving Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Certified Quasi&#8208;Steady&#8208;State Output</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric isothiourea&#8211;guanidine additive dihydrochloride is developed, which uniformly distributes throughout the perovskite. The isothiourea group preferentially regulates perovskite crystallization along (001) orientation, while guanidine group contributes to suppressing ion migration by formation of N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds, enabling a 26.73% efficiency with a highest certified steady&#8208;state power output of 26.73% to date and an over 4000 h operational stability.








Abstract
Guanidinium and thiourea derivatives play significant roles in suppressing both shallow&#8208; and deep&#8208;level defects, regulating perovskite crystallization, and leading to enhanced performance for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an asymmetric isothiourea&#8211;guanidine hybrid dihydrochloride is designed by merging the two functional motifs onto a thiazole core to overcome the long&#8208;overlooked competition between guanidinium and thiourea additives. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that the isothiourea arm selectively orients crystal growth along the (001) plane while effectively suppressing the formation of dimethylsulfoxide&#9472;PbI2 and other deleterious intermediate phases, whereas the guanidinium counterpart immobilizes iodide ions via N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonding, lowering ion&#8208;migration activation energy. The resulting films exhibit suppressed defect densities, relieved residual strain, and an air&#8208;stable black phase retained after 11 days of ambient aging. Consequently, MA&#8208;free PSC delivers one of the highest certified quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state output of 26.73% (p&#8211;i&#8211;n), a conventional 26.18% (n&#8211;i&#8211;p), and an indoor&#8208;light champion of 44.60% (n&#8211;i&#8211;p). Notably, the devices retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiency after 4000 h of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination (international summit on organic photovoltaic stability (ISOS)&#8208;L&#8208;1) and 2000 h of dark storage (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1).

The isothiourea group preferentially regulates perovskite crystallization along (001) orientation, while guanidine group contributes to suppressing ion migration by formation of N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds, enabling a 26.73% efficiency with a highest certified steady-state power output of 26.73% to date and an over 4000 h operational stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guanidinium and thiourea derivatives play significant roles in suppressing both shallow- and deep-level defects, regulating perovskite crystallization, and leading to enhanced performance for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an asymmetric isothiourea&#8211;guanidine hybrid dihydrochloride is designed by merging the two functional motifs onto a thiazole core to overcome the long-overlooked competition between guanidinium and thiourea additives. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that the isothiourea arm selectively orients crystal growth along the (001) plane while effectively suppressing the formation of dimethylsulfoxide&#9472;PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other deleterious intermediate phases, whereas the guanidinium counterpart immobilizes iodide ions via N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonding, lowering ion-migration activation energy. The resulting films exhibit suppressed defect densities, relieved residual strain, and an air-stable black phase retained after 11 days of ambient aging. Consequently, MA-free PSC delivers one of the highest certified quasi-steady-state output of 26.73% (p&#8211;i&#8211;n), a conventional 26.18% (n&#8211;i&#8211;p), and an indoor-light champion of 44.60% (n&#8211;i&#8211;p). Notably, the devices retain &amp;gt;90% of their initial efficiency after 4000 h of continuous 1-sun illumination (international summit on organic photovoltaic stability (ISOS)-L-1) and 2000 h of dark storage (ISOS-D-1).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Type Solvation Structure Enables Freeze&#8208;Tolerant Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To construct freeze&#8208;tolerant aqueous Zn&#8208;V batteries with improved low&#8208;temperature performance, a fluorinated solvent with weak coordination and dissociation capacity is utilized as a functional co&#8208;solvent to re&#8208;shape the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+ from H2O&#8208;dominated to anion&#8208;dominated in an aqueous environment.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries represent a promising solution for large&#8208;scale energy storage, offering inherent safety and cost advantages. However, their subzero operation is fundamentally constrained by severely retarded reaction kinetics of Zn2+. Herein, to construct high&#8208;performance, freeze&#8208;tolerant aqueous zinc&#8208;vanadium batteries, 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) with weak coordination and dissociation capacity is introduced as a functional co&#8208;solvent to reconstruct Zn2&#8314; solvation structures from water&#8208;dominated ([Zn(H2O)6]2+) to anion&#8208;dominated ([Zn(H2O)2(OTf&#8722;)4]2&#8722;) in 1&#160;M Zn(OTf)2. The as&#8208;constructed anion&#8208;type solvation configuration creates low&#8208;barrier desolvation/migration ion channels and anion&#8208;rich interface, leading to key improvements in bulk Zn2&#8314; ion transport and interfacial stability, benefiting both the anodic and cathodic chemistry. Substantial improvement of Zn plating/stripping reversibility, contributed by promoted Zn&#8208;diffusion kinetics and OTf&#8722;&#8208;derived robust protective interphase, is obtained from 25 to &#8722;20 &#176;C, while long&#8208;term structure integrity of NaV3O8&#8729;1.5H2O cathode, attributed to the prohibition of H2O&#8208;driven degradation and dissolution issues, is also effectively maintained. Consequently, even at &#8722;20 &#176;C, where the pure aqueous electrolyte hardly works, the Zn||NaV3O8&#8729;1.5H2O assembled in 2&#8208;MeTHF&#8208;containing electrolyte still presents long&#8208;term cycling durability up to 8000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1, with negligible capacity decay throughout the test. This work highlights the significant role of anion&#8208;type solvation of Zn2+ in achieving wide&#8208;temperature aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>Tuning Active Hydrogen on Reconstructed RuO2/Co(OH)2 Catalysts for Selective Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined approach of precatalyst design and electrolyte engineering is employed to develop highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for electrochemical nitrate reduction. In alkaline media, the reconstructed RuO2/Co(OH)2 catalyst demonstrates impressive performance in ammonia synthesis, rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery, and the remediation of nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) is widely recognized as a promising strategy for sustainable ammonia production and supporting the nitrogen cycle. However, its advancement is impeded by complex behavior of reaction intermediates and the inevitable reconstruction of precatalysts. To address these challenges, the generation and utilization of active hydrogen (*H) are strategically managed by tailoring the RuO2/Co3O4 precatalyst and optimizing the electrolyte composition (OH&#8722; and NO3&#8722; concentration), thereby selectively enhancing ammonia formation. Consequently, the in situ reconstructed RuO2/Co(OH)2 catalyst achieves an impressive ammonia yield of 35.9&#160;&#177;&#160;0.9&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.1&#160;&#177;&#160;2.6% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE. Furthermore, the catalyst shows significant potential for applications in nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater treatment and rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; batteries, maintaining stable operation for over 260 hours at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only a 6&#160;mV increase in the potential window. Mechanistic studies reveal that electron&#8208;rich RuO2 facilitates *H generation through water dissociation, which subsequently migrates to Co(OH)2 to hydrogenate nitrogenous intermediates, selectively producing ammonia. This study highlights the importance of designing efficient catalytic systems that address both precatalyst reconstruction and the complexities of reactant and intermediate conversion in electrolytes, which are essential for managing the intricate electron and proton transfer processes involved in eNO3RR.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Particulate Surface Pinning of CeO2 Enables Durable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel CeO2 nanoparticle pinning structure is developed to coat and stabilize LiCoO2 at high voltages. This coating structure addresses cathode degradation by accommodating volume changes and supressing fracture formation. Moreover, it enhances Li&#8314; transport kinetics and acts as an oxygen reservoir, ensuring interfacial and structural stability of cathode material.








Abstract
Elevating the cut&#8208;off voltage of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) enhances capacity but increases structural instability. While surface coatings are used to mitigate structural degradation at high voltages, conventional full coverage coatings often fail to withstand the cyclic mechanical stress, resulting in crack formation and performance decay. Here, a multifunctional CeO2 nanoparticle (NP) pinning structure is designed as a surface coating on LCO (LCO@CeO2) to enable stable operation at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V (vs Li/Li+). This surface pinning architecture balances structural integrity with minimal inactive material usage. The CeO2 NPs are strategically anchored to the LCO surface, creating a pinning structure that accommodates volume changes and suppresses fracture formation in the cathode. Moreover, the CeO2&#8208;mediated fast Li+ transport pathways are established, improving high&#8208;rate capability. The interspersed CeO2 NPs also act as oxygen reservoirs, stabilizing reversible (O2)3&#8722; species during high&#8208;voltage oxygen anionic redox reactions. Consequently, the optimized LCO@CeO2 cathode achieves a capacity retention of 85.3% after 500 cycles at 1C and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 124.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10C. This CeO2 NP pinning structure offers a novel practical strategy for designing durable high&#8208;voltage layered cathodes.

         <title>A Versatile Materials Class for Solution&#8208;Processed Optics and Photonics Based On Titanium Oxide Hydrates and Polyalcohols: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, solution&#8208;processable class of optical materials based on molecular hybrids of metal oxide hydrates and commodity polymers is discussed here, including their synthesis, processing into thin films, patterning, and photonic structures realized to date. Due to their low optical loss and tunable refractive index through composition and post&#8208;deposition treatments, this library of materials expands the capabilities to control light.








Abstract
The ability to propagate light within a structure comprising a controlled spatial distribution of the refractive index n prompted the telecommunications revolution of the 20th century. More recently, progress with exploiting the flow of light has led to a broad range of light&#8208; and heat&#8208;management tools, as well as novel quantum devices. This perspective discusses a new versatile class of optical materials based on molecular hybrids of metal oxide hydrates and commodity polymers, such as poly(vinyl alcohol). These fascinating, easy&#8208;to&#8208;produce materials are examined, and their processing into useful architectures such as photonic crystals is reviewed, with a focus on thin&#8208;film optics. Their potential in other areas is also assessed, for instance, for the fabrication of optical microcavities that allow the formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons, enabling studies on strong light&#8208;matter interactions. Generally, these molecular hybrids open future opportunities in applications like optics, photonics, quantum devices, catalysis, and beyond.

         <title>Boosting Mechanoluminescence Performance in Doped CaZnOS by the Facile Self&#8208;Reduction Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 3, 13 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;reduction primarily enhances mechanoluminescence intensity by deliberately introducing lattice defects, which increase structural distortion and amplify the piezoelectric response, thereby improving the force&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion efficiency. Additionally, self&#8208;reduction optimizes the local distribution of Mn2+ ions, promoting energy concentration within the emission band.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML), the emission of light under mechanical stimuli, shows great potential in passive sensing, wearable devices, and biomedical diagnostics. However, the practical application of ML materials is hindered by low intensity and poor self&#8208;recoverable performance. Herein, a Mn4+&#8594;Mn2+ self&#8208;reduction strategy is presented to significantly enhance the self&#8208;recoverable ML performance of CaZnOS by inducing lattice defects and promoting distortion in its noncentrosymmetric hexagonal structure. This approach enhances the internal piezoelectric response and increases the maximum ML intensity up to 4 times. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, electron paramagnetic resonance, piezoresponse force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations reveal that the composite defects involving VO&#183;&#183;${\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}}^{\cdot \cdot}$ and VZn&#8242;&#8242;${\mathrm{V}}_{{\mathrm{Zn}}}^{{\mathrm{^{\prime\prime}}}}$ are the key to the significant enhancement of ML. Furthermore, this strategy is successfully extended to rare&#8208;earth ions codoped systems, achieving a general enhancement of near&#8208;infrared ML emission. Based on these findings, a multilayer orthodontic sensor is developed, capable of real&#8208;time occlusal mapping and bite&#8208;force monitoring. The device exhibits sensitive response across 0&#8211;12 N and achieves 96.89% accuracy in occlusal localization through neuromorphic image recognition. This work offers a generalizable route toward ML performance optimization and paves the way for the development of advanced intelligent sensing technologies.

         <title>Sacrificial Biofabrication for Vascularization: Concept, Materials, Technologies, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vasculature is indispensable for tissue viability in regenerative medicine. The sacrificial biofabrication enables precise fabrication of vascular channels by using temporary templates that are subsequently removed. This review defines the concept and delves into sacrificial materials, surrounding materials, fabrication technologies, and biomedical applications, offering insights into current advancements and future prospects in vascular engineering through sacrificial biofabrication.









Abstract
Vasculature plays a crucial role in tissue engineering since it is essential for maintaining tissue viability by efficient nutrient and oxygen exchange as well as waste removal. The creation of biomimetic vascular networks is therefore critical for the development of functional tissue constructs. Sacrificial biofabrication has emerged as an effective method for engineering vascular structures by creating temporary templates that are subsequently removed to form well&#8208;defined vascular channels. In this review, the concept of sacrificial biofabrication is introduced and defined, with a focus on vascularization. Then, a comprehensive overview of the commonly used sacrificial materials based on different types of external stimuli is provided, and the classification and design principles of surrounding materials are briefly introduced. Additionally, various fabrication technologies employed to process sacrificial materials are summarized, and the diverse applications of sacrificial biofabrication in disease models and regenerative medicine are discussed. Finally, the current challenges are highlighted, and the future perspectives for advancing sacrificial biofabrication are explored to address the demand for vasculature manufacturing.

Blue&#8208;emitting electroluminescent quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) face critical challenges that limit their practical application, including short operational lifetimes, low color purity, broad spectral linewidths, and unpredictable transient effects like blinking and positive aging. This review explores the underlying mechanisms behind these challenges, discussing key knowledge gaps that require further investigations, and highlighting recent developments of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue QD&#8208;LEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) are electroluminescent devices where the emissive layer consists of inorganic colloidal quantum dots. Recent breakthroughs have enabled the development of bright and efficient blue&#8208;emitting QD&#8208;LEDs based on heavy metal&#8208;free compositions. However, challenges remain that hinder their practical application in electroluminescent displays and lighting technologies. The primary obstacle is their limited operational lifetimes which remain significantly below practical requirement standards, especially in comparison to the red&#8208; and green&#8208;emitting QD&#8208;LEDs. Another important issue is the low color purity and broad spectral linewidths of heavy metal&#8208;free blue quantum dot compositions. Additional problems include transient electroluminescent behaviors such as fluorescence intermittency and positive aging effects. This review examines the current understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying these challenges faced by blue QD&#8208;LEDs. Often, contradictory explanations are proposed to account for the same phenomenon. Here, potential interpretations are suggested that may help reconcile the conflicting reports. Recent advances are further examined that have contributed to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue QD&#8208;LEDs.

This review systematically examines C&#8722;N coupling mechanisms, discusses atomic&#8208;level catalysts with multiple active sites (dual&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;atom, dual&#8208;nucleus heterogeneous dual&#8208;atom, and dual&#8208;nucleus heteroatomic dual&#8208;atom), highlights characterization and theoretical calculations in C&#8722;N electrocatalysis, identifies future challenges/opportunities, aiming to guide atomic&#8208;level catalyst design for electrochemical C&#8722;N coupling.








Abstract
Electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling for the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals, such as urea and amides, offers a significant advantage over traditional chemical methods. The latter are characterized by high energy consumption and pollution. However, the complexity of reaction intermediates and competing reactions in electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling leads to low product selectivity. In addition, Faradaic efficiency is typically below 50%. Therefore, studying intermediates and designing catalysts are crucial for improving selectivity. Atomic&#8208;level dispersed catalysts modify the structure and composition around the central metal atoms. This results in higher atomic efficiency and catalytic selectivity. This review systematically examines the C&#9472;N coupling mechanism, from single&#8208;step reactions to intermediate coupling processes. It then discusses the design of atomic&#8208;level catalysts with multiple active sites from three perspectives: 1) dual&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;atom catalyst, 2) dual&#8208;nucleus heterogeneous dual&#8208;atom catalysts, and 3) dual&#8208;nucleus heteroatomic dual&#8208;atom catalyst. Additionally, the review highlights the applications of characterization techniques and theoretical calculations in C&#9472;N electrocatalysis. Finally, it identifies future challenges and opportunities for development in this field. The review aims to provide theoretical guidance for designing atomic&#8208;level catalysts for electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling reactions.

Abstract
Semiconductor photocatalysis presents a promising route to convert solar energy into storable fuels and tackle global energy and environmental challenges. However, its efficiency is often hindered by rapid electron&#8211;hole recombination. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;a class of crystalline, porous organic polymers&#8212;offer exceptional potential for photocatalysis owing to their precisely tunable structures and distinctive physicochemical properties, yet their performance remains limited by intrinsic charge recombination. To overcome this limitation, the construction of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions has been proposed as a promising strategy to enhance charge separation while maintaining strong redox capabilities. This review begins by presenting a comprehensive perspective on the development and scientific significance of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. It then systematically summarizes the design principles and synthetic strategies of COFs, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the fabrication methods and principles of COF&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques that enable precise elucidation of charge migration pathways within these heterostructures are highlighted. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of recent applications of COF&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts, including hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, environmental remediation, hydrogen peroxide production, and others. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed to inspire continued innovation in the development of high&#8208;performance S&#8208;scheme photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Strong Stabilization of Co Nanoparticles by CeO2&#8208;x Clusters in Inverse CeOx/Co Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse CeOx/Co catalysts are promising new materials for CO2 methanation. Operando spectroscopy reveals that small, reducible CeO2&#8208;x clusters effectively stabilize Co nanoparticles from sintering during H2 reduction and promote CO2 activation at the Co&#8208;CeO2 interface. This leads to abundant metallic Co surface sites and a high coverage of surface carbonyl intermediates, thereby facilitating CH4 formation.








Abstract
Inverse catalysts, where metal oxide species are dispersed over metallic nanoparticles, represent a promising class of materials for accelerating various chemical reactions. However, stabilizing metal nanoparticles with a small amount of oxide clusters remains a significant challenge, as the metallic phase tends to sinter under reaction conditions due to insufficient immobilization. In this study, flame spray pyrolysis is employed to synthesize uniformly sized inverse CeOx/Co catalysts for CO2 methanation (Sabatier reaction). It is found that small, highly reducible CeO2&#8208;x clusters effectively stabilize metallic cobalt nanoparticles, thereby preventing sintering even during hydrogen reduction at 500&#160;&#176;C and during CO2 hydrogenation. Detailed operando characterization demonstrates that this stabilization leads to a high density of metallic Co sites interfaced with CeO2&#8208;x clusters, which facilitates CO2 activation into carbonyl (CO*) intermediates, resulting in significantly enhanced&#160;CH4 formation rates. Notably, an inverse CeOx/Co catalyst containing 20 mol% Ce exhibits a methanation rate an order of magnitude higher than that of a CeO2&#8208;free Co catalyst. These findings highlight the dual role of CeO2&#8208;x clusters in both stabilizing Co nanoparticles and enhancing catalytic performance, offering a robust strategy for improving CO2 hydrogenation performance.

         <title>Personalized Vaccination of Tumor&#8208;Derived Antigens and STING Agonists for Specific Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Personalized immunotherapy strategy to treat tumors by its own mechanism is achieved through the hydrogel&#8208;integrated delivery of tumor&#8208;derived antigens and STING agonists, which can activate specific antitumor immune responses for prevention and inhibition of tumor growth via promotion of the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells and elicitation of tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.








Abstract
Personalized vaccines have shown their promise in cancer immunotherapy, while screening of personalized antigens remains challenging. Herein, a personalized immunotherapy strategy to treat tumors by its own mechanism is reported, which is achieved through the hydrogel&#8208;integrated delivery of tumor&#8208;derived antigens and STING signaling activation. Self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles composed of gallic acid, manganese ions, and mitoxantrone are prepared to induce immunogenic cell death of tumor cells in vitro to release damage&#8208;associated&#8198;molecular&#8198;patterns and autologous antigens. Sodium alginate integrated with the released antigens and STING agonists (i.e., MSA&#8208;2) can be instantaneously cross&#8208;linked with endogenous calcium ions in vivo to form hydrogels upon subcutaneous injection. The hydrogels allow for the controlled release of autologous tumor antigens and agonists to activate specific anti&#8208;tumor immune responses via promotion of the maturation of dendritic cells and elicitation of tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As a result, the in&#8208;situ formation of hydrogel&#8208;based vaccines can prevent homologous tumor progression and inhibit metastatic tumor growth. This work outlines a straightforward and generalized strategy for personalized vaccination to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Neuroimmune Microenvironment Reprogramming via Immuno&#8208;piezoelectric Transducers for Synergistic Stem Cell Therapy in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer is innovatively developed. This device promotes neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation and maturation via ultrasound&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and it amplifies the therapeutic efficacy of NSC in traumatic brain injury (TBI) by modulating the immune microenvironment. This piezoelectric transducer with &#8220;immune&#8208;neuro&#8221; dual&#8208;modulation functions, combined with NSC, provides a new strategy for nerve regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Secondary traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces a pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment that hampers neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy and tissue regeneration. To address this challenge, an immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer have been developed to create an anti&#8208;inflammatory immune microenvironment, deliver wireless electrical stimulation, and facilitate multimodal NSCs therapy. The immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer drives the polarization of microglia towards the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype and secretion of anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. This modulation significantly reduces the inflammatory response, creating an optimal microenvironment for NSCs survival. Furthermore, the wireless electrical stimulation generated by ultrasound facilitates NSCs differentiation into glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, enhances neurite complexity, upregulates synaptic proteins expression and neural integration in injured regions. The multimodal therapy demonstrates superior outcomes in restoring structural integrity, improving functional, and enhancing behavioral action in TBI rat models. This study integrates piezoelectric with immunomodulation to reprogram the neuroimmune microenvironment, providing novel therapeutic paradigm for brain injury repair.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that hampers neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy and tissue regeneration. To address this challenge, an immuno-piezoelectric transducer have been developed to create an anti-inflammatory immune microenvironment, deliver wireless electrical stimulation, and facilitate multimodal NSCs therapy. The immuno-piezoelectric transducer drives the polarization of microglia towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This modulation significantly reduces the inflammatory response, creating an optimal microenvironment for NSCs survival. Furthermore, the wireless electrical stimulation generated by ultrasound facilitates NSCs differentiation into glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, enhances neurite complexity, upregulates synaptic proteins expression and neural integration in injured regions. The multimodal therapy demonstrates superior outcomes in restoring structural integrity, improving functional, and enhancing behavioral action in TBI rat models. This study integrates piezoelectric with immunomodulation to reprogram the neuroimmune microenvironment, providing novel therapeutic paradigm for brain injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Zero&#8208;Thermal Quenching Flexible Fiber for Visible Cellular Concentration Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional biosensors suffer thermal drift, limiting accuracy. Here, an innovative flexible optical fiber detector incorporating a novel phosphor Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3&#8314; is developed, which exhibits zero thermal quenching (up to 200&#160;&#176;C) at 577 nm. This device achieves stable (&#916;x/y &lt; 0.003) and precise (200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1) HbO2 concentration measurement. This work provides a breakthrough in reusable, temperature&#8208;resistant biosensing technology.








Abstract
The development of stable and precise visible light sources is crucial for advanced cellular analysis, yet current spectrophotometric systems face significant challenges, particularly temperature&#8208;dependent signal drift and decreased measurement accuracy. In this work, a novel yellow&#8208;emitting phosphor Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3+ is developed, which demonstrates exceptional thermal stability with zero&#8208;thermal quenching (ZTQ) up to 200&#160;&#176;C. This remarkable performance is achieved through the strategic manipulation of trap&#8208;assisted thermoluminescence enhancement mechanisms. In addition, a flexible optical detector is developed for oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) concentration testing by incorporating Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3+ in stretchable elastomer&#8208;based optical fiber. The fabricated device exhibits exceptional photoluminescence stability (near&#8208;zero chromaticity drift, &#916;x/y &lt; 0.003 from 10 to 40&#160;&#176;C), and promising measurement accuracy (200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1). Tb3+/ Eu3+/ Pr3+ doped Gd3ScGa4O12 is also developed, which all perform favorable thermal stability. This finding not only provides a reliable and reusable cellular concentration detector but also establishes a ZTQ design framework for lanthanide&#8208;doped materials.

         <title>Achieving Enhanced Reversible Anionic Redox Activity in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides via LiCoMn5 Superstructure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moderate incorporation of Co into LiMn6 mainly produces LiCoMn5 superstructure units in LRLO&#8208;Co10, where highly reversible ARR activity is achieved, and Li3&#8208;O&#8208;LiTM2 coordination is regulated from O(I)&#8208; or/and O(II)&#8208;type coordination to relatively stable Li3&#8208;O(III)&#8208;LiCoMn. With this unique structure, LRLO&#8208;Co10 exhibits a reversible capacity of 259.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 1C with a capacity retention of 95.7%.








Abstract
The Li&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathode drives the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;based batteries, owing to its ultrahigh capacity contributed from cationic redox and extra oxygen anionic redox reaction (ARR). However, unlocking higher ARR activity without compromising reversibility remains challenging. Herein, a series of LRLO samples with varying Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn compositions is designed to synergistically enhance ARR activity and reversibility. On the one hand, the absence of Co results in suppressed ARR activity for traditional Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 with LiMn6 superstructures, causing inferior O&#8208;related capacity and cycling stability. On the other hand, excessive Co/Mn atomic exchange within the honeycomb structure by forming LiConMn6&#8208;n (n &#8805; 2) units activates more O&#8208;redox capacity for another typical Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2, but induces oxygen instability and low ARR reversibility. Notably, moderate incorporation of Co into LiMn6 mainly produces LiCoMn5 (n = 1) superstructures in Li1.2(Mn0.65Ni0.25Co0.1)0.8O2 (LRLO&#8208;Co10) with Li3&#8208;O&#8208;LiCoMn coordination. This unique structure enables highly reversible ARR activity. Consequently, LRLO&#8208;Co10 exhibits a reversible capacity exceeding 300 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C and retains 95.7% of the initial capacity (271.1 mAh g&#8722;1) after 300 cycles at 1C. These findings provide a valuable insight into compositional optimization and a strategy for achieving high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich cathodes.

         <title>Ultrabright and Ultrasmall Chiral Luminescence Pixel Based on Thorned&#8208;Helicoid&#8208;on&#8208;Mirror</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superbright chiral photoluminescence is achieved based on the chiral Purcell enhancement of plasmonic nanocavities made of thorned helicoid&#8208;on&#8208;mirror (THoM). The chiral emission can be tunable through the assembly of achiral dyes in the chiral plasmonic nanocavity, which displays colored chiral images of letters &#8220;P&#8221; and &#8220;L&#8221; through circular polarizers.








Abstract
Achieving highly circularly polarized luminescence has long been a primary objective in the design, synthesis, and application of chiral luminophores. However, a persistent challenge arises from the trade&#8208;off between large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) and high luminescence efficiency, resulting in typically mediocre brightness for most chiral emitters and limiting their practical use. While various strategies have been proposed to enhance glum, these values rarely exceed 1.0 and often come at the cost of diminished luminescence intensity. In this article, an extreme nanophotonic approach is employed using thorned helicoid&#8208;on&#8208;mirror (THoM) constructs to generate intense local optical chirality, which is then coupled to achiral dyes with high quantum yields. An efficient coupling is revealed between the strong superchiral near field and the dyes within the chiral nanocavity, which not only produces glum values exceeding 1.0 but also amplifies both excitation and emission processes via a pronounced chiral Purcell effect, leading to ultrahigh brightness in circularly polarized luminescence. By adjusting the dye assembly and its corresponding emission peaks, tunable chiral emission is achieved, demonstrating significant potential for advanced chiral displays and information encryption. Furthermore, this high&#8208;performance chiral emitting system holds promise for on&#8208;chip integration of chiral lasers and chiral single&#8208;photon sources.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;containing hyperbranched polymer is developed to guide oriented crystallization and construct a cross&#8208;linked hydrophobic network, enabling the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with enhanced environmental stability. The resulting devices deliver a PCE of 26.05% (0.04&#160;cm2) and 22.43% (16.1&#160;cm2), while maintaining 97% of their initial efficiency after 1500 h of unencapsulated operation at 50&#8211;55&#160;&#176;C under continuous illumination.

Solution&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells have significant potential for large&#8208;scale manufacture, but the production of perovskite film with high crystallinity over large areas remains a major challenge. Here, a fluorine&#8208;containing hyperbranched polymer is shown for meticulous control of the perovskite film crystallization. Synergistic coordination of functional fluorine groups and perovskite species constrains the complex intermediate phases and facilitates the formation of spatially oriented perovskite films with high crystallinity and phase purity. Simultaneously, the thermal radical polymerization during the annealing process creates a cross&#8208;linked hydrophobic network, which enhances resistance to moisture. This results in efficient regular planar perovskite solar cells with a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 26.05% for small devices (active area 0.04 cm2) and 22.43% for large devices (active area 16.1 cm2) under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent operating stability, with 97% of initial efficiency remaining at the maximum power point tracking for 1500 h under continuous illumination (one sunlight intensity) at 50&#8211;55&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Octahedral Twisting&#8208;Mediated van der Waals Stacking Induces Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low thermal conductivity (&#954;) is an important physical parameter inherent to all solids, and the quest for intrinsic ultralow&#8208;&#954; solids is one of the key scientific issues. By designing asymmetric units in van der Waals material In2Ge2Se&#8326;, ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.2 W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1) is achieved, demonstrating functional&#8208;unit control over phonon anharmonicity and group velocity. 








Abstract
Low thermal conductivity (&#954;) is an important physical parameter inherent to all solids, and the quest for intrinsic ultralow&#8208;&#954; solids is one of the key scientific issues. Material design based on functional units can achieve control over lattice and phonon dynamics, and it is proposed that asymmetric structural units&#8208;mediated van der Waals stacking can collectively lead to the low thermal conductivity. Herein, a novel van der Waals material In2G2Se&#8326; is reported, in which the distorted InSe&#8326; octahedron forms monolayers in conjunction with Ge2Se&#8326; dimers, which are further stacked along the c&#8208;axis via weak metavalent bonding. The distorted octahedron and van der Waals stacking result in large anharmonicity and ultrasoft acoustic phonon along &#915;&#8211;Z direction, respectively. Consequently, In2Ge2Se6 exhibits ultralow out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, &#954;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#8776;0.2&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at 600 K. This study establishes a model for phonon physics that simultaneously enhances phonon&#8208;phonon scattering and lowers the phonon group velocity, revealing the great potential of functional&#8208;unit&#8208;based material design for low&#8208;&#954; solids.

         <title>Increasing Aromaticity in Selenium&#8208;Embedded Hetero Ring Enables Stable Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter for Long&#8208;Lifetime Pure&#8208;Green OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
Increasing aromaticity in a series of selenium&#8208;embedded hetero rings stabilizes the emitter while exploits the advantages of heavy atoms effect, which results in narrowband pure&#8208;green OLEDs with high efficiency, reduced roll&#8208;off and long device lifetime.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that simultaneously achieve narrowband emission, superior efficiency, and extended operational stability remains a significant challenge for thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Herein, a novel molecular architecture is reported that strategically integrates selenium (Se) into a rigid pentagonal aromatic sextet (dibenzoselenophene, DBSe) within a multi&#8208;resonance (MR) framework, addressing the intrinsic limitations of hexagonal Se&#8208;MR systems. The developed molecule DBSe&#8208;BN exhibits a rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate in the order of 106 s&#8722;1 and narrow emission bandwidth of 21&#160;nm, providing persuasive guarantee for high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;green emission. Notably, the DBSe&#8208;BN&#8208;based OLEDs demonstrate exceptional performance, including a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 38.8%, suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000 = 33.7%), and pure&#8208;green emission, characterized by Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.73). The devices exhibit remarkable operational stability, with greatly prolonged lifetime (LT50) of 1341&#160;h based on binary&#8208;emitting system and 5310&#160;h based on the ternary device, at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work presents a feasible strategy for gathering high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF emitters, achieving a multi&#8208;dimensional balanced OLED with enhanced FWHM, CIE, EQE, roll&#8208;off and lifetime promoted by Se&#8208;embedded aromatic sextet.

Programmable Liquid&#8208;Metal Electronics
In the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202506383), Wedyan Babatain and colleagues report a programmable continuous electrowetting strategy to steer gallium&#8208;based liquid metal on graphitic substrates by tuning its electrochemical potential on&#8208;demand. This enables surface&#8208;enabled valves, size&#8208;dependent sorting, and feedback sensing. A two&#8208;layer reconfigurable circuit demonstrates liquid metal as dynamic interconnects for sequential and parallel component activation and healing of broken traces, enabling physical hardware updates.

This enables surface-enabled valves, size-dependent sorting, and feedback sensing. A two-layer reconfigurable circuit demonstrates liquid metal as dynamic interconnects for sequential and parallel component activation and healing of broken traces, enabling physical hardware updates.

Bio&#8208;Inspired Artificial Muscles
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202503094), Shengqiang Cai, Yong&#8208;Lae Park, and co&#8208;workers report a bio&#8208;inspired artificial muscle&#8211;tendon complex (MTC) based on liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with embedded liquid&#8208;metal channels, illustrated as an artificial actuator connected to biological muscle in the image. The MTC integrates both actuation and proprioceptive sensing within a single structure, enabling simultaneous efferent actuation and afferent feedback. Mimicking natural musculature through an antagonistic arrangement, the system achieves closed&#8208;loop bidirectional control, demonstrated in robotic finger and gripper applications.

Biosensing Platform for In Vivo Thrombus Monitoring
A novel biosensing platform is developed using an MXene&#8208;powered terahertz metamaterial, which substantially increases the early thrombus detection ability by utilizing the highly sensitive terahertz response from the interfacial charge transfer between MXene and thrombus. This platform demonstrates the potential for tailoring clinical anticoagulation strategies for individual patients to reduce the current high risk of thrombus complications for cardiovascular diseases. More details can be found in the Research Article by Ke Yang, Xu Xiao, Min Hu, Xiang Yang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202507063).

         <title>Confined Dynamic and Static Disorder Realized by Entropy Engineering, a New Path to Excellent High Temperature Energy Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by reviewing the recent research in the field of high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage, a new paradigm of achieving superior energy storage performance is proposed through entropy engineering to regulate the dynamic/static disorder in polymers. This new paradigm has good inclusiveness for many previous research results and may have significant implications for in&#8208;depth research in the field of high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based capacitors are essential in modern electronics, yet their energy storage performance declines significantly at high temperatures, limiting extreme&#8208;condition applications. Extensive research has been conducted to address this challenge. Since ideal dielectrics are insulators, existing models often empirically summarize conductive behaviors based on inorganic materials. However, the complex aggregated structures of polymers make accurately describing their conduction particularly difficult. This review consolidates previous findings and proposes a novel research paradigm centered on the internal order degree of the polymer system. Grounded in thermodynamic principles and experimental studies on polymer conduction, this framework offers a fresh perspective for understanding the nonlinear conductive behavior under high temperatures and electric fields. It provides critical insights for designing advanced polymer&#8208;based capacitors with superior high&#8208;temperature performance.

This review summarizes the breakthroughs of the inorganic oxide phosphors&#8208;polydimethylsiloxane composite platforms, covering the luminescence mechanism of inorganic oxide phosphors, the manufacturing of PDMS composite films, multifunctional cutting&#8208;edge applications, and key challenges for future research.








Abstract
Inorganic oxide phosphors&#8208;polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite platform integrates inorganic oxide materials with a PDMS matrix, providing unique optical properties along with flexibility and humidity resistance, making it promising for applications in the forefront of advanced optoelectronics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes advances in photocatalyst design and system integration for solar water splitting. Strategies include bandgap engineering, morphology and facet control, heterostructures, cocatalysts, and external fields. System optimization from reactor to panel assembly is discussed. Efficiency and stability factors are analyzed, with future directions proposed for next&#8208;generation photocatalysts and scalable solar hydrogen systems.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis, which converts and stores solar energy as chemical energy, holds immense potential for promoting sustainable development and achieving carbon neutrality. Solar&#8208;driven water splitting offers an ideal method for storing solar energy, with one of the most promising approaches based on efficient particulate photocatalysts. In recent years, significant progress has been made in particulate photocatalyst&#8208;based water splitting systems, from fundamental scientific research to exploratory practical applications. However, to date, no photocatalytic water splitting system has achieved the efficiency required for practical applications. The development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts and optimized photocatalytic systems is urgently needed. This review examines the crucial factors limiting the activity of photocatalysts for overall water splitting and summarizes design strategies to enhance photocatalyst performance and overcome these barriers. The design and modification strategies for high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts are highlighted, including bandgap regulation, localized surface plasmon resonance, morphology control, crystal facet engineering, heterostructures, cocatalysts, and external&#8208;field association. Additionally, the scalability of using particulate photocatalysts for overall water splitting driven by natural sunlight is discussed. Finally, insights into advanced strategies for improving the performance of particulate photocatalysts are provided, and perspectives on the future development of solar water splitting systems for commercial applications are offered.

         <title>Literature on the Synthesis of Modulator&#8208;Assisted Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MA&#8208;COFs): A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulators play a pivotal role in steering covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) crystallization by slowing rapid polycondensation and enabling error correction during framework growth. Acting as competitive binders and capping agents, they regulate nucleation, suppress uncontrolled aggregation, and direct anisotropic crystal growth. This modulator&#8208;assisted strategy (MA&#8208;COFs) enhances long&#8208;range order, structural integrity, and tailored porosity compared to unmodulated systems. Residual modulators within COFs can further influence surface chemistry and open avenues for post&#8208;synthetic modification. Thus, modulators emerge as powerful kinetic controllers to bridge the gap between fast reactions and high&#8208;quality crystalline COFs.








Abstract
Covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) owe their remarkable efficiency and versatility to an array of superior structural attributes, including crystallinity, surface area, crystal size, pore distribution, and stability. Although myriad methods have sought to enhance these traits, a singular breakthrough emerged from our research: the strategic use of a lone modulator that elevates all these properties, yielding high&#8208;quality Modulator&#8208;Assisted COFs (MA&#8208;COFs). By deftly slowing monomer incorporation during synthesis, modulators orchestrate the creation of exquisitely ordered crystalline structures, amplify surface area, and foster larger, more resilient crystal domains. Beyond this, they refine pore distribution and fortify stability, unveiling a suite of extraordinary physical and chemical properties. The careful selection and optimization of modulators prove pivotal, directly shaping COF performance and integrity. This review meticulously explores the transformative influence of modulators in COF synthesis, shedding light on mechanisms that drive structural advancements and pinpointing critical efficacy factors. Such strategic deployment not only revolutionizes COF synthesis but also magnifies its potential across diverse scientific and industrial realms. Ultimately, these insights affirm modulators as essential instruments for sculpting COFs of unmatched performance and durability, charting new paths in catalysis and energy storage.

         <title>Comparative Advances in Sulfide and Halide Electrolytes for Commercialization of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compares sulfide&#8208; and halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs), highlighting their ionic conductivity, chemical stability, manufacturability, and compatibility with lithium metal. Sulfides offer higher conductivity, while halides provide enhanced stability and scalability. The study emphasizes hybrid strategies, interfacial design, and material selection to enable safer, high&#8208;performance, and commercially viable next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) outperform lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in safety, energy density, and thermal stability. Their performance depends on high ionic conductivity, chemical/physical stability, and scalable manufacture of solid electrolytes (SEs). This study compares sulfide&#8208; and halide&#8208;based SEs, two promising next&#8208;generation energy storage options. Soft mechanics permit sulfides with high room&#8208;temperature conductivity, low activation energies, and processability, but high&#8208;voltage cathode instability, moisture sensitivity, and probable hydrogen sulfide (H2S) release. Market prospects are favorable as the industry improves crystallinity and elemental substitution, especially for automotive cells. Chloride&#8208;based halides are more environmentally friendly, have adequate voltage stability, and can be used with oxide cathodes without coatings. Despite traditionally low conductivity, high&#8208;entropy, and oxyhalide chemistries currently reach 10 mS cm&#8722;1, and scalable solvent syntheses and dry processing are driving adoption. Mechanical compliance and the use of rare elements (In, Sc) continue to cause integration and cost issues. Composition, microstructure, synthesis techniques, interfacial behavior, mechanical characteristics, and scalability are evaluated. The findings show sulfides have better conductivity and Li&#8208;metal compatibility, but halides are more stable and manufacturable, recommending hybrid or tailored material selection based on application. Optimizing ASSB systems requires complementary sulfide/chloride utilization due to halides' mechanical constraints.

         <title>Photothermally Powered 3D Microgels Mechanically Regulate Mesenchymal Stem Cells Under Anisotropic Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photothermally powered microgel is designed to mechanically train mesenchymal stem cells using spatially patterned exogenous forces in three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;workspaces. When microgels are activated selectively via photothermal actuation, locally confined tens of nN forces are exerted on cells, triggering osteogenic differentiation in encapsulated cells.








Abstract
Exogenous forces significantly influence mammalian cell behavior, yet current strategies fail to resolve signaling processes between individual cells under conditions that accurately mimic the native microenvironment. This work presents a new cell culture technology capable of applying spatially patterned exogenous forces on individual cells within multicellular clusters encased in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogel matrices. Photothermally powered 3D microgels containing stem cells and integrated force generators are engineered to investigate intercellular communication under anisotropic forces with excellent spatial resolution (&#8776;1 &#181;m). Varying force patterns, such as uniform compression versus spatially heterogeneous tension, are achieved in 3D by relying on the synergistic effect of plasmonic gold nanorods and thermally responsive co&#8208;polymers under light actuation. The microgels generate 17&#8211;34 nN force locally, which activates mechanically sensitive ion channels in encapsulated cells stimulated with isotropically applied compression and spatially heterogeneous tension in 3D in a selective manner. Spatially patterned exogenous forces trigger F&#8208;actin remodeling, nuclear translocation of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) and Runt&#8208;related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2)&#160;in encapsulated cells following cyclic stimulation. Sustained application of exogenous forces over three days is sufficient to regulate stem cell fate toward osteogenesis. This technology allows combinatorial studies of biomolecular and biophysical cues in 3D, making it suitable for applications in mechanobiology and bioengineering.

         <title>Virus Enhanced Microrobots for Biofilm Eradication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofilms resist antimicrobials across medicine, industry, and environments. We present virus&#8208;conjugated microrobots synthesized hydrothermally and magnetically actuated. Their motion and viral specificity enable targeted binding, penetration, and delivery, outperforming bare microrobots. This platform achieves rapid, efficient biofilm eradication; future work will optimize design and conjugation for scalable, clinically translatable infection control.








Abstract
Biofilms pose significant challenges in biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications due to their inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents. This study introduced an innovative and effective strategy for biofilm eradication by employing virus&#8208;conjugated microrobots (virus@microbots). These biofunctionalized microrobots are synthesized via the hydrothermal method, followed by the functionalization of the viruses. The synergy of microrobots&#8217; active movement and the virus's specificity boosted biofilm removal by enabling targeted binding, penetration, and effective delivery into the biofilm matrices. Additionally, compared to microrobots alone, virus@microbots significantly accelerated and refined the process. By integrating biological specificity with magnetic responsiveness, this approach demonstrated the efficacy of virus@microbots as a viable antibacterial strategy for biofilm elimination, offering a promising antibacterial platform for combating biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Future research should focus on optimizing microrobot design and viral conjugation protocols to enhance scalability and therapeutic specificity, paving the way for clinical translation and broader applications in infection control.

         <title>Tunable Structural Colors with &#8216;Light&#8208;Lossy&#8217; MXene Paints</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vivid structural colors are generated with MXene as the absorbing layer in a multilayer interference film. The light&#8208;lossy refractive indices of various MXenes largely expand the color gamut, outperforming the conventional metals and semiconductors. The unique optical properties of the MXene family offer a versatile platform for the physical manipulation of light.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film interference with a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is a classic approach to generating structural colors for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensors, and aesthetical demands. However, an absorbing layer capable of balancing the reflectance and absorption bands remains elusive, thereby limiting the chromatic and luminant tunability of structural coloration. Here wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut films are reported with MXene as the absorbing layer in a simple trilayer configuration for vivid structural colors, outperforming conventional metal&#8208; and semiconductor&#8208;based films. It is demonstrated that the &#8216;lossy&#8217; refractive indices of different metallic MXene compositions broaden the absorption bandwidth of multilayer films and maintain the high reflectance, enabling a substantial and complementary gamut with high tunability beyond the area of sRGB color space. Various structural color films/patterns based on MXenes showcase the compatibility for different scenarios. The results accompanied by theoretical calculations provide insights into the fundamental understanding of light&#8208;MXene interaction in coloration. The unique optical absorbance and solution processibility of the MXene family offer a versatile platform for the physical manipulation of light beyond conventional manufacturing approaches.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition Driven by the Interplay of Vacancies and Charge Orders in Square&#8208;Net Materials GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;</title>

Conventional 2D/3D charge density wave (CDW) materials are limited by partial gap opening, typically retain metallic behavior even with Fermi surface nesting. This work reveals a synergistic interplay between CDW and vacancies as a distinct pathway to induce metal&#8211;insulator transition and tunable narrow bandgaps in square&#8208;net material GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;.








Abstract
Engineering narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductors remains a pivotal challenge for next&#8208;generation electronic and energy devices. Charge density wave (CDW) systems offer a promising platform for bandgap engineering. However, most 2D and 3D CDW systems remain metallic despite exhibiting&#160;Fermi surface nesting. Here, a doping&#8208;dependent metal&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) with tunable bandgaps is reported in square&#8208;net materials GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948; and a cooperative interaction between CDWs and vacancies that drives the MIT is discovered. Angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals the MIT in the low Sb&#8208;content regime of GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;, with a maximum energy gap of &#916; &#8776; 98 meV at x = 0.16, corroborated by electrical transport measurements. Following the MIT, X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a doping&#8208;dependent shift of the CDW wavevector toward a commensurate structure with&#160;q = 0.25 a*, concurrent with the appearance of Te vacancies in the square&#8208;net layers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations attribute the gap formation to the ordered Te vacancies modulated by the 4&#215;1&#215;1 CDW superstructure, which suppresses the electronic states near the Fermi level. Contrasting with the partial gap scenarios in conventional CDW systems, this synergy between the CDW and the vacancy stabilizes the insulating phase, offering a distinct avenue for narrow bandgap engineering in electronic materials.

         <title>Quantitative Tactile Sensing of Surface Microstructures Through Time&#8208;Domain Analysis of Piezoelectric Twin Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric twin&#8208;film architecture enables self&#8208;deducing the scanning speed, allowing for quantitative and tactile sensing of surface microstructures without external motion control systems. It achieves over 99.2% accuracy across a 1&#8211;1000&#160;&#181;m height range, unlocking new possibilities for advanced tactile technologies in robotics, flexible electronics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces, as well as for in situ surface characterization methods.








Abstract
Tactile sensors enabling human&#8208;like behavior to identify surface microstructures are essential for humanoid robots to interact precisely with complex environments. Most existing approaches use materials responding to dynamic forces and rely on machine learning methods to distinguish various types of surface microstructures. Quantitatively profiling the surface microstructures is significant but challenging, especially under the requirement of eliminating external bulky motion&#8208;control systems. Here, a quantitative tactile surface profiling strategy is presented through time&#8208;domain analysis of the signal of a piezoelectric twin&#8208;film architecture. The architecture uses two parallel piezoelectric films with a fixed interlayer distance, generating twin voltage signals with a time delay, which is inversely proportional to the scanning speed, and consequently removes the need for motion control. The microstructure heights correlate with the peak voltages, whereas widths and edge profiles are derived from the temporal analysis of distinct signal features.

&lt;p&gt;A piezoelectric twin-film architecture enables self-deducing the scanning speed, allowing for quantitative and tactile sensing of surface microstructures without external motion control systems. It achieves over 99.2% accuracy across a 1&#8211;1000&#160;&#181;m height range, unlocking new possibilities for advanced tactile technologies in robotics, flexible electronics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces, as well as for in situ surface characterization methods.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tactile sensors enabling human-like behavior to identify surface microstructures are essential for humanoid robots to interact precisely with complex environments. Most existing approaches use materials responding to dynamic forces and rely on machine learning methods to distinguish various types of surface microstructures. Quantitatively profiling the surface microstructures is significant but challenging, especially under the requirement of eliminating external bulky motion-control systems. Here, a quantitative tactile surface profiling strategy is presented through time-domain analysis of the signal of a piezoelectric twin-film architecture. The architecture uses two parallel piezoelectric films with a fixed interlayer distance, generating twin voltage signals with a time delay, which is inversely proportional to the scanning speed, and consequently removes the need for motion control. The microstructure heights correlate with the peak voltages, whereas widths and edge profiles are derived from the temporal analysis of distinct signal features. Tactile and in situ measurement of surface microstructures is demonstrated with high accuracy (&amp;gt;99.2%) over a broad height range of 1&#8211;1000&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, in-line quality inspection during additive manufacturing is realized by quantitatively profiling the surface microstructures. This work will drive innovations in tactile technologies that emulate and potentially surpass human capabilities and advance in situ surface characterization methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Selective Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage in Mechanoresponsive Topochemical Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of mechanoresponsive polymers based on polybiidenedionediyl (PBIT) derivatives exhibits distinct color changes upon mechanical stimuli such as grinding, milling, and compression. The response arises from depolymerization and backbone conjugation changes. A PBIT&#8211;PDMS composite film enables ink&#8208;free, rewritable paper, offering a simple and direct platform for stress visualization.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive polymeric materials that respond to mechanical deformation are highly valued for their potential in sensors, degradation studies, and optoelectronics. However, direct visualization and detection of these responses remain significant obstacles. In this study, novel mechanoresponsive polybiidenedionediyl (PBIT) derivative topochemical polymers are developed that depolymerize under mechanical forces, exhibiting a distinct and irreversible color change in response to grinding, milling, and compression. This color change is attributed to the alteration of polymer backbone conjugation during elongated Carbon&#8208;Carbon (C&#9472;C) single bond cleavage. Quantum chemical pulling simulations on PBIT polymers reveals a force range of 4.3&#8211;5.0 nN associated with the selective cleavage of elongated C&#9472;C single bonds. This force range is comparable to that observed for typical homolytic mechanophores, supporting the mechanistic interpretation of homolytic bond scission under mechanical stress. C&#9472;C bond cleavage kinetic studies of PBIT under compression indicates that strong interchain interactions significantly increase the pressure needed to cleave the elongated C&#9472;C bonds. Additionally, PBIT polymer thin films are composited with polydimethylsiloxane to create free&#8208;standing and robust thin films, which can serve as ink&#8208;free and rewritable paper for writing and stress visualization applications. This advancement opens new possibilities for utilizing crystalline and brittle topochemical polymers in practical applications.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield Conductive Inks of Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Quantum Dots for White LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sb3+/Mn2+ co&#8208;doping transforms Cs2NaInCl6 double&#8208;perovskite quantum dots (QDs) from disordered, trap&#8208;rich lattices into ordered, defect&#8208;suppressed emitters. Short&#8208;chain conductive ligands enhance carrier transport, delivering near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a record 0.91% external quantum efficiency (EQE) in lead&#8208;free double perovskite white LEDs. This solution&#8208;processable system integrates lattice ordering with ligand engineering to enable eco&#8208;friendly, high&#8208;performance broadband solid&#8208;state lighting.








Abstract
Double perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with self&#8208;trapped exciton emission provide an eco&#8208;friendly route to broadband white&#8208;light generation. Yet severe charge losses arising from trap&#8208;mediated recombination and inefficient carrier transport remain major obstacles to their integration into electroluminescent devices. Here, Sb3+/Mn2+ co&#8208;doped Cs2NaInCl6 QD inks are reported that enable the fabrication of defect&#8208;suppressed, conductive QD films with low charge transport and hole&#8208;injection barriers in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices. Sb3+/Mn2+ co&#8208;doping not only induces white emission but also suppresses cation disorder, leading to near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Moreover, replacing long&#8208;chain ligands with short&#8208;chain 2&#8208;ethylhexanoic acid and 3,3&#8208;diphenylpropylamine chloride enhances the film conductivity by nearly 20&#8208;fold and induces a favorable band alignment with the poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole):poly[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;butylphenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(phenyl)&#8208;benzidine] hole transport layer, hereby reducing the injection barrier by 0.4&#160;eV. These improvements enable an LED external quantum efficiency of 0.91% (0.05&#160;cm2)&#8212;the highest reported for double perovskite QDs and nearly 1.3 the previous record. It is anticipated that this work provides a viable route toward overcoming the key limitations of double perovskite electroluminescence and advancing eco&#8208;friendly solid&#8208;state lighting.

         <title>Agile Stealth: Bioinspired Metamaterials with Continuous Dynamic Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by moth eyes, this paper designs a mechanically reconfigurable EM&#8208;absorbing metamaterial with ultra&#8208;wideband absorption (2&#8211;40 GHz, 90% efficiency, 180.95% bandwidth) and at least six tunable resonant peaks (&gt;3 GHz tuning, RL &lt; &#8722;20 dB). It enables dynamic RCS control and coding programmability, offering a promising solution for next&#8208;gen stealth and multifunctional EM devices.








Abstract
The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency broadband absorption and dynamic frequency agility in electromagnetic metamaterials is a critical yet challenging goal for advanced stealth technologies. Here, a bioinspired reconfigurable metamaterial is introduced that overcomes this limitation through a novel dynamic structure&#8208;function design. Inspired by the moth&#8208;eye's truncated cone morphology, the metamaterial integrates a mechanical transmission system to precisely control the displacement of internal petal&#8208;shaped structures. This unique mechanism unlocks exceptional dual&#8208;mode performance: it maintains ultra&#8208;wideband absorption (&#8805;90%) across a vast 2&#8211;40&#160;GHz spectrum while simultaneously enabling the continuous tuning of at least six distinct, high&#8208;efficiency (&#8805;99%) absorption peaks, each with a tuning bandwidth over 3&#160;GHz. The geometric reconfiguration actively reshapes surface impedance, creating a synergistic effect that enhances overall performance. Consequently, the metamaterial demonstrates significant broadband radar cross&#8208;section (RCS) reduction and provides adaptive, deep suppression at specific threat frequencies. By incorporating coded driving, 2D control of frequency and amplitude is also realized. This integrated approach paves the way for the next generation of intelligent and high&#8208;performance adaptive stealth systems.

         <title>Physical Reservoir Computing System via Hybrid Ferroelectric&#8208;Ionic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated physical reservoir computing system is realized using hybrid ferroelectric&#8208;ionic transistors with full CMOS compatibility. Dual long&#8208;term polarization and short&#8208;term ionic switching enable scalable in&#8208;materia computation optimized for multimodal biosignal processing. The architecture delivers superior temporal dynamics, tunable memory, and energy&#8208;efficient performance, advancing hardware&#8208;based neural networks for practical edge AI healthcare applications.








Abstract
In&#8208;materia computing, harnessing material complexity for energy&#8208;efficient computation, drives breakthroughs in constructing physical reservoir computing (PRC), a promising paradigm for energy&#8208;efficient handling of dynamic temporal tasks. However, the integration of PRC components into complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible and very large&#8208;scale integration (VLSI)&#8208;scalable platforms remains challenging, particularly in two&#8208;terminal devices that utilize exotic material systems. Herein, the integration of hafnia&#8208;based hybrid ferroelectric&#8208;ionic field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) is reported for in&#8208;materia PRC with all&#8208;FET structures. Hybrid FETs with dual long&#8208;term polarization switching and short&#8208;term ionic switching functionality are integrated into PRC via wafer&#8208;scale atomic layer deposition on a single wafer, guaranteeing CMOS compatibility and VLSI scalability with the deposition technique and materials in modern microelectronics. The proposed PRC system effectively processes multimodal biosignals, including electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional two&#8208;terminal device&#8208;based systems by enabling adaptive temporal dynamics and tunable memory characteristics. These results pave the way for hardware&#8208;implemented dynamic neural networks that are highly energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient, thus advancing practical edge AI applications in healthcare and real&#8208;time signal processing.

&lt;p&gt;An integrated physical reservoir computing system is realized using hybrid ferroelectric-ionic transistors with full CMOS compatibility. Dual long-term polarization and short-term ionic switching enable scalable in-materia computation optimized for multimodal biosignal processing. The architecture delivers superior temporal dynamics, tunable memory, and energy-efficient performance, advancing hardware-based neural networks for practical edge AI healthcare applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-materia computing, harnessing material complexity for energy-efficient computation, drives breakthroughs in constructing physical reservoir computing (PRC), a promising paradigm for energy-efficient handling of dynamic temporal tasks. However, the integration of PRC components into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible and very large-scale integration (VLSI)-scalable platforms remains challenging, particularly in two-terminal devices that utilize exotic material systems. Herein, the integration of hafnia-based hybrid ferroelectric-ionic field-effect transistors (FETs) is reported for in-materia PRC with all-FET structures. Hybrid FETs with dual long-term polarization switching and short-term ionic switching functionality are integrated into PRC via wafer-scale atomic layer deposition on a single wafer, guaranteeing CMOS compatibility and VLSI scalability with the deposition technique and materials in modern microelectronics. The proposed PRC system effectively processes multimodal biosignals, including electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional two-terminal device-based systems by enabling adaptive temporal dynamics and tunable memory characteristics. These results pave the way for hardware-implemented dynamic neural networks that are highly energy- and area-efficient, thus advancing practical edge AI applications in healthcare and real-time signal processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All Drug Glassy Microneedle Patches for Instantaneous Transdermal Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carrier&#8208;free antibiotic glassy microneedles with 100%&#8208;drug payload for instant transdermal delivery are constructed via a supramolecular engineering strategy. The synergistic drug&#8208;sulfate&#8208;water interactions suppress drug crystallization and facilitate the formation of amorphous glassy networks, enabling record&#8208;high 100% drug loading, exceptional mechanical strength, and ultrafast dissolution/diffusion in the skin.








Abstract
Dissolving microneedles (DMNs) are emerging transdermal delivery platforms but rely on water&#8208;soluble polymers as carriers that inherently limit drug&#8208;loading capacity and slow release due to dissolution/diffusion barriers. Formulating drugs directly into robust DMNs is further challenged by crystallization tendencies. Here, a supramolecular engineering strategy enabling carrier&#8208;free antibiotic glass microneedles (GMNs) is presented, leveraging synergistic drug&#8208;sulfate&#8208;water interactions that suppress crystallization and form mechanically stable amorphous networks. Using tobramycin sulfate, monolithic GMNs are achieved with 100%&#8208;drug payload, exceptional strength (Young's modulus 5.1&#160;GPa), and instant transdermal delivery (threefold faster than polymer DMNs). Eliminating polymeric carriers accelerates drug diffusion by 2.6&#8208;fold, enabling deep tissue penetration for efficient biofilm eradication. In vivo evaluation demonstrates that the antibiotic GMNs effectively promote the healing of biofilm&#8208;infected skin wounds in mice and exhibit potent therapeutic efficacy against subcutaneous abscesses. This strategy extends broadly to aminoglycoside antibiotics. By replacing the polymer matrix with supramolecular&#8208;engineered amorphous networks, a next&#8208;generation DMN platform is pioneered that bridges critical gaps in drug&#8208;loading efficiency, dissolution kinetics, and clinical translation for urgent therapeutic applications.

         <title>Grain Boundary Strengthening Enables Microstructural Regulation of Electrolytes for Robust Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain boundary strengthening electrolyte is developed for zinc metal batteries, in which refined reverse micelle motifs assemble into densely anion&#8208;participating boundaries that reorganize the solvation environment. This microstructural regulation simultaneously accelerates Zn2+ transfer dynamics and suppresses Grotthuss&#8208;mediated H+/OH&#8722; transport, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free deposition, mitigated hydrogen evolution, and exceptionally stable and reversible zinc cycling.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) suffer from notorious dendrite formation and interfacial side reactions, hindering their long&#8208;term stability and practical deployment. Here, a grain boundary strengthening electrolyte (GBSE) is reported featuring numerous boundaries with unique anion&#8208;participating interfacial composition of reverse micelle motifs. This microstructural regulation effectively suppresses proton and hydroxyl anion transport via the Grotthuss mechanism, while enhancing zinc ion transfer dynamics. Accompanied by the in situ formation of the high&#8208;fluorinated solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), the Zn metal anode achieves a remarkable 99.8% coulombic efficiency and a lifespan of over 3000 h with a cumulative deposition capacity exceeding 12&#160;000 mAh cm&#8210;2, demonstrating excellent dendrite suppression and reversibility in the GBSE. This microstructural design substantially enhances the stability of high&#8208;voltage Zn||graphite batteries (310 cycles, 92.5% capacity retention) and the performance of highly safe and practical ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale Zn||Mn&#8208;doped V2O5 pouch cells, achieving a superior cumulative cycling capacity of 510 Ah over 450 cycles with 96.5% capacity retention and 81.65% depth of discharge. This study features a new insight into microstructural regulation and grain boundary strengthening strategy of electrolytes for high&#8208;performance ZMBs.

         <title>A Hypoxia&#8208;Activatable Prodrug for Targeted Combination Therapy of Hepatoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;activatable prodrug (POPZ) is screened out from three synthesized N&#8208;oxide&#8208;containing perylene diimide (PDI)&#8208;based oligomers, and it can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (POPZ NPs). The biocompatible POPZ can be reduced to highly cytotoxic PPZr in hypoxic tumors, accompanied by the generation of enhanced photothermal properties and type&#8208;I photodynamic effect, which can be applied to targeted combination therapy of hepatoma.








Abstract
Precision medicine is characterized by high accuracy and safety, showing robust superiority and significant potential in clinical applications. Organelle&#8208;targeting therapies are important tactics for precision medicine, allowing for efficient tumor treatment and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, a mitochondria&#8208;targeting and hypoxia&#8208;activatable nanoprodrug (POPZ NPs) is prepared. The N&#8208;oxide groups of POPZ NPs can successfully target mitochondria and are reduced to tertiary amines by Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450s), which are highly expressed in hypoxic tumors and located in the inner mitochondrial membranes. Biocompatible POPZ NPs can become cytotoxic and produce type&#8208;I photodynamic activities and enhance photothermal properties after reduction by CYP450s. The tumor&#8208;specific activatable prodrug reveals potent efficacy for tumor elimination without causing systemic toxicity. This work may provide a paradigm for achieving precision medicine as well as more convenient and feasible tumor combination therapy.

         <title>Bi&#8208;Functional Topospecific Nanoparticles to Promote Immune&#8208;Tumor Cell Engagement as A New Immunotherapeutic Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus&#8208;engineered nanoplatform (J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1), featuring separate tumor&#8208; and immune&#8208;targeting faces, bridges melanoma cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes using toposelective pHLIP and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 presentation. This strategy elicits robust antitumor responses, promotes immunogenic tumor cell death, suppresses lung metastasis in vivo, and provides a modular, safer alternative for versatile immune engagement in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative approach, enabling the body's immune system to fight cancer. Cytotoxic T cells play a pivotal role in recognizing and eliminating tumor cells, and their effectiveness relies on establishing a physical interaction and efficient communication with cancer cells. However, this communication is often disrupted by immune escape mechanisms, allowing cancer progression. A versatile nanoplatform is developed to restore cellular connection using Janus mesoporous silica&#8208;Au nanoparticle (J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1), including specific binding sites on opposite faces for simultaneous binding to cancer cells and immune cells. The two differential surfaces on the nanoparticle allow orthogonal functionalization with the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody that interacts with the PD&#8208;1 receptor in cytotoxic T cells on the gold face and the pH Low Insertion Peptide (pHLIP), which undergoes specific insertion into the tumor cell membrane on the silica face. J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 nanoparticles effectively bind the surface of tumor cells and capture T cells, facilitating the formation of immune synapse&#8208;like structures that lead to reduced cancer cell viability in vitro, associated with immunogenic cell death signatures. The therapeutic potential of J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 is also demonstrated in an in vivo metastatic melanoma model, where treatment with J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 produces a significant decrease in metastatic burden and increases T cell presence. The Janus nanosystem represents an attractive platform that expands the toolbox of immune&#8208;engaging strategies, offering a flexible alternative to conventional immunotherapies that link immune and tumor cells, restoring cell&#8211;cell communication for cancer elimination.

The Muscle&#8211;tendon complex (MTC)&#8208;inspired Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#160;artificial muscle integrates actuation (efferent) and proprioceptive sensing (afferent) by combining contractile nematic and elastic isotropic LCEs within a single soft structure. Embedded liquid metal channels enable simultaneous Joule heating and real&#8208;time sensing of length and force. The proposed system demonstrates effective closed&#8208;loop control applicable to physical human&#8211;robot interaction.








Abstract
The muscle&#8208;tendon complex (MTC) in biological systems integrates contractile actuation and proprioceptive sensing, enabling coordinated feedback control of muscle activations through simultaneous afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) signaling. To achieve similar functionality, artificial muscles, often based on polymeric materials with intricate material behaviors, require embedded proprioceptive capabilities to enable adaptive and reliable feedback control. Here, an artificial MTC&#8208;inspired liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscle with embedded physical intelligence is presented that supports simultaneous sensing and actuation. The proposed system utilizes embedded liquid metal (LM) channels for Joule heating and sensing of mechanical states, such as force and length, within the LCE structure. The multimaterial design combines isotropic LCE and nematic LCE, each with distinct thermomechanical properties optimized for specific functions, allowing for responsive contractile actuation&#160;and efficient proprioception. Integrated within a single, compact structure, this artificial muscle combines all sensing and actuation components, enhancing compliance and proprioceptive functionality. Furthermore, the LCE actuators are arranged in an antagonistic pair, mirroring the setup of biological muscles, to improve controllability and coordination. These MTC&#8208;inspired LCE artificial muscles demonstrate closed&#8208;loop feedback control in robotic applications, such as a robotic finger and gripper system, highlighting the potential of embedded physical intelligence in advanced robotic control systems.

         <title>Arbitrarily Shapeable Couplant with Fluidity Onset for Conformal Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative couplant is presented, comprising fibers and dynamically cross&#8208;linked polysilicone, that transitions from solid to fluid when stress exceeds a threshold. This stress&#8208;triggered fluidity, coupled with acoustic transparency, enables seamless conformability to complex geometries and reliable long&#8208;term performance, addressing challenges in imaging steep curves and pressure&#8208;sensitive tissues for industrial and medical applications.








Abstract
Couplant is indispensable for ultrasound examinations. However, shape adaptability and operational feasibility, which are both crucial, cannot be provided conjointly by existing couplants due to their either liquid or solid form. Here an ideal couplant composed of fibers and dynamically cross&#8208;linked polysilicone is reported, which exhibits a unique solid&#8208;to&#8208;fluid transition upon application of stress exceeding a threshold. Together with the acoustically transparent feature, the particularity of the stress&#8208;triggered fluidity allows conformal adapting to arbitrary geometries under stress exertion and stable preserving for long&#8208;term and reliable ultrasound examination after stress release. Steeply curved geometries and pressure&#8208;sensitive tissues, which are extremely challenging for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrasound modalities, are successfully graphed or treated. This couplant integrates the merits of liquids and solids, providing new opportunities for various ultrasound in industrial and medical fields.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Powered Terahertz Metamaterials as a Real&#8208;Time Biosensing Platform for In Vivo Thrombus Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MXene&#8208;powered terahertz (THz) metamaterial platform significantly enhanced early, real&#8208;time in vivo thrombus detection sensitivity (94.7%) and accuracy (92.3%) for cardiovascular disease patients, surpassing current methods like thromboelastogram and activated clotting time (ACT) method. This system detects thrombus 6 min faster and provided anticoagulant feedback 2 min earlier than ACT, enabling personalized clinical anticoagulation strategies to reduce thrombotic risk.








Abstract
Precise, timely, and personalized in vivo thrombus monitoring is critical for improving the treatment effectiveness and clinical outcomes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy has become increasingly important as a novel tool in biomedical engineering due to its rapid analysis ability, high temporal resolution, and label&#8208;free measurement modality. However, achieving high thrombus sensing performance in real blood environments remains a significant challenge. In this work, a thrombus sensing platform is developed using an MXene&#8208;powered THz hybrid metamaterial, which substantially increases early thrombus detection sensitivity and real&#8208;time sensing ability by utilizing the highly sensitive THz response from the interfacial charge transfer between MXene and the thrombus. When applied to patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy, the sensitivity (94.7%) and accuracy (92.3%) of diagnosing a thrombus using this platform surpassed the capabilities of current clinical methods, including the thromboelastogram and the activated clotting time (ACT) method. Furthermore, the platform provides faster assay performances for in vivo thrombus detection (6&#160;min in advance) and anticoagulant effectiveness feedback (2&#160;min in advance) than the ACT method. The proposed platform demonstrates the potential for tailoring clinical anticoagulation strategies for individual patients to substantially reduce the current high risk of thrombus complications among those with CVDs.

         <title>Tailoring the Reaction Heterogeneity for Robust Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction heterogeneity is tailored precisely within Li&#8208;rich cathode materials, which not only helps alleviate the notorious oxygen release as well as parasitic interfacial side reactions, but also improve the Li+ diffusion kinetics by means of highly ordered cationic arrangement and enhanced mechanical stability, thereby boosting the electrochemical properties.








Abstract
The practical application of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLO) cathode is hindered by severe capacity and voltage degradation resulting from severe oxygen release and irreversible phase transition. Herein, the reaction heterogeneity, which describes the spatially resolved electrochemical divergence within individual cathode particles, is engineered through compositional gradient design to couple Li+ transport kinetics and the anion redox activity between particle interiors and surfaces. It is revealed that Co/Mn concentration gradient within particles creates heterogeneous phase content distribution and structural ordering, inducing surface&#8208;bulk reaction heterogeneity that significantly impacts the overall electrochemical performance. Specifically, Li2MnO3&#8208;poor and Co&#8208;enriched surface effectively mitigates the oxygen loss and enhances electrochemical reaction kinetics, benefited from the reduced surface redox reactivity and induced highly ordered intra&#8208;layered cationic arrangement. Meanwhile, the Li2MnO3&#8208;enriched core with slight Li/Ni intermixing provides high reversible capacity and strong mechanical stability. Consequently, the greatly enhanced anion redox reversibility, Li+ diffusion dynamics, and structure stability endow LLO with exceptional electrochemical properties, showing a capacity retention of 86.0% and a reduced voltage decay of 0.518&#160;mV per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work provides a valuable strategy to tailor the redox chemistry and achieve robust LLO.

         <title>Emergent Berry Curvature in Inversion&#8208;Symmetric Photonic Crystals for Ultraconfined Topological States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, nonzero Berry curvature in photonic crystals is induced by breaking unit cell inversion symmetry through spatial shifts rather than geometrical modifications. This enables the design of ultraconfined topological states with subwavelength in&#8208;plane field confinement and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane field isolation. These results provide a new approach for high&#8208;density on&#8208;chip photonic integration of topological waveguides without breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry.








Abstract
An interface between two periodic structures is topological when the global periodicity cannot be restored through local deformations. In time&#8208;reversal symmetric photonic crystals, such interfaces typically form between structures with distinct topological phases characterized by nonzero Berry curvature, which is conventionally induced by breaking spatial inversion symmetry through the modifications of air hole sizes and positions. Here, a topological interface is formed between photonic crystals by breaking the unit cell inversion symmetry via spatial shifts (&#916;y=&#177;a3${{\Delta}}y = \pm \frac{a}{{\sqrt 3 }}$).

     alt="Emergent Berry Curvature in Inversion-Symmetric Photonic Crystals for Ultraconfined Topological States"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, nonzero Berry curvature in photonic crystals is induced by breaking unit cell inversion symmetry through spatial shifts rather than geometrical modifications. This enables the design of ultraconfined topological states with subwavelength in-plane field confinement and out-of-plane field isolation. These results provide a new approach for high-density on-chip photonic integration of topological waveguides without breaking time-reversal symmetry.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interface between two periodic structures is topological when the global periodicity cannot be restored through local deformations. In time-reversal symmetric photonic crystals, such interfaces typically form between structures with distinct topological phases characterized by nonzero Berry curvature, which is conventionally induced by breaking spatial inversion symmetry through the modifications of air hole sizes and positions. Here, a topological interface is formed between photonic crystals by breaking the unit cell inversion symmetry via spatial shifts (&#916;y=&#177;a3${{\Delta}}y = \pm \frac{a}{{\sqrt 3 }}$). This modifies the rotational symmetry of a honeycomb photonic crystal unit cell from C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which induces nonzero Berry curvature in the lower photonic band. It is further shown that nonzero Berry curvature emerges in any photonic crystals with bulk inversion symmetry and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetric unit cells, regardless of lattice structure or in-plane polarization. Using this unit cell, a glide-symmetric interface is designed to support an ultraconfined topological state that exhibits single-unit-cell (0.2&#955;) in-plane field confinement, subwavelength bending radius (0.24&#955;), and out-of-plane isolation. These findings challenge the conventional view that geometrical modifications are necessary to break the spatial inversion symmetry and generate nonzero Berry curvature in time-reversal symmetric photonic crystals, offering it as a promising platform for high density, subwavelength scale photonic integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Demonstration of wide&#8208;field visual neurons employing MoSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions with TS integration. The population&#8208;coded architecture reduces information distortion rate by 82.1% vs single devices (p &lt; 0.0001), while achieving broad receptive field coverage through complementary 473 nm (MoS2) and 808 nm (MoSe2) sensitivity. This bio&#8208;inspired design combines mammalian visual principles with scalable semiconductor fabrication for advanced machine vision applications.








Abstract
Modern neuromorphic systems face critical bottlenecks in emulating biological vision, particularly in reconciling wide&#8208;spectrum perception, distortion&#8208;free encoding, and population&#8208;level signal processing. Drawing inspiration from the stochastic&#8208;resilient population coding of macaque visual neurons, an advanced visual neuron prototype is developed that incorporates photoelectric multi&#8208;stimulation field&#8208;effect transistor and innovative parallel threshold&#8208;switch architecture. The visual neuron integrates broadband photodetection (350&#8211;1000 nm) with biomimetic spike population encoding in a monolithic architecture. The photosensitive MoSe2/MoS2 heterojunction region in field&#8208;effect transistor extends the visual perception field from UV to infrared wavelengths (350&#8211;700 nm to 350&#8211;1000 nm), doubling the original field. Meanwhile, under the same conditions, the photocurrent response achieves a 1.36&#8208;fold increase from 0.109 to 0.148 A (W&#8201;cm&#8722;2)&#8722;1. The parallel threshold&#8208;switching design transforms single&#8208;unit encoding into cooperative population coding, achieving an 82.1% reduction rate in signal distortion. When deployed in a spiking neural network, this population&#8208;coding paradigm demonstrates high accuracy in pattern recognition, surpassing single neuron architectures by 12.1%, while maintaining the information processing time at the biological scale (&lt;200 ms). By unifying van der Waals heterostructure photonics with macaque&#8208;derived neural population coding principles, this work establishes a transformative framework for bioinspired vision hardware, bridging the critical gap between neuromorphic materials and cortical processing efficiency.

         <title>Multimodal Nanoregulator Rescues Impaired Neurovascular Units to Attenuate Secondary Injury Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recognition of the multifaceted nature of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a multimodal nanotherapeutic platform that simultaneously targets multiple key pathological processes involved in neurovascular unit disruption, attenuating secondary brain injury and enhancing cognitive outcomes is developed.








Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers complex neurovascular unit (NVU) damage via ischemia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and persistent immune activation, contributing to long&#8208;term neurological deficits. However, effective NVU repair remains challenging due to the multifactorial nature of secondary injury. Here, a novel multimodal nanotherapeutic platform designed to concurrently target multiple key pathological events underlying NVU disruption is presented. This nanodrug integrates ultrasmall cerium oxide nanoparticles and IRAK&#8208;4 siRNA within a ROS&#8208;responsive poly(1,4&#8208;phenyleneacetone dimethylene thioketal) (PPADT) matrix, cloaked with neutrophil membranes for inflammation homing. At the injury lesion, the responsive nature enables on&#8208;demand drug release, eliciting synergistic therapeutic actions. Specifically, the cerium nanodots catalyze ROS scavenging and oxygen generation, alleviating oxidative stress and hypoxia to facilitate blood&#8211;brain barrier restoration, pericyte repair, and improved cerebral perfusion. Simultaneously, IRAK&#8208;4 siRNA downregulates pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling and reprograms microglia toward an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. In a murine TBI model, the nanotherapy promotes vascular repair, reduces brain edema, attenuates neuroinflammation, and preserves neuronal integrity. Additionally, treatment ameliorates sleep spindle loss, reduces epileptiform activity, and significantly improves cognitive performance in learning and memory tasks. This work highlights a multipronged therapeutic strategy capable of restoring NVU homeostasis and mitigating secondary brain injury, offering great promise for advancing TBI treatment.

         <title>Shapeshifting Nanocatalyst for CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;modal in situ characterization of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles during CO2 photoreduction sheds light on dynamic transformations occurring during reaction. The Cu(core)&#8208;Ag(shell) nanoparticles present the Ag replacement by Cu atoms. Ag is trapped at the subsurface forming a Ag&#8208;Cu&#8208;O phase, and the nanoparticle spreads over the substrate. These transformations are responsible for the enhanced performance of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles in the CO2 photoreduction.








Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals through a photoreduction reaction in water is a promising route to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Enhancing selectivity toward hydrocarbons or alcohols can be achieved by Ag&#8208;Cu alloys. However, the stabilized surface state created by Ag&#8208;Cu interactions is still poorly understood. In this work, multi&#8208;modal in situ X&#8208;ray experiments reveals underlying mechanisms and the evolution of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles under CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) conditions. Both morphological and chemical changes of Ag and Cu species induced by diffusion mechanics are tracked during nanocatalyst operation. The initial spheroid Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles are composed of a Cu&#8208;rich shell and Ag&#8208;rich core. The reduction treatment promotes Ag migration toward the surface. During photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, Cu atoms migrate back to the surface, forming Ag&#8208;Cu&#8208;O species. The study observes the surface oxidation of Cu(0) to Cu+ and the presence of Ag at the sub&#8208;surface region. Furthermore, nanoparticles change their shape, decreasing their specific surface area, driven by Cu diffusion during the CO2 photoreduction reaction. The results provide invaluable insights into the dynamic restructuring of the catalyst under reaction conditions and into the active species responsible for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Tuning Molecular Afterglow via Rare&#8208;Earth Complexation in Monodisperse SiO2 Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the tunable afterglow of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;doped SiO2 microparticles via rare&#8208;earth complexation. Afterglow quantum yield and lifetime are tuned from 3.00% to 9.02% and 0.07 to 1.46&#160;s, respectively. Notably, the paramagnetic effect of rare&#8208;earth ions proves more effective than their heavy&#8208;atom effect in the afterglow tuning, enabling the development of a library of customizable, optically active SiO2 microparticles for photonic crystal applications.








Abstract
Rational control of triplet&#8208;state emissions in organic molecules is key to advancing organic phosphors for optoelectronic applications. However, achieving precise modulation of both afterglow intensity and lifetime remains challenging. Here, a tunable afterglow system based on 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (1,10&#8208;phen), enabled by rare&#8208;earth (RE3+) complexation and incorporation into SiO2 microparticles (MPs) under hydrothermal conditions, is presented. Doping 1,10&#8208;phen into SiO2 MPs activates phosphorescence at 488&#160;nm, with a quantum yield of 2.59% and a lifetime of 1.14&#160;s. Upon coordination with various RE3+ ions (La3&#8314;, Y3&#8314;, Gd3&#8314;, Lu3&#8314;), both the quantum yield (3.00&#8211;9.02%) and afterglow lifetime (0.07&#8211;1.46&#160;s) are finely tunable. Remarkably, Gd3&#8314;, through its paramagnetic effect, enhances intersystem crossing more efficiently than the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Lu3&#8314;, resulting in a higher quantum yield but a shorter afterglow duration. In contrast, Y3&#8314;, which lacks a heavy&#8208;atom effect, increases the rigidity of the 1,10&#8208;phen framework, thereby improving the phosphorescence quantum yield to 3.11% and extending the afterglow lifetime to 1.46&#160;s.

     alt="Tuning Molecular Afterglow via Rare-Earth Complexation in Monodisperse SiO2 Microparticles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the tunable afterglow of 1,10-phenanthroline-doped SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microparticles via rare-earth complexation. Afterglow quantum yield and lifetime are tuned from 3.00% to 9.02% and 0.07 to 1.46&#160;s, respectively. Notably, the paramagnetic effect of rare-earth ions proves more effective than their heavy-atom effect in the afterglow tuning, enabling the development of a library of customizable, optically active SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microparticles for photonic crystal applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational control of triplet-state emissions in organic molecules is key to advancing organic phosphors for optoelectronic applications. However, achieving precise modulation of both afterglow intensity and lifetime remains challenging. Here, a tunable afterglow system based on 1,10-phenanthroline (1,10-phen), enabled by rare-earth (RE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) complexation and incorporation into SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microparticles (MPs) under hydrothermal conditions, is presented. Doping 1,10-phen into SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MPs activates phosphorescence at 488&#160;nm, with a quantum yield of 2.59% and a lifetime of 1.14&#160;s. Upon coordination with various RE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (La&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;, Y&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;, Gd&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;, Lu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;), both the quantum yield (3.00&#8211;9.02%) and afterglow lifetime (0.07&#8211;1.46&#160;s) are finely tunable. Remarkably, Gd&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;, through its paramagnetic effect, enhances intersystem crossing more efficiently than the heavy-atom effect of Lu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;, resulting in a higher quantum yield but a shorter afterglow duration. In contrast, Y&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;, which lacks a heavy-atom effect, increases the rigidity of the 1,10-phen framework, thereby improving the phosphorescence quantum yield to 3.11% and extending the afterglow lifetime to 1.46&#160;s. These findings highlight a versatile and effective strategy for tuning the optical properties of organic molecules via RE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexation within SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrices, offering promising potential for the development of advanced photonic crystal platforms in optoelectronic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Metal&#8208;Like Ferroelectric Molecular Crystal with Malleability and Ductility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferroelectric molecular crystal trimethylamine chloroborane is successfully synthesized with exceptional malleability and ductility at room temperature, achieving large compressive strain of &#8776;94% and saturation polarization of 23.9 &#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Ferroelectric crystals possess essential properties for a wide array of applications, while their inherent brittleness presents significant challenges in smart scenarios that demand high flexibility and customizable shapes. Herein, an aminoborane adduct ferroelectric molecular crystal, trimethylamine chloroborane (TMACB), is synthesized, showing room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;like malleability and ductility. TMACB crystallizes in rhombohedral R3m space group at room temperature and undergoes structural phase transition to monoclinic Cc space group at 256 K. The compressive strain of TMACB single crystal can reach &#8776;94% before fracture, more than 16 times that of traditional inorganic ferroelectrics (less than 6% in general), and large ultimate tensile strain of 15.6% can also be achieved. Both polarization&#8208;electric field hysteresis loop and piezoresponse force microscopy characterizations have demonstrated ferroelectricity of TMACB, which is further firmly supported by density functional theory calculation. Moreover, compressed thin sheet of TMACB crystal maintains promising ferroelectric performance with a large polarization value of 23.9 microcoulomb per square centimeter, close to that of inorganic ferroelectric BaTiO3. The discovery breaks through the research paradigm of brittle ferroelectric materials and offers new insights into the exploration of highly deformable ferroelectric crystals for flexible wearable devices and adaptable sensor arrays in the future.

Submillimeter, ultrathin single&#8208;crystal NdOCl nanosheets are synthesized via modified PVD. It exhibits high&#8208;&#954; (&#8776;11.7), ultralow leakage (&#8776;10&#8722;7&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a wide bandgap (4.57&#160;eV). MoS2/NdOCl FETs show a high Ion/Ioff ratio, steep subthreshold swing, suppressed scattering, and enhanced mobility. The 100&#8208;nm channel MoS2 FETs and high&#8208;gain inverters with NdOCl gate, demonstrating their potential as a next&#8208;generation 2D dielectric.








Abstract
2D dielectrics integrated with atomically thin semiconductors hold immense potential to address the scaling challenges in future nanoelectronics. However, existing 2D dielectrics are limited by insufficient dielectric constants, poor interfacial quality, and degraded gate controllability. Here, a controlled synthesis of single&#8208;crystal neodymium oxychloride (NdOCl) nanosheets with submillimeter sizes (169&#160;&#181;m) and ultrathin thickness (5&#160;nm) is presented using a modified physical vapor deposition (PVD) approach. The NdOCl nanosheets exhibit a high dielectric constant (&#954;&#8776;11.7), ultralow leakage currents (&#8776;10&#8722;7&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a wide bandgap of 4.57&#160;eV. MoS2/NdOCl field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) achieve high on/off current ratios (108), steep subthreshold swings, and suppressed Coulomb scattering, enabling a carrier mobility of 123&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at 80&#160;K, a value three times higher than MoS2/SiO2 FETs. The implementation of high&#8208;&#954; NdOCl dielectrics facilitates the successful fabrication of short&#8208;channel MoS2 FETs (100&#160;nm) and high&#8208;gain logic inverters (60.9). These findings underscore the great potential of NdOCl as a next&#8208;generation 2D gate dielectric for advanced, miniaturized nanoelectronic applications.

         <title>Radiofrequency Spintronic Neural Network Enabled by Electrically Modulated Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work experimentally demonstrates electrically tunable spintronic synapses and neurons based on three&#8208;terminal magnetic tunnel junctions, which are energy efficient, scalable, and suitable for complex network architectures. Through computational simulation, spintronic networks achieve high accuracies on both drone classification and the Fashion&#8208;MNIST dataset, expanding the capability of spintronic neural networks to address large&#8208;scale problems.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in nanoscale have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. As a pioneering demonstration, the radiofrequency (RF) neural network based on the intrinsic RF&#8208;to&#8208;DC conversion capability of MTJs features multilayer interconnectivity and native processing of RF inputs. However, most existing devices rely on magnetic field lines to modulate their behavior in neural networks, resulting in high energy consumption and increased area overhead. Moreover, the limited tunable bandwidth of the MTJs constrains the number of synapses per layer, thereby limiting the network's potential for scaling up. In this work, electrically tunable spintronic synapses and neurons based on three&#8208;terminal MTJs are experimentally realized, where the spin&#8208;orbit torque enables precise modulation of synaptic weight and neuron output frequency. The proposed methodoffers enhanced scalability and reduces energy consumption by a factor of 21. Furthermore, multilayer networks employing both fully connected and convolutional architectures, achieving 99.2% accuracy on drone classification and 92.0% on the Fashion&#8208;MNIST image dataset, are stimulated. The convolutional design notably reduces the number of required oscillator frequency channels. The results demonstrate the feasibility of scalable, high operational frequency, and energy&#8208;efficient all&#8208;spintronic neuromorphic systems, offering a compatible platform for future neuromorphic computing applications.

         <title>Tunable Magnetism and Intrinsic Exchange Bias in Al&#8208;Substituted Terbium Iron Garnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al substitution in terbium iron garnet thin films enables continuous tuning of the magnetic compensation temperature from 190 K to above room temperature. Near compensation, a giant intrinsic exchange bias emerges, whose sign and stochasticity can be controlled by external fields and cooling history. This approach provides new routes to engineer garnet thin films for spintronic applications.








Abstract
Ferrimagnetic insulators are central to both fundamental magnetism and diverse technologies, including spintronics, photonics, and microwave engineering. Their low damping, electrical insulation, and tunable magnetism make them ideal, especially for low&#8208;power spintronic devices. Controlling key magnetic properties &#8212;particularly the magnetic compensation&#8212; is essential for accessing ultrafast dynamics, and advanced spintronic functionalities. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic compensation temperature (TM) of an archetype ferrimagnetic insulator, terbium iron garnet (Tb3Fe5O12, TbIG), can be continuously tuned and raised to ambient temperature by partially substituting magnetic Fe atoms with nonmagnetic Al. This substitution, achieved by high&#8208;temperature co&#8208;sputtering of TbIG and Al2O3, is confirmed by atomically resolved electron microscopy. Near TM, a giant intrinsic exchange bias of up to 2.5&#160;kOe is observed. The exchange bias exhibits deterministic or stochastic behavior depending on the cooling conditions, and its polarity can be controlled via an external magnetic field. To explain the observed phenomena, a phenomenological model is developed that takes into account a distribution of local TM values induced by magnetic site disorder. These findings provide an efficient strategy for controlling TM and enabling exchange bias in TbIG that may add new functionalities for room&#8208;temperature spintronic and photonic applications.

     alt="Tunable Magnetism and Intrinsic Exchange Bias in Al-Substituted Terbium Iron Garnet"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al substitution in terbium iron garnet thin films enables continuous tuning of the magnetic compensation temperature from 190 K to above room temperature. Near compensation, a giant intrinsic exchange bias emerges, whose sign and stochasticity can be controlled by external fields and cooling history. This approach provides new routes to engineer garnet thin films for spintronic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrimagnetic insulators are central to both fundamental magnetism and diverse technologies, including spintronics, photonics, and microwave engineering. Their low damping, electrical insulation, and tunable magnetism make them ideal, especially for low-power spintronic devices. Controlling key magnetic properties &#8212;particularly the magnetic compensation&#8212; is essential for accessing ultrafast dynamics, and advanced spintronic functionalities. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic compensation temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;) of an archetype ferrimagnetic insulator, terbium iron garnet (Tb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, TbIG), can be continuously tuned and raised to ambient temperature by partially substituting magnetic Fe atoms with nonmagnetic Al. This substitution, achieved by high-temperature co-sputtering of TbIG and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is confirmed by atomically resolved electron microscopy. Near &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, a giant intrinsic exchange bias of up to 2.5&#160;kOe is observed. The exchange bias exhibits deterministic or stochastic behavior depending on the cooling conditions, and its polarity can be controlled via an external magnetic field. To explain the observed phenomena, a phenomenological model is developed that takes into account a distribution of local &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; values induced by magnetic site disorder. These findings provide an efficient strategy for controlling &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; and enabling exchange bias in TbIG that may add new functionalities for room-temperature spintronic and photonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Efficiency and Stable Flexible Organic Solar Cells Facilitated by Light Sensitive Hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrophobic Converting Surface Modification of the Flexible Barrier Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced surface modification enables the direct fabrication of flexible organic solar cells on transparent barrier films. The light&#8208;sensitive material enables the interface hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic conversion, facilitates uniform electrode fabrication, and enhances the moisture barrier properties, thereby improving efficiency, flexibility, and stability of the flexible organic solar cells.








Abstract
With the advantages of high efficiency and flexibility, the flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) showed great application in wearable electronics. However, degradation of device performance due to the infiltration of water and oxygen into the flexible substrate becomes the main obstacle to its development. The traditional encapsulation with a sandwich structure would reduce the optical and mechanical properties of the devices and increase the device's weight. In this work, a strategy of in situ fabrication of highly efficient and long&#8208;term stable FOSCs on the highly transparent barrier film (BF) substrates is developed. A kind of light&#8208;sensitive material, o&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohol derivatives, which can convert from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, is induced to improve the wettability of AgNWs on the substrate and enable the printing fabrication of a uniform AgNWs transparent electrode. After light conversion, the NBE films are converted to hydrophobic, which sufficiently improved the barrier property. The efficiency of the BF/NBE devices reached 16.33% and retained 80% of its initial value after being stored in the air for 600&#160;h, which is compared to the grid devices with the glass substrate. Besides, due to the superior mechanical properties and thin thickness, the in situ FOSCs with barrier substrates exhibited excellent mechanical bending durability.

         <title>Sensitive and Stable Tandem X&#8208;Ray Detectors Achieved by High&#8208;Quality 2D Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem detector is designed and assembled for the first time to solve the critical issue of low carrier transport efficiency in 2D perovskite SCs. The tandem SC detector establishes efficient cross&#8208;layer charge transport channels through a &#8220;layered synchronous collection&#8221; strategy, enabling a &#8220;short&#8208;range transport&#8221; mechanism, thus significantly enhanced carrier collection efficiency. The combination of high stability and sensitivity enables the tandem SC detectors achieved high&#8208;definition X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
2D perovskite single crystals (SCs) demonstrate significant potential for developing low&#8208;cost, stable, and low dose X&#8208;ray detection. However, the large interlayer spacing in 2D perovskite results in low carrier mobility, limiting the sensitivity enhancement of X&#8208;ray detection. Herein, a tandem detector is designed and assembled for the first time to solve the critical issue of low carrier transport efficiency in 2D perovskite SCs. The tandem SC detector establishes efficient cross&#8208;layer charge transport channels through a &#8220;layered synchronous collection&#8221; strategy, enabling a &#8220;short&#8208;range transport&#8221; mechanism. The unique &#8220;longitudinal short&#8208;range transport&#8221; reduces carrier transport distance and then decreases recombination and trap capture, thus significantly enhanced carrier collection efficiency. Consequently, these detectors not only maintain low dark current but also exhibit a higher response current than single&#8208;junction counterparts, resulting in superior X&#8208;ray detection performance. Specifically, the tandem SC detectors achieved a high sensitivity of 5218 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.2 n Gy s&#8722;1, and a short response time of 1.8&#160;ms. Furthermore, the tandem detectors retain original response after continuous X&#8208;ray irradiation with a high dose of 2.4&#160;Gy. The combination of high stability and sensitivity enables the tandem SC detectors achieved high&#8208;definition imaging at 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1.

         <title>De Novo Design of Polyimides Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo design strategy for polyimides based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed and an agent, DAPiGen, for generating specific polyimides is constructed. These findings highlight the pivotal role of diamines in polyimide properties. Rigorously validated, the strategy has yielded a novel polyimide with good overall performance.








Abstract
Designing molecular structures has long been a central pursuit in organic films with super properties. However, the vast chemical space of candidate molecules poses a challenge in screening optimal materials with exceptional performance. Herein, a multi&#8208;objective performance&#8208;oriented strategy driven by deep reinforcement learning and train an agent, DAPiGen is proposed, for a de novo template&#8208;free polyimide creation. The agent combines the property predictors identified from four machine learning models and a fragment&#8208;based generation architecture with active fragments extracted from polyimides as fundamental building blocks. Its successful use is demonstrated to create several polyimides for flexible display scenarios, i.e., with specific properties such as higher transparency, lower coefficient of linear thermal expansion, superior tensile strength, and elevated glass transition temperature. Experiment validation and structural importance analysis demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed research approach. The scalable strategy presented in this work stands as a paradigm for the inverse design of a spectrum of polymeric materials, offering guidance for other structural engineering endeavors.

         <title>Homogeneity Regulation in Sequential Fabricated Perovskite Film for Industrial&#8208;Scale Deposition of Fully&#8208;Textured Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a synergistic strategy for the regulation of penetration of organic salts by employing solvent engineering combined with near&#8208;infrared irradiation pre&#8208;heating, high&#8208;quality perovskite films are obtained over industrially large area. The resultant perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem device based on industrially compatible textured silicon yields a certified efficiency of 30.6% and a laboratory efficiency of 27.1% at an active area of 1.0 and 110 cm2, respectively.








Abstract
The combination of industrially crystalline silicon with metal halide perovskites in a tandem configuration has been the focus of intense research efforts. Although a hybrid deposition method has been developed to achieve conformal and scalable growth of perovskite film on textured silicon, this dry/wet approach faces problems of incomplete reaction and phase impurities, posing a challenge for up&#8208;scaling fabrication. Herein, a synergistic strategy is demonstrated for homogeneity regulation of penetration of organic salts by employing solvent engineering in slot&#8208;die coating combined with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation pre&#8208;heating. The use of mixed solvent contributes to a phase&#8208;pure and homogeneous perovskite film by balancing the rate of solvent evaporation and reactant diffusion. Additionally, the NIR energy heats the large&#8208;area perovskite wet film directly and rapidly in the air, and thus controls the solvent volatilization for uniform phase transformation. As a result, this strategy enables the air&#8208;processed perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem device based on an industrial c&#8208;Si cell to achieve an efficiency of 30.95% (certified 30.6%) for an active area of 1.0 cm2 and obtain an efficiency of 27.1% for an aperture area of 110 cm2. Furthermore, the encapsulated large&#8208;area device retains 89% of the initial output after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point tracking.

Additionally, the NIR energy heats the large-area perovskite wet film directly and rapidly in the air, and thus controls the solvent volatilization for uniform phase transformation. As a result, this strategy enables the air-processed perovskite-silicon tandem device based on an industrial c-Si cell to achieve an efficiency of 30.95% (certified 30.6%) for an active area of 1.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and obtain an efficiency of 27.1% for an aperture area of 110 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the encapsulated large-area device retains 89% of the initial output after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gel&#8208;Locked Lamellar Membranes: Overcoming the Limitations of Permeance, Selectivity, and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a facile photothermal&#8208;triggered confined gelation approach to manufacture novel gel&#8208;locked lamellar membranes (GLLMs) with versatile gel&#8208;rich nanochannel chemistry and gel&#8208;locked lamellar nanochannel architecture. These gel&#8208;locked lamellar nanochannels render GLLMs with excellent antiswelling property and extraordinary structure stability, realizing exceptional permeance, selectivity, and stability simultaneously for isotopic separation, optical resolution, organic solvent nanofiltration, and gas separation.








Abstract
Nanosheets&#8208;stacked lamellar membranes with unique 2D nanochannels are promising platform to achieve ultrafast molecule sieving over conventional membranes in numerous separation applications. Despite significant successes in material design and structure optimization, existing lamellar membranes remain challenging to achieve boosted permeance, selectivity, and stability simultaneously, owing to their limited nanochannel chemistry and unstable nanochannel architecture. Herein, a new class of gel&#8208;locked lamellar membranes (GLLMs) that feature versatile gel&#8208;decorated nanochannel chemistry and gel&#8208;crosslinked lamellar nanochannel architecture are discovered by an original photothermal&#8208;triggered confined gelation (PTCG) approach. In the PTCG, the photothermal&#8208;enabled localized heating from nanosheets is leveraged to trigger rapid and efficient generation of free radicals in their vicinity, allowing for precisely confining polymerization and gelation into lamellar nanochannels. With this method, a series of GLLMs are constructed by easily devising functional monomers and nanosheets and exhibit ultrastable nanochannel architecture with antiswelling ability in many harsh conditions. It is demonstrated that the GLLMs with customized gel&#8208;decorated nanochannels showcase boosted permeance and selectivity over conventional lamellar membranes in many separation scenarios such as isotopic separation, optical resolution, organic solvent nanofiltration, and CO2/CH4 separation. The findings represent a paradigm shift in exploiting a family of advanced lamellar membranes with broader applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Nitrous Oxide Decomposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 310. A novel mechanochemical strategy is presented for decomposing N2O into harmless nitrogen and oxygen, achieving a rapid decomposition rate of 1761.3 mL h&#8722;1 and nearly complete N2O conversion of 99.98% at 42&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the top three greenhouse gases, together with carbon dioxide and methane, but it is stable enough not to be easily decomposed under thermocatalytic conditions, even at high temperature (445&#160;&#176;C). Herein, an efficient N2O decomposition method is reported using nickel oxide catalyst under mechanochemical conditions operated near ambient temperature. The mechanochemical N2O decomposition method exhibited a rapid reaction rate of 1761.3 mL h&#8722;1 and a high conversion of 99.98% even at 42&#160;&#176;C, compared to the thermochemical method (294.9 mL h&#8722;1 and 49.16% at 445&#160;&#176;C). Unlike equilibrium thermocatalytic states, the non&#8208;equilibrium mechanocatalytic states induced by intensive dynamic mechanochemical actions are responsible for effective N2O decomposition under mild temperature conditions.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printing Assisted Bidirectional &#960;&#8208;Structured Thermoelectric Generators: Reverse&#8208;Designed Flexible Architectures for Curved Heat Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an innovative bidirectional &#960;&#8208;structure based on 3D printing technology, which optimizes heat conduction efficiency and enhances mechanical flexibility. Using an inverse design framework that integrates 3D scanning and curvature distribution analysis, a customized topological structure tailored to the geometry of the target heat source is developed, thereby improving thermal collection from curved surfaces.








Abstract
Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) demonstrate significant potential for sustainable energy harvesting through direct heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion. Nevertheless, conventional fully encapsulated designs face critical limitations including heat dissipation inefficiencies and restricted conformability to complex curved surfaces. This investigation proposes a breakthrough bidirectional &#960;&#8208;structured (BD&#960;&#8208;structure) that achieves enhanced mechanical compliance while establishing a mechano&#8208;electrical coupling criterion for abrupt curvature transitions. Through implementing a reverse design framework integrating 3D scanning and curvature distribution analysis, customized topological configurations are specifically developed and adapted to target heat source geometries. Concurrently, a novel photocurable composite with enhanced thermal conductivity (0.213 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1) is designed through 3D&#8208;printed structural optimization, achieving 59.1% power enhancement compared to conventional encapsulated modules. Experimental validation demonstrates remarkable surface fit tightness of 90.7% (positive Gaussian) and 80.2% (negative Gaussian), translating to exceptional power output improvements of 432.7% and 253.2% relative to non&#8208;optimized counterparts. This work establishes a comprehensive framework encompassing material innovation, structural design, and system integration strategies, significantly advancing flexible thermoelectric technology for high&#8208;efficiency energy harvesting from geometrically complex thermal sources.

         <title>Regulating Exciton Dissociation and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Over Single&#8208;Atom Cu&#8208;In2S3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence Cu single&#8208;atom in In2S3 nanosheets can drive the separation and transfer of charge carriers, enhance the exciton dissociation as free photogenerated electrons and holes, as well as lower the reaction barrier energy. As a result, the Cu&#8208;In2S3 nanosheets demonstrate an enhanced rate of CO production in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with/without a sacrificial agent.








Abstract
Uncovering the excitation processes of photocatalysts and enhancing the dissociation of excitons into free photogenerated electrons and holes for photocatalytic CO2 reduction is imperative yet quite challenging. Herein, an efficient strategy of reducing the binding energy of excitons to boost exciton dissociation is reported by anchoring the low valence single&#8208;atom Cu sites in In2S3 nanosheets (Cu&#8208;In2S3), which can enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. The investigations of photo&#8208;irradiated Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), in situ irradiates X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (TD&#8208;PL) indicate that the doping of low valence single&#8208;atom Cu can efficiently drive the charge transfer and separation. Moreover, the studies of the dynamic behaviors of charge carriers by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveal that the doping of low valence Cu single&#8208;atom sites allows the promotion of exciton dissociation by reducing the binding energy of the exciton, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction of Cu&#8208;In2S3 nanosheets. The aforementioned strategy for enhancing the dissociation efficiency of excitons in photocatalysts will offer a highly efficient and promising approach for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction and other photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Giant Shell Nanorods for High&#8208;Efficiency and Low&#8208;Roll&#8208;Off Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that low&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CdSe&#8208;based nanorods enhance charge confinement, suppress leakage current, and limit EQE roll&#8208;off to just 2% across 25&#8211;1&#8201;000 mA cm&#8722;2, enabling red NR&#8208;LEDs with record&#8208;high efficiency (23.4%), brightness (289&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and lifetime (T95 10&#8201;638 h at 1&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2).








Abstract
1D colloidal semiconductor nanorods (NRs) offer polarized emission and enhanced photon out&#8208;coupling efficiency for high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, their practical application has been limited by severe efficiency roll&#8208;off at high current densities due to thin radial shells along the radial direction and the high aspect ratio that leads to random orientation during the fabrication of solution&#8208;processed films, which causes structural gaps, triggering leakage currents and ultimately exacerbating efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, fatty acid is introduced to mitigate the c&#8208;axial growth induced by phosphonic acid in traditional NRs synthesis, while promoting radial shell growth, thereby forming giant&#8208;shell CdSe/CdZnSe/CdS/CdZnS NRs with an aspect ratio of &#8776;2.2. This design effectively alleviates electron leakage caused by random orientation in NR films, while minimizing interfacial defects and Auger recombination, achieving a near&#8208;unity PLQY. Consequently, NR&#8208;LEDs based on these NRs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a luminance of 289&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Significantly, this NR design greatly suppresses the EQE roll&#8208;off at high current density. Furthermore, the devices have a long T95 lifetime of more than 10&#160;000&#160;h at a luminance of 1&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This material design strategy lays the foundation for realizing highly polarized NR&#8208;LEDs for efficient high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Nucleophilic Redox Shuttle Surpasses the Efficiency Limitation of Oxygen Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible nucleophilic redox shuttle is integrated into flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries to regulate oxygen redox chemistry. The NRS mediates multielectron transfer, mitigates anode parasitic reactions, and stabilizes discharge/charge tri&#8208;phase interfaces, thereby achieving high energy efficiency, prolonged cycle life, and providing mechanistic insight into oxygen electrocatalysis in advanced metal&#8211;air systems.








Abstract
Oxygen redox is a promising route for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical systems, but poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and bubble desorption at the gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid interface limit efficiency and stability. Here, the introduction of a reversible nucleophilic electrochemistry embedded in the oxygen redox reaction, known as the nucleophilic redox shuttle (NRS), is reported to develop a strategy that surpasses the energy efficiency limitations of pure oxygen redox. By incorporating the miscible ionic liquid 1&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropyl)imidazole (APMID) into Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), the OER during charging is replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with lower free&#8208;energy barriers. This pathway boosts the cycling energy efficiency from 63.2% to 80.1%, surpassing most oxygen redox&#8211;based systems.&#160;Additionally, a Zn@Cu anode is used to restore nucleophiles during charging, maintaining a low voltage gap of 0.30&#160;V (compared to &#8776;0.69&#160;V for common ZABs) over 2100 h of cycling at 1 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The high reversibility of the nucleophilic reactions ensures its stable operation even in gel electrolyte, demonstrated by the integration with a wearable patch electrocardiogram detection. These findings establish NRS as a robust strategy to extend the efficiency and durability of oxygen redox systems, advancing their practical application in next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Stabilizing the High Spin Cobalt Atoms by Local Magnetic Asymmetry in p&#8208;Block Metals&#8208;Doped Spinel MnCo2O4 Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8722;2O&#8722;Pb covalency creates a local asymmetric magnetism to stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of surface Co centers (dxy2dxz2dz21dyz1dx2&#8722;y21${{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{\mathrm{xy}}}}^{\mathrm{2}}{{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{\mathrm{xz}}}}^{\mathrm{2}}{{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{{{\mathrm{z}}}^{\mathrm{2}}}}}^{\mathrm{1}}{{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{\mathrm{yz}}}}^{\mathrm{1}}{{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{{{\mathrm{x}}}^{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{ - }}{{{\mathrm{y}}}^{\mathrm{2}}}}}^{\mathrm{1}}$), thereby increasing greatly the transfer rate of electrons from the Co sites to triplet O2 adsorbates and the eORR efficiency.








Abstract
Spinel MnCo2O4 (MCO) is often used for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (eORR), limited kinetically by the electronic spin state of surface cobalt (Co) centers. In this work, the rate&#8208;determining step of eORR is unlocked by doping p&#8208;block metals, including Ga, In, and Pb, into MCO catalysts to stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of surface octahedral Co atoms, where the high&#8208;spin electrons are rapidly injected into triplet O2 adsorbates. The optimal Pb&#8208;doped MCO catalyst (denoted as 0.2MCPO) as an air electrode is used to setup a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) device, achieving a significantly&#8208;enhanced peak power density of 1.53 W cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability over 210 h. The M&#9472;2O&#9472;Co covalencies make the high&#8208;spin state of surface octahedral Co atoms more stable by the p&#8208;d orbital coupling mechanism, and thus boost kinetically the electron transfer from surface Co sites to O2 adsorbates. A combination of experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that the stable high&#8208;spin state of Co atoms enhances O2 adsorption and activation, lowering the energy barriers for the homolytic cleavage of O2 into two *O atoms. These findings offer fundamental insights into spin&#8208;selected electrocatalysis for ORR and a general guidance to construction of high&#8208;performance SOFC devices for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Supramolecular Amino Acids&#8208;Encoded Nanodots (SEND) with pH&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Responsive Phase Separation for Serum&#8208;Tolerant Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 60 supramolecular amino acid&#8208;encoded nanodots (SEND) is screened to identify candidates for serum&#8208;tolerant protein delivery. Among them, the FR (Phe&#8208;Arg) modified SEND exhibited bicarbonate&#8208;triggered liquid&#8211;solid phase separation (LSPS) driven by strengthened hydrogen bonding. This pH&#8208; and Ion&#8208;responsive LSPS protects proteins from serum&#8208;induced leakage, allowing for efficient cytosolic delivery in serum and therapeutic efficacy against lung metastasis.








Abstract
To broaden the scope of potential intracellular targets for protein drugs, artificial carriers are employed to achieve efficient cytosolic delivery. However, the majority of delivery vectors are hindered by restricted serum tolerance. Here, the screening of supramolecular amino acids&#8208;encoded nanodots (SEND) for efficient serum&#8208;tolerant cytosolic protein delivery is reported. A library of 60 nanodots is constructed by surface conjugation of different amino acids or dipeptides on cyanine five&#8208;cored polylysine dendrimers. The FR (Phe&#8208;Arg) and RW (Arg&#8208;Trp) modified SEND achieved efficient intracellular protein delivery in both serum&#8208;free and serum&#8208;containing conditions, and preserved high protein bioactivity. These two SEND can recruit a wide range of proteins and induce liquid&#8211;solid phase separation, thereby preventing the premature leakage of loaded proteins. The phase separation behavior of SEND&#8208;FR and &#8208;RW is responsive to ionic strength and pH. Moreover, SEND&#8208;FR is sensitive to bicarbonate, which promotes the hardening of SEND&#8208;FR coacervates through enhanced hydrogen bonding. Lowering the pH triggers reversion to a homogeneous phase, enabling controlled protein release. The SEND&#8208;FR is capable of sending toxic protein Saporin to the lung via systemic administration, effectively inhibiting the progression of lung metastasis. This study provides a promising strategy to construct functional nanocarriers for efficient serum&#8208;tolerant cytosolic protein delivery.

Here, the screening of supramolecular amino acids-encoded nanodots (SEND) for efficient serum-tolerant cytosolic protein delivery is reported. A library of 60 nanodots is constructed by surface conjugation of different amino acids or dipeptides on cyanine five-cored polylysine dendrimers. The FR (Phe-Arg) and RW (Arg-Trp) modified SEND achieved efficient intracellular protein delivery in both serum-free and serum-containing conditions, and preserved high protein bioactivity. These two SEND can recruit a wide range of proteins and induce liquid&#8211;solid phase separation, thereby preventing the premature leakage of loaded proteins. The phase separation behavior of SEND-FR and -RW is responsive to ionic strength and pH. Moreover, SEND-FR is sensitive to bicarbonate, which promotes the hardening of SEND-FR coacervates through enhanced hydrogen bonding. Lowering the pH triggers reversion to a homogeneous phase, enabling controlled protein release. The SEND-FR is capable of sending toxic protein Saporin to the lung via systemic administration, effectively inhibiting the progression of lung metastasis. This study provides a promising strategy to construct functional nanocarriers for efficient serum-tolerant cytosolic protein delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Fibril Network Engineering for Scalable and Sustainable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a multifunctional additive strategy, high&#8208;quality films with a dual&#8208;fibril network morphology are successfully printed, achieving a remarkable PCE of 20.23% for the device and 17.26% in the module.








Abstract
Green&#8208;printed, high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics modules are critical to the commercial expansion and practical deployment of organic photovoltaics. Since the emergence of Y6&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs is remarkable progress. However, a considerable performance gap remains between devices processed with halogenated versus non&#8208;halogenated (green) solvents, primarily due to difficulties in controlling molecular aggregation. Here, hydroxyl&#8208;rich cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) is introduced as a multifunctional additive to enhance the morphology and performance of modules fabricated via large&#8208;area green printing. CAB suppresses excessive molecular aggregation and modulates the film&#8208;formation dynamics. Crucially, its hydroxyl side groups interact synergistically with both donor and acceptor materials to induce a dual&#8208;fibril network, providing abundant interfacial area for exciton dissociation and continuous pathways for efficient charge transport. As a result, green&#8208;printed PM6:PTP&#8208;eC9 devices achieve PCE of 19.04%. Moreover, ternary PM6:PTQ&#8208;10:PTP&#8208;eC9 devices and modules with an active area of 16.94 cm2 exhibit PCEs of 20.23% and 17.26%, respectively. This work demonstrates a viable additive engineering strategy for realizing scalable, environmentally benign, and high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Ni&#8208;Doped Cu&#8208;Based Catalyst Shielded by Carbon Overlayer for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid plasma shock approach creates a Ni&#8208;doped Cu catalyst with a protective carbon overlayer for efficient ammonia electrosynthesis, which suppresses surface degradation and boosts NO3&#8722; hydrogenation by optimizing intermediate adsorption and hydrogen availability.








Abstract
Plasma&#8208;enabled N2 oxidation coupled with electrocatalytic NOx&#8722; reduction (pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR) represents a highly promising approach for sustainable, scalable, and distributed NH3 production under mild conditions. However, the eNOx&#8722;RR for NH3 synthesis is hindered by catalyst degradation, which results in low NH3 selectivity and poor stability. Here, inspired by solid&#8208;state source doping in photolithography, this work reports a rapid plasma shock strategy to build a Ni&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;based catalyst shielded by a carbon overlayer. It demonstrates long&#8208;term stability, maintaining an NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96% for 156&#160;h at a current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More importantly, this work establishes a continuous&#8208;flow pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR system using air and water as feedstocks, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 5.36&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 FE of 85%. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the carbon overlayer suppresses electrochemical surface degradation and stabilizes the coexistence of Cu2O and Cu during eNO3&#8722;RR, while Ni doping simultaneously balances the mismatch between NO3&#8722; adsorption and *H supply and accelerates both processes. This study provides a new approach for designing stable catalysts and offers insights into the pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR system, paving the way for continuous NH3 production directly from air and water under ambient conditions.

         <title>Multiplexed Single&#8208;Particle Imaging Enabled by Modulation of Er3+ Energy&#8208;Level Populations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy enables multiplexed single&#8208;particle imaging by precisely tuning the red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G)&#160;emission ratios of Yb/Er co&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles. Quantitative modeling and experimental validation reveal that R/G modulation is dictated by excited Yb3+ density (n1&#8242;${n}_{1}^{\prime}$), which governs energy redistribution among Er3+ states. This mechanism allows more than a tenfold spectral tunability and enables reliable multicolor tracking of molecular dynamics.








Abstract
Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) offers critical insights into nanoscale molecular dynamics, but is limited by short tracking durations due to irreversible photobleaching and the technical complexity of multicolor imaging. Here, a non&#8208;photobleaching ratiometric imaging strategy is developed based on lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), exploiting their intrinsic, tunable red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G) emission ratios for multiplexed SPT. Single&#8208;particle characterization reveals over 10&#8208;fold tunability. Mechanistic investigations show that this ratiometric behavior is governed by Yb3+ excitation density, which modulates the energy distribution within energy levels of Er3+ ions. Specifically, high Yb3+ excitation densities enhance three&#8208;photon transitions, favoring red emission, while lower densities promote two&#8208;photon upconversion and green emission. Both processes proceed through a shared energy level of 2H11/2, leading to competitive energy transfer dynamics. Based on this competition mechanism, a quantitative relationship is further established between UCNPs structure and the resulting R/G emission ratio, allowing reliable prediction of spectral output across different designs. Leveraging this tunable ratiometric principle, simultaneous five&#8208;color single&#8208;particle imaging is demonstrated with a misidentification rate below 5%. This strategy is further applied to visualize receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis in live cells. This work highlights the advantages of upconversion luminescence&#8208;based R/G ratio discrimination for long&#8208;term, multicolor SPT, offering a simple and reliable tool for probing complex biological processes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Eu3+ Complexes Enabling Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive Data Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through J&#8208;aggregation assembly of engineered Eu(THA)3, multistimuli&#8208;responsive Eu&#8208;NPs and Eu/DTE&#8208;NPs are created exhibiting: i) pH&#8208;switchable red/green emission (614/480 nm), ii) thermally&#8208;quenched luminescence with high lifetime sensitivity, and iii) UV/Vis&#8208;toggled FRET switching. Also, nanoconfinement boosted quantum yield and lifetime by suppressing non&#8208;radiative decay. These properties enabled dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting platforms (labels/QR codes/hydrogels) and dual&#8208;key PUF tags (intensity/lifetime).








Abstract
Multistimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials are pivotal for next&#8208;generation information encryption, yet integrating orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, high reversibility, and nanoscale programmability remains a formidable challenge. Herein, Eu3+&#8208;based nanoparticles (Eu&#8208;NPs) are constructed with triply orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence (pH/thermal/light) through J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a tailored &#946;&#8208;diketone complex (Eu(THA)3). Spatial confinement within the nanostructure suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay, enhancing the luminescence quantum yield while extending the lifetime. Crucially, the Eu&#8208;NPs enable: i) Reversible pH&#8208;switching between red Eu3+ emission (614 nm) and green ligand AIE (480 nm) with good cyclability; ii) Linear thermal quenching for dual&#8208;mode thermometry (intensity sensitivity: 3.82%&#183;K&#8722;1; lifetime sensitivity: 7.46%&#183;K&#8722;1); iii) UV/Vis&#8208;light&#8208;modulated FRET with dithienylethene (DTE) enabling single&#8208;particle ON/OFF switching. Leveraging these properties, hierarchical encryption platforms are developed, including dynamically responsive printed labels, QR codes, and hydrogels. Furthermore, exploiting inherent assembly randomness, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are fabricated with dual&#8208;key (intensity/lifetime) authentication and ultrahigh encoding capacity (41,600). This strategy establishes a new paradigm for adaptive anti&#8208;counterfeiting by integrating dynamic data encryption with physically unclonable security in a single rare&#8208;earth nanoplatform.

&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregation assembly of engineered Eu(THA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, multistimuli-responsive Eu-NPs and Eu/DTE-NPs are created exhibiting: i) pH-switchable red/green emission (614/480 nm), ii) thermally-quenched luminescence with high lifetime sensitivity, and iii) UV/Vis-toggled FRET switching. Also, nanoconfinement boosted quantum yield and lifetime by suppressing non-radiative decay. These properties enabled dynamic anti-counterfeiting platforms (labels/QR codes/hydrogels) and dual-key PUF tags (intensity/lifetime).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multistimuli-responsive luminescent materials are pivotal for next-generation information encryption, yet integrating orthogonal stimuli-responsiveness, high reversibility, and nanoscale programmability remains a formidable challenge. Herein, Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-based nanoparticles (Eu-NPs) are constructed with triply orthogonal stimuli-responsive luminescence (pH/thermal/light) through &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregation-driven self-assembly of a tailored &#946;-diketone complex (Eu(THA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Spatial confinement within the nanostructure suppresses non-radiative decay, enhancing the luminescence quantum yield while extending the lifetime. Crucially, the Eu-NPs enable: i) Reversible pH-switching between red Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; emission (614 nm) and green ligand AIE (480 nm) with good cyclability; ii) Linear thermal quenching for dual-mode thermometry (intensity sensitivity: 3.82%&#183;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;; lifetime sensitivity: 7.46%&#183;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;); iii) UV/Vis-light-modulated FRET with dithienylethene (DTE) enabling single-particle ON/OFF switching. Leveraging these properties, hierarchical encryption platforms are developed, including dynamically responsive printed labels, QR codes, and hydrogels. Furthermore, exploiting inherent assembly randomness, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are fabricated with dual-key (intensity/lifetime) authentication and ultrahigh encoding capacity (4&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;1,600&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;). This strategy establishes a new paradigm for adaptive anti-counterfeiting by integrating dynamic data encryption with physically unclonable security in a single rare-earth nanoplatform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Iontronic Hydrogels Generating Biomimetic Endogenous Bioelectricity for Promoting Cartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable mechano&#8208;iontronic hydrogel is designed to enhance cartilage repair, which generates iontronic electricity under deformation, closely mimicking the characteristics and mechanisms of natural cartilage. The coupled iontronic electricity and mechanical stimulation are shown to reprogram the metabolic microenvironment, enhancing glutamine metabolism and accelerating the cartilage regeneration process.








Abstract
Articular cartilage regeneration has long been a formidable challenge because of its avascular and aneural nature. Traditional approaches, using exogenous electrical stimulation or electroactive materials, often fail to align with the endogenous iontronic bioelectricity of natural cartilage. Herein, an implantable mechano&#8208;iontronic hydrogel (MI&#8208;hydrogel) is biomimetically designed to enhance cartilage repair. This MI&#8208;hydrogel generates iontronic electricity under deformation, closely mimicking the characteristics and mechanisms of natural cartilage. It is demonstrated that the MI&#8208;hydrogel synergistically integrates iontronic electricity and mechanical stimulation during physical activity, activating the ion channel protein Piezo1. This activation promotes the chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells in vitro and facilitates cartilage repair in vivo. Additionally, these coupled effects are shown to reprogram the metabolic microenvironment, enhancing glutamine metabolism and accelerating the cartilage regeneration process. This study not only underscores the potential of the MI&#8208;hydrogel as a novel therapeutic platform but also introduces a new mechanism for tissue regeneration, paving the way for innovative approaches in regenerative medicine.

A multifunctional microrobot with gold nanospikes enables magnetic navigation, lesion sampling, and AI&#8208;enhanced SERS&#8208;based tissue analysis for targeted biopsy of deep&#8208;seated tracheal microlesions. This integrated micro&#8208;robotic approach represents an accurate, noninvasive, and rapid biopsy technology, providing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept solution to renovate current clinical workflows for early lung cancer diagnosis.








Abstract
Biopsy remains gold standard for definitive diagnosis of numerous diseases, yet conventional approaches confront inherent limitations encompassing procedural invasiveness, limited spatial resolution, poor deep&#8208;tissue accessibility, and complicated post&#8208;operative histopathology examinations. Herein, a multifunctional magnetically actuated microrobotic platform for targeted biopsy of deep&#8208;seated micro&#8208;lesion in lung for potential use of early lung cancer diagnosis is reported. This conical helix&#8208;structured microrobot features controllable gold nanospike decoration at its tip, integrating dual functionality in drilling&#8208;enabled tissue sampling and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensing. Utilizing real&#8208;time tracheoscopy and fluoroscopy guidance, this platform achieves magnetic navigation through saline&#8208;filled bronchi to target lesions, followed by on&#8208;demand sampling and retrieval, whose feasibility is systematically verified through ex vivo porcine lung models and in vivo rabbit trials. The collected biomarker and tissue samples can be rapidly recognized and quantified based on SERS spectroscopy. Moreover, through establishing a convolutional neural network&#8208;based deep learning model, it is succeed to distinguish between the healthy and various cancerous lung tissues from clinical patients, achieving a recognition accuracy of over 94.3% within just 3&#160;min. Therefore, this work represents a microrobot&#8208;based biopsy techniques for noninvasive and precise sampling in lung with diagnosis capability of early&#8208;stage lung cancer, offering substantial improvements over conventional biopsy methods.

One&#8208;step interfacial redox strategy for enhancing catalytic performance in seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis is a promising strategy for sustainable hydrogen production, yet it faces critical challenges in catalyst design, including scalability, chloride corrosion resistance, and cost efficiency. A one&#8208;step interfacial redox strategy is reported to construct Fe/Co co&#8208;doped Ru@Ni(OH)2 electrodes (Ru@FeCo&#8211;Ni(OH)2), enabling precise control of metal coordination environments while ensuring industrial&#8208;scale manufacturability. This method enables the fabrication of 5000 cm2 electrodes with no performance deviation, demonstrating compatibility with commercial electrolyzers. The Ru@FeCo&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrodes exhibit remarkable durability (&gt;3000&#160;h) and achieve hydrogen production at $0.87 per kg using natural seawater from the South China Sea (unpurified, with KOH added), surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy's 2031 cost target of $1 per kg. Operando spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a synergistic co&#8208;doping mechanism: 1) d&#8208;band center downshifting (&#916;E = 0.68&#160;eV) optimizes hydrogen adsorption for superior hydrogen evolution reaction performance, while 2) accelerated surface reconstruction forms chloride&#8208;resistant oxyhydroxide layers, improving oxygen evolution reaction efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm in bifunctional catalyst design, providing mechanistic insights into active site evolution and a scalable pathway for cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production directly from seawater.

         <title>From Irreversible to Reversible: Nucleophilic Reactions Enhance Fast Kinetics and Superior Cycling Stability in High Voltage Lithium&#8208;Organosulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diphenyl tetrasulfide (PTS) is composited with tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM) with a PTS:TMTM molar ratio of 1:4 to form a PT14 cathode. The Li&#8208;PT14 cell shows a high discharge voltage of 2.55 V and retains 90% of the initial capacity after 700 cycles at 1 C. It also shows promising performances at elevated temperatures. When paired with a lithiated graphitic anode, the full cell delivers a capacity retention of 97% after 840 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, a Li&#8208;PT14 pouch cell remains 100% of the initial capacity after 50 cycles.








Abstract
Organosulfur represents a class of promising candidates as cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. However, their development has been hindered by several key factors, including low discharge voltage, shuttle of polysulfides, and sluggish kinetics. Herein, tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM) is introduced as a functional substrate and composited with diphenyl tetrasulfide (PTS), which is denoted as PT14. During discharge, PTS generates benzenethiolate and sulfide anions, both of which can in situ react with TMTM forming new electrochemical reactive species. This design mitigates the polysulfide shuttle effect and enables rapid reaction kinetics. The Li&#8208;PT14 cell shows a high discharge voltage of 2.55&#160;V and retains 90% of the initial capacity after 700 cycles at a 1C rate. When the temperature is increased to 60&#160;&#176;C, the cell retains 95% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles. When paired with a lithiated carbon paper anode (LiC) to form a full cell, it delivers a capacity retention of 97% after 840 cycles at N/P = 3.5 and 0.5 C rate. Furthermore, a 100 mAh pouch cell assembled with the PT14 cathode shows no capacity loss after 50 cycles. This work provides a new strategy to develop advanced rechargeable batteries based on organosulfur cathode materials.

         <title>Acupuncture&#8208;Inspired Active&#8208;Material Microenvironment Engineering for High&#8208;Throughput Thick Electrodes by Instant Microneedle Templating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Chinese acupuncture, a microneedle&#8208;array templated extrusion (MATE) technology and an active&#8208;material microenvironment (AMME) therapy theory are proposed. This enables ultrafast fabrication of 3D thick electrodes with ordered channels, achieving a 300% capacity increase at 60 mg cm&#8722;2. The AMME therapy theory provides deeper insight into the rational design of pore structure of thick electrodes.








Abstract
Rational design and ultrafast fabrication of high&#8208;throughput thick electrodes are essential for high&#8208;energy and power density batteries. However, it is blocked by the lack of both theory and cost&#8208;effective technologies for regulating the active&#8208;material microenvironment (AMME) that fundamentally controls the ion and electron transport for each active&#8208;material particle. Here, inspired by the Chinese&#8208;acupuncture therapy that employs microneedles to dredge the cell microenvironment, a microneedle&#8208;array templated extrusion (MATE) technology is proposed along with an AMME&#8208;therapy theory to address the above challenges. Specifically, a unique clay&#8208;alike thixotropic (CAT) slurry through sol&#8208;binder is first fabricated with significant capabilities in 3D&#8208;morphing. Enabled by this morphable CAT&#8208;slurry, MATE technology is further developed to rapidly and seamlessly fabricate high&#8208;throughput 3D thick electrodes with customizable ordered ion&#8208;transport channels. Consequently, the optimized 3D thick electrode shows a remarkable improvement in specific capacity by 300% even at an ultrahigh active&#8208;material loading of 60&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (ca. 3 times the commercial level). Finally, an AMME therapy theory based on an artificial potential field algorithm for ion&#8208;transport path optimization is established to understand the enhanced ion&#8208;transport dynamics. The proposed AMME&#8208;therapy theory and industry&#8208;friendly MATE technology could advance&#160;the design and fabrication of high&#8208;throughput electrodes in batteries and other electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Implanting Crystal Nuclei at the Buried Interface to Regulate the Growth of Inorganic Perovskite for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface of TiO2 with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminobutyl)guanidine sulfate (AGS) is modified to improve the performance of inorganic perovskite solar cells. AGS can induce in situ formation of PbSO4 crystal nuclei and regulate perovskite crystallization. Furthermore, better energy&#8208;level alignment and the inhibition of ion migration are also demonstrated. Therefore, the AGS&#8208;modified devices exhibit a high efficiency of 22.22%, with superior operational stability.








Abstract
The substitution of organic cations with inorganic Cs+ in metal halide perovskites provides a broad chance for the development of high&#8208;performance tandem solar cells due to excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgaps of inorganic perovskites. However, the buried interface that governs interfacial charge transport and initialization of perovskite film crystallization is often overlooked due to difficulties in tailoring it. Herein, a strategy of modifying TiO2 surface with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminobutyl) guanidine sulfate (AGS) is proposed to tackle these issues. It is found that the introduction of AGS induces in situ formation of PbSO4 dots and interaction with perovskite precursors, which rigorously regulate the crystallization of inorganic perovskite, featuring fast nucleation and acceleration of the phase transition process. This results in more uniform films, enlarged grain size, with reduced defects. The modified buried interface exhibits alleviated strain, suppressed ion migration, fewer voids, and better contact. Together with improved interfacial energy level match between perovskite and TiO2, the power conversion efficiency of modified inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) increases from 19.84% to 22.22%, with a voltage deficit of only 0.44&#160;V. Furthermore, PSCs still maintain 91.5% of its initial value after continuous operation at maximum power point tracking and illumination for 800&#160;h.

         <title>Programmable Continuous Electrowetting of Liquid Metal for Reconfigurable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a programmable continuous electrowetting (CEW) approach for the dynamic manipulation of liquid metal (LM), enabling directional control via electrochemical modulation. By leveraging laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) substrates, a wide range of utilities is demonstrated, including fluidic &#8220;valves,&#8221; logic gates, and reconfigurable circuits. This approach contributes to the development of next&#8208;generation reconfigurable electronics and digital fluidic systems.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of the shape and position of liquid metal (LM), a conductive and deformable conductor, presents new opportunities for reconfigurable electronics, fluidic logic, and soft&#8208;actuation systems. This study combines continuous electrowetting (CEW) with electrochemical modulation of the interface of LM in electrolyte to achieve tunable and directional LM manipulation in 2D spaces. A key finding is that under a fixed external electric field, the LM moves in a direction that depends on its electrochemical potential. The LM potential is controlled using a substrate featuring patterns of laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) since it is non&#8208;wetting to LM and electrically conductive. This strategy enables a range of functionalities, including &#8220;valves&#8221; for on&#8208;demand LM control, LM droplet sorting, feedback sensing, and fluidic logic gates. The strategy can also control the motion of LM droplets across 2D spaces. Finally, it is utilized within a reconfigurable circuit platform where the LM functions as a dynamic interconnect for sequential activation, parallel switching, and self&#8208;healing circuits. By coupling the electrically&#8208;driven motion of LM and the versatility of LIG patterning, this work establishes a versatile framework for reconfigurable electronics, programmable fluidic systems, and adaptive systems.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Ethyl Cellulose Films with Asymmetric Graded Pores for Low Dielectric Printing Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Niu et&#160;al. present a one&#8208;step preparation method for ethyl cellulose asymmetric porous films with dense skins based on the dry phase inversion technique and breath figure phenomenon. The entire pore&#8208;forming process is completed using only ethanol and water. The porous film's relative permittivity can be significantly reduced to 2.02 (6 GHz) and is suitable for Sub&#8208;6GHz printing radio frequency substrate.








Abstract
The innovation of communication technology and the proliferation of the Internet of Things have propelled the exploitation and application of mid&#8208;to&#8208;low end and disposable radio frequency devices, alongside the development of low dielectric materials. Traditional petroleum&#8208;based low dielectric substrates, led by polyimide, present several challenges, including higher cost, non&#8208;renewability, difficulty in disposal and recycling, rendering them unsuitable for disposable applications. In this study, the asymmetric ethyl cellulose (EC) porous film with dense skins is prepared in one step by the evaporation process of EC/ethanol/H2O solution. The synergistic pore&#8208;forming mechanism of the dry phase inversion technique and breath figure&#160;phenomenon is proposed based on EC pore morphology. The relative permittivity of the asymmetric EC porous film is 2.02 &#177; 0.03 (6&#160;GHz), demonstrating satisfactory dielectric stability, printing adaptability, and bending ability. The EC in discarded printed antennas and remnants from the film&#8208;making process can be separated and recovered through a simple dissolution and centrifugation process. The green and simple preparation process, extremely low manufacturing cost, excellent recyclability, and potential roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process adaptability make asymmetric EC porous film highly competitive in the mid&#8208;to&#8208;low end and disposable centimetre wave radio frequency device substrate fields.

         <title>Surface Segregation Reconstructing Alloy Substrate for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>

A rapid 1&#8208;min surface segregation strategy reconstructs Cu&#8211;Sn alloy substrates, effectively regulating Zn deposition behavior and suppressing side reactions. The optimized anode achieves 5400&#8208;h cycling in zinc&#8208;based pouch cells, offering a promising route for stable aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries via surface reconstruction.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (AZBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their high safety, low cost, and eco&#8208;friendliness, but uncontrolled dendrite growth, low zinc (Zn) utilization, and resulting reduced energy density hinder their practical applications. Inert current collectors alleviate partial issues from excessive Zn loading, yet commercial metal foils suffer from rolling defects and localized Zn deposition. This work proposes a segregation strategy that induces directional inward tin (Sn) atom migration in copper&#8208;tin (Cu&#8211;Sn) alloy substrates via diffusion rate disparity by a 1&#8208;min heating process, forming a reconstructed surface that facilitates uniform Zn deposition. This reconstruction establishes triple synergistic optimization, including reducing nucleation barriers by exposing Cu (111) facets, creating uniform voids and CuO particles for homogeneous Zn nucleation, and eliminating rolling defects to enable dense Zn deposition. Based on these synergistic effects, the asymmetric cell exhibits exceptional cycling stability over &#8776;10&#160;000 cycles with 99.8% Coulombic efficiency. Zn&#8211;I2 coin cells achieve ultra&#8208;stable 40&#160;000 cycles, while pouch cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long 5000&#8208;h cycling stability with a 91% capacity retention rate, demonstrating superior stability for practical applications. Combining efficiency, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability, this work provides a critical pathway for sustainable development and potential commercialization of AZBs.

         <title>Promoting Electrochemical Reactions with Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable strategy for synthesizing transition metal&#8211;bismuth atomic pairs on carbon nitride to accelerate sulfur redox reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is presented. Nickel&#8208;bismuth and cobatl&#8208;bismuth catalysts improve rate performance by promoting direct electrochemical transitions and rapid Li2S nucleation, minimizing sulfur loss, and enhancing stability.








Abstract
Sulfur cathodes offer a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable energy storage. However, their practical application is limited by sluggish and complex multistep sulfur redox reactions (SRRs), involving both electrochemical and chemical processes. Herein, it is demonstrated that accelerating electrochemical processes, particularly Li2S nucleation, over competing chemical pathways is fundamental to minimizing sulfur loss and achieving high&#8208;rate performance. To this end, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy is presented for synthesizing a series of 3d transition metal&#8211;bismuth (TM&#8211;Bi) atomic pairs anchored on carbon nitride (CN) and investigate their potential to activate SRRs in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). An initial screening identifies Ni&#8211;Bi/CN and Co&#8211;Bi/CN as highly effective in improving rate performance. Detailed analysis shows these catalysts promote direct electrochemical transitions and rapid Li2S nucleation over competing chemical reactions, enabling high charge&#8211;discharge rates while preventing active material loss and enhancing stability. Electrochemical analysis, density functional theory, and operando spectroscopy reveal that TM&#8208;Bi pairing shifts d&#8208;band states closer to the Fermi level and modulates HOMO&#8211;LUMO levels, promoting lithium polysulfide (LiPS) interaction and facilitating efficient charge transfer. These findings offer valuable insights for designing advanced catalysts for LSBs and broader electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Control of Effective Elastomer Density Enables Mechanically Robust and High&#8208;Efficiency Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective elastomer density (De) is introduced as a unified descriptor linking elastomer structure to device performance. A critical De enables optimal balance between efficiency and stretchability. At critical De, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells achieved an initial power conversion efficiency of 14.3% with 80% retention at 30.6% strain, representing the highest performance reported for elastomer&#8211;plasticized IS&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are highly promising for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. The incorporation of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) provides a cost&#8208;effective strategy to improve mechanical compliance. However, the influence of TPE structural diversity on device performance has been largely overlooked. In this work, the concept of effective elastomer density (De) is introduced as a unified molecular descriptor to quantitatively evaluate how elastomer structures affect IS&#8208;OSC morphology and functionality. It is demonstrated that increasing De enhances stretchability by inducing domain coarsening and surface roughening in amorphous regions, but simultaneously prolongs exciton lifetimes and suppresses charge extraction and transport. Notably, IS&#8208;OSCs achieve an optimal balance at a critical De of 1.5 mol&#160;m&#8722;3, delivering a high initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.3% and retaining 80% of the initial PCE at 30.6% strain, representing the best performance reported to date for IS&#8208;OSCs employing the elastomer&#8208;plasticization strategy. This descriptor&#8208;based framework provides a predictive and generalizable guideline for the molecular design of elastomers in stretchable optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doping and Conjugation&#8208;Extension Enable Ultrahigh&#8208;Bright Full&#8208;Color Carbon Quantum Dots for Tunable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers and 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;bright full&#8208;color fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are synthesized via a single&#8208;precursor system, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) approaching 100% (hereafter referred to as unity&#8208;CQDs). These unity&#8208;CQDs exhibit superior liquid&#8208;state laser performance compare to the widely used organic dye, Rhodamine B. The enclosed area of the CIE color coordinates for the laser spectra of these unity&#8208;CQDs covers 152.6% of the NTSC color gamut. Furthermore, these unity&#8208;CQDs demonstrate excellent compatibility with various polymers, retaining their intense fluorescence even after thorough mixing. High&#8208;precision micro/nano 3D printing has been successfully achieved using these unity&#8208;CQDs, thereby confirming their micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale processability.








Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) represent a novel solution&#8208;processable gain material with significant potential to replace conventional nano&#8208;luminescent materials such as organic molecules, quantum dots, and perovskites. However, the relatively low fluorescence brightness (FB) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) have hindered their widespread adoption. In this study, pyrene is used as the sole precursor to introduce various heteroatom dopants, and followed by solvothermal treatment to synthesize blue&#8208;, green&#8208;, and red&#8208;emissive CQDs with PLQYs approaching 100% (referred to as &#8220;unity&#8208;CQDs&#8221;). The FBs of these CQDs are all approximately 2 million. Pure unity&#8208;CQDs directly emit quasi&#8208;single&#8208;mode blue, green, and red lasers in a simple mirrorless pumping system that covers an area equivalent to 152.6% of the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard color gamut. These lasers exhibit significantly higher Q&#8208;factors, higher gain coefficients, superior stabilities, and lower thresholds than those of Rhodamine B. Additionally, unity&#8208;CQDs demonstrate single&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation bright fluorescent imaging in biological staining. Furthermore, they can be combined with various polymer materials for solid&#8208;state vivid fluorescence applications including flexible high&#8208;transparent films, textiles, artwares, and high&#8208;precise micron&#8208;scale 3D printings. The research findings presented herein will contribute significantly toward the development and practical utilization of multicolor CQDs exhibiting ultra&#8208;high PLQYs and FBs.

         <title>Passively Ultra Cooling Patch Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Power&#8208;Water Cogeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photovoltaics are the most viable solar energy technology. This work introduces an ultra&#8208;cooling patch (UCP) for passive thermal management of PV, achieving a 28% increase in power density and a water production rate of 2.2 L day&#8722;1. The enhancement results from the aligned channels and configurable heat transfer pathways of the UCP, which significantly improve thermal dissipation performance.








Abstract
Photovoltaic (PV) systems, which accounted for 75% of global renewable energy capacity in 2023, are limited by the substantial waste heat generated through the photothermal effect, reducing both electricity generation efficiency and panel longevity. In this work, a passive cooling strategy using an ultra&#8208;cooling patch (UCP) that effectively cools down the PV panel is presented, thus achieving an exceptionally high cooling power of nearly 700&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and facilitating the recovery of over 70% of waste heat for freshwater production. The flexibility and adhesive properties of UCP allow for easy integration with various PV configurations, including flexible panels. In addition, the UCP can be easily reconfigured into a fined structure, enabling modifications to the heat transfer pathway. This passively intensifies the heat dissipation of the PV panel, further enhancing the cooling performance. As a result, a remarkable temperature reduction of 29&#160;&#176;C for the PV panel is achieved, which in turn results in an impressive increase in maximum power density of over 28%. Moreover, outdoor experiments on a &#8776;1&#160;m2 PV panel validated the cooling performance and practical applicability. This study offers a solution with commercial potential to relieve the energy&#8208;water crisis, owing to its high efficiency, scalability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Driven Allosteric and Self&#8208;Encapsulating Polymers for Tumor&#8208;Specific Fluorescence Imaging and Dual&#8208;Enzymatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimetic fluorescent polymer is constructed through Cu2&#8314; chelation, exhibiting conformational transition, fluorescence quenching, and self&#8208;folding encapsulation properties. Under GSH&#8208;triggered reductive conditions, it enables FRET&#8208;mediated visualization of drug release, alongside dual enzymatic activity for tumor imaging. 








Abstract
Metal ion&#8208;mediated redox process and protein folding are fundamental to numerous physiological functions. However, the mechanisms underlying copper ion interactions with macromolecules remain insufficiently understood, and the therapeutic potential of polymer&#8208;copper complexes is largely underexplored. Here, a biomimetic metallopolymer is reported in which copper ion coordination induces a conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix, accompanied by oxidative self&#8208;encapsulation and fluorescence quenching. By leveraging the tunable intrinsic fluorescence of the polymer, the first systematic elucidation of the coordination interaction mechanism between polythiols and copper ions is presented. This interaction enhances the structural stability, catalytic efficiency, membrane activity, and drug loading capacity. Furthermore, the polymer&#8208;copper complex demonstrates tumor&#8208;activated fluorescence and dual enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities, enabling precise tumor imaging and multimodal therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work provides new insights into the interactions between macromolecules and metal ions and establishes a versatile and intelligent nanosystem for advanced disease diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>3D Spatiotemporal Electrophysiology of Cardiac Organoids Using Shell Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D spatiotemporal activation and conduction velocity mapping of whole cardiac organoids of various sizes is demonstrated using a novel organoid&#8208;encapsulating shell microelectrode array (MEA). The device's programmable shape transformation enables noninvasive, conformal, and stable contact with suspended organoids, facilitating long&#8208;term electrophysiological monitoring with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. The shell MEA is optically transparent and fabricated entirely on&#8208;chip using standard photolithographic techniques, enabling simultaneous optical imaging and scalable high&#8208;throughput manufacturing.








Abstract
Cardiac organoids have emerged as powerful platforms for modeling human heart development and disease. However, traditional 2D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are limited to planar recordings and fail to capture the 3D propagation of electrical signals. Here, programmable, shape&#8208;adaptive, organoid&#8208;encapsulating shell MEAs are presented as a technology that enables comprehensive 3D electrophysiological mapping. These on&#8208;chip&#8208;fabricated devices feature customizable geometries and electrode layouts tailored to an organoid's unique morphology. Shell MEAs generate high&#8208;resolution 3D isochrone and conduction velocity maps, unveiling long&#8208;term spatiotemporal field potential dynamics in spontaneously beating organoids. Furthermore, they integrate multiple modalities, such as&#160;calcium imaging&#160;to corroborate electrophysiological findings and pharmacological screening to assess organoid responses to isoproterenol, E&#8208;4031, and serotonin. This platform represents a significant advance in bioelectronic interfaces, enabling high&#8208;content 3D spatiotemporal functional analysis for cardiac disease modeling and pharmacological testing.

         <title>Photodegradable, Self&#8208;Healing, and Soft&#8208;Tough Transparent Elastomers Via Zinc Coordination for Transient Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper written by Ni and coworkers reports an effective molecular design strategy for simultaneously achieving excellent mechanical strength, toughness, softness, self&#8208;healing, and photodegradation of elastomers, which is highly desired for soft transient electronics applications. As a proof of concept, the resultant Zn&#8208;MDPU film is combined with liquid metal to construct a stretchable conductor for signal sensing.








Abstract
Transient electronics have emerged as a promising way to mitigate electronic pollution. However, developing soft transient electronics with practical potential to recover mechanical properties, restore sensing signals during operation, and rapidly vanish under specific external stimulation remains challenging. Herein, a molecular design strategy is proposed based on Zn2&#8314;&#8208;coordinated oxime&#8208;carbamate groups to simultaneously enhance mechanical strength, toughness, self&#8208;healing, and photodegradation performance in soft polyurethane elastomers (Zn&#8208;MDPU). Compared with MDPU elastomers without Zn2+ coordination interactions, the mechanical strength and toughness of Zn&#8208;MDPU elastomers are enhanced 3.8&#8208; and 16&#8208;fold, respectively, without any deterioration in their softness. The Zn2+ ions facilitate both the dynamic exchange of oxime&#8208;carbamate units, to enable efficient self&#8208;healing at room temperature, and the homolytic scission of weak N&#9472;O bonds within these groups for photodegradation. Application of Zn&#8208;MDPU elastomers coated with liquid metal is demonstrated through a patterned flexible transient conductor for human&#8211;machine interaction and health monitoring, along with the development of a self&#8208;healing triboelectric nanogenerator for mechanical energy harvesting. The proposed molecular design strategy opens vast possibilities for developing soft transient materials for wearable electronics applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Water&#8208;Based Metamaterial Absorber for Ultrabroadband Radar Stealth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the hierarchical porous architecture of Pachliopta aristolochiae butterfly wings and leveraging the intrinsic dielectric dispersion of water, a biomimetic water&#8208;based metamaterial absorber is proposed. Simulation and experiments show that the absorber has properties of ultra&#8208;broadband performance, angular stability, and scalable fabrication, can be used for adaptive camouflage, electromagnetic shielding, and multispectral stealth technologies.








Abstract
Inspired by the hierarchical porous architecture of Pachliopta aristolochiae butterfly wings and leveraging the intrinsic dielectric dispersion of water, it proposes a biomimetic water&#8208;based metamaterial absorber. Breaking conventional compactness&#8208;bandwidth trade&#8208;offs, this work integrates aqueous metamaterials with bio&#8208;inspired architecture, combining butterfly&#8208;derived hierarchical porosity and water's dielectric dispersion to achieve unprecedented microwave absorption. The absorber employs hexagonal water cavities in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix, mimicking butterfly&#8208;wing multiscale pores to extend wave paths through cascaded resonances. Water serves as &#8220;artificial melanin,&#8221; enabling tunable dielectric loss via molecular relaxation, with absorption dynamically adjusted through water column height/temperature for frequency&#8208;shifting and bandwidth broadening. The centrosymmetric geometry ensures polarization insensitivity and wide&#8208;angle stability. Optimized aqueous unit coupling achieves &gt;95% experimentally verified absorption (17.11&#8211;35.74&#160;GHz) and &gt;10&#160;dB simulated radar cross section (RCS) reduction. Experimental validation shows that the measured absorptivity is in high agreement with the simulation results. Unlike rigid multilayered alternatives, this water&#8208;PDMS architecture offers optical transparency, flexibility, and inherent fluidic tunability for functional reconfiguration. With advantages in ultra&#8208;broadband performance, angular stability, and scalable fabrication, the proposed absorber opens new avenues for adaptive camouflage, electromagnetic shielding, and multispectral stealth technologies.

Simulation and experiments show that the absorber has properties of ultra-broadband performance, angular stability, and scalable fabrication, can be used for adaptive camouflage, electromagnetic shielding, and multispectral stealth technologies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the hierarchical porous architecture of Pachliopta aristolochiae butterfly wings and leveraging the intrinsic dielectric dispersion of water, it proposes a biomimetic water-based metamaterial absorber. Breaking conventional compactness-bandwidth trade-offs, this work integrates aqueous metamaterials with bio-inspired architecture, combining butterfly-derived hierarchical porosity and water's dielectric dispersion to achieve unprecedented microwave absorption. The absorber employs hexagonal water cavities in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix, mimicking butterfly-wing multiscale pores to extend wave paths through cascaded resonances. Water serves as &#8220;artificial melanin,&#8221; enabling tunable dielectric loss via molecular relaxation, with absorption dynamically adjusted through water column height/temperature for frequency-shifting and bandwidth broadening. The centrosymmetric geometry ensures polarization insensitivity and wide-angle stability. Optimized aqueous unit coupling achieves &amp;gt;95% experimentally verified absorption (17.11&#8211;35.74&#160;GHz) and &amp;gt;10&#160;dB simulated radar cross section (RCS) reduction. Experimental validation shows that the measured absorptivity is in high agreement with the simulation results. Unlike rigid multilayered alternatives, this water-PDMS architecture offers optical transparency, flexibility, and inherent fluidic tunability for functional reconfiguration. With advantages in ultra-broadband performance, angular stability, and scalable fabrication, the proposed absorber opens new avenues for adaptive camouflage, electromagnetic shielding, and multispectral stealth technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemically Cation&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Phase Conversion for Consecutively Tunable Electromagnetic Wave Response</title>

         <dc:description>
A device with a sandwich&#8208;structured configuration of metal mesh@HxWO3/H2SO4/hollow graphite is designed, in which an electrochemically cation&#8208;induced three phase conversion in HxWO3 could dynamically modify the electrical structure of HxWO3 and create a mass of dipoles by the intercalation and accumulation of the external cations in the host structure, thereby enhancing the overall dynamic response capabilities of electromagnetic wave.








Abstract
Tunable electromagnetic wave responses are increasingly attracting attention in the realm of integrated electronics. However, the modulation flexibility and reliability are limited in the current electromagnetic shielding materials. In this study, a device with a sandwich&#8208;structured configuration of metal mesh@HxWO3/H2SO4/hollow graphite is designed to enable dynamic response and precise control for electromagnetic waves (EMWs). In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulation revealed that the electrochemically controlled cation intercalation preferentially triggers the reversible conversion of HxWO3 from the monoclinic phase (M&#8208;phase) to the tetragonal phase (T&#8208;phase), and subsequently to the cubic phase (C&#8208;phase) by voltage management, which leads to a successive increase in valence electrons and enhancement in conductivity for precisely modulating reflection shielding efficiency of the incident EMWs. Furthermore, the intercalation and accumulation of the external cations produce a mass of dipoles in the crystal HxWO3 host structure, which further enhances the dielectric performances of materials and the dissipation capability of incident EMWs, and thus improves the electromagnetic absorption shielding effectiveness. Consequently, the outstanding modulation capability &#916;: 42.36 dB) and consecutively tunable intensity (from 10.98 to 53.34 dB) of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness is realized, which provides a more remarkable technology for adapting to demanding environments through the dynamical regulation of EMWs.

         <title>Without Contact Resistance, Proteins in Thin&#8208;Film Solid&#8208;State Junctions Can Be Efficient Electronic Conducting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that contact resistance is effectively eliminated in two&#8208;probe micropore device metal/protein/metal bioelectronic junctions. These results, using two different protein types in these junctions, show that, as ultrathin (&lt;40 nm) films, proteins are an even more efficient electronic transport medium than previously thought, when the contact resistance is still included in measurements.








Abstract
The solid&#8208;state protein junctions have shown efficient electron transport over a few tens of nanometer lengthscale. This work demonstrates, how the contact resistance (RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$) of a solid&#8208;state protein junctions, treated as a contact&#8208;limited process, which can be extracted quantitatively from the measured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero&#8208;length resistance and series resistance (RS). Alternating current (impedance spectroscopy) and direct current measurements are used to examine charge transport in junctions of human serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying thicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si&#8211;Au, Au&#8211;eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), and, in a micropore device (MpD), Au&#8211;Pd, are compared. While Si&#8211;Au and Au&#8211;EGaIn junctions exhibit substantial RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$ that are ascribed to interfacial oxides and electrostatic protein&#8211;electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$, enabling measuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The exponential length&#8208;dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (&#946;) that varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact engineering. By minimizing RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$, exceptionally low &#946; values (&#8776;0.7&#8211;1.1 nm&#8722;1) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.

         <title>An Activable Photosensitizer for Sunshine&#8208;Driven Photodynamic Therapy Against Multiple&#8208;Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria by Exploiting Macrophage Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
There has been a vision of conducting therapy using sunlight since the beginning of human civilization. This study develops a novel photodynamic therapy paradigm that, for the first time, uses sunlight to treat bacterial infections. It provides a simple, safe, and effective treatment for systemic bacterial infections in immunocompromised hosts, achieving a 100% cure rate in mouse and rabbit models. 








Abstract
Aiming to improve photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#160;safety and specificity at the in vivo level, a new concept is proposed by combining the chemotaxis and circulating ability of macrophages with the controllable therapeutic efficiency of PDT. Moreover, an irradiation strategy is utilized of sunbathing to conduct PDT. Specifically, an inflammation&#8208;activable photosensitizer (Lyso710A) based on NIR BODIPY is designed and loaded it into macrophages. These &#8220;armed&#8221; macrophages are then transferred into the infected host to capture bacteria and transport them to the surface of the skin through blood circulation, where sunlight can penetrate. Upon capturing bacteria, the photodynamic effect of Lyso710A is turned on by the macrophage's endogenous hypochlorous acid (HClO). When these macrophages reach the epidermis, the bacteria are eradicated by the photodynamic effect of the activated photosensitizer during exposure to sunlight. Furthermore, this strategy demonstrates promising therapeutic efficacy in two animal models (mouse and rabbit) with systemic bacterial infection, using a low photosensitizer dose of 0.14&#160;mg&#160;Kg&#8722;1 in animals. This work demonstrates an intelligent and promising approach to breaking the routine of PDT and, for the first time, executing PDT for deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection simply by bathing in the sunshine.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Multiphase Engineering Enables Superior Broadband Infrared Emissivity in High&#8208;Entropy Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing entropy&#8208;driven phase engineering in high&#8208;entropy spinel oxides, three crystalline phases are stabilized into a robust multiphase network. This engineered architecture introduces abundant defects, interfacial mismatches, and localized strain, which narrow the bandgap and enhance carrier excitation, yielding near&#8208;blackbody emissivity across 0.78&#8211;16 &#181;m &#8212; ideal for next&#8208;generation radiative thermal management applications.








Abstract
Efficient infrared (IR) thermal management is crucial for advanced industrial and aerospace heat management. However, achieving stable, broadband emissivity across 0.78&#8211;16&#160;&#181;m, particularly at high temperatures, remains challenging. Herein, an entropy&#8208;driven phase&#8208;engineering strategy is presented that enables synergistic enhancement of broadband IR emissivity in high&#8208;entropy spinel oxides. By systematically tuning La doping, controlled coexistence of three intimately coupled crystalline phases is achieved. Multi&#8208;scale structural and atomic&#8208;level analyses reveal dense phase boundaries, abundant defects, and pronounced lattice strains, which together induce bandgap narrowing and facilitate efficient free carrier transitions in the short&#8208;wavelength IR regime. Simultaneously, the intricate network of phase interfaces and local lattice disorders intensifies phonon vibrations, resulting in enhanced lattice vibration absorption in the mid&#8208;to&#8208;long wavelength region. Consequently, the multiphase oxide achieves a robust emissivity of 0.91 across 0.78&#8211;16&#160;&#181;m and retains high performance after prolonged exposure to 900 &#176;C. When applied as coatings, even higher emissivity (up to 0.95) and excellent mechanical durability are achieved. Compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art emitters, these entropy&#8208;stabilized ceramics uniquely integrate broadband high emissivity, thermal stability, and mechanical robustness. The findings provide fundamental insights into entropy&#8208;enabled multiphase synergy and establish a framework for next&#8208;generation radiative thermal management materials in extreme environments.

However, achieving stable, broadband emissivity across 0.78&#8211;16&#160;&#181;m, particularly at high temperatures, remains challenging. Herein, an entropy-driven phase-engineering strategy is presented that enables synergistic enhancement of broadband IR emissivity in high-entropy spinel oxides. By systematically tuning La doping, controlled coexistence of three intimately coupled crystalline phases is achieved. Multi-scale structural and atomic-level analyses reveal dense phase boundaries, abundant defects, and pronounced lattice strains, which together induce bandgap narrowing and facilitate efficient free carrier transitions in the short-wavelength IR regime. Simultaneously, the intricate network of phase interfaces and local lattice disorders intensifies phonon vibrations, resulting in enhanced lattice vibration absorption in the mid-to-long wavelength region. Consequently, the multiphase oxide achieves a robust emissivity of 0.91 across 0.78&#8211;16&#160;&#181;m and retains high performance after prolonged exposure to 900 &#176;C. When applied as coatings, even higher emissivity (up to 0.95) and excellent mechanical durability are achieved. Compared to state-of-the-art emitters, these entropy-stabilized ceramics uniquely integrate broadband high emissivity, thermal stability, and mechanical robustness. The findings provide fundamental insights into entropy-enabled multiphase synergy and establish a framework for next-generation radiative thermal management materials in extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant Circular Dichroism in Proximitized WS2 Spin&#8208;Valley Transistors for Complementary Optoelectronics and Reconfigurable Logics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2&#8208;based spin&#8208;valley transistors are developed with notable circular dichroic photocurrent, benefited from the proximity coupling from magnetic substrates and spin&#8208;selectivity of spin tunneling electrodes. Complementary phototransistors can be developed by reversing the spin polarization of magnets. These devices are used to build reconfigurable optoelectronic NOT, NAND, and NOR gates for optical switching and all&#8208;optical computing applications.








Abstract
The coupling of valley and spin degrees of freedom in 2D materials holds significant promise for advancing novel device applications. In this study, a highly polarized spin&#8208;valley transistor based on the circular dichroic photocurrent in WS2 is demonstrated. By integrating highly spin&#8208;selective tunneling spin detectors and leveraging the magnetic proximity effect of spin&#8208;polarized substrates, the spin degeneracy in optical transition and spin transport can be broken. A giant photocurrent polarization of 41.90% is realized at room temperature under ultraviolet light irradiation. Interestingly, the sign of the circular dichroism can be reversed by switching the magnetization of substrates and electrodes, showing an opposite resistance state under circularly polarized light. This device has removed the hurdle for developing complementary phototransistors (as they are always in low&#8208;resistance states under light illumination), which are further exploited to construct reconfigurable logic gates. The findings will pave the way for new developments in optical couplers and on&#8208;chip optical computing technologies.

         <title>Adaptive and Multifunctional Emulsion Solar Evaporators with High Operating Stability in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;like Pickering emulsion solar evaporator is developed for the first time, which enables continuous, stable, and ultrahigh&#8208;rate water evaporation under harsh conditions, including oil contamination, high salinity, and bacteria, while offering self&#8208;cleaning, pollutant degradation, and recyclability. This multifunctional and adaptable platform provides a transformative solution for sustainable clean water production in complex environments.








Abstract
Global water scarcity and pollution demand innovative solutions for sustainable clean water production. While interfacial solar evaporation holds great promise, current evaporators face significant challenges in achieving stable clean water&#160;productivity under harsh conditions. Here, a highly adaptive, liquid&#8208;like, multifunctional Pickering emulsion solar evaporator is developed, which can be formed in situ on oil&#8208;contaminated water or preconstructed with optimized rheological properties for flexible and scalable deployment. The resulting emulsion evaporator exhibits multidirectional water transport pathways, enhanced thermal localization, controllable salt deposition, and gravity&#8208;assisted self&#8208;cleaning capabilities. During operation, this evaporator can actively integrate oil contaminants into its emulsion structure without compromising efficiency, while inhibiting salt accumulation, realizing stable, long&#8208;term ultrahigh&#8208;rate evaporation (12.5&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) even in hypersaline (26&#160;wt.%) conditions under elevated solar irradiation intensity (11 kW cm&#8722;2). It also degrades organic pollutants (e.g., nearly 100% phenol removal), deactivates bacteria, and prevents biofouling. Its phase transformation capability enables easy recovery and recycling, further enhancing practicality and sustainability. This study overcomes the limitations of conventional solid&#8208;state solar evaporators, offering a versatile platform for clean water production in challenging environments.

         <title>Photogenerated Carrier Reconstructed Ion Concentration Gradients for Moisture Electricity Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a photon moisture electricity generator (P&#8208;MEG) that leverages a coupling of photovoltaic and hydrovoltaic effects to reconstruct the ion concentration gradient under illumination, effectively addressing ion saturation and enhancing the long&#8208;term stability of moisture&#8208;based energy harvesters.








Abstract
Although moisture electricity generators (MEG), which enable conversion of atmospheric moisture into electricity, have attracted great attention, the long&#8208;term moisture absorption of MEG leads to the saturation of ion concentration gradient and the decreased ion migration rate, seriously reducing the output performance. In this work, this bottleneck of MEG is addressed by constructing a photon moisture electricity generator (P&#8208;MEG) with a photosensitive layer electrode, and the synergistic coupling of photovoltaic and hydrovoltaic effects is realized. The photogenerated carriers in photosensitive layer convert H+ on the photosensitive layer into H2, resulting in a reconstructed H+ concentration gradient between the two electrodes of P&#8208;MEG. The direct detection of H2 by gas chromatography and the increase of the pH from 0.26 to 2.11 under illumination both prove the H+ gradient reconstruction mechanism. The results show that under 80% relative humidity (RH), the illumination increases the P&#8208;MEG output voltage from 0.55 to 0.65&#160;V the current density from 17.5 to 34.5&#160;&#181;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the power density from 8.26 to 26.7 &#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Present work provides a strategy to enhance the long&#8208;term stability of MEG devices.

         <title>Structural Phase Separation and Enhanced Superconductivity in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 Under Uniaxial Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniaxial strain is used to tune electronic, structural, and magnetic order in a copper oxide superconductor. Application of a moderate uniaxial strain condition across the low&#8208;temperature orthorhombic&#8208;to&#8208;tetragonal transition creates a condition that disrupts the usual stripe ordering. The result is phase separation into three distinct structural phases, characterized by enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.








Abstract
Strain engineering has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its capability in tuning lattice and electronic structures of quantum materials. Using moderate uniaxial compressive strain, structural phase separation is induced in the low&#8208;temperature phase of x = 1/8 La2&#8722;xBaxCuO4$\rm La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}$ (LBCO) single crystals. These structures are low temperature tetragonal (LTT), low temperature less orthorhombic (LTLO), and a plastically deformed nano&#8208;domain structure (PDNS), comprised of few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized orthorhombic domains within an amorphous matrix. These three structures exhibit distinct superconducting behaviors. The volume fraction of the LTT structure is suppressed with increasing strain, while its superconducting transition temperature increases and broadens. The LTLO structure exhibits a sharp superconducting transition above 32&#160;K, which increases up to &#8776;&#8201;36&#160;K at maximum strain. The PDNS phase exhibits a very broad superconducting transition and persists even after removing the strain. This study illustrates the sensitivity of superconductivity to the structure of the LBCO sample near its stripe&#160;instability.

         <title>Mechanically Compliant and Impedance Matching Hydrogel Bioelectronics for Low&#8208;Voltage Peripheral Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel bioelectronics for low&#8208;voltage peripheral neuromodulation: Selfcurling hydrogel bioelectronics establish a multifunctional platform for lowvoltage peripheral neuromodulation, enabling tailored designs to accommodate diverse nerve curvatures through precise geometric optimization. These devices seamlessly integrate with neural tissues and are validated in a rat stroke model, demonstrating precise neuromodulation achieved via low&#8208;current stimulation.








Abstract
In neural biointerfacing technologies, mitigating the mismatch in mechanical and impedance attributes between neural tissues and bioelectronics remains a central challenge for achieving high&#8208;efficacy neuromodulation. Here, full&#8208;hydrogel bioelectronics that demonstrate superior mechanical compliance and impedance matching with 3D peripheral nerves, allowing for low&#8208;voltage vagus nerve stimulation, are reported. By precisely tuning the dimensional parameters through 3D printing, the hydrogel bioelectronics, initially in a 2D planar form in a dehydrated state, can curl spontaneously around nerves and form a seamless interface. During the hydration process, instant, and tough bioadhesion is achieved through a dry crosslinking mechanism, enabling a mechanically robust nerve&#8208;electrode interface to resist dynamic yet vigorous deformations of the peripheral nerve systems. The as&#8208;formed nerve&#8208;electrode interface significantly mitigates the impedance mismatch, in favor of electrical stimulation at a threshold voltage of 10 mV, one order of magnitude lower than that of conventional metallic electrodes. The use of the hydrogel bioelectronics for successful stroke rehabilitation through low&#8208;voltage vagus nerve stimulation in a rat model is also&#160;demonstrated.

         <title>Thermoresponsive Hydrogel with Thermal Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally plastic hydrogels (TP&#8208;gels) encode thermal history via temperature&#8208;dependent polymer&#8211;water miscibility; elastic networks store memory, and elasticity&#8208;constrained demixing actuates opacity. Unlike conventional thermoresponsive gels with a fixed critical temperature (Tc), TP&#8208;gels modulate Tc through thermal training, delivering programmable, equilibrium&#8208;driven phase behavior and swelling&#8208;history&#8208;dependent transitions.








Abstract
Thermal plasticity&#8212;the capacity to dynamically reconfigure material properties in response to thermal history&#8212;is a hallmark of biological systems that remains elusive in synthetic hydrogels. Inspired by coral symbiont acclimatization, thermally plastic hydrogels (TP&#8208;gels) based on polyvinyl butyral are reported, which emulate biological thermal memory through a bioinspired feedback loop: thermoresponsive equilibrium swelling encodes thermal history, while elastic network constraints translate this memory into programmable phase transition thresholds (Tc). By exploiting temperature&#8208;dependent polymer&#8208;water miscibility, TP&#8208;gels achieve multi&#8208;stable states through adaptive swelling, enabling reversible opacity transitions with Tc shifts of 3&#8211;7&#160;&#176;C per thermal training cycle. Crucially, elasticity&#8208;mediated suppression of spinodal decomposition stabilizes metastable states during thermal encoding, preventing premature phase separation. This plasticity is leveraged for cryptographic applications, demonstrating sequential information decryption via thermal trajectory programming&#8212;where spatially resolved&#160;Tc&#160;gradients serve as thermodynamic keys. This work establishes a paradigm for materials with embodied environmental intelligence, bridging the divide between biological adaptability and synthetic systems through thermodynamic metastability engineering.

         <title>Click Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Fixation Catalysis for Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;inspired molecular catalyst enables both iodine fixation and dynamic redox catalysis in aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. The Fe&#8208;Cp catalyst forms robust Fe&#9472;I bonds and promotes axial electron transfer, suppressing shuttle effects and accelerating reaction kinetics. This dual mechanism delivers ultralong cycling stability and high&#8208;capacity pouch cells.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising candidates for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective energy storage, yet their practical deployment is hindered by severe polyiodide shuttling and limited redox kinetics. To overcome this bottleneck at its core, a molecular&#8208;level fixation catalysis strategy&#8212;inspired by click chemistry principles is presented&#8212;that transcends the limitations of conventional adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis. Inspired by the selectivity and efficiency of click reactions, a Cp(Fe(CO)2)2&#8208;derived molecular catalyst (Fe&#8208;Cp) is designed that forms directional and robust Fe&#9472;I coordination bonds, locking iodine species into stable Fe&#8208;CpI complexes. Beyond anchoring, Fe&#8208;Cp uniquely enables axial electron transfer, facilitating reversible charge redistribution and dynamic iodine redox conversion beyond the reach of surface&#8208;confined systems. This dual&#8208;function mechanism not only suppresses the polyiodide shuttle but also dynamically regulates the electron redistribution at the catalytic interface, fundamentally enhancing reaction kinetics. Benefiting from this design, the Zn&#8211;I2 batteries deliver an exceptional cycling lifespan of 63&#160;000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1 with 95% capacity retention and &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency. Remarkably, even under a high mass loading of 20&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 in pouch Zn&#8211;I2 cells, the system maintains a high areal capacity of 3.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 and &#8776;100% capacity retention even after 2000 cycles.

Abstract
With the rapid advancement of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics, multifunctional hydrogels with an emphasis on environmental sustainability have attracted growing attention. In this work, a starch&#8208;based hydrogel featuring a multi&#8208;bond network structure&#8212;composed of amylopectin, polyvinyl alcohol, borax, and MXene nanosheets&#8212;is prepared via a simple, scalable kneading method using a roller machine. The reversible crosslinking from hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with MXene nanosheets acting as stress&#8208;transfer centers, endow the hydrogel with exceptional stretchability (&#8764;6151%), high electrical conductivity, fast self&#8208;healing, and strong adhesion. The resulting capacitive sensor exhibits high sensitivity (gauge factor = 1.1), a broad sensing range (up to 300%), and excellent durability, allowing accurate detection of physiological signals. It also enables Morse code&#8208;based encryption of letters, numbers, and punctuation, highlighting its potential in wearable and secure communication technologies. Notably, the hydrogel biodegrades in natural soil within 20 days, addressing electronic waste concerns. This study presents a recyclable, high&#8208;performance hydrogel with broad application prospects in flexible electronics, healthcare monitoring, and assistive communication.

         <title>Nano/Micro Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Ceramics for Sustainable Energy Saving/Capturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;fired ceramics integrate MOF&#8208;derived hierarchical alumina particles within a glass matrix. This design achieves excellent solar reflectance and thermal emittance, enabling dual functions: building energy conservation and enhanced photovoltaic efficiency. This work advances large&#8208;scale production of passive radiative cooling materials for sustainable energy solutions, accelerating the global transition to climate&#8208;neutral infrastructure.








Abstract
To combat the global energy crisis, passive radiative cooling materials provide more sustainable solutions to save energy for cooling buildings and capture renewable energy for powering them. However, the design of passive radiative cooling materials is subject to a trade&#8208;off between solar reflectance and practicality. To overcome this dilemma, a low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;firing ceramic is reported that integrates hierarchically structured alumina particles&#8212;derived from nano/micro metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8212;within a glass matrix. These alumina particles enhance light backscattering by utilizing optimized geometric parameters and high porosity to achieve near&#8208;perfect solar reflectance (&gt;0.98), while the glass matrix ensures high long&#8208;wave infrared emittance (0.93).

&lt;p&gt;Low-temperature co-fired ceramics integrate MOF-derived hierarchical alumina particles within a glass matrix. This design achieves excellent solar reflectance and thermal emittance, enabling dual functions: building energy conservation and enhanced photovoltaic efficiency. This work advances large-scale production of passive radiative cooling materials for sustainable energy solutions, accelerating the global transition to climate-neutral infrastructure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat the global energy crisis, passive radiative cooling materials provide more sustainable solutions to save energy for cooling buildings and capture renewable energy for powering them. However, the design of passive radiative cooling materials is subject to a trade-off between solar reflectance and practicality. To overcome this dilemma, a low-temperature co-firing ceramic is reported that integrates hierarchically structured alumina particles&#8212;derived from nano/micro metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8212;within a glass matrix. These alumina particles enhance light backscattering by utilizing optimized geometric parameters and high porosity to achieve near-perfect solar reflectance (&amp;gt;0.98), while the glass matrix ensures high long-wave infrared emittance (0.93). This synergy enables a maximum sub-ambient temperature reduction of 7.4&#160;&#176;C during the daytime and a midday short-circuit current boost of 10.46 mA. Global simulations project a net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission reduction of 1.43 billion metric tons through reducing cooling demands and enhancing photovoltaic output. Combined with robust mechanical strength (43 MPa), UV resistance (&amp;gt;2000 h), superhydrophobicity (150&#176; water contact angle, maintaining an exceptional solar reflectance of 0.97), flame resistance (&amp;gt;1000&#160;&#176;C tolerance), and near-100% recyclability, this low-cost and scalable ceramic provides an effective strategy to accelerate the global transition toward climate-neutral infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible and Dynamic Interfacial Desolvation in High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte for Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy flexible electrolyte (HEFE) with imbalanced H2O coordination enables mixed Zn2+ solvation (Zn(H2O)m2+, m &#8804; 6) and disordered water networks, boosting ionic conductivity and suppressing H2 evolution. It achieves 3500 h Zn cycling at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 and, with I2@C cathodes, enables solid&#8211;solid redox (3600 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). The strategy also works for Mn2&#8314;, showing broad potential for multivalent batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion technologies, but the intrinsic hydrogen&#8208;down orientation of interfacial water under negative bias, together with ion depletion at the electrode surface, promotes inhomogeneous Zn plating and substantial hydrogen evolution. Here, a high&#8208;entropy flexible electrolyte (HEFE) is demonstrated that leverages the fast water&#8208;exchange kinetics of Li&#8314;, K&#8314;, and Cs&#8314;. By deliberately inducing cation&#8208;hydration disequilibrium, the HEFE forms flexible Zn(H2O)m2+ (m &#8804; 6) solvation structures embedded in a disordered water network, enhancing ionic conductivity and alleviating ion&#8208;transport limitations. Under cathodic bias, a progressive desolvation from Zn(H2O)62+ to Zn(H2O)x2+ (x &#8804; 5) proceeds while retaining aqueous disorder, thereby suppressing hydrogen evolution and enabling 3500 h of deep cycling at 1 mA cm&#8722;2/3 mAh cm&#8722;2. For iodine cathodes, the HEFE induces a pathway shift from the conventional I&#8722;&#8594;I2 route to a solid&#8211;solid (CsI&#8594;I2) conversion, fundamentally inhibiting iodide shuttling and extending full&#8208;cell life to 3600 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Beyond Zn, the solvation&#8208;heterogeneity strategy opens avenues for reversible multivalent electrochemistry and advancing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Ni&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) Reaction Energy Barrier Regulation in Passive Film for Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate with Cr, enhancing the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film, and achieving excellent anode stability in industrial seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis offers a promising route for green hydrogen production, but anode corrosion by chloride (Cl&#8722;) and bromide (Br&#8722;) ions hinders its practicality. Although effective catalyst modification strategies have been developed to mitigate Cl&#8722;&#8208;induced corrosion, the extensive spallation of the catalyst layer caused by accumulated Br&#8722; highlights the urgent need to address co&#8208;corrosion by both Br&#8722; and Cl&#8722;. Here, a Ni&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate to enhance the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film. Theoretical simulations predict that NiCr alloy has substantial potential as an anode substrate. Experimental results further demonstrate that the unique passive film of NiCr can resist both Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, with a much higher pitting potential compared to alternative materials, effectively preventing harmful Br&#8722;&#8208;induced lateral corrosion. As validation, a typical NiFe&#8208;LDH catalyst grown on a NiCr mesh exhibits over 15 times the stability of the same catalyst on a Ni mesh, achieving &gt;2000 h of stability in concentrated seawater and &gt;1000 h of stable operation at 60&#160;&#176;C in an industrial electrolyzer device.

         <title>Chiral Noncovalent Peptide Glasses for Highly Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral noncovalent peptide glasses with high transparency, large size, and self&#8208;healing are constructed via an ambient supramolecular&#8208;coordination synergistic strategy. These glasses exhibit high and tunable circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 0.29) and multi&#8208;modal encryption, paving the way for sustainable photonic security materials.








Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based noncovalent glasses exhibit natural origins, green synthesis conditions, and self&#8208;healing properties, representing a promising sustainable alternative to conventional glasses. However, developing chiral noncovalent peptide glasses with highly circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is still a challenging task. Herein, a supramolecular&#8208;coordination synergistic induced strategy is reported for constructing enantiomeric noncovalent peptide glasses from carnosine (Car) enantiomers and metal ions (Zn2+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Gd3+) under ambient conditions. The resulting chiral Car(M) peptide glasses not only exhibit high optical transparency (&gt;90%), large sizes, easily processable shapes, and high ambient self&#8208;healing performances, but also show programmable multicolor emission, chiral amplification, and full&#8208;spectrum CPL encoding. Due to the synergistic metal coordination and hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular interactions, the obtained chiral Car(M) glasses reveal record&#8208;high and tunable CPL with dissymmetry factors (|glum|) up to 0.29. Leveraging the high transparency and multicolor chiral emission of Car(M) glasses, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform is demonstrated including flexible multicolor QR codes, filter&#8208;resolved patterns, polarization&#8208;sensitive Morse codes, and programmable dot&#8208;array encryption. This work fabricates new chiral noncovalent peptide glasses that exhibit rapid self&#8208;healing capabilities and high, tunable CPL performance, thereby pioneering a novel avenue for chiral photonic applications.

         <title>Cooling Crystallization at Solid Interfaces en Route to a Janus Nanocatalyst</title>

A unique RuNiW/W2C Janus structure are synthesized through a cooling crystallization strategy, serving as highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for urea assisted hydrogen production.








Abstract
Hydrogen production via water electrolysis is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however replacing OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) provides a promising, energy&#8208;efficient alternative. The development of Janus electrocatalysts offers new opportunities to address the intrinsic complexity problem of the UOR, which involves multiple electron transfers.

&lt;p&gt;A unique RuNiW/W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C Janus structure are synthesized through a cooling crystallization strategy, serving as highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for urea assisted hydrogen production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen production via water electrolysis is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however replacing OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) provides a promising, energy-efficient alternative. The development of Janus electrocatalysts offers new opportunities to address the intrinsic complexity problem of the UOR, which involves multiple electron transfers. Here, a cooling crystallization strategy is reported, guided by carbophilicity differences, to synthesize multi-metallic RuNiW/W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C Janus nanoparticles as efficient catalysts for catalyzing the UOR. In the synthesis, W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C forms during the initial heating stage and serves as a substrate that promotes the exsolution and subsequent growth of the RuNiW phase upon cooling. This Janus electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding bifunctional performance, requiring only 1.40&#160;V versus RHE for the UOR and an overpotential of 133&#160;mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, it enables urea-assisted electrolyzer to operate continuously for over 200 h. Both experiments and calculations confirm that the Janus structure effectively modulates the valence state of Ni component, optimizing urea adsorption and reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This work provides a new avenue for designing highly efficient Janus electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;PARPi Conjugates Delivering USP1i for Maximizing Synthetic Lethality to Stimulate STING Pathway in High&#8208;Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer</title>

A GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticle co&#8208;delivering a USP1 inhibitor and Niraparib amplifies DNA damage and collapses homologous recombination repair. This strategy restores PARPi sensitivity, remodels the ovarian tumor microenvironment, and achieves strong synergy with immune checkpoint blockade, offering a translational nanomedicine solution for overcoming therapeutic resistance in high&#8208;grade serous ovarian cancer.








Abstract
Overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and therapeutic resistance remains a significant challenge in ovarian cancer treatment. In this study, a glutathione&#8208;responsive polymeric nanoparticle platform for the co&#8208;delivery of the USP1 inhibitor SJB3&#8208;019A and the PARP inhibitor Niraparib is developed. This system synergistically enhances DNA damage accumulation, suppresses homologous recombination repair, and robustly activate the STING signaling pathway, leading to enhanced type I interferon responses and mitigation of immune evasion. Mechanistically, USP1 inhibition significantly impairs DNA repair, amplifying the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibition and promoting immunogenic cell death. In vivo studies demonstrated precise, glutathione&#8208;responsive drug release and substantial tumor accumulation of the nanoparticles, resulting in remarkable antitumor efficacy in murine ovarian cancer models. Importantly, this combinational approach effectively remodels the tumor microenvironment by increasing CD8&#8314; T cell infiltration and enhancing tumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. This innovative strategy targeting DNA damage responses presents a promising platform for precise and effective ovarian cancer immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
This study develops a biomass dual&#8208;functional platform with chemically modified metasequoia wood, using vertical microchannels for concurrent power generation and evaporative cooling. The prototype cabin demonstrates stable performance in diverse scenarios, validated by practical tests for off&#8208;grid energy and cooling in sustainable architecture. 








Abstract
Natural materials, prized for their hierarchical microchannels, eco&#8208;friendliness, and low cost, show great promise for evaporation&#8208;driven power generation. Yet developing them into bifunctional platforms that simultaneously produce electricity and cooling remains an unmet challenge. This study demonstrates a biomass&#8208;based dual&#8208;functional platform using chemically modified metasequoia wood for concurrent electricity generation and evaporative cooling. The wood's vertically aligned microchannels enable anisotropic water transport, integrating carboxylation&#8208;modified structure with stainless steel electrodes to form a green energy device. In deionized water, it delivers &#8776;265.8 mV open&#8208;circuit voltage, &#8776;4.3 &#181;A short&#8208;circuit current, and a record &#8776;408 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2 power density&#8212;beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomass harvesters constructed via interface engineering. Its stable, adaptable performance across environments is further enhanced by circuit integration. Under solar radiation, an energy&#8208;saving cabin prototype achieves &#8776;6.1 &#176;C cooling (&#8776;857.5 W&#160;m&#8722;2) and maintains &#8776;2.1 &#176;C night&#8208;time temperature reduction. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a metasequoia wood cabin prototype, generates power and cools simultaneously. Yangzhou tests show &#8776;1580&#8211;1630 mV output and &#8776;4.9&#160;&#176;C/1.1&#160;&#176;C day/night cooling, proving sustainable architecture viability. This work innovates sustainable energy&#8208;water technologies, enabling off&#8208;grid power and passive cooling for self&#8208;sufficient architectures.

         <title>Enhancing Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Pollutant Adsorption in Advanced Oxidation Processes with Cation Vacancy&#8208;Driven Dual&#8208;Site Mn2SiO4 Catalysts</title>

Cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;driven dual active site Mn2SiO4 catalytic materials effectively activate reactive oxygen species and enhance pollutant adsorption, thereby achieving efficient oxidation degradation of recalcitrant pollutants.








Abstract
Catalytic advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising strategy for the near&#8208;complete mineralization of all&#8208;organic pollutants via the strong oxidizing power of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, practical implementation is hindered by the low ROS generation yield owing to insufficient catalytically active sites and ineffective utilization stemming from transient radical lifetimes. Herein, cation vacancy&#8208;engineered manganese silicate (V&#8208;Mn2SiO4) catalysts comprising dual reaction sites are presented, which enable the highly efficient oxidation of recalcitrant organic pollutants through the activation of peroxymonosulfate. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations confirm that Mn sites adjacent to vacancies serve as the primary active centers for peroxymonosulfate activation, whereas adjacent O sites facilitate pollutant adsorption. This dual&#8208;site configuration effectively lowers the activation energy barrier and enhances peroxymonosulfate activation and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation while optimizing the 1O2 migration distance via pollutant adsorption and enrichment. The rate constants of V&#8208;Mn2SiO4 against rhodamine B and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol pollutants are 1.171 and 0.1291 min&#8722;1, respectively, which are comparable to those reported for atomically dispersed metal nanocatalysts in AOPs. This discovery marks a breakthrough in AOPs, accelerating their practical application in environmental remediation and advancing sustainable pollution control technologies.

         <title>Understanding the Zeta Potential in Regulating Zn Deposition Kinetics for Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work evaluates the effects of the Zeta potential (ZP) of oxide nanoparticles (ONPs, i.e., MgO, SiO2, Al2O3) on enhancing the cyclic stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The screening principle for ONPs based on ZP is established when they are used in colloidal electrolytes. Specifically, the ZP&#8208;optimized SiO2 colloidal electrolyte (4Z&#8208;S) with the ZP of &#8722;28.6 mV enables rapid Zn deposition kinetics. The 4Z&#8208;S colloidal electrolyte exhibits a long&#8208;term life of 3400 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 for Zn anodes and a high capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles for a 145 mAh Zn||I2 pouch cell.








Abstract
Severe Zn2+ concentration polarization at the anode/electrolyte interface induces inhomogeneous electric field distribution on the Zn anode surface in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), causing dendrite growth and formation of &#8220;dead zinc&#8221;. Colloidal electrolytes are used to regulate Zn plating/stripping behavior. However, there is a lack of systematic and fundamental understanding of the adsorption capacity of colloidal particles for Zn2+ and Zeta potential (ZP) in optimizing Zn deposition kinetics. Herein, the ZP of oxide nanoparticles (ONPs, i.e., MgO, SiO2, Al2O3) and the adsorption energy for Zn2+ are studied to evaluate their effects on enhancing the cyclic stability of AZIBs. A Gum Arabic (GA) coating strategy on the ONPs surface is executed to eliminate the interference of the surface chemical environment for Zn2+ adsorption energy. Therefore, the screening principle for ONPs based on ZP is established when they are used in colloidal electrolytes. Specifically, the SiO2 colloidal electrolyte (4Z&#8208;S) with the ZP of &#8722;28.6&#160;mV facilitates rapid Zn deposition kinetics. Accordingly, zinc electrodes in 4Z&#8208;S electrolyte realize a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.7% and long&#8208;term life of 3400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. A 145 mAh Zn||I2 pouch cell achieves a high capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles, implying promising practical application.

The 4Z-S colloidal electrolyte exhibits a long-term life of 3400 h at 5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for Zn anodes and a high capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles for a 145 mAh Zn||I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration polarization at the anode/electrolyte interface induces inhomogeneous electric field distribution on the Zn anode surface in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs), causing dendrite growth and formation of &#8220;dead zinc&#8221;. Colloidal electrolytes are used to regulate Zn plating/stripping behavior. However, there is a lack of systematic and fundamental understanding of the adsorption capacity of colloidal particles for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Zeta potential (ZP) in optimizing Zn deposition kinetics. Herein, the ZP of oxide nanoparticles (ONPs, i.e., MgO, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and the adsorption energy for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are studied to evaluate their effects on enhancing the cyclic stability of AZIBs. A Gum Arabic (GA) coating strategy on the ONPs surface is executed to eliminate the interference of the surface chemical environment for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption energy. Therefore, the screening principle for ONPs based on ZP is established when they are used in colloidal electrolytes. Specifically, the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; colloidal electrolyte (4Z-S) with the ZP of &#8722;28.6&#160;mV facilitates rapid Zn deposition kinetics. Accordingly, zinc electrodes in 4Z-S electrolyte realize a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.7% and long-term life of 3400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A 145 mAh Zn||I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell achieves a high capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles, implying promising practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plants&#8208;Inspired Cellulose Nanocomposites&#8208;Based Soft Intelligent Actuators with Exceptional Thermal Conductivity and Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
CNFs&#8208;based composites with superior thermal conductivity and electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness are successfully prepared, featuring &#8220;mimosa&#8221;&#8208;like ordered layered architectures. Integration with liquid crystal elastomers, CNFs&#8208;based composites are constructed as smart curtains and intelligent grabbers with biomimetic actuation. Furthermore, the CNFs&#8208;based composites used as sensors based on triboelectric effect to transmit messages through Morse code, demonstrating immense potential in flexible electronic devices for soft robotics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Soft actuators with controllable responsiveness have wide application prospects in human&#8208;machine interfaces and intelligent robotics. However, the increasing integration and multi&#8208;functionality inevitably accumulate heat and radiate electromagnetic waves in electron components, detrimental to device service life and human health. Herein, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs)&#8208;based composites with excellent thermal conductivity (TC) and superior electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency (EMI SE) are prepared by layered dispersion of polyamide epichlorohydrin modified graphene nanosheets (pGNPs) within silver nanoparticles deposited CNFs through electrostatic self&#8208;assembly via vacuum filtration. The subsequent hot&#8208;pressing forms densely interconnected pGNPs within the CNFs&#8208;based composites with &#8220;mimosa&#8221;&#8208;like ordered layered architectures, showing a TC of 150.6&#160;W/(m&#160;K) and an EMI SE of 75&#160;dB. By integrating the CNFs&#8208;based composites with outstanding Joule heating performance into liquid crystal elastomers, smart curtains and intelligent grabbers are yield with a bending angle of 82&#176; under a voltage of 3&#160;V. Furthermore, the CNFs&#8208;based composite with an excellent conductivity (9.8 &#215; 103&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1) is used as an electrode to construct triboelectric nanogenerators for transmitting information through Morse code. Overall, the as&#8208;prepared CNFs&#8208;based composites can be used to prolong the life of actuators and sensors, paving the way for multi&#8208;functional wearable terminals and biomimetic actuators.

         <title>Observation of Dislocation Non&#8208;Hermitian Skin Effect in a Torus&#8208;like Acoustic Metamaterial</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waves in non&#8208;Hermitian systems can defy intuition by accumulating at specific locations rather than spreading uniformly. While conventional studies focused on boundaries, this work reports the first experimental observation of the dislocation non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect in acoustic metamaterials. Sound is shown to concentrate at one dislocation and vanish at another, unveiling a new non&#8208;Hermitian topological localization mechanism with potential for novel sound and energy control devices.








Abstract
The non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a striking phenomenon where a large number of states accumulate toward open boundaries, has garnered significant attention in both fundamental physics and emerging applications. Recent theoretical studies unveiled a distinctive dislocation NHSE by disentangling it from the established boundary NHSE, thereby bridging the gap between topological defects and non&#8208;Hermitian effects. In this work, the first experimental observation of the dislocation NHSE is reported, achieved using an ingeniously designed nonreciprocal, torus&#8208;like acoustic metamaterial with two dislocations of opposite Burgers vectors. The results show that the sound energy density inside the sample dramatically accumulates at one dislocation, while being unusually depleted at the other, a response distinct from all existing NHSE phenomena. This novel non&#8208;Hermitian effect not only probes the interplay between nontrivial defects and point&#8208;gap topology, but also holds promise for practical applications, such as the design of topological sound vacuum pumps.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis of Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Clusters Coupled with Super&#8208;Hydrophilic CeO2 Enables Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst composed of Pt&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy clusters coupled with super&#8208;hydrophilic CeO2 is developed. This coupling simultaneously enhances the intrinsic activity and accelerates the interfacial H2O dissociation kinetics for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. When integrated into an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, the system achieves low cell voltages of 1.74 V at 1 A cm&#8722;2, and can maintain its performance for at least 500 h at an industrial&#8208;level current density.








Abstract
Simultaneously enhancing the intrinsic activity and accelerating H2O dissociation kinetics is crucial for developing advanced low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal Pt&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy alloy clusters coupled with super&#8208;hydrophilic CeO2 on porous carbon support (Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;cluster/CeO2/C) is developed. The optimized Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;cluster/CeO2/C catalyst exhibits the faster Volmer&#8208;Tafel mechanism with an exceptionally low overpotential of 12.3 mV at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH, surpassing the benchmark commercial Pt/C (32.2 mV). When integrated into an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, the system achieves low cell voltages of 1.74 V at 1 A cm&#8722;2, and can maintain its performance for at least 500 h at an industrial&#8208;level current density. Operando spectroscopy and density functional theory&#160;calculations reveal that H2O preferentially adsorbs on Ce site of CeO2, while the interfacial Pt sites in contact with Ce can simultaneously act as efficient active sites for H2O dissociation, thus significantly enhancing the sluggish Volmer kinetics via Ce&#8208;Pt dual&#8208;site synergy. Concurrently, the electronic structure of surface Pt sites is synergistically regulated through the metal bonds in the HEA and interfacial Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Ce linkage, thus effectively optimizing its hydrogen adsorption free energy. This work establishes a new paradigm in synergistic catalysis between Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;clusters and CeO2 for efficient alkaline HER.

         <title>Multifunctional Buried Molecule&#8208;Bridge for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>

The 4&#8208;Bromobenzylphosphnic acid molecule is constructed as a molecular bridge connecting Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite to improve their interfacial characteristics achieving certified efficiency of 26.12% and improved stability for the resultant solar cells.








Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as an effective hole transportation layer have tremendously advanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the inhomogeneous distribution of SAMs on substrate and non&#8208;intimate interface contact can bring about significant interfacial energy loss at SAM/perovskite heterojunction. Herein, a small molecule 4&#8208;Bromobenzylphosphnic acid (4Br&#8208;BPA) is constructed as a molecule bridge connecting [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl] phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) and perovskite, exhibiting multifunctionality on improving the interfacial characteristics. First, the small&#8208;size 4Br&#8208;BPA molecules can partly fill some voids on NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz anchored with NiOx via phosphonic acid group, meanwhile ameliorating the NiOx surface state. Second, the 4Br&#8208;BPA post&#8208;deposited onto Me&#8208;4PACz interacting with Me&#8208;4PACz via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking has suppressed charge accumulation at interface, aligned the energy level of NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz consequently promoting the hole transportation. Third, the interplay between 4Br&#8208;BPA and perovskite enables effective passivation of interfacial traps, and the substrate NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz/4Br&#8208;BPA with improved wettability has facilitated the perovskite film growth with enhanced crystallization and released residual stress. Consequently, all these benefits have been transformed to an impressive PCE of 26.59% (certified 26.12%).

&lt;p&gt;The 4-Bromobenzylphosphnic acid molecule is constructed as a molecular bridge connecting Me-4PACz/perovskite to improve their interfacial characteristics achieving certified efficiency of 26.12% and improved stability for the resultant solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbazole-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as an effective hole transportation layer have tremendously advanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the inhomogeneous distribution of SAMs on substrate and non-intimate interface contact can bring about significant interfacial energy loss at SAM/perovskite heterojunction. Herein, a small molecule 4-Bromobenzylphosphnic acid (4Br-BPA) is constructed as a molecule bridge connecting [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-carbazol-9-yl) butyl] phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) and perovskite, exhibiting multifunctionality on improving the interfacial characteristics. First, the small-size 4Br-BPA molecules can partly fill some voids on NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Me-4PACz anchored with NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; via phosphonic acid group, meanwhile ameliorating the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; surface state. Second, the 4Br-BPA post-deposited onto Me-4PACz interacting with Me-4PACz via &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; stacking has suppressed charge accumulation at interface, aligned the energy level of NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Me-4PACz consequently promoting the hole transportation. Third, the interplay between 4Br-BPA and perovskite enables effective passivation of interfacial traps, and the substrate NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Me-4PACz/4Br-BPA with improved wettability has facilitated the perovskite film growth with enhanced crystallization and released residual stress. Consequently, all these benefits have been transformed to an impressive PCE of 26.59% (certified 26.12%). The device based on 4Br-BPA also demonstrates much improved operational stability, maintaining &#8776;90% of initial efficiency under 1400 h continuous one-sun illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temporal Immunomodulatory Hydrogel Regulating the Immune&#8208;Osteogenic Cascade for Infected Bone Defects Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel with sequential ions&#8208;releases capability is constructed to regulate the immune&#8208;osteogenic cascade for infected bone defects regeneration. It guided macrophage polarization from M0 to M1 and subsequently to M2 phenotypes according to the healing progression. By simultaneously modulating the immune microenvironment, suppressing bacterial infection, promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis, the temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel restored infected bone defects effectively.








Abstract
Early pathogen clearance and immunomodulation are critical for the restoration of infected bone defects. Conventional osteoimmunomodulatory strategies mainly emphasize M2 macrophage&#8208;mediated bone regeneration, neglecting the pivotal role of early&#8208;stage M1 macrophage&#8208;activated immune response in microbial elimination. This oversight ultimately compromises repair efficacy in infected bone defects. Herein, a temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel is developed to regulate the immune&#8208;osteogenic microenvironment for the repair of infected bone defects. The hydrogel is rapidly formed by crosslinking of acrylate&#8208;modified engineered protein with oxidized sodium alginate, mimicking extracellular matrix architecture to promote cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. To achieve temporal ion release, zinc&#8208;based nanoparticles mineralized with hydroxyapatite are incorporated within the hydrogel matrix. The early&#8208;stage release of Ca2+ promotes M1 polarization to inhibit infection, while sustained release of Zn2+ induces M2 polarization to promote osteogenic differentiation. This system further exhibits antioxidant and antibacterial properties, ensuring comprehensive immunomodulation across the bone healing process. In a rat model of infected cranial defects, the hydrogel effectively remodels the osteoimmune microenvironment, suppresses infection, and facilitates vascularized bone regeneration. This work highlights a temporal immunomodulatory strategy for infected bone repair and offers new insights into the design of advanced osteoimmunomodulatory biomaterials.

         <title>The Bionic Interface: Considering the Material Mediated Electrical Stimulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical stimulation directs stem cell fate in tissue engineering. Cellular responses are influenced by membrane properties, intrinsic cell state, material charge&#8208;transport characteristics, and the applied electrical signal. Additionally, a material&#8217;s ability to inject, store, and redistribute charge further modulates these responses. Understanding these mechanisms enables the rational design of highly effective electroactive scaffolds for precise stem cell control.








Abstract
Electromaterials, in the field of tissue engineering, are designed to use an electrical signal to induce specific biological responses in cells and tissues. Using materials to control stem cell fate is a substantial field of research within tissue engineering, where stem cell differentiation is controlled through careful design of the material properties (roughness, topography, stiffness, and surface chemistry); the introduction of electromaterials into this field has added an extra dimensionality along with the ability to provide dynamic, temporally controlled cues through electrical stimulation. While significant research has focused on the cell&#8208;material interface for electrical stimulation platforms, the underlying reasons why certain materials outperform others remain poorly understood. Most existing studies emphasise mechanical stiffness and chemical composition, often overlooking the role of electronic charge transport. In this perspective, the focus is shifted to the charge transport properties of commonly used electrically conductive materials&#8212;such as metal&#8208;based electrode, carbon&#8208;based composites, and conjugated polymers&#8212;and discusses how these mechanisms modulate cellular responses. It is proposed that a deeper understanding of how materials inject, store, and redistribute charge at the interface can offer a new paradigm in designing electrically active scaffolds for more predictable and effective stem cell modulation.

         <title>Revealing the Design Principle for Highly Compositional Reversible Transition Metal Chalcogenide Electrodes: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective provides a fundamental understanding of the design principle for highly compositional reversible transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) electrodes in conversion&#8208;type batteries. That is, fabricating TMC/atomically dispersed catalyst (TMC/C&#8208;ADC) composites together with interfacial (e.g., stacking and orientation) engineering and multiscale (atomic, nano&#8208;, and macro&#8208;) structural co&#8208;modifications to accelerate reaction kinetics in both the discharging and charging processes.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are considered a promising kind of anode material for next&#8208;generation alkali metal ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their multielectron&#8208;transfer energy storage mechanism and low cost. However, their sluggish reaction kinetics lead to irreversible conversion reaction during cycling, resulting in low compositional reversibility and rapid battery failure. To improve their electrochemical performance in AMIBs, many efforts involving structure, composition, and interface modifications have been devoted. However, there is still a lack of a systematic understanding of the reversible conversion reaction mechanism and design principle for highly compositional reversible TMC electrodes. This perspective discusses the reversible conversion mechanism and key challenges of TMCs through a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Three kinds of modification strategies, including multi&#8208;scale structure construction, fabrication of TMC&#8208;based composite, and interfacial engineering, along with their working mechanisms on promoting the reversible conversion reaction of TMCs, are comprehensively elucidated. Finally, the current general design principle for compositional reversible TMC electrodes in AMIBs is summarized, while future research opportunities are discussed. This perspective provides fundamental and instructive insights for rational design and synthesis of highly reversible electrodes in conversion&#8208;type batteries.

         <title>Innate Immune&#8208;Cloaked Microgel&#8208;Coated Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Reverse Persistent Pulmonary Fibrosis via Reparative Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft microgel coating is developed with a &#8220;self&#8221; peptide that helps mesenchymal stromal cells evade innate immune clearance. These engineered cells reverse fibrosis through secreted signals. Single&#8208;cell analysis reveals a special macrophage type that drives healing. This approach enables a living pharmacy for long&#8208;term tissue repair.








Abstract
The innate immune system plays a dual role in both mediating pathogenic processes following tissue damage and acting as a barrier to effective therapeutic delivery. Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material&#8208;based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self&#8208;marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen&#8208;presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects. By combining immune cloaking with the presentation of local signals encoded in the gel coatings, this strategy can be used to design secretory cells for long&#8208;term tissue remodeling, enabling a living pharmacy for chronic tissue damage.

         <title>Adaptive Metaskins for Active and Passive Thermal Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic integration of reconfigurable MXene micro&#8208;wrinkles and a temperature&#8208;sensitive substrate, an adaptive metaskin that can operate in either active or passive modes is proposed for multi&#8208;scenario IR camouflage. This coupling design enables reversible, continuous, controllable, and wide&#8208;range emissivity modulation, ensuring robust adaptability across diverse thermal environments, opening up an additional degree of freedom in IR camouflage applications.








Abstract
Dynamic thermal camouflage conceals objects from infrared detection by modulating surface emissivity to match the thermal signature of the background. However, existing emissivity modulation systems fail to perform effectively across both hot backgrounds, such as sun&#8208;heated buildings and roads, and cold backgrounds, such as open fields. Here, an adaptive metaskin capable of operating in either active (externally powered) or passive mode is demonstrated, enabling effective camouflage across diverse thermal environments. This is achieved through the synergistic integration of a plasmonic MXene metasurface and a reprogrammable liquid crystal elastomer. The metaskin offers both a wide, continuously tunable emissivity range (&#8776;41%) and a rapid temperature response (1.2 s), selectively triggered in the passive mode. In cold backgrounds (e.g., 20&#160;&#176;C), the system operates in an active mode, delivering a non&#8208;volatile low&#8208;emissivity state that conceals objects across a wide temperature range (e.g., 20&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C). In hot backgrounds (e.g., 50&#160;&#176;C), it switches to passive mode, autonomously modulating its emissivity and maintaining an average infrared contrast of just 4.7&#160;&#176;C for objects of 50&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C. This dual&#8208;mode design is expected to address the challenges of active and passive thermal camouflage, opening new possibilities for dynamic thermal radiation management.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glass&#8208;Unified MOF Membranes for High&#8208;Efficiency Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy enables the fabrication of defect&#8208;free MOF membranes through integration with melt&#8208;quenched coordination polymer glass. These advanced membranes possess densely interconnected nanochannels that facilitate high&#8208;efficiency molecular separations in organic solvent nanofiltration, pervaporation, and gas separation, respectively, and tunable separation performance through non&#8208;destructive modification.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) demonstrate significant potential as separation membranes in energy&#8208;efficient industrial applications. Nevertheless, fabricating an arbitrary MOF membrane with intrinsic separation capability remains a persistent challenge due to intercrystalline defects, necessitating case&#8208;specific optimization of synthesis conditions for different separation targets. Herein, the first coordination polymer (CP) glass&#8208;unified MOF (GUM) membranes are fabricated by a melt&#8208;quenching approach, establishing a tunable and facile strategy for on&#8208;demand MOF membrane fabrication. The three types of Zr&#8208;GUM, Al&#8208;GUM, and Zn&#8208;GUM membranes with different Zr&#8208;, Al&#8208;, Zn&#8208;MOFs are defect&#8208;free and feature high&#8208;density, interconnected, selective nanochannels that dominate the transport process. This strategy enables precise and rapid molecular separation in organic solvent nanofiltration, isomer pervaporation, and gas separation. Meanwhile, through non&#8208;destructive modification of MOF crystals, the separation performance can be precisely fine&#8208;tuned without compromising the structural integrity of the GUM membrane. Furthermore, leveraging the meltability of CP glass, this strategy enables the fabrication of innovative defect&#8208;free membranes with integrated self&#8208;healing properties. The GUM membranes demonstrate sustained high&#8208;efficiency separation performance coupled with exceptional mechanical robustness, chemical resistance, and thermal stability, providing a facile strategy for both gas and liquid membrane separations.

         <title>Ultrasound Active Piezoelectric Nanostimulators for Long&#8208;Acting Wireless Deep Brain Electric Stimulation to Inhibit Epileptic Seizures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine&#8208;coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles are explored as wireless nanostimulators for deep brain electrical stimulation. These nanostimulators can adhere to the neuronal membrane and generate electrical signals under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound to precisely activate neurons and associated neural circuits through triggering voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels. Piezoelectric nanostimulator&#8208;based stimulation can effectively suppress epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine&#8208;induced epilepsy rat models.








Abstract
Electrical deep brain stimulation is effective for epilepsy suppression, but will lead to neural tissue damage and inflammation due to implantation of electrodes and a pulse generator. Transcranial magnetic and transcranial ultrasound stimulation cannot directly generate effective electrical signals in deep brain regions. Here, the use of piezoelectric nanoparticles is proposed as wireless nanostimulators for deep brain electrical stimulation and minimally invasive suppression of epilepsy. Polydopamine&#8208;coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanostimulators can adhere to neuronal membrane and generate pulsed electrical signals under ultrasound irradiation, effectively activating neurons through modulating voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels on the membrane. These nanostimulators can be minimal&#8208;invasively implanted into target deep brain regions, such as the hippocampal CA1, through stereotactic microinjection and remain stable for at least 14 weeks with negligible inflammatory reactions. These implanted nanostimulators precisely and effectively activate surrounding neurons and associated neural circuits in vivo under a portable low&#8208;intensity ultrasound transducer. This piezoelectric nanostimulator&#8208;based wireless deep brain electrical stimulation effectively suppresses epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine&#8208;induced epilepsy rat models. By combining the deep penetration of ultrasound with the efficacy of piezoelectric stimulation, this minimally invasive method holds great promise for effective suppression of epileptic seizures and management of other neural disorders.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Wettability Triboelectric Sensors for Sweat Collection and Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bioinspired triboelectric material with heterogeneous wettability, which is used to construct a lightweight, self&#8208;powered wearable sweat sensor. By integrating an ion&#8208;selective membrane and a wireless transmission module, the device enables selective detection of salt ions and real&#8208;time remote monitoring, offering notable potential for long&#8208;term, continuous health monitoring applications.








Abstract
Triboelectric sweat sensors, endowed with the technical advantages of non&#8208;invasive ex vivo and in situ detection, have catalyzed the rapid advancement of personalized medicine and precision health management systems. However, the inherently low secretion rate and rapid evaporation of sweat pose significant challenges for its efficient collection and rapid analytical screening. This study leverages laser cutting and aqueous interfacial self&#8208;assembly strategies to develop a biomimetic heterogeneous wettability triboelectric material (HWTM). Sweat is rapidly collected from the edge to the center of the material, driven by the combined effect of a wettability gradient and the Laplace pressure difference arising from asymmetric curvature at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. This collection mechanism markedly enriches target analytes, yielding a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of 51&#160;dB, which surpasses that of prevailing sweat sensor technologies. A portable wearable patch is engineered by integrating ion&#8208;selective membranes and data processing modules, enabling selective salt ion profiling and real&#8208;time wireless monitoring. This work paves the way for the rational design of sweat sensors grounded in fluidic transport mechanisms.

         <title>Unique Impacts of Scandium Doping on Electrode Performance of P&#8217;2&#8208; and P2&#8208;type Na2/3MnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural stability during electrochemical cycling for P&#8217;2&#8208;Na2/3MnO2 as a positive electrode for of Na&#8208;ion battery is investigated by modulating the materials via metal substitution and varying the degree of Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion. The cycle stability is maximized when combining Sc doping and the lattice distortion, demonstrating &gt; 300 cycles in the coin&#8208;type full cell.








Abstract

Layered sodium manganese oxides are one of the promising candidates as cathode materials for high&#8208;capacity Na&#8208;ion batteries free from rare elements. Among the polytypes of layered sodium manganese oxides, the P&#8217;2&#8208;type Na2/3MnO2&#160;electrode exhibits the highest reversible capacity &#8776;220 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 based on the Mn3+/4+&#160;redox couple; however, the cycle life remained&#160;a significant challenge. Because of Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) active Mn3+&#160;ions ([Ar]4s23d4), the layered structure is cooperatively distorted and experiences complex structural changes during Mn3+/4+&#160;redox accompanied by Na extraction/insertion.

     alt="Unique Impacts of Scandium Doping on Electrode Performance of P&#8217;2- and P2-type Na2/3MnO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural stability during electrochemical cycling for P&#8217;2-Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a positive electrode for of Na-ion battery is investigated by modulating the materials via metal substitution and varying the degree of Jahn-Teller distortion. The cycle stability is maximized when combining Sc doping and the lattice distortion, demonstrating &amp;gt; 300 cycles in the coin-type full cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Layered sodium manganese oxides are one of the promising candidates as cathode materials for high-capacity Na-ion batteries free from rare elements. Among the polytypes of layered sodium manganese oxides, the P&#8217;2-type Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;electrode exhibits the highest reversible capacity &#8776;220 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; based on the Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+/4+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;redox couple; however, the cycle life remained&#160;a significant challenge. Because of Jahn-Teller (JT) active Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;ions ([Ar]&lt;i&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;), the layered structure is cooperatively distorted and experiences complex structural changes during Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+/4+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;redox accompanied by Na extraction/insertion. The impact of scandium(III) dopant in Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;[Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sc&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;on the cooperative lattice-distortion and electrode performance is systematically investigated, and prepartion for distortion-free hexagonal P2-type Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;[(Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sc&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.93&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;0.07&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;(&#9633; = vacancy) allows the contribution of the vacancies on the Mn site to be checked. Furthermore, a comparative study of the case of other trivalent metals of yttrium(III) and aluminum(III) as dopants is demonstrated. Thus, it is concluded that a unique synergetic effect of the Sc doping and JT distortion provides significant improvement of redox activity of P&#8217;2-Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;[Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sc&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, demonstrating stable cycling for more than 300 cycles in a Na-ion cell. The findings highlight the critical role of the coexistence of the Sc dopant and honeycomb ordering of Mn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;(Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sc&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) in [Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sc&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;slabs of P&#8217;2-Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;[Mn&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sc&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;

Infrared Camouflage
This adaptive metaskin integrates a plasmonic MXene metasurface with a temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomer to realize dual&#8208;mode active and passive thermal camouflage. It enables important objects, such as vehicles and personnel, to precisely match the thermal signatures of both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature backgrounds, achieving seamless blending with the environment and evading infrared detection. More details can be found in the Research Article by Keqiao Li, Yang Li, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202506934).

Interface Segregation in Dielectrics
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202507233), Sung&#8208;Yoon Chung and co&#8208;workers overturn the long&#8208;standing reliance on multiple additives and costly rare&#8208;earth elements in MLCCs by demonstrating that a single acceptor&#8208;type additive enables superior dielectric performance. Through atomic&#8208;scale grain&#8208;boundary segregation in nanocrystalline BaTiO3, they achieve dielectric loss below 0.8% up to 100 MHz and under 2.5% up to 1 GHz, while maintaining high effective permittivity even under electric fields as high as 80 kV/cm and exhibiting excellent temperature stability.

Engineering Aging
This illustration is a metaphorical representation of in vitro aging models. The engineers (cells) start their careers working with robust, well&#8208;maintained equipment (healthy tissue), and as time passes, they grow older, and their equipment eventually fails. These elements combine to form an accelerated aging model that can be studied to uncover some of the mysteries of the aging process. More details can be found in the Perspective by Khoon S. Lim and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202512523).

Lim and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202512523"&gt;10.1002/adma.202512523&lt;/a&gt;).

Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202511754), Ferhat Katmis, Valeria Lauter, Mehmet C. Onbasli, Jagadeesh S. Moodera, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the first room&#8208;temperature, zero&#8208;field stabilization of interfacial skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings in EuS/Bi2Se3/EuS trilayers. Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interactions and geometric confinement enable robust topological spin textures directly imaged by Lorentz TEM and confirmed by micromagnetic models, magnetometry and neutron reflectometry. These findings establish a pathway toward ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic technologies based on stable topological information carriers.

         <title>Probiotic&#8208;Based Materials as Living Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Engineered Living Materials are highlighted, integrating synthetic biology and advanced materials, with a focus on probiotic&#8208;based therapeutics. Probiotic Living Materials hold great potential for biosensing, infection treatment, osteogenesis, wound healing, vaginal and gastrointestinal disorders, and cancer therapy. breakthroughs in the field is critically reviewed, including challenges for clinical translation.








Abstract
The growing demand for safer, more targeted therapeutics requires the development of advanced biomaterials. Among these, Engineered Living Materials (ELMs)&#8212;which integrate synthetic biology with material science&#8212;are emerging as promising platforms for biomedical applications. This review focuses on a subclass of ELMs based on genetically engineered probiotics combined with matrices, that are termed Probiotic Living Materials (PLMs) to differentiate them from Living Biotherapeutic Products (LBPs). Recent studies highlight PLM's potential in addressing different health conditions, offering targeted and dynamic therapies. However, PLMs face multiple challenges to be implemented in clinics, including a lack of robust genetic toolkits for probiotic engineering, concerns about biosafety (e.g., horizontal gene transfer or non&#8208;desirable biological activity), difficulties in translating preclinical results to humans, and the absence of clear regulatory guidance for clinical use. This review first explores the fundamental features of ELMs, then provides an overview of probiotics, followed by recent advances in the design of engineered PLMs for biomedical applications, particularly in biosensing development, infection treatment, bone repair, wound healing, vaginal imbalances, gut&#8208;related conditions, and cancer therapy. Finally, biosafety issues and current gaps in regulatory frameworks to ensure safe and effective use of PLMs, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations, are discussed.

         <title>Bioactive Materials&#8208;Mediated Regulation of Bone Marrow Microenvironment: Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in biomaterials that regulate the bone marrow microenvironment (encompassing osteocytes, stem cells, immune cells, nerves, and blood vessels). It introduces the action mechanisms of various materials and the limitations of current research, while outlining the development potential of biomaterials and their transformative impacts on medical paradigms.








Abstract
The bone marrow microenvironment(BME) maintains bone homeostasis through multi&#8208;cellular cooperation and signal crosstalk, its&#160;dysregulation drives&#160;pathological bone&#160;loss. In recent years, Materiobiology, a scientific discipline studying how biomaterial properties affect biological functions, has opened new avenues for the precise regulation of this complex microenvironment. Biomaterials enable sophisticated regulation of the BME through biomimetic design and functionalization strategies. They not only activate osteoblast signaling pathways to promote bone formation but also inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption functions. Additionally, they integrate nerve and vascular regeneration processes with immunomodulatory mechanisms to optimize stem cell behavior and improve the tissue repair microenvironment. This review comprehensively summarizes advances in biomaterial&#8208;mediated BME regulation, emphasizing interdisciplinary integration and intelligent material development to overcome the limitations of conventional therapies. The innovation of intelligent materials lies in their ability to mimic biological systems. Recent research has leveraged generative design models to engineer new thiol&#8208;containing antimicrobial peptides. These approaches achieve spatiotemporal coordination of cellular interactions and functional reconstruction during bone regeneration. Future efforts need to address challenges in material stability, personalized adaptation, and clinical translation, promoting cross&#8208;scale therapeutic innovation from molecular intervention to tissue regeneration, providing revolutionary solutions for bone metabolic diseases and complex defect repair.

         <title>Diverse Perovskite Solar Cells: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress, challenges, and perspectives for diverse categories of perovskite solar cells classified according to composition, dimension, and crystallinity are overviewed.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have revolutionized optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps, exceptional optoelectronic properties, and structural flexibility. Notably, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of perovskite solar cells has reached 27%, making perovskite materials a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. Although numerous reviews regarding perovskite materials have been published, the existing reviews generally focus on individual material systems (e.g., organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites) and specific optimizations in one particular optoelectronic application (e.g., stability engineering for solar cells), lacking a systematic overview of the progress and challenges across diverse perovskite types. This review breaks this limitation by providing a systematic overview of all perovskite categories used in solar cells classified by different criteria, including composition (organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, all&#8208;inorganic perovskites, lead&#8208;free perovskites, and metal&#8208;free perovskites), dimensionality (3D and low&#8208;dimensional perovskitoids), and crystallinity (poly&#8208;crystal thin film and single&#8208;crystal perovskites). The recent progress and future perspectives for each category of perovskite solar cells are focused on, aiming to establish a holistic roadmap for perovskite solar cells toward technological innovations and industrial viability.

         <title>Hierarchically MOF&#8208;Based Porous Monolith Composites for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the design of hierarchical porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting, focusing on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous monoliths. Emphasis is placed on integrating MOF nanoscale porosity with the microscale channels of monolithic scaffolds to enhance sorption&#8208;desorption performance. The role of multiscale porosity, from the nanometer scale to the macrostructure, is highlighted in optimizing water uptake, vapor transport, and stability under varying humidity.








Abstract
Water scarcity, a critical global challenge, has intensified due to the adverse effects of climate change on ecosystems and its detrimental impact on human activities. Addressing this issue requires solutions capable of providing clean water in regions facing hydroclimatic challenges and limited infrastructure. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising solution, particularly in arid regions, by extracting moisture from the air. This review explores AWH technologies that leverage material porosity and hygroscopicity, focusing on highly porous materials such as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and monolithic scaffolds. While MOFs exhibit exceptional water uptake due to their tunable chemistry and nanoscale porosity, their powdery nature poses stability and processability challenges. To overcome these limitations, integrating MOFs into multiscale porous monoliths&#8212;such as foams, aerogels, cryogels, and xerogels&#8212;enhances structural integrity and performance. The role of hierarchical porosity, engineered across nano&#8208;scale in MOF (&lt;2 nm) and micro&#8208;scales (&gt;2 nm) is emphasized in porous monoliths, in optimizing water capture efficiency. This review also highlights recent advancements in MOF&#8208;based composite monoliths, their working mechanisms, and the potential for large&#8208;scale implementation. By integrating nanotechnology with material chemistry, this work outlines strategies to enhance sorption capacity, desorption kinetics, and scalability, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing efficient, sustainable, and scalable AWH systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrocatalytic Materials in Zn&#8208;Air Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs)&#8208;based electrocatalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) applications, systematically addressing their physicochemical characteristics, design paradigms, characterization techniques, and cutting&#8208;edge advancements. The current review can provide a valuable foundation for the selection of elements and the design of HEMs for bifunctional catalysts, as well as for the optimization of HEM compositions to enhance their intrinsic activity.








Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high energy density, low costs, and environmental sustainability by using air as the cathode and zinc as the anode. The critical bottlenecks in advancing rechargeable ZABs lie in the development of high&#8208;performance bifunctional air electrode catalysts that efficiently drive the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), comprising four or more elements with distinctive structural characteristics, tailorable chemical compositions, and correspondingly tunable functional properties, have exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic activity toward ORR/OER in various catalytic systems. To further enhance HEMs' catalytic performance, systematic investigations into elemental interactions, precise identification of active sites, and elucidation of fundamental reaction mechanisms are imperative. This review first introduces the synthetic methods, design principles, and characterization technologies of HEM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and summarizes their applications in ZABs based on oxygen chemistry. This study endeavors to decode the complexity of active sites, elemental interactions, and the reaction mechanisms intrinsic to HEMs. Finally, the critical challenges, the significance of integrating both experimental and theoretical approaches, and the prospective applications of HEMs in ZABs are emphasized. This review is expected to facilitate the rational design and practical deployment of HEMs for next&#8208;generation ZAB systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in metal&#8208;based nanomaterials (MBNs) as multifunctional platforms for next&#8208;generation diagnostics and nanodynamic therapies (NDTs), highlighting their structural tunability, diverse therapeutic modalities, and broad biomedical applications in oncology and infectious disease control. This review comprehensively emphasizes the design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and synergistic treatment strategies of emerging MBN, while also addressing current facing challenges in clinical translation.








Abstract
Advanced metal&#8208;based nanomaterials (MBNs) represent a dynamic frontier in nanomedicine, offering a versatile platform for next&#8208;generation diagnostics and therapeutics. Their tunable structures and catalytic, optical, and magnetic properties enable diverse nanodynamic therapies (NDTs), including photodynamic, chemodynamic, sonodynamic, thermodynamic, piezoelectric, radiodynamic, and magnetodynamic modalities. In addition to the well&#8208;established tumor ablation, MBNs also feature potent antimicrobial and antiviral activity, functioning via reactive oxygen species generation, immune modulation, and biofilm disruption. Recent developments in metal&#8211;organic frameworks, metal&#8211;phenolic networks, and 2D metal nanosheets have expanded the toolkit for precision drug delivery, imaging&#8208;guided therapy, and bioresponsive release strategies. This comprehensive review highlights the structural design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and versatile biomedical applications of emerging MBN platforms, emphasizing synergistic treatment strategies and their role in overcoming hypoxia, multidrug resistance, and immunosuppression. Despite their promise, clinical translation remains hindered by unresolved issues in long&#8208;term biosafety, biodegradation, and scalable manufacturing. Future efforts are expected to focus on tailoring intelligent nanostructures with optimized pharmacokinetics, integrating multimodal imaging with real&#8208;time therapeutic feedback, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Continued innovation at the interface of materials science, biology, and medicine will be essential for transforming MBN&#8208;based systems into clinically viable tools for oncology, infectious disease control, and personalized medicine.

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Engineering for Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review dissects the primary failure mechanisms of sodium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes at low temperatures, such as sluggish ion transport and high interfacial resistance. It comprehensively summarizes key optimization strategies, including solvent engineering, concentration regulation, and the development of novel additives and salts, offering a systematic guide for designing advanced electrolytes for reliable low&#8208;temperature energy storage.








Abstract
Given the abundance and low cost of sodium resources, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, the unique electrochemical and chemical characteristics of SIBs indicate their substantial potential for low&#8208;temperature operation. However, low temperatures significantly reduce the intrinsic Na+ transport rate, sharply increase the Na+ de&#8208;solvation energy barrier at the battery&#8208;electrolyte interface, and lead to dynamic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) reconstruction, resulting in a substantial increase in interfacial impedance. These issues ultimately lead to severe capacity degradation, diminished power performance, shortened cycle life, and even complete battery failure at low temperatures. To address these challenges, this review thoroughly analyzes the failure mechanisms of electrolytes at low temperatures and comprehensively summarizes current design and optimization strategies for low&#8208;temperature SIB electrolytes, including solvent engineering, concentration regulation, novel additives and sodium salts, and emerging electrolyte systems.

     alt="Advanced Electrolyte Engineering for Low-Temperature Sodium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review dissects the primary failure mechanisms of sodium-ion battery electrolytes at low temperatures, such as sluggish ion transport and high interfacial resistance. It comprehensively summarizes key optimization strategies, including solvent engineering, concentration regulation, and the development of novel additives and salts, offering a systematic guide for designing advanced electrolytes for reliable low-temperature energy storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the abundance and low cost of sodium resources, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, the unique electrochemical and chemical characteristics of SIBs indicate their substantial potential for low-temperature operation. However, low temperatures significantly reduce the intrinsic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport rate, sharply increase the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation energy barrier at the battery-electrolyte interface, and lead to dynamic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) reconstruction, resulting in a substantial increase in interfacial impedance. These issues ultimately lead to severe capacity degradation, diminished power performance, shortened cycle life, and even complete battery failure at low temperatures. To address these challenges, this review thoroughly analyzes the failure mechanisms of electrolytes at low temperatures and comprehensively summarizes current design and optimization strategies for low-temperature SIB electrolytes, including solvent engineering, concentration regulation, novel additives and sodium salts, and emerging electrolyte systems. Furthermore, it prospects the future development trends of organic electrolytes, aiming to provide insights for the advancement of novel low-temperature SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Device simulations are essential for uncovering efficiency losses and failure pathways in perovskite solar cells. This review summarizes device simulations across five fundamental domains, including optical management, electrical processes, thermal effects, mechanical stress, and energy output. In addition, it provides insight into high&#8208;throughput and AI&#8208;assisted multiphysics modeling in advancing future photovoltaic technologies.








Abstract
Device simulations have become indispensable tools for advancing the performance and deepening the understanding of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These simulations enable a systematic exploration of light management strategies, charge transport mechanisms, and device architecture optimization. This review comprehensively highlights the critical role of modeling in the development of PSCs, with a focus on five key domains: optical management (light absorption, reflection, and scattering), electrical processes (carrier dynamics, defect passivation, and interface engineering), thermal effects (heat generation and dissipation), mechanical stress (structural stability and degradation mechanisms), and energy yield (real&#8208;world output power, performance improvement, and device degradation). The integration of multiphysics simulations to address complex device challenges and to accelerate the development of high&#8208;efficiency and stable PSCs is also discussed. Key achievements in tandem architecture optimization, interface engineering, and insights into device degradation pathways under real&#8208;world operating conditions are thoroughly summarized. Finally, remaining challenges, such as modeling non&#8208;idealities, the scalability of simulation approaches, and experimental validation, are identified, and offer an outlook on future directions in multiphysics modeling. By bridging theoretical and experimental perspectives, this review emphasizes the transformative potential of simulations in enabling higher performance, enhanced stability, and broader application of perovskite photovoltaics (PV) in sustainable energy systems.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Direct Lithium Extraction from Low&#8208;Quality Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review synthesizes the structure&#8208;efficiency&#8208;application framework of solar&#8208;driven direct lithium extraction (SDLE) systems for lithium extraction from low&#8208;quality brines. It highlights fundamental mechanisms, integrated design, engineering applications, and device development of SDLE systems, covering adsorption, membrane separation, crystallization separation, and electrochemical extraction. The challenges and future perspective for the next generation of scale&#8208;up SDLE architectures are also supplemented.








Abstract
Owing to the crucial role in energy transformation for decarbonization, sustainable lithium (Li) supply has become growingly critical. Low&#8208;quality brines hold vast potential due to infinite reserves and diverse distribution but desire green and cost&#8208;effective extraction techniques against low Li concentrations and high magnesium&#8208;to&#8208;lithium ratios. Solar&#8208;driven direct lithium extraction (SDLE) systems combining conventional evaporation and DLE techniques can overcome the present challenges of Li extraction, promising to advance the exploitation of low&#8208;quality brines while simultaneously producing fresh water. However, the underlying construction principles and fundamental physical processes concerning SDLE systems are still uncovered comprehensively. This review first reveals the high&#8208;efficient and energy&#8208;effective Li extraction mechanisms from low&#8208;quality brines. Then, this work systematically presents construction and enhancement strategies, and the latest advancements and engineering applications of various SDLE systems, covering adsorption, membrane separation, crystallization separation, and electrochemical extraction. Furthermore, this work highlights the rational design of SDLE devices for water&#8208;Li co&#8208;production. Finally, this work discusses the challenges and future prospects for realizing SDLE systems from lab discovery to scale&#8208;up field demonstration. This review aims to bridge the gap between fundamental science and practical engineering behind the SDLE, unlocking different insights for resource sustainability and low&#8208;grade brines mining.

         <title>Terahertz Electronic and Spin Currents in Wafer&#8208;Scale Van der Waals Bi2Se3/WSe2 Heterostructures and Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterostructures offer exciting possibilities for artificial materials with unique optical, electronic, and spintronic properties. However, their use in the terahertz (THz) range is limited due to material constraints. This study demonstrates scalable, large&#8208;area, crystalline 2D heterostructures, combining topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), and ferromagnets. This enables a range of THz phenomena from spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, nonlinear down&#8208;conversion and magnetic proximity effects in a single heterostructure stack. Further, different TMD polymorphs &#8211; the crystal phase &#8208; significantly alter the THz responses, providing a pathway for advanced heterostructure engineering in 2D materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures and polymorphs have promised the realization of artificial materials with multiple physical phenomena such as giant optical nonlinearities, spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge interconversion in spintronics and topological carrier protection, through an infinitely diverse set of 2D quantum materials and their stacking order in a single layered device. However, their exploitation for the terahertz range has been limited with most investigations based around the optical domain, owing to the use of exfoliated material that inherently limits both the dimensions of the materials and the scalability for applications. Here, the combination of terahertz electronic and spin currents is demonstrated through the realization of large area complex crystalline heterostructures of topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and ferromagnets. This is demonstrated through down&#8208;conversion of optical beams into coherent terahertz currents, where the terahertz phase permits the decoupling of the physical phenomena, and bringing novel functionalities beyond those achievable in simple homostructures. In particular, the role of different TMD polymorphs (stacking orders &#8208; 1T&#8242;, 2H, and 3R) is shown with the simple change of one atomic monolayer of the material stack entirely changing the terahertz responses &#8211; both electrical and magnetic &#8208; of the artificial material. This allows to highlight ultrafast phenomena that combine both the electronic&#8208; and spin&#8208;based processes in these structures. The importance of the crystal symmetry on the magnetic properties through proximity effects is further demonstrated, showing a nonlinearity of magnetic origin as a result of the 1T&#8242; polymorph. As well as control of the terahertz currents through different polymorphs, this scalable integration of a set of highly diverse materials establishes a platform for next&#8208;generation 2D heterostructures that integrate photonic, electronic, and spintronic properties into device&#160;architectures.

         <title>Li&#8208;Well ZnO Memtransistors: High Reliability for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lithium (Li)&#8208;well ZnO memtransistor integrates&#160;transistor switching and nonvolatile memory, akin to ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) and floating gates, while enabling low&#8208;power operation via Li&#8314; ion migration. Li&#8314; ion migration and switching mechanisms were&#160;confirmed by 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array achieves 99.31% yield, and this scalable design supports neuromorphic computing and artificial neural network accelerators. 








Abstract
Memtransistors are active analog memory devices utilizing ionic memristive materials as channel layers. Since their introduction, the term &#8220;memtransistor&#8221; has widely been adopted for transistors exhibiting nonvolatile memory characteristics. Currently, memtransistor devices possessing both transistor on/off functionality and nonvolatile memory characteristics include ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) and charge&#8208;trap flash (floating gate), yet ionic memtransistors have not matched their performance. Here a facile and extendable lithium (Li)&#8208;well oxide memtransistor (LWOM) is reported as a promising candidate. Forming a Li well, analogous to an n+ well beneath electrodes in n&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistor (MOSFET) processes, induces Li&#8314;&#8208;ion migration via write VDS, achieving analog memory characteristics through Schottky barrier modulation. LWOM enables low&#8208;voltage weight updates and precise gate&#8208;controlled weight update characteristics. Analysis via 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) confirms Li&#8208;ion redistribution and the resistance&#8208;switching mechanism. A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array demonstrates 99.31% operational yield and successful weight updates to target conductance values. Fabricated using mature oxide semiconductor technology with a 230&#160;&#176;C thermal budget and a simple process, LWOM stands as a strong contender for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memory and artificial neural network (ANN) acceleration hardware.

Currently, memtransistor devices possessing both transistor on/off functionality and nonvolatile memory characteristics include ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) and charge-trap flash (floating gate), yet ionic memtransistors have not matched their performance. Here a facile and extendable lithium (Li)-well oxide memtransistor (LWOM) is reported as a promising candidate. Forming a Li well, analogous to an n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; well beneath electrodes in n-metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) processes, induces Li&#8314;-ion migration via write &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving analog memory characteristics through Schottky barrier modulation. LWOM enables low-voltage weight updates and precise gate-controlled weight update characteristics. Analysis via 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) confirms Li-ion redistribution and the resistance-switching mechanism. A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array demonstrates 99.31% operational yield and successful weight updates to target conductance values. Fabricated using mature oxide semiconductor technology with a 230&#160;&#176;C thermal budget and a simple process, LWOM stands as a strong contender for next-generation nonvolatile memory and artificial neural network (ANN) acceleration hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Textile&#8208;Based Electromagnetic Audio Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current wearable audio interfaces exhibit sound&#8208;emitting function but compromise either acoustic performance or wearability, and lack sufficient robustness against unstructured conditions. A textile&#8208;based audio interface is proposed with robust actuation to address these challenges and demonstrate various human&#8208;machine interactive applications. 








Abstract
Textiles with inherently porous architectures are commonly employed for acoustic absorption. Although recent advances in textile&#8208;based audio interfaces have enabled sound emission, they lack robustness under unstructured conditions. Therefore, this study introduces a strategy that integrates textile structures with a durable actuation mechanism to overcome these limitations. Through optimized theoretical modeling, this study enhances the vibration amplitudes, effectively compensating for the intrinsic acoustic damping losses of textiles, achieving a relatively high and flat sound pressure level of 71.7&#160;&#177;&#160;3.3&#160;dB. Notably, the audio interface maintains stable performance under various mechanical deformations, including stretching, compression, bending, and twisting. Furthermore, this audio interface preserves the essential characteristics of textiles, such as washability and breathability, and remains fully functional even in extremely humid conditions, such as heavy perspiration. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated through three practical applications: sound&#8208;beanie, talking&#8208;cloth, and sound&#8208;sofa. In each case, this audio interface delivers high&#8208;quality acoustic performance and robustness to unstructured conditions. The proposed strategy is anticipated to enhance the design of wearable audio interfaces for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Switching via 180&#176; N&#233;el Vector Reversal in Pt/Cr2O3/Co Trilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;induced switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector offers strong potential for ultrafast SOT&#8208;MRAM, though its mechanism remains debated. Here, such switching is reported in antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 within a Pt/Cr2O3/Co trilayer. The switching occurs via antiferromagnetic domain wall motion, leading to unconventional SOT behaviors in the Co layer, including reversed polarity, current&#8208;induced exchange bias modulation, and field&#8208;cooling&#8208;dependent switching ratios.








Abstract
The 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector induced by the spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) presents significant potential for ultradense and ultrafast antiferromagnetic SOT&#8208;magnetoresistive random&#8208;access memory. However, its experimental realization remains a topic of intense debate. Here, unequivocal evidence is provided for the SOT&#8208;induced 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in collinear antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 in a Pt/Cr2O3/Co trilayer structure. It is demonstrated that the 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in Cr2O3 can lead to the unconventional switching behavior of the Co layer on top of it. The switching polarity of the Co layer can be reversed after the insertion of the Cr2O3 layer. Moreover, the exchange bias directions are switched simultaneously with the Co layer. The switching ratio of the Co layer is sensitive to the antiferromagnetic states of Cr2O3 and can be tuned by field cooling. The results not only underpin the electrical switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in Cr2O3 but are also beneficial for the development of antiferromagnetic&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Diatom&#8208;Inspired Scaffold for Infected Bone Defect Therapy: Achieving Stable Photothermal Properties and Coordinated Antibacterial&#8208;Osteogenic Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the hierarchical structure of diatoms, this work presents a biomimetic bone repair scaffold based on copper&#8208;doped iron goethite (Fe(Cu)OOH) nanoparticles and a mesoporous SiO2 protective layer, achieving simultaneously efficient antibacterial performance at low temperatures, immune modulation, and bone regeneration.









Abstract

Bone defect therapy frequently encounters bacterial infections and chronic inflammation, which impair bone regeneration and threaten implant stability. Iron oxide nanoparticles have attracted attention due to cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and metabolic safety. However, iron oxide nanoparticles still struggle to balance low&#8208;temperature efficient antibacterial activity, effective immunomodulation, and bone regeneration. Therefore, inspired by diatoms, a multifunctional bone repair scaffold based on chitosan&#8208;hydroxyapatite (CH) is developed by integrating the multifunctional properties of copper&#8208;doped iron goethite (Fe(Cu)OOH) nanoparticles and a mesoporous SiO2 protective layer (CH/FeCu@SiO2). The &#8220;cytoskeleton&#8221; CH scaffold stabilizes the nanoparticles and supports tissue growth. The &#8220;chloroplast&#8221; Fe(Cu)OOH and the &#8220; frustule&#8221; SiO2 layer synergistically capture near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to generate localized mild hyperthermia (&#8776;42&#160;&#176;C), with the release of Cu2+ to achieve antibacterial effects (&gt;99%). In addition, Fe(Cu)OOH exhibits enzyme&#8208;like antioxidant activity, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) (69.20%) and thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization (1.64&#8208;fold), which protects stem cells and creates osteogenic immune microenvironment. Moreover, the mild hyperthermia and ion release upregulate the TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling pathway and inhibit osteoclast differentiation, promoting vascularized bone regeneration and defect repair (1.3&#8208;fold). Overall, this biomimetic scaffold, enabling synergistic antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and osteogenic activities, offers a promising therapeutic strategy for infectious bone defects treatment.

         <title>Solubility&#8208;pKa Coupling Effect Tailored Nanoporous Nylon Aerogel Family with Multiple Thermomechanical Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal solubility&#8208;pKa coupling effect to engineer a high&#8208;performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By controlling nylon crystallization assembly, various nylon aerogels with robust nanofiber skeletons are developed comparable to traditional high&#8208;performance aerogels, while possessing unique thermoplastic characteristics for functional aerogel thermomechanical processing.








Abstract
Despite significant advancements in aerogels science, the fabrication of high&#8208;performance aerogels with their plastic processability remains unexplored owing to their inherent trade&#8208;off between skeletal rigidity and transformable processability. Herein, a universal solubility&#8208;pKa coupling&#8208;effect to engineer high&#8208;performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By modulating solubility parameters and acid dissociation constants in nylon&#8208;solvent systems, it is precisely control crystallization to assemble interlaced 1D nanofiber skeletons, yielding nylon aerogels that integrate a high specific surface area (226&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), exceptional compressive modulus (12.6&#160;MPa), and ultralow thermal conductivity (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1). Notably, beyond achieving performance comparable to aramid and other high&#8208;performance aerogels, these nylon aerogels uniquely incorporate thermoplastic properties enabling multiple thermomechanical processing for aerogel functionalization, including protective barrier via thermal encapsulating, reassembly of aerogel unmanned aerial vehicle through thermal cutting and welding, and biomimetic hydrophobic surfaces with lotus and petal effects through precise thermal imprinting. Surprisingly, thermomechanical processing also induces fluorescence of aerogels, suggesting applications in thermal&#8208;recording, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, etc. This research overcomes the critical skeletal rigidity&#8208;transformable processability trade&#8208;off in aerogels, enabling novel manufacturing approaches and broader engineering applications.

Notably, beyond achieving performance comparable to aramid and other high-performance aerogels, these nylon aerogels uniquely incorporate thermoplastic properties enabling multiple thermomechanical processing for aerogel functionalization, including protective barrier via thermal encapsulating, reassembly of aerogel unmanned aerial vehicle through thermal cutting and welding, and biomimetic hydrophobic surfaces with lotus and petal effects through precise thermal imprinting. Surprisingly, thermomechanical processing also induces fluorescence of aerogels, suggesting applications in thermal-recording, anti-counterfeiting, etc. This research overcomes the critical skeletal rigidity-transformable processability trade-off in aerogels, enabling novel manufacturing approaches and broader engineering applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preventing Glioblastoma Relapse by Igniting Innate Immunity through Mitochondrial Stress in the Surgical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work synthesizes a charge&#8208;inversion nanodrug (INSTNA) that can activate innate immunity by interfering with the mitochondrial electron transport chain of tumor cells in the surgical cavity of GBM. Mechanistically, INSTNA coordinated tumor treatment fields (TTF) induce mitochondrial stress and release damage&#8208;related molecular patterns (DAMP) that amplify innate immunity and further activate adaptive immunity to kill GBM cells.








Abstract
Innate immunity is crucial in orchestrating the brain immune response, however, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade innate immune surveillance, posing significant challenges for current immunotherapies. Here, a therapeutic strategy is reported that aims at reactivating innate immune responses in GBM via targeted induction of mitochondrial stress, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity. Specifically, innate immune&#8208;stimulating nanoparticles (INSTNA) are developed, encapsulating positively charged iridium&#8208;based complexes (Ir&#8208;mito) and small interfering RNA against Methylation&#8208;Controlled J protein (si&#8208;MCJ) to attenuate mitochondrial respiration. This combination effectively disrupts mitochondrial function of GBM cells, particularly when combined with tumor&#8208;treating fields. The engineered charge&#8208;reversal INSTNA impair the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), inducing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) stress and subsequent mitochondrial matrix release. Furthermore, hydrogel&#8208;mediated delivery of INSTNA in a postoperative GBM mouse model significantly remodeled the immunosuppressive microenvironment, resulting in pronounced tumor regression. In sum, these findings highlight that targeted induction of mitochondrial stress in postoperative GBM can potentiate innate immune activation and enhance adaptive immunity, offering a promising avenue for mitigating GBM recurrence.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Tunable Fluorinated Polyester Electrolytes with Enhanced Interfacial Stability for Recyclable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated polyesters are shown to regulate lithium&#8208;ion coordination and promote stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. The rational structural design enables uniform lithium deposition, suppressed dendrite growth, and enhanced cycling performance in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. This work highlights the importance of molecular engineering in developing high&#8208;performance and sustainable electrolytes.








Abstract
Polyesters, with their tunable chemical structures and environmental sustainability, have drawn growing attention as solid polymer electrolytes for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Through a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study involving the systematic variation of carbon chain lengths in the flexible (diol) and coordinating (diacid) segments, along with selective fluorination at distinct positions along the polymer backbone, 18 types of polyester are fabricated and demonstrate that fluorination at the coordinating segment significantly enhances ionic conductivity by suppressing crystallinity. In contrast, fluorination at the flexible segment reduces ionic migration barriers by providing more homogeneous coordinating sites, thereby improving the lithium&#8208;ion transference number, despite increasing chain rigidity and a reduction in overall ionic conductivity. The optimized fluorinated polyesters exhibit excellent interfacial stability with lithium metal by facilitating the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, as supported by experimental and theoretical simulation analysis. More importantly, to enhance cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability, a solvent&#8208;based recycling route has been developed, achieving substantial recovery yields and notable environmental benefits. This work provides a versatile molecular design and closed&#8208;loop recovery strategy for fluorinated polyester electrolytes, advancing their practical application in high&#8208;energy and sustainable SSLMBs.

         <title>Gbits/s&#8208;Level Encrypted Spectral Wireless Communication Enabled by High&#8208;Performance Flexible Organic Hyperspectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;novel spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology based on an organic hyperspectrometer is proposed. By analyzing the spectrum of information&#8208;carrying light in the time domain, binary information encoded in different wavelengths can be extracted. The theoretical communication rate reaches up to 9.1 Gbits s&#8722;1, representing the highest value reported to date for wireless optical communication based on organic photodetectors.








Abstract
The exponential growth of data in the information era has pushed conventional optical communication technology to its limitations, including inefficient spectral utilization, slow data rate, and inherent security vulnerabilities. Here, a transformative high&#8208;speed organic spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology enabled by a flexible, miniaturized, and high&#8208;performance organic hyperspectrometer is proposed that integrates ultrahigh&#8208;speed data transmission with hardware&#8208;level encryption. By synergistically combining organic photodetector arrays with tunable responsivities and spectral&#8208;tunable organic filters, the organic hyperspectrometer achieves a broad spectral detection range of 400 to 900 nm, resolution of 1.08 nm, accuracy of 0.60 nm, and response time of 684 ns. Unlike prior optical wireless communication systems, the organic hyperspectrometer&#8208;based SWC platform uniquely decodes high&#8208;speed encrypted data at the hardware level, which is a breakthrough in secure, high&#8208;speed, and high&#8208;capacity communication. Harnessing the full visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectrum, the SWC system achieves a theoretical data rate of 9.1 Gbits s&#8722;1, ranking as the highest&#8208;speed organic optical communication system. Furthermore, the intrinsic flexibility and bandgap&#8208;tunability of organic materials enable unparalleled portability, adaptability, and scalability of organic SWC, establishing a scalable framework for terahertz&#8208;scale data transmission. These advancements mark a pivotal leap toward secure, high&#8208;speed, and ultracompact optical networks for the future data&#8208; and AI&#8208;driven era.

         <title>Observation of &#957; = 5/2 Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in Trilayer Graphene Proximitized by V&#8208;Doped WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even&#8208;denominator 5/2 fractional state in trilayer graphene/V&#8208;doped WSe2 heterostructure, mediated by proximitized magnetism, is demonstrated. An exceptionally high energy gap &#8710;5/2 (48 K) for the 5/2 state, significantly surpassing previous values in semiconductors and bilayer graphene (&#8710;5/2 &lt; 1 K) is reported. The large &#8710;5/2 is essential for probing the non&#8208;Abelian nature of the 5/2 state and has implications for fault&#8208;tolerant topological quantum computation.








Abstract
Graphene has long been a test bed for observing strongly correlated phenomena owing to its 2D nature and ability to host high carrier mobility. However, the lack of intrinsic magnetism and weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling limits its ability to host strong electronic correlations. Here, observation of strongly correlated phenomena in trilayer graphene (TLG) proximitized by a ferromagnetic V&#8208;doped WSe2 (V&#8208;WSe2) overlayer is reported. These include the emergence of an odd&#8208; and even&#8208;denominator fractional quantum Hall state at &#957;&#8197; = 5/2 and reentrant integer quantum Hall effect in the hole regime of the TLG, driven by proximate magnetism from the V&#8208;WSe2. A remarkably large activation energy gap (&#916;5/2 = 48 &#177; 5 K) for the 5/2 fractional state is observed, which is essential for probing its non&#8208;Abelian nature. Furthermore, the large &#916;5/2&#8197;significantly enhances its feasibility for topological quantum computation by exponentially suppressing the error rates. Additionally, the formation of three additional Dirac cones, termed Dirac &#8220;gullies,&#8221; is observed, which manifest as threefold&#8208;degenerate Landau levels in magnetotransport measurements. These findings not only advance the role of magnetism in graphene&#8208;based heterostructures but also open pathways toward studying non&#8208;Abelian quasiparticles for their exotic fundamental and technological implications.

         <title>Emergence of Polar Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pair Arrays in Multiferroic Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable 4.5&#160;nm&#8208;period polar vortex&#8211;antivortex arrays are realized in multiferroic/dielectric (BiFeO3/DyScO3) superlattices, which retain structural integrity above 350&#160;&#176;C, exhibit electrical switching, and display periodicity tunable via atomic&#8208;scale layer thickness control&#8212;offering a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density, low&#8208;power topological memory.








Abstract
Ferroelectric topologies, renowned for their nanoscale dimensions and external electric field tunability, are emerging as leading candidates for high&#8208;density, low&#8208;power memory devices in the Big Data era. While polar configurations such as vortices, flux&#8208;closure domains, center&#8208;type domains, skyrmions, and merons have been extensively explored, antivortices remain largely underdeveloped. In this work, the discovery and realization of stable polar vortex&#8208;antivortex pair arrays within multiferroic&#8208;dielectric superlattices are reported with integrated experimental and theoretical efforts, enabled by low&#8208;symmetry BiFeO3 with diagonal spontaneous polarization. By employing atomic&#8208;level engineering to precisely modulate the architecture of BiFeO3 layers, achieving unprecedented periodicities as small as 4.5&#160;nm. These arrays exhibit exceptional thermal stability, preserving their structural integrity above room temperature, and reversible polarization switching under applied electric fields. Additionally, the sensitivity of domain wall configurations to the dielectric layer thickness offers further tunability. These findings not only expand the scope of ferroelectric topologies but also provide a versatile platform for harnessing antivortices in practical applications, paving the way for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density, low&#8208;power memory technologies.

         <title>Universal Method for Covalent Attachment of Hydrogels to Diverse Polymeric Surfaces for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, reagent&#8208;free strategy is presented for covalently attaching hydrogels to diverse polymeric substrates through reactive oxygen species. The scalable, linker&#8208;free approach enables robust adhesion and broad material compatibility, advancing the fabrication of hybrid solid&#8211;hydrogel systems for next&#8208;generation biomedical devices and bioprinting applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels, renowned for their biocompatibility and capacity to mimic biological tissues, are integral to many biomedical applications, such as implantable devices and wound dressings. However, their poor mechanical strength and the challenge of achieving durable adhesion to polymeric surfaces have hindered their broader utility. Current methods of creating hybrid solid&#8208;hydrogel (HSH) structures often rely on complex chemical linkers, adding steps, cytotoxic risks, and scalability issues. Here, a novel, reagent&#8208;free method that covalently bonds hydrogels to polymeric substrates directly via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is introduced. Through an evaporation&#8208;induced enhanced concentration (EIEC) approach, robust hydrogel layers are formed on ROS&#8208;functionalized surfaces, eliminating the need for silane&#8208;based linkers and achieving up to 60&#160;kPa adhesion strength in wet conditions. This strategy offers robust hydrogel adhesion, reduces processing complexity, and preserves cytocompatibility, as demonstrated by the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and THP&#8208;1 derived macrophages with minimal immune response. Applicable across various hydrogels, such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), chitosan, and polymeric substrates, including Teflon, polyethylene, and polycaprolactone (PCL), this dry process holds substantial promise for integration into advanced biomanufacturing systems, such as 3D bioprinters, unlocking new potentials in tissue engineering and biomedical device fabrication.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation of Adaptive Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Molecules via B&#8592;N Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamically tunable butterfly&#8208;shaped molecular system based on B&#8592;N coordination enables force&#8208;driven transitions between bistable stacking conformations. Single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements reveal distinct charge transport mechanisms, which are modulated by external electric fields, substituent effects, and quantum interference effects. These findings highlight the potential of B&#8592;N interactions in designing multiunit functional molecular junctions with tailored electronic characteristics.








Abstract
Achieving dynamic control over stereostructures and electronic properties of rigid molecules remains a significant challenge due to the delicate balance between stability and flexibility. Here, the construction of butterfly&#8208;shaped molecular junctions stabilized by moderate&#8208;strength boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) coordination between boraacenes and pyridines is reported. By leveraging the pivot&#8208;like flexibility of B&#8592;N bonds, molecular conductance switching with on/off ratios exceeding 100 is achieved through force&#8208;driven dynamic transitions between distinct stacking conformations. Single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements combined with first&#8208;principle calculations identify distinct charge transport mechanisms&#8212;through&#8208;space and through&#8208;bond&#8212;associated with the butterfly&#8208;wing open and closed configurations. Furthermore, external factors like electric fields and substituent effects modulate &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and charge transport properties. The introduction of destructive quantum interference effects can be achieved by replacing molecular units. The findings demonstrate that B&#8592;N coordination serves as a dynamically tunable linkage, offering a pathway to design molecular platforms with multifunctional units, customized stereo&#8208;conformations, and quantum effects.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Micromotors in Air Propelled by Thermal Convection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;driven micromotors in air can overcome gravity and generate convective motion by a light&#8208;induced thermal mechanism driven by a temperature gradient in the air caused by the interaction of the gold nanoparticles present on the surface of ZnO and NIR irradiation. NaGdF4:Er, Yb upconverting nanoparticles enable temperature quantification on the micromotors' surface through luminescence nanothermometry. Tracking of motion and speed quantification is achieved with a microscope camera, light scattering and software tracking. Schematic created using BioRender.








Abstract
Micromotors are an attractive cutting&#8208;edge technology that exhibit controllable motion in response to chemical reactions or external stimuli. These nature&#8208;inspired materials are widely explored for use in environmental remediation, and drug delivery, other emerging applications. Until now, the micromotors field is restricted to applications in aqueous environments, as achieving controllable motion in air while overcoming gravity remains a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, to our knowledge, we introduce a system capable of overcoming gravity to achieve light&#8208;induced thermal convective motion in air, driven by near&#8208;infrared light excitation. The micromotors are composed of spiky, pollen&#8208;like ZnO microparticles coated with gold nanoparticles, which interact photothermally with the NIR light, generating a thermal gradient that induces propulsion of the micromotor system. Lanthanide&#8208;doped upconverting nanoparticles are deposited onto the micromotor surface to enable nanothermometric monitoring of surface temperature, providing critical information needed to describe the system's thermal behavior in air. This micromotor platform provides a versatile approach to overcome gravity and induce a controllable movement in a gaseous matrix, opening new opportunities to develop proof&#8208;of&#8208;concepts and applications using this aerodynamic micromotor approach.

         <title>Phase Stabilization of In2Se3 by Disordered Ni Intercalation and its Enhanced Thermoelectrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that disordered Ni intercalation in In2Se3 stabilizes the phase structure, enhances electrical conductivity, and reduces thermal conductivity. This strategy improves the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT by 86% (in&#8208;plane) and 222% (out&#8208;of&#8208;plane) at 500&#160;&#176;C, providing new insights for optimizing layered thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials have gained significant attention owing to their distinctive structure and unique properties. The weak interlayer bonding in vdW layered materials enables guest atom intercalation, allowing precise tuning of their physical and chemical properties. In this work, a ternary compound, NixIn2Se3 (x = 0&#8211;0.3), with Ni randomly occupying the interlayers of In2Se3, is synthesized via an intercalation route driven by electron injection. The intercalated Ni atoms act as &#8220;anchor points&#8221; within the interlayer of In2Se3, which effectively suppresses the phase transition of In2Se3 at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the disordered Ni intercalation significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of In2Se3 through electron injection, while reducing the thermal conductivity due to the interlayer phonon scattering, leading to an improved thermoelectric performance. For instance, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of Ni0.3In2Se3 increased by 86% (in&#8208;plane) and 222% (out&#8208;of&#8208;plane) compared to In2Se3 at 500&#160;&#176;C. These findings not only provide an effective strategy to enhance the performance of layered thermoelectric materials but also demonstrate the potential of intercalation chemistry for expanding the application scope of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials.

         <title>Anisotropic Optoelectronic Synapses in 2D Nb2GeTe4 for Direction&#8208;Programmable Neuromorphic Perception and Decision&#8208;Making</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck. Using anisotropic 2D Nb2GeTe4, dual electronic&#8208;optical synapses with directional plasticity are developed: 98.3% accuracy along a&#8208;axis vs 88.3% along b&#8208;axis under electrical&#8208;optical co&#8208;stimulation. This enables compact neuromorphic hardware with co&#8208;stimulation processing, demonstrated in high&#8208;accuracy machine vision (89.6%) and vehicle navigation (90.2%). It advances multimodal sensing for edge AI and robotics.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing presents a promising solution for the von Neumann bottleneck, enabling energy&#8208;efficient and intelligent sensing platforms. Although 2D materials are ideal for bioinspired neuromorphic devices, achieving multifunctional synaptic operations with simple configurations and linear weight updates remains challenging. Inspired by biological axons, the in&#8208;plane anisotropy of 2D Nb2GeTe4 is exploited to develop dual electronic&#8208;optical synaptic devices. The device exhibits anisotropic hole mobilities (137.97 cm2 V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the a&#8208;axis and 78.29 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the b&#8208;axis) and a wavelength&#8208;dependent photoresponse. This enables directional synaptic plasticity under electrical&#8208;optical co&#8208;stimulation, achieving 98.3% accuracy along the a&#8208;axis and 88.3% along the b&#8208;axis in adaptive image processing. A machine vision system with 89.6% object recognition accuracy and an intelligent vehicle navigation platform with 90.2% decision&#8208;making accuracy is also demonstrated. The integration of anisotropic transport and spectrally tunable responses in a single material paves the way for compact neuromorphic hardware with multimodal sensing and parallel processing capabilities. This study advances 2D material&#8208;based neuroelectronics for edge computing, autonomous robotics, and adaptive artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Niobium Oxide Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters Boosting Charge Transfer for Highly Reversible Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly unsaturated, sub&#8208;nanoscale niobium&#8208;oxide clusters (&#8776;0.7&#160;nm) anchored on defective carbon feature self&#8208;adaptive Nb4+/Nb5+ redox pairs that dynamically mediate polysulfide conversion in ether&#8208;based, room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. A distinct d&#8208;band center self&#8208;regulation mechanism simultaneously accelerates the sulfur&#8208;reduction and sulfur&#8208;oxidation half&#8208;reactions, sustaining high capacity with an ultra&#8208;low capacity&#8208;fade rate over 3000 cycles.








Abstract
Ether&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#9472;S) batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage system, yet hindered by the unregulated sulfur redox pathway, severe polysulfide shuttling and rapid capacity fading. Herein, highly unsaturated niobium&#8208;oxide sub&#8208;nanoclusters (&#8776;0.7&#160;nm) anchored on defective carbon black (NbOx&#8208;DCB) as a dynamic sulfur&#8208;conversion catalyst are introduced. The delocalized Nb d&#8208;electrons in the sub&#8208;nanocluster configuration create a mixed Nb4+/Nb5+ valence state that functions as a bidirectional electron reservoir, thereby enabling a distinct d&#8208;band&#8208;center self&#8208;regulation mechanism. The strong d&#8211;p orbital coupling enabled by a Nb4+&#8208;rich surface effectively captures sodium polysulfides and accelerates sulfur conversion kinetics during discharge, while a Nb5+&#8208;rich surface promotes facile solid&#8208;polysulfide decomposition during charging. Consequently, the NbOx&#8208;DCB/S cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 1184&#160;mAh&#160;gS&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles and retains 547&#160;mAh&#160;gS&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to a decay rate of 0.0027% per cycle. The general applicability&#160;of this approach is validated by high&#8208;performance tungsten and vanadium oxide sub&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;based sulfur cathodes. These findings highlight sub&#8208;nanoscale metal&#8208;oxide engineering as a versatile route to high&#8208;performance RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Competing Grain Growth Pathways in Anisotropic Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ microscopy and simulations, this study unravels competing grain growth pathways in Bi2Te3&#8208;based nanoplates. It is found that pure Bi2Te3 nanoplates undergo predominantly surface&#8208;driven reshaping, while Sb&#8208;doping alters interfacial chemistry to promote collective grain merging. This work demonstrates how grain boundary modification can rationally steer microstructural evolution for advanced thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
Thermoelectric nanoplates derived from anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials such as Bi2Te3 are pivotal for flexible electronics and microscale thermal management. Their performance critically depends on grain boundary (GB) microstructure, but the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms governing grain growth in these highly anisotropic systems remain elusive. This particularly concerns the competition between individual nanoplate reshaping driven by facet stabilization and collective merging at GBs. Integrating in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these competing pathways in pure Bi2Te3 (BT) and Sb&#8208;doped (BST) systems are unraveled. Undoped BT nanoplates preferentially undergo atomically localized reshaping, with atoms migrating from high&#8208;energy edges to stabilize low&#8208;energy facets. Conversely, Sb doping introduces Sb&#8208;Te interfacial phases that thermodynamically favor GB coalescence, thereby shifting the dominant pathway to collective merging. This work reveals how chemical modification steers GB evolution, determining whether reshaping or merging predominates. Such understanding is crucial for rationally designing anisotropic layered materials for applications in flexible electronics, topological materials, and energy&#8208;efficient devices.

A stable Z&#8208;scheme FexInySz/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates 1.16&#160;% solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency for CO2 reduction under natural sunlight for four consecutive days, as photothermal synergy stretches electrons from O to Fe and optimizes active sites.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green promising approach for CO2 reduction. Metal sulfides are widely studied in this field due to the high&#8208;efficiency, however, most of them are prone to photo&#8208;corrosion. Herein, a stable and efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction catalyst is reported, FexInySz/TiO2 owing an orderly drawing photo&#8208;thermal synergistic electron flow for CO2 reduction in a field experiment. The tests under natural sunlight conditions demonstrated that FexInySz/TiO2 has a stability of 4 natural days. The maximum photothermal energy conversion efficiency is 1.16%, which is the highest record under concentrated natural sunlight for CO2 reduction with pure water. The in situ rapid&#8208;scan XANES and XPS show the raising temperature and photo&#8208;irradiation synergistically stretch electrons from O to Fe, revealing the mechanism of thermal modulation to optimize the active sites for efficient and stable photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work pioneers the stable and efficient reduction of CO2 under outdoor sunlight conditions, providing a theoretical foundation for the outdoor application of this technology.

         <title>Pure&#8208;Green Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Enantiomers with Discontinuous Fused Benzene Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circularly polarized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) molecular engineering composed of discontinuous fused benzene rings is proposed, and obtains a pair of green BN[7]helicene&#8208;based emitters (P/M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz. (P) and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz&#8208;based electroluminescence devices deliver pure&#8208;green emission peaking at 516&#160;nm, with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.72), electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of +5.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3/&#8722;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 37.3%/36.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Helicene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials suffer from severely low color purity in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Here, a novel molecular engineering strategy is introduced by replacing helicene containing continuous fused benzene rings with a multiple resonance (MR) framework comprising discontinuous fused benzene rings. This approach effectively suppresses high&#8208;frequency C&#9472;C bond stretching vibrations and enhances short&#8208;range charge transfer, enabling high color purity, CPL activity, and efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept green BN[7]helicene&#8208;based emitters (P/M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz display bright and narrowband green emission peaking at 512&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Notably, the enantiomers (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz exhibit narrowband CPL spectra with FWHMs of 26 and 25&#160;nm, the Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.72) and (0.15, 0.72), and photoluminescence dissymmetry factors of +2.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs deliver pure&#8208;green emission, characterized by a peak wavelength of 516&#160;nm, a narrow FWHM of 27&#160;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.72), representing the purest green CP&#8208;OLEDs reported to date. Furthermore, these devices exhibit high electroluminescence dissymmetry factors of +5.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3/&#8722;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, and maximum external quantum efficiencies of 37.3% and 36.6%, respectively.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room&#8208;Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first room&#8208;temperature, zero&#8208;field observation of stable skyrmion&#8211;hopfion spin textures in EuS&#9472;Bi2Se3&#9472;EuS trilayers is reported. Combining Lorentz TEM imaging and micromagnetic modeling, the authors unveil how interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and geometric confinement stabilize these multidimensional topological states. These findings offer a pathway toward ultralow&#8208;power spintronic devices harnessing robust, chiral magnetism in engineered topological heterostructures.








Abstract
Topological spin configurations, such as soliton&#8208;like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have recently emerged in fundamental science and technology. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room temperature is crucial for their use as long&#8208;range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation are hindered by multi&#8208;step field training and competing interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multidimensional topological spin textures is desirable, with skyrmions forming swirling, hedgehog&#8208;like spin structures in two dimensions and hopfions as their twisted 3D counterparts. Here, the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field is reported, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion&#8208;hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modeling, the experimental observations of hopfion&#8208;skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. This model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy, and Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction. This study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetic topological carriers, paving the way for ultralow&#8208;power and high&#8208;density information processing.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Imaging&#8208;Guided Self&#8208;Penetrating Nanomotors for Millimeter&#8208;Scale Deep Thrombolysis Tracking and Accelerated Embolus Clearance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;propulsive nanomotors enable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided microemboli diagnosis and real&#8208;time thrombolysis monitoring at millimeter&#8208;scale resolution. Based on the active penetration&#8208;promoted thermoablation and chemical lysis, these nanomotors achieve efficient, rapid, safe thrombolysis in both posterior auricular artery thrombosis and submillimeter&#8208;sized microemboli&#8208;induced pulmonary embolism models.








Abstract
Pulmonary embolism (PE), a life&#8208;threatening condition caused by thromboembolic obstruction of pulmonary arteries, demands urgent therapeutic interventions and precise diagnostic strategies to prevent systemic complications. Current thrombolytic therapies and imaging modalities face critical limitations, including hemorrhagic risks from high&#8208;dose fibrinolytic drugs and insufficient sensitivity for detecting microemboli or dynamically tracking thrombolytic progression. Herein, a self&#8208;propelling nanomotor platform is reported that integrates second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided navigation, thrombus&#8208;targeting capability, and synergistic thrombolysis for real&#8208;time theranostics management of PE. Leveraging a relatively high fluorescence quantum yield (1.08%) for NIR&#8208;II probes and prolonged circulation half&#8208;life (7.2 h), these nanomotors enable sensitive detection of submillimeter microemboli and sustained, millimeter&#8208;level precision monitoring of thrombolytic progression. Through a self&#8208;penetration&#8208;enhanced synergistic therapy&#8208; combining thermal ablation and chemical lysis, the platform achieved rapid vascular recanalization, exceeding 95% efficiency within a shortened therapeutic timeframe, using only 13.6% of the clinical urokinase (UK) dose. Validation in both the posterior auricular artery thrombosis (PAAT) and submillimeter microemboli&#8208;induced PE models demonstrated accelerated embolus clearance, precision thrombolytic monitoring, and excellent biosafety without secondary embolism or hemorrhagic complications. This work demonstrates the significant potential of multifunctional nanomotors for the precision management of thrombotic disorders.

Herein, a self-propelling nanomotor platform is reported that integrates second near-infrared window (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging-guided navigation, thrombus-targeting capability, and synergistic thrombolysis for real-time theranostics management of PE. Leveraging a relatively high fluorescence quantum yield (1.08%) for NIR-II probes and prolonged circulation half-life (7.2 h), these nanomotors enable sensitive detection of submillimeter microemboli and sustained, millimeter-level precision monitoring of thrombolytic progression. Through a self-penetration-enhanced synergistic therapy- combining thermal ablation and chemical lysis, the platform achieved rapid vascular recanalization, exceeding 95% efficiency within a shortened therapeutic timeframe, using only 13.6% of the clinical urokinase (UK) dose. Validation in both the posterior auricular artery thrombosis (PAAT) and submillimeter microemboli-induced PE models demonstrated accelerated embolus clearance, precision thrombolytic monitoring, and excellent biosafety without secondary embolism or hemorrhagic complications. This work demonstrates the significant potential of multifunctional nanomotors for the precision management of thrombotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctionally Driven Organic Photonic Conversion Devices Facilitated by Minimalistic Synthesis&#8208;Based Interfacial Energetic Alignment</title>

A benzene&#8208;phosphonic acid self&#8208;assembled monolayer (BPA) simultaneously optimizes hole extraction and noise suppression, enabling bifunctional organic photovoltaics&#8211;photodetectors that deliver superb indoor performance and commercial viability. BPA&#8208;devices achieve 28.6% PCE at 1000 lx, retain 93% efficiency on large&#8208;scaled devices, and reach 584 fW NEP with a 103 kHz 3dB bandwidth, while cutting production costs by 720%.








Abstract
Bifunctional integration of indoor organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) faces fundamental challenges because of incompatible interfacial thermodynamics: indoor OPVs require unimpeded charge extraction under low&#8208;light conditions (200&#8211;1000&#160;lx), whereas OPDs require stringent suppression of noise current. Conventional hole transport layers (HTLs) fail to satisfy these opposing charge&#8208;dynamic requirements concurrently with commercial practicality (large&#8208;area uniformity, photostability, and cost&#8208;effective manufacturability). This study introduces benzene&#8208;phosphonic acid (BPA)&#8212;a minimalist self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM)&#8208;based HTL with a benzene core and phosphonic acid anchoring group&#8212;enabling cost&#8208;effective synthesis and excellent ITO interfacial properties such as energy alignment, uniform monolayer, and stability. This molecular design resolves core limitations and achieves high indoor OPV efficiency (28.6% PCE at 1000&#160;lx LED 2700 K), maintains 93% PCE retention when scaled by &#8776;220&#215; area, and delivers competitive self&#8208;powered (V = 0&#160;V) OPD performance (noise equivalent power = 584 fW at bandwidth = 1&#160;Hz and wavelength = 730&#160;nm; 3&#160;dB frequency = 103&#160;kHz). Simplified synthesis of BPA reduces production costs by 720% ($0.042 cm&#8722;2) and achieves 9&#215; higher power&#8208;per&#8208;cost ratio (19.25 mW&#8729;$&#8722;1) relative to its&#160;counterpart SAM. Synergy between performance and commercial practicality positions BPA&#8208;HTL as a transformative enabler for self&#8208;powered IoT and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Pyroelectric Enhanced Catalytic Oxidation: A Universal Strategy for Low&#8208;Temperature Gas Phase Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in promoting heterogeneous catalytic reaction processes, but how to generate ROS continuously during the catalyst process remains a challenge. Here, the authors propose a pyroelectric&#8208;enhanced catalytic oxidation strategy to achieve efficient and continuous formation of ROS.








Abstract
In the field of gas phase catalysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role, but how to improve catalytic efficiency and lifetime by forming ROS efficiently and sustainably during the catalytic process is a challenge for high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, a pyroelectric enhanced catalytic oxidation (PECO) strategy is reported that can effectively enhance the catalytic oxidation efficiency and life of the catalyst by constantly generation of ROS. When gaseous pollutants of formaldehyde (HCHO) are catalytically degraded by conductive aerogel catalysts of MnOx, the HCHO to CO2 conversion efficiency is increased by &#8776;300% to 95.33% at a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV: 600 L&#160;gcat.&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) using the pyroelectric effect of BaTiO3, and the efficiency attenuation is less than 3% during the continuous catalytic process of 1200&#160;h. The experimental and theoretical analysis confirm that the pyroelectric effect contributes to improving valence transition of Mn3+/Mn4+ and electron transfer of oxygen&#8208;containing molecules thus leading to the continuous formation of ROS. The PECO strategy provides a simple and effective approach for ROS engineering and has broad application prospects in the field of catalysis.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Engineered Protein Delivery via Integrated Covalent Coupling and Pathological Triggers for Precision Microenvironment Reprogramming in Tissue Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive biomaterial platform is developed for spatiotemporally controlled factor delivery in response to phase&#8208;specific enzymes (MMP2/thrombin). Using natural biomaterials (HA, SCECM, chitosan) and enzymatic conjugation (Sortase A), the system precisely delivers each protein in spinal cord and myocardial infarction models, this sequential release strategy significantly enhances tissue repair by optimizing the therapeutic window.








Abstract
Tissue injury presents a complex microenvironment with temporal pathological dynamics, necessitating precision therapeutic strategies. However, current interventions lack effective measures that precisely respond to and modulate the dynamic changes in the microenvironment. Herein, a biomaterial&#8208;driven platform based on covalent conjugation and enzyme&#8208;responsive release, enabling the spatiotemporally controlled delivery of regenerative and immunomodulatory factors, is developed. Following tissue injury, the early&#8208;phase protease thrombin and the delayed&#8208;phase matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP2) serve as endogenous triggers that correspond to distinct stages of the microenvironmental evolution. By site&#8208;specific covalent conjugation via Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated transpeptidation to intraluminal aligned fibers, combined with outer encapsulation within T&#8208;HA (thrombin&#8208;responsive cleavable hyaluronic acid gel), it is discovered that sequential delivery (CNTF/FGF2 followed by IL&#8208;4) significantly enhances spinal cord injury (SCI) recovery compared to reverse sequencing (IL&#8208;4 followed by CNTF/FGF2). Likewise, SrtA&#8208;mediated protein conjugation to HA demonstrates that FGF2 delivery preceding IL&#8208;4 resulted in superior cardiac functional restoration in the myocardial infarction (MI) model. This spatiotemporally system optimizes the critical therapeutic window for inflammation and tissue remodeling after injury, offering a versatile paradigm for addressing the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of injured tissues.

         <title>Breaking Efficiency Barrier: Dual&#8208;Channel Energy Transfer Enables Record 1540&#160; nm NIR LEDs from Er3+&#8208;Doped Cs3DyI6 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs3DyI6:Er3+ perovskite achieves strong 1540 nm emission via synergistic dual energy transfer pathways (STE &#8594; Er3+ and Dy3+ &#8594; Er3+), enhanced by phonon&#8208;assisted processes. This mechanism enables high&#8208;performance NIR LEDs with record EQE and stability, promising for optical communication applications.








Abstract
Er3+&#8208;doped 1.54 &#181;m light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in the optical communication C&#8208;band are central to the development of integrated photonic systems. Given the pressing need for efficient, stable, cost&#8208;effective, and low&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven 1.54 &#181;m light sources, a lanthanide&#8208;based metal halide Cs3DyI6:Er3+ nanocrystal is engineered with a tetragonal phase structure. The study reveals a unique dual&#8208;channel energy transfer mechanism. The 574 nm emission, stemming from 4F9/2&#8208;2H13/2 orbital transitions of Dy3+ ions, enables phonon&#8208;assistant energy transfer to excite 4I15/2&#8208; 4S3/2 of Er3+ ions. Meanwhile, self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) contribute additional energy via a 488 nm broadband emission to excite 4I15/2&#8208;4F7/2 of Er3+. The two pathways synergize to facilitate efficient 1.54 &#181;m emission from Er3+ ions, overcoming limitations of traditional single&#8208;path energy transfer systems. To optimize device performance, 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (TPPO) is employed for passivating surface defects to enhance the overall photoluminescence quantum yield up to 87.4%. Precise control of the LiF interlayer thickness (1&#8211;2 nm) achieves balanced electron&#8211;hole injection, significantly improving both external quantum efficiency (EQE) and operational stability. The fabricated infrared LED device demonstrates outstanding performance, with a record EQE of 2.76% at 1.54 &#181;m and a half&#8208;life of 345 min, marking a significant milestone in optical communication technology.

Given the pressing need for efficient, stable, cost-effective, and low-voltage-driven 1.54 &#181;m light sources, a lanthanide-based metal halide Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;DyI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;:Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; nanocrystal is engineered with a tetragonal phase structure. The study reveals a unique dual-channel energy transfer mechanism. The 574 nm emission, stemming from &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;9/2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;13/2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital transitions of Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, enables phonon-assistant energy transfer to excite &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;15/2&lt;/sub&gt;- &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; of Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Meanwhile, self-trapped excitons (STEs) contribute additional energy via a 488 nm broadband emission to excite &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;15/2&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;7/2&lt;/sub&gt; of Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The two pathways synergize to facilitate efficient 1.54 &#181;m emission from Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, overcoming limitations of traditional single-path energy transfer systems. To optimize device performance, 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-trioxane (TPPO) is employed for passivating surface defects to enhance the overall photoluminescence quantum yield up to 87.4%. Precise control of the LiF interlayer thickness (1&#8211;2 nm) achieves balanced electron&#8211;hole injection, significantly improving both external quantum efficiency (EQE) and operational stability. The fabricated infrared LED device demonstrates outstanding performance, with a record EQE of 2.76% at 1.54 &#181;m and a half-life of 345 min, marking a significant milestone in optical communication technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This work presents an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; polymer electrode&#8208;electrolyte material that integrates ion&#8208;conducting pathways and redox&#8208;active centers via covalent bonding. The polymer not only exhibits appreciable Li&#8314; conductivity, but also delivers a high reversible capacity below 2.5 V, driven by a potential&#8208;gated electronic structure transformation. This multifunctionality enables a versatile solid&#8208;state battery with integrated design, flexibility, and high energy density.








Abstract
The development of practical solid&#8208;state batteries is hindered by their high interfacial resistance and sluggish diffusion properties, primarily due to the heterogeneous interfaces between the solid electrolyte and the electrode. Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one polymer electrode&#8208;electrolyte material (P(EO2&#8208;S3)) is presented, which covalently integrates ethylene oxide groups for Li+ transport and trisulfide linkages for redox&#8208;active sites. This material exhibits favorable ionic conductivity as a solid electrolyte, while its reversible redox activity activates below 2.5&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li, delivering a high reversible capacity of 491.7 mAh g&#8722;1. Leveraging P(EO2&#8208;S3) as both cathode and electrolyte, integrated cells (P(EO2&#8208;S3)@CP|P(EO2&#8208;S3)|Li) exhibit accelerated electrochemical kinetics while maintaining cycling stability in flexible devices over 20&#160;000 bending cycles. As a redox&#8208;active catholyte of LiFePO4, P(EO2&#8208;S3) increases the capacity of the composite cathode to 358.3 mAh g&#8722;1 based on LiFePO4 mass, achieving an electrode energy density of 585.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work establishes a new paradigm for multifunctional polymers that integrates ion transport and storage, offering a versatile platform for flexible, high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Adaptive Localized Ectopic Structure Enhances Regeneration of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural repair is crucial for regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. A lithium&#8208;rich, low&#8208;cobalt deep eutectic solvent repairs phase defects, induces ectopic sites, and facilitates adaptive reconstruction during annealing. This process generates adaptive localized ectopic structures, which form degradation barriers that control long&#8208;range disorder through the regulation of localized disorder.








Abstract
Direct regeneration has emerged as a budding strategy for recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet restoring the degraded crystal structure of the cathode remains a momentous handicap. Here, a novel deep eutectic solvent rich in lithium (Li) is developed that not only induces the formation of an adaptive local ectopic structure (ALES) characterized by disordered and localized cations, but also facilitates the separation of cathode sheets and replenishes depleted elements. Within ALES, ectopic cobalt (Co) sites boost Li+ diffusion by expanding the Li slab and forming octahedral coordination with low&#8208;spin Co3+, while ectopic Li modulates Co&#9472;O interactions, collaboratively impeding long&#8208;range structural disorder, mitigating lattice stress, and reducing charge density fluctuations. The synergistic interaction between the ectopic Co and Li enables in situ structural repair of spent lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), thereby restoring crystallinity and enhancing electrochemical performance. The regenerated LCO delivers a reversible capacity of 183.08 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C, with 87.01% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, outperforming commercial counterparts. This study offers a new pathway for addressing an urgent bottleneck in structure&#8208;targeted LIB regeneration.

         <title>Constructing 0D Bismuth&#8208;Metal Nanosphere Networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 Heteromorphic Junctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Acetaldehyde</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of Eucalyptus trees, a selective reduction strategy is proposed to grow bismuth nanosphere networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 (BWO) heteromorphic junctions, which consist of interwoven mesoporous nanofibers and nanosheets. The 0D/1D/2D Bi&#8208;BWO photocatalyst can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde and exhibits superior stability over five cycles. Its degradation rate significantly surpasses traditional BWO.








Abstract
Semiconductor photocatalysis holds great potential for the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), yet photocatalysts often experience low efficiency due to insufficient surface catalytic active sites, limited light absorption, and poor carrier separation efficiency. Inspired by the structure of Eucalyptus trees, a selective reduction strategy is proposed to grow bismuth nanosphere networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 (BWO) heteromorphic junctions, which consist of interwoven mesoporous nanofibers (NFs) and nanosheets (NSs). This establishes a synergistic mechanism of &#8220;surface active sites&#8208;intrinsic defects&#8208;carrier separation.&#8221; Initially, the electrospun BWO precursor NFs are calcined in air, resulting in 2D NSs growing radially along the NFs in an ordered, spaced arrangement to form 1D/2D BWO structures. Subsequently, under H2/Ar reduction, Bi3+ species are preferentially reduced to Bi&#8304; along the NF axes and NS corners, forming a dynamically evolved metal&#8208;defect regulatory system. The 0D/1D/2D Bi&#8208;BWO photocatalyst can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde and exhibits superior stability over five cycles. Its degradation rate is 3.5 times faster than that of 1D/2D BWO and significantly surpasses traditional BWO. This work presents a novel perspective for designing photocatalysts to efficiently remove VOCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Interfacial Defect Passivation and Free&#8208;Volume Reduction by Fluorinated Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable simultaneous multi&#8208;defect passivation and interfacial free&#8208;volume reduction for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells, three hole&#8208;transport materials featuring distinct fluorine distribution are systematically designed and compared. Benefiting from better interfacial passivation ability, lower interfacial free&#8208;volume, more intimate interface contact, and enhanced suppression of ion migration and perovskite degradation, AdF&#8208;BCz&#8208;based devices achieved a champion efficiency of 25.35% and excellent stability.








Abstract
Interfacial defects and free&#8208;volume between the perovskite layer and hole transport material (HTM) critically impact the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the interfacial issues of the PSCs are addressed by strategically modulating the fluorine distribution in N,N&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole (BCz)&#8208;based HTMs, specifically, fluorine is introduced either asymmetrically and symmetrically on the peripheral groups, yielding AdF&#8208;BCz and SdF&#8208;BCz, respectively. Through a combination of experimental characterization and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that AdF&#8208;BCz exhibits superior interfacial passivation stability against Pb2+ and I&#8211; related defects, as well as stronger adhesion to the perovskite surface compared to the fluorine&#8208;free NF&#8208;BCz and symmetrically substituted SdF&#8208;BCz. Moreover, AdF&#8208;BCz reduces interfacial free&#8208;volume, promotes more intimate contact at the interface, and enhances the suppression of ion migration and perovskite degradation. Consequently, the PSCs fabricated with AdF&#8208;BCz achieved a notable efficiency of 25.35%, outperforming devices based on SdF&#8208;BCz (23.12%) and NF&#8208;BCz (24.2%). Furthermore, unencapsulated AdF&#8208;BCz based PSCs exhibit respectable stability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiencies after 2000&#160;h under 30% relative humidity and 82% after 300&#160;h of continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C.

     alt="Simultaneous Interfacial Defect Passivation and Free-Volume Reduction by Fluorinated Hole Transport Materials for High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable simultaneous multi-defect passivation and interfacial free-volume reduction for high-performance perovskite solar cells, three hole-transport materials featuring distinct fluorine distribution are systematically designed and compared. Benefiting from better interfacial passivation ability, lower interfacial free-volume, more intimate interface contact, and enhanced suppression of ion migration and perovskite degradation, AdF-BCz-based devices achieved a champion efficiency of 25.35% and excellent stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interfacial defects and free-volume between the perovskite layer and hole transport material (HTM) critically impact the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the interfacial issues of the PSCs are addressed by strategically modulating the fluorine distribution in &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-bicarbazole (BCz)-based HTMs, specifically, fluorine is introduced either asymmetrically and symmetrically on the peripheral groups, yielding AdF-BCz and SdF-BCz, respectively. Through a combination of experimental characterization and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that AdF-BCz exhibits superior interfacial passivation stability against Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and I&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; related defects, as well as stronger adhesion to the perovskite surface compared to the fluorine-free NF-BCz and symmetrically substituted SdF-BCz. Moreover, AdF-BCz reduces interfacial free-volume, promotes more intimate contact at the interface, and enhances the suppression of ion migration and perovskite degradation. Consequently, the PSCs fabricated with AdF-BCz achieved a notable efficiency of 25.35%, outperforming devices based on SdF-BCz (23.12%) and NF-BCz (24.2%). Furthermore, unencapsulated AdF-BCz based PSCs exhibit respectable stability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiencies after 2000&#160;h under 30% relative humidity and 82% after 300&#160;h of continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semitransparent Photovoltaics via Reflection Optical Paths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work devises a reflective semitransparent photovoltaic (R&#8208;STPV) structure, which exploits a dual&#8208;surface reflection optical path to achieve equivalent transmission. By integrating a reflector that selectively reflects visible light, such a design enables a high&#8208;performance Si&#8208;based R&#8208;STPV with 14.4% efficiency and 92.2% visible light transmittance, setting a record light utilization efficiency of 13.28% among STPVs.








Abstract
Semitransparent photovoltaics (STPV) show great potential for building integration, but the imbalance between visible light transmission and power generation limits their practical applications. To overcome this, a reflective STPV (R&#8208;STPV) structure is proposed, via utilizing a dual&#8208;surface reflection optical path to achieve equivalent transmission. Unlike STPV systems relying on transmission optical paths, this design bypasses reflection losses and alleviates the stringent selective absorption requirements for the active layer. Thus, such design enables the fabrication of wavelength&#8208;selective STPVs using various high&#8208;performance photovoltaic materials such as silicon, CIGS, and CdTe. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an optical reflector is designed to selectively reflect visible light and transmit the invisible one, and by integrating it with the above PVs, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance R&#8208;STPV with appropriate optical geometry. Remarkably, the best Si&#8208;based R&#8208;STPV delivers a reliable efficiency of 14.4%, an average visible light transmittance of 92.2%, a record light utilization efficiency of 13.28% and an exceptional color rendering index of 99%. The versatility of R&#8208;STPV window technology makes it suitable for various building&#8208;integration application scenarios, and an average annual power generation of 69.8&#160;kWh&#160;year&#160;m&#8722;2 is obtained according to the simulation results. Therefore, this work paves a new path for high&#8208;performance solar windows that will contribute significantly to energy sustainability.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into Nanoparticle Exsolution at Dislocations in Dislocation&#8208;Engineered Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals an atomic&#8208;level correlation between bulk dislocations and the exsolution of surface nanoparticles through a novel approach for dislocation engineering in epitaxial thin films. Employing in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, two primary reasons for the frequent nucleation of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles are identified: the accumulation of exsolution&#8208;active acceptors along dislocations and lattice distortions induced by the dislocation structure.








Abstract
Achieving control over properties such as density and lateral distribution of catalytic nanoparticles under operation conditions is a major challenge for the development of active and durable catalysts, where nanoparticle coarsening is often the cause of performance degradation. While metal exsolution catalysts are regarded to be robust against this degradation mode, coarsening and increased concentrations of exsolved metal nanoparticles have been detected near extended defects. The present study examines the role of dislocations in metal exsolution reactions and explores the potential of dislocation&#8208;engineering for the synthesis of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles. An atomic&#8208;level correlation between bulk dislocations and surface nanoparticle locations is demonstrated through a novel approach for engineering epitaxial thin films with confined regions of increased dislocation densities in combination with in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. While nanoparticle exsolution proceeds across the entire sample, two primary reasons for the frequent nucleation of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles are identified: the accumulation of exsolution&#8208;active acceptors along dislocations and lattice distortions that are likely to lower the energy barrier for nanoparticle nucleation. This work establishes a proof of concept for using engineered dislocations in exsolution catalysts to synthesize nanoparticles with modified nanoparticle&#8208;support properties relevant for the thermal stability and the lateral distribution of exsolved nanoparticles.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Strain Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescence for Potential Nondestructive Artificial Joint Stress Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time stress sensing during total knee replacement procedure is expected to be realized based on near&#8208;infrared mechanoluminescent phosphor of Sr3Sn1.98Sb0.02O6.99, which has the lowest strain sensitivity as low as 50&#160;&#181;st. 








Abstract
Recently, joint replacement surgery is facing significant challenges of patient dissatisfaction and the need for revision procedures. In&#8208;situ monitoring of stress stability at the site of artificial joint replacement during postoperative evaluation is important. Mechanoluminescence (ML), a novel &#8220;force to light&#8221; conversion technology, may be used to monitor such bio&#8208;stress within tissues. However, this is hindered by ultraviolet&#8211;visible ML emission wavelength, low ML intensity, and high strain response sensitivity. Here, by incorporating Sb3+ ions into Sr3Sn2O7 crystals, a highly strain&#8208;responsive&#160;material, with ML originating from intrinsic defect emissions is obtained. The Sr3Sn1.98Sb0.02O6.99 film produces detectable ML signals under compressive strain as low as 50&#160;&#181;st in the absence of biological tissue. After pre&#8208;irradiating with red light through 15&#160;mm of porcine tissue, ML signals can still be detected through the same tissue thickness. Notably, this material enabled real&#8208;time stress imaging through 4&#160;mm of porcine skin during mild finger joint bending. This work presents a novel methodological framework and proposes a new mechanism to defect ML. It offers a fresh perspective for designing high&#8208;performance ML materials and lays the foundation for innovative research to enhance the functionality of artificial tissues and joints in living organism.

         <title>Temporally Reconfigurable Reservoir Computing with Flexible Electrolyte&#8208;Gated TFTs for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temporally reconfigurable reservoir computing system is developed using ultrathin, flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;gated thin&#8208;film transistors (UFLEX TFTs). By simply tuning temporal dynamics electrically, the system achieves 93.7% accuracy for MNIST handwritten digits, 90.3% for CIFAR&#8208;10 images, and 81.8% for chest X&#8208;rays, surpassing CNNs in efficiency. Combining strong performance and flexibility, UFLEX TFTs enable neuromorphic hardware for next&#8208;generation wearable edge devices.








Abstract
Reservoir computing (RC), a brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic algorithm, offers simplicity and efficiency for processing spatiotemporal signals. However, conventional RC systems face limitations in handling diverse temporal scales and spatial complexities due to invariant temporal dynamics. This study introduces a temporally reconfigurable RC system utilizing ultrathin, flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;gated thin&#8208;film transistors (UFLEX TFTs) with high performance: an on/off ratio of &#8776;107, endurance beyond 2.5 &#215; 104 pulses, and low variability. UFLEX TFTs, based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channels and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid AlOx dielectrics, enable modulation of temporal dynamics via simple electrical signals. The system maintains mechanical flexibility and robust performance after bending tests. By extracting features across varied temporal and spatial scales, it achieves classification accuracies of 90.3% for CIFAR&#8208;10 object images and 81.8% for NIH chest X&#8208;ray images. This work lays a foundation for flexible neuromorphic hardware systems capable of efficient, high&#8208;performance spatiotemporal signal processing.

UFLEX TFTs, based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) channels and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid AlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; dielectrics, enable modulation of temporal dynamics via simple electrical signals. The system maintains mechanical flexibility and robust performance after bending tests. By extracting features across varied temporal and spatial scales, it achieves classification accuracies of 90.3% for CIFAR-10 object images and 81.8% for NIH chest X-ray images. This work lays a foundation for flexible neuromorphic hardware systems capable of efficient, high-performance spatiotemporal signal processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A self&#8208;assembled vanadium hydrogel integrates multienzyme&#8208;mimetic V2O5 nanowires and bactericidal THPS via one&#8208;step nanoconstruction. This TME&#8208;responsive platform combines catalytic tumor suppression, infection prevention, and dynamic mechanoadaptivity to surgical niches. By reprogramming immunosuppressive microenvironments via M1 macrophage polarization and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell recruitment, the hydrogel pioneers a paradigm for precision postsurgical therapy through synergistic immunomodulation and localized intervention.








Abstract
Surgical resection remains the frontline intervention for cancer; however, postoperative tumor recurrence and wound infection remain critical unmet challenge in surgical oncology. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanowired hydrogel (V&#8208;Hydrogel) is developed through a facile one&#8208;step assembly employing enzyme&#8208;mimetic V2O5 nanowires and bactericidal crosslinker THPS. The V&#8208;Hydrogel reserves the glutathione peroxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, catalase&#8208;, and oxidase&#8208;mimetic enzymatic activities derived from vanadium oxide nanowires, thereby exhibiting efficient tumor&#8208;specific catalytic therapy. Simultaneously, the introduction of bactericide THPS endows the potent antibacterial capabilities of V&#8208;Hydrogel against surgical site infections. This hydrogel exhibits dynamic mechanical adaptability to the tumor microenvironment (f), ensuring conformal coverage of irregular resection cavities for precise therapy. Additionally, the V&#8208;Hydrogel can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME via polarizing macrophages into antitumor M1 phenotypes and recruiting cytotoxic T cells, thereby establishing systemic antitumor immunity. This multifunctional vanadium&#8208;integrated hydrogel platform, designed based on the pathological characteristics of postoperative tumors, addresses key limitations in conventional postoperative therapies, offering a strategy for postoperative adjuvant tumor therapy.

         <title>Regenerable Water Remediation Platform for Ultrafast Capture and Mineralization of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are effectively captured and mineralized by nitrate&#8208;intercalated copper&#8211;aluminum layered double hydroxides (CuAl LDH). The capture&#8211;thermal destruction&#8211;recycling process achieves ultrafast PFAS removal and regenerable water remediation. Regenerability is enabled by the memory effect of LDH, restoring the layered structure after thermal treatment and allowing repeated adsorption&#8208;destruction cycles with maintained performance.








Abstract
Concerns about per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) arise from their persistence, toxicity, and widespread presence in aquatic environments. Currently, activated carbon and ion exchange resins have been used to remove perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the most commonly studied PFAS, but these methods face challenges like low adsorption capacity and slow kinetics, leading to secondary waste issues. Here, it is observed that a high interlayer crystallinity of nitrate intercalated CuxAl layered double hydroxides (LDH) (CuxAl&#8208;NO3 LDH) enables a boundary&#8208;breaking performance of maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of PFOA as 1702&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at neutral pH and room temperature. The Al&#8208;Al clash within the cationic layers (basal plane disorder) enhances adsorption kinetics (k1 = 13.2 h&#8722;1), as determined by a 2H magic angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, PFOA&#8208;saturated Cu2Al&#8208;NO3 LDH can be regenerated through its memory effect, achieving &#8776;54% defluorination of the adsorbed PFOA in the presence of CaCO3 after the thermal treatment at 773 K (500&#160;&#176;C). Performance in continuous fixed&#8208;bed systems (720&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5 mL&#160;min&#8722;1) and PFOA&#8208;spiked real water matrices indicates the practical application potential of CuxAl&#8208;NO3 LDH, suggesting an effective integrated ultrafast capture&#8211;thermal destruction&#8211;recycling (CTR) process for treating PFAS&#8208;contaminated water.

         <title>Lanthanum&#8208;Induced Gradient Fields in Asymmetric Heterointerface Catalysts for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncontrolled atomic migration during the pyrolysis of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts often leads to disordered coordination environments, active site loss, and poor oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Herein, a La&#8208;mediated atomic migration strategy enables the fabrication of a well&#8208;defined asymmetric heterostructure (LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC) featuring a built&#8208;in electric field. This architecture stabilizes the Fe active sites, enhances interfacial charge transport, and delivers an outstanding oxygen electrocatalysis performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts display considerable potential as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble metals in oxygen electrocatalysis. However, uncontrolled atomic migration and random structural rearrangement during pyrolysis often lead to disordered coordination environments and sparse active sites, fundamentally limiting their intrinsic catalytic activities and long&#8208;term durability. Herein, a novel strategy is reported for use in directionally regulating atomic migration pathways via the incorporation of a foreign metal (La). By exploiting the differences in the atomic migration priorities via the Kirkendall effect, directional control of atomic diffusion is achieved to fabricate a well&#8208;defined asymmetric multiphase heterointerface catalyst (LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC). The presence of high&#8208;density, structurally well&#8208;defined active sites &#8211; along with a built&#8208;in directional electric field across the heterointerface &#8211; substantially enhances the efficiency of interfacial charge transport, thus improving the intrinsic activity and stability in oxygen electrocatalysis. When incorporated into a rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery, LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC delivers a high power density of 211 mW cm&#8722;2, with an exceptional cycling stability of &gt;240 h. This study establishes a generalizable atomic&#8208;level design strategy for use in engineering robust heterointerface catalysts and offers valuable insights for application in advancing next&#8208;generation renewable energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>High Performance Transmission&#8208;Type Daytime Radiative Cooling Film with a Simple and Scalable Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, scalable method fabricates transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling textiles by blending mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) transparent styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) with polyethylene, then selectively dissolving SEBS to create pores. The textile achieves 95% solar reflectivity, 80% mid&#8208;IR transmittance, and sub&#8208;ambient cooling of 4&#176;C. This process reduces production costs by 68% and CO2 emissions by 92% versus conventional methods.








Abstract
Transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling textiles represent a vital strategy for personal thermal management. However, traditional preparation methods based on heat&#8208;induced phase separation face significant challenges regarding cost, environmental impact, and optical performance. Herein, a novel preparation method is devloped by blending mid&#8208;IR transparent solid styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) with solid polyethylene (PE), enabling the creation of pores through dissolving SEBS. Consequently, large&#8208;scale production of transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling films at the meter scale are achieved, exhibiting 95% solar reflectivity and 80% mid&#8208;IR transmittance. Moreover, this method reduces costs by 68% and diminishes CO2 emissions by 92%. Under sunny and cloudy conditions (solar irradiance &#8776;730 and 280&#160;Wm&#8722;2, respectively), the film&#8208;covered simulated skin demonstrates sub&#8208;ambient cooling effects of &#8776;4 and 3&#160;&#176;C. Given its exceptional passive cooling capabilities, low&#8208;cost, and scalability, this film holds great potential for industrial and personal applications.

Consequently, large-scale production of transmission-type radiative cooling films at the meter scale are achieved, exhibiting 95% solar reflectivity and 80% mid-IR transmittance. Moreover, this method reduces costs by 68% and diminishes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 92%. Under sunny and cloudy conditions (solar irradiance &#8776;730 and 280&#160;Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively), the film-covered simulated skin demonstrates sub-ambient cooling effects of &#8776;4 and 3&#160;&#176;C. Given its exceptional passive cooling capabilities, low-cost, and scalability, this film holds great potential for industrial and personal applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Recycling of Degraded LiFePO4 Cathode Material via Natural Electron Donors Healing and Targeted Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated bulk and surface restoration strategy is proposed to regenerate spent LFP (S&#8208;LFP) via using natural tea polyphenols as electron donors to reduce Fe (III) phase and heal anti&#8208;site defects in the bulk, and introducing a hybrid AlPO4/Li3PO4 (AP/LP) patching coating at the fracture of carbon layer on LFP for targeted surface reconstruction, accompanied by Al doping into the bulk LFP.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent cathode materials is crucial for the sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. However, owing to the lack of targeted surface repair strategies, the regenerated LiFePO4 (LFP) always faces some issues, such as Fe ions re&#8208;migration and sluggish Li+ diffusion, or a serious trade&#8208;off between restored specific capacity and stability. Herein, an integrated bulk and surface restoration strategy is proposed to regenerate spent LFP (S&#8208;LFP) via using natural tea polyphenols as electron donors to reduce Fe (III) phase and heal anti&#8208;site defects in the bulk, and introducing a hybrid AlPO4/Li3PO4 (AP/LP) patching coating at the fracture of carbon layer on LFP for targeted surface reconstruction, accompanied by Al doping into the bulk LFP. Theoretical calculations reveal that AP/LP patching coating forms a dual electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;conducting layer with the residual carbon layer, coupling with strengthened Fe&#9472;O bonding by Al doping, to improve kinetics and stability of LFP during cycling. The optimized regenerated LFP cathode exhibits a capacity of 124.3 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles at 2C with a capacity retention of 92.1%. This scalable healing and stabilizing strategy have large potential to strike a balance between specific capacity repairing and stability improvement in the regeneration process.

         <title>Localized Gradient Conductivity Enabled Ultrasensitive Flexible Tactile Sensors with Ultrawide Linearity Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design of localized gradient conductivity is presented, combining low&#8208;&#963; CPDMS (carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane) and high&#8208;&#963; AgNWs (silver nanowires) to resolve the mutual restriction between sensitivity and linearity of piezoresistive tactile sensors. The derived series&#8208;parallel switching enables the ultrawide linear range (0&#8211;3000&#160;kPa) and ultrahigh sensitivity (1546.35 kPa&#8722;1). The work opens up promising strategies for future high&#8208;performance flexible tactile sensors toward diverse application scenarios.








Abstract
The high sensitivity and wide linearity are crucial for flexible tactile sensors in adapting to diverse application scenarios with high accuracy and reliability. However, conventional optimization strategies of constructing microstructures suffer from the mutual restriction between the high sensitivity and wide linearity. Herein, a novel design of localized gradient conductivity (LGC) with partly covered low&#8208;conductivity (low&#8208;&#963;) carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane layer on high&#8208;conductivity (high&#8208;&#963;) silver nanowires film upon the micro&#8208;dome structure is proposed. The LGC configuration enables a unique pressure&#8208;motivated series&#8208;parallel switching to allow the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components to separately take dominant effects in different pressure ranges. The ultrawide linearity can thus be realized by customizing the segmented linear current variation via the rationally associated coverage degree and conductivity gradient of the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components. Moreover, the ultrahigh sensitivity can be originally endowed by the conductivity difference between the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components without compromising linearity. The optimized sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 1546.35 kPa&#8722;1 within an ultrabroad linear sensing range of 0&#8211;3000&#160;kPa, which is first reported. With such an excellent sensing performance, the potential applications, e.g., reliable healthcare monitoring, convenient smart home control, and ground detection of intelligent vehicles, are successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Optically Controlled Memristor Enabling Synergistic Sensing&#8208;Memory&#8208;Computing for Neuromorphic Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel optically controlled KNbO3 memristor is developed. This device utilizes light&#8208;modulated oxygen vacancies to regulate the formation of conductive filaments, enabling nonvolatile switching behavior. The memristor demonstrated a high switching ratio (&gt;102), endurance 6 &#215; 106 cycles, extended retention (&gt;104 s), and pronounced light/dark contrast. These characteristics significantly enhance the visual perception capabilities under complex lighting conditions. The implementation achieved 96% image recognition accuracy, demonstrating substantial progress in bioinspired vision chip technology.








Abstract

Neuromorphic Visual Devices hold considerable promise for integration into neuromorphic vision systems that combine sensing, memory, and computing. This potential arises from their synergistic benefits in optical signal detection and neuro&#8208;inspired computational processes. However, current devices face challenges such as insufficient light/dark resistance ratios, mismatched transient photo&#8208;response, and volatile retention characteristics, limiting their adaptability to complex artificial vision systems. Here, a novel optically controlled memristor is developed by leveraging the unique properties of KNbO3, where resistive switching originates from the dynamic reconstruction of conductive filaments controlled by light&#8208;modulated oxygen vacancy charges. Experimental results reveal exceptional reconfigurable electrical characteristics across the 405&#8211;650 nm visible spectrum: optically triggered nonvolatile resistive switching, dual&#8208;modal dark&#8208;state operation, switching ratio &gt;102, endurance 6 &#215; 106 cycles, retention &gt;104 s, photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio &gt;102, and self&#8208;powered capability. The enhanced light/dark resistance contrast significantly improves visual perception in complex illumination environments, whereas the synergistic interplay between the dynamic photo&#8208;response and nonvolatile storage balances transient signal processing with persistent information retention. In integrated sensing&#8208;memory&#8208;computing tasks, the devices achieved recognition accuracies of 96% and 85% on the standard Jellyfish dataset and its low&#8208;illumination variant, demonstrating technical feasibility and providing a theoretically grounded solution with practical implications for the development of bioinspired vision chips.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Tunable Heliconical and Ferroelectric Nematics for White Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of the ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in 2017 and the spontaneous symmetry&#8208;breaking of the ferroelectric twist&#8208;bend nematic (NTBF)phase in 2024 have made major breakthroughs in the context of self&#8208;assembly materials. This study presents pioneering temperature and voltage&#8208;tunable lasing in both phases, demonstrating multicolor and in&#8208;demand white lasers. Additionally, spontaneously formed emissive fibers are shown, with promising applications for displays and Light Fidelity (Li&#8208;Fi) technologies.








Abstract
Nematic Liquid Crystals (LCs), noted for their simple molecular alignment and broad use in optoelectronics, remain unmodified for over a century. However, in 2017, a unique polar phase, the ferroelectric nematic (NF), is confirmed. Subsequently, in 2024, the revolutionary spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking of ferroelectric twist&#8208;bend nematic chiral structures (NTBF phase) is demonstrated. Nematic LCs are commonly used as optically active matrices for luminescent dyes, allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of emission properties through external fields. In this manuscript, the pioneering temperature&#8208;tunable lasing studies utilizing commercial dyes doped into a mixture that displays the NTBF phase within an exceptionally low&#8208;temperature range of 34&#8211;43.3&#160;&#176;C are shown. The subsequent experiments explore how lasing characteristics within NTBF and NF phases can be employed in a single, compact device to produce multicolor and white lasers. Furthermore, there are introduced spontaneously formed emissive fibers from the NTBF phase. As perspectives, the voltage&#8208;dependent increase of lasing intensity in NF is demonstrated, showing the exceptional result in two differently arranged LC cells. The findings highlight that simple molecules, like those in nature and living organisms, can shape intricate systems with significant implications for the accelerated progress of laser and display technologies, along with Li&#8208;Fi concepts.

Subsequently, in 2024, the revolutionary spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking of ferroelectric twist-bend nematic chiral structures (N&lt;sub&gt;TBF&lt;/sub&gt; phase) is demonstrated. Nematic LCs are commonly used as optically active matrices for luminescent dyes, allowing the fine-tuning of emission properties through external fields. In this manuscript, the pioneering temperature-tunable lasing studies utilizing commercial dyes doped into a mixture that displays the N&lt;sub&gt;TBF&lt;/sub&gt; phase within an exceptionally low-temperature range of 34&#8211;43.3&#160;&#176;C are shown. The subsequent experiments explore how lasing characteristics within N&lt;sub&gt;TBF&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; phases can be employed in a single, compact device to produce multicolor and white lasers. Furthermore, there are introduced spontaneously formed emissive fibers from the N&lt;sub&gt;TBF&lt;/sub&gt; phase. As perspectives, the voltage-dependent increase of lasing intensity in N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is demonstrated, showing the exceptional result in two differently arranged LC cells. The findings highlight that simple molecules, like those in nature and living organisms, can shape intricate systems with significant implications for the accelerated progress of laser and display technologies, along with Li-Fi concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of 1.84&#160;eV Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites Photovoltaics Beyond 19% via Yb3+ Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially those with a bandgap &#8776;1.84&#160;eV, are pivotal for tandem photovoltaics. However, severe halide phase segregation and ion migration critically limit their efficiency and operational stability. In this work, these challenges are addressed through an innovative Yb3&#8314;&#8208;based additive engineering strategy. Based on this strategy, the champion Yb(TFSI)3&#8208;modified PSCs achieved a PCE of 19.06%.








Abstract
Phase segregation remains one of the most critical challenges limiting the performance and long&#8208;term operational stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This issue is especially pronounced in 1.84&#160;eV wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, where severe halide phase segregation leads to compositional heterogeneity and accelerated device degradation. In this work, a comprehensive investigation of halide ion distribution across the surface and bottom interfaces of 1.84&#160;eV perovskite films is conducted, revealing significant Br&#8722;/I&#8722; halide phase segregation that severely impairs device efficiency and stability. To address this, Ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate (Yb(TFSI)3) is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the perovskite precursor. The strong coordination between Yb3+ ions and halide anions not only modulates the crystallization kinetics but also homogenizes the spatial distribution of Br&#8208;rich and I&#8208;rich domains, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced compositional heterogeneity. Furthermore, Yb3+ significantly suppresses halide migration and ion exchange processes, thereby enhancing phase stability. Depth&#8208;resolved characterizations, including grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, confirm improved crystallinity, structural uniformity, and suppressed phase segregation across the film depth. As a result, the champion device achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.06% and retains 85% of its initial efficiency after 1500&#160;h in a nitrogen atmosphere (10% RH, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Mechanoluminescent Aluminum Nitride Crystal for Super&#8208;Sensitive Optical Manometry, Thermometry and Force Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the first discovery of intrinsic mechanoluminescence in undoped AlN crystals, accompanied by pronounced photoluminescence and persistent luminescence. It further demonstrates a defect&#8208;emission&#8211;driven multifunctional optical sensing platform for force, pressure, and temperature detection, achieving exceptional sensitivities.








Abstract
AlN is a core material widely used as a substrate and heat sink in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. Introducing luminescent properties into intrinsic AIN opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation intelligent sensors, self&#8208;powered displays, and wearable electronics. In this study, the first evidence is presented of AlN crystals exhibiting satisfactory mechanoluminescence (ML), photoluminescence (PL), and afterglow performance, demonstrating their potential as novel multifunctional optical sensors. A series of undoped AlN crystals (ranging from &#181;m to mm scale) is successfully synthesized on tungsten substrates via physical vapor transport. A multimodal optical sensing platform is developed, showing afterglow and PL for temperature and pressure sensing, and ML for force detection. Despite minimal structural deformation under extreme conditions, attributed to the high bulk modulus of AIN, the optical sensors, driven by intrinsic defect&#8208;related emissions, exhibited excellent sensitivity to temperature and pressure. Notably, significant and previously unreported differences in the PL and ML spectra are observed in response to light and mechanical stimuli, respectively. These spectral variations are attributed to the activation of distinct defect states during PL and ML processes. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study represents a significant step forward in the development of optical sensing technologies for extreme environments and force detection applications.

Abstract
Emerging contaminants, including pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), pose significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. This study demonstrates efficient electrochemical oxidation of PPCPs using a novel tin&#8208;antimony doped carbon nanofiber membrane (Sn&#8208;Sb&#8208;CNF) anode leveraging dual&#8208;metal synergy. Oxygen vacancies generated through this synergistic effect function as active sites, enhancing pollutant adsorption capacity and oxidant activation capability. The degradation mechanism proceeds primarily via dominant hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation, leading to complete contaminant mineralization. Notably, Sn/Sb dual&#8208;metal doping modulates the electronic structure, altering the d&#8208;band center from &#8722;4.777 to &#8722;2.175 eV and significantly lowering reaction energy barriers. This electronic optimization facilitates electron transfer kinetics and accelerates pollutant degradation. Owing to this synergy, the Sn&#8208;Sb&#8208;CNF anode achieved high removal efficiencies (&gt;90%) within 30 min for multiple PPCPs: ofloxacin (95%), enrofloxacin (91%), carbamazepine (90%), acetaminophen (82%), and ibuprofen (96%). Furthermore, the membrane exhibits potent antimicrobial activity, achieving 4&#8208;log inactivation of tetracycline&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and 5&#8208;log reduction of T7 bacteriophage within 30 min. In real wastewater containing antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria from a treatment plant, the system attained 62% mineralization rate. This work establishes a dual&#8208;metal synergy strategy that provides new avenues for efficient PPCP elimination in complex aqueous matrices.

         <title>Intensifying D&#8208;Orbitals Energy Level Splitting of Local Co Atoms in CoO Lattice for Accelerated Iodine Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduced oxygen vacancies in CoO lattice induce low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin state transition at adjacent Co active sites, which optimizes spin&#8208;orbital coupling with I2/I&#8210; molecular orbitals to enable faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions on cathode, thus achieving enhanced energy efficiency of the assembled Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.









Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to maximize their power holds the key to address the challenges faced by zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs), including the shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics at the iodine cathode. Herein, oxygen vacancies is innovatively introduced into CoO lattice to create high&#8208;spin&#8208;state Co active sites in nonstoichiometric CoO1&#8331;x nanocrystals supported by carbon nanofibers (H&#8208;CoO1&#8331;x/CNFs). This simple strategy intensifies crystal field splitting of Co 3d orbitals, optimizing the spin&#8208;orbital coupling between Co 3d orbitals and iodine species. The resulting enhanced availability of more unpaired electrons in non&#8208;degenerate eg orbitals facilitates faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions, thus improved reaction kinetics. Therefore, the assembled ZIBs employing H&#8208;CoO1&#8331;x/CNFs/I2 cathode acquires a narrower overpotential gap (37 mV), higher initial capacity (203.0 mAh g&#8210;1), and better cycling stability (96.0% capacity retention after 2200 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8210;1) compared to the CoO/CNFs/I2 cathode without experiencing defect engineering (109 mV/192.6 mAh g&#8210;1/74.7% after 1000 cycles). This work opens new avenues for maximizing the potential power of cathode host catalysts, making immediate contributions to the advancement of aqueous halogen batteries.

Therefore, the assembled ZIBs employing H-CoO&lt;sub&gt;1&#8331;x&lt;/sub&gt;/CNFs/I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode acquires a narrower overpotential gap (37 mV), higher initial capacity (203.0 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and better cycling stability (96.0% capacity retention after 2200 cycles at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to the CoO/CNFs/I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode without experiencing defect engineering (109 mV/192.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt;/74.7% after 1000 cycles). This work opens new avenues for maximizing the potential power of cathode host catalysts, making immediate contributions to the advancement of aqueous halogen batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Writing of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Mo2C Enabled by Low&#8208;Temperature Laser Deposition for High&#8208;Performance Acidic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

Molybdenum carbide electrocatalysts exhibit limited hydrogen evolution performance due to excessively strong Mo&#8208;H interactions. Low&#8208;temperature laser deposition enables the kinetic stabilization of metastable oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C with optimized electronic structure, delivering high activity and long&#8208;term durability for acidic hydrogen production at industrial current densities.








Abstract
Molybdenum carbides have gained tremendous attention for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their high electrical conductivity and similar d&#8208;band structure to platinum. Among molybdenum carbides, Mo2C catalysts have exhibited greater potential for acidic HER. However, their performance is restricted by the strong binding interaction between molybdenum and hydrogen. Herein, a series of Mo2C catalysts are synthesized using a rapid, low&#8208;temperature laser deposition method to dope oxygen atoms into the Mo2C lattices. The metastable oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C exhibits a low overpotential of 125 mV at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, showing significant improvement compared to Mo2C (&#8776;182 mV). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the introduction of oxygen into the lattices of Mo2C can reduce the hydrogen adsorption free energy, indicating that hydrogen production is more favorable on oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C electrocatalyst. At the industrial&#8208;level current density of 1 A&#160;cm&#8722;2, the oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with a low overpotential of 312 mV. Moreover, it exhibits remarkable stability, maintaining consistent hydrogen production for 200 h (&gt;8 days) in 0.5 M H2SO4, potentially&#160;outperforming most non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts. This work highlights a new method to synthesize high&#8208;performance transition metal carbide catalysts with a tunable electronic structure to enhance HER performance.

         <title>Robust Immobilization and Activity Preservation of Enzymes in Porous Frameworks by Silica&#8208;Based &#8220;Inorganic Glue&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept, &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue,&#8221; is introduced, where enzyme&#8208;induced silicification is employed to enhance enzyme stability, improve interactions with supports, and prevent pore blocking. Due to its simplicity, reliability, and scalability, this approach offers a transformative advancement in enzyme immobilization for industrial applications.








Abstract
The development of novel methods to enhance enzyme&#8208;carrier interactions in situ, at a feasible cost, and on a large scale is crucial for improving the stability and durability of current immobilized enzyme systems used in industrial settings. Here, a pioneering approach termed &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue&#8221; is proposed, which utilizes protein&#8208;catalyzed silicification to fix enzyme within porous matrix while preserving enzyme activity. This innovative strategy offers several key benefits, including conformational stabilization of enzymes, improved interactions between enzymes and the matrix, prevention of enzyme leakage, and mitigation of pore blocking. Moreover, the controllable and scalable nature of this method renders it a cost&#8208;effective solution for enhancing enzyme immobilization in industrial contexts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue&#8221; technology, it has applied to three different enzymes exhibiting varying surface characteristics, sizes, and functions and in diverse porous supports, including a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and a commercial macroporous resin, which resulted in a significant improvement of the stability and longevity of the immobilized enzymes. Overall, this findings represent a significant advancement in enzyme immobilization techniques, signaling a paradigm shift in current industrial catalysis.

         <title>Critical Role of Ultra&#8208;Microporous Tunnel Structure Within Hard Carbon in Boosting Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

The desolvation and weak capillary effect of UMTS can effectively reduce the decomposition of the electrolyte and thus significantly enhance the ICE, which also facilitates the rapid transport of sodium ions and provides sites for the storage of sodium clusters, effectively enhancing the rate performance and reversible capacity.








Abstract
Accurately constructing pore structures and clarifying the relationship between pore structure and sodium storage performance to obtain high&#8208;quality hard carbon (HC) is crucial for the commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is still challenging to simultaneously obtain HC with high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), excellent rate performance, and satisfactory capacity in ester electrolytes by modifying the pore structure. Herein, the challenge is innovatively addressed by optimizing the dechlorination polymerization reaction to obtain the precursor, thereby modulating the carbon atom structure rearrangement and preoxidation process to design the HC with ultra&#8208;microporous tunnel structure (UMTS). The desolvation of UMTS (&lt;1&#160;nm) and the weak capillary effect at the surface can effectively reduce the decomposition of the electrolyte at the electrode surface and thus significantly enhance the ICE. The UMTS also facilitates the rapid transport of sodium ions and provides sites for the storage of sodium clusters, greatly enhancing the rate performance and reversible capacity. As a result, especially in ester electrolyte, the optimized material demonstrates an ultrahigh ICE of 90.9%, good rate performance (108.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1) and an outstanding reversible capacity (357.2 mAh g&#8722;1 with 98.3% of the capacity contribution below 1&#160;V). This design concept of precisely constructing UMTS contributes significantly to the rational design of high&#8208;quality HC anode, and may be extended to other battery systems to promote the ongoing advancement of battery technology.

         <title>Non&#8208;PFAS&#8208;Based Magnetic Polymer Sorbents for Efficient Removal of Perfluorinated Compounds from Landfill Leachate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic polymer sorbents featuring non&#8208;per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (non&#8208;PFAS)&#8208;based fluorinated and cationic groups enable selective and efficient removal of multiple PFAS from complex landfill leachate. By optimizing functional group balance and polymer design, the sorbents achieve &gt;90% removal, excellent reusability, and outperform commercial materials&#8212;offering a promising solution for PFAS remediation in challenging real&#8208;world water matrices.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are carcinogenic and environmentally persistent contaminants, necessitating their efficient removal to protect environmental and human health. In this study, a series of fluorinated, non&#8208;PFAS&#8208;based magnetic polymer sorbents is developed for the selective removal of multiple PFAS from landfill leachate containing high levels of co&#8208;contaminants. Crosslinked polymer networks are shown to enhance both magnetic separation and PFAS sorption performance. The magnetic sorbent with a higher proportion of quaternary ammonium groups and a lower proportion of fluorinated segments shows improved sorption kinetics for most PFAS and greater sorption capacity for perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), the most abundant compound in the tested landfill leachate. However, this formulation exhibits lower sorption selectivity and reduced equilibrium removal efficiencies when PFAS are present at low initial concentrations. A compact and portable treatment device is constructed to simulate practical deployment. The system achieves high PFAS removal efficiencies (&gt;90% for the majority of PFAS) and maintains good regeneration and reusability over five sorption&#8208;desorption cycles at environmentally relevant concentrations. Compared to four commercially available sorbents, the developed magnetic polymer sorbents exhibit superior performance in PFAS removal, indicating their potential as efficient candidates for remediating PFAS from landfill leachate.

         <title>Achieving Electrode Smoothing by Controlling the Nucleation Phase of Metal Deposition Through Polymer&#8208;Substrate Binding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how polyethylene oxide (PEO) facilitates smooth electrode deposition using in situ experiments and simulations. PEO does not bind to Zn or Zn2+ to control growth but adsorbs on Cu, tuning Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfacial energy. This promotes the nucleation of flat&#8208;lying Zn (002) platelets and confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow region near the interface.








Abstract
Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and many other battery systems. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, the knowledge gap is addressed by using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on Cu substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions, which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, the results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near&#8208;surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.

         <title>Revisiting Ferroelectric&#8208;Gated Phototransistors: A Tripartite Synapse&#8208;Inspired Approach to In&#8208;Sensor Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric&#8208;gated phototransistor (FGPT) enables linear and multilevel modulation of photoconductance through partial polarization switching and photogating effects. The device achieves photonic non&#8208;volatility over a 153&#160;dB dynamic range and performs in&#8208;sensor processing under unstructured illumination, demonstrating enhanced face recognition accuracy by recalibrating distorted visual inputs into a pre&#8208;trained range.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices inspired by the tripartite synapse system offer enhanced modulation of synaptic weight via a third terminal. However, using an electrically independent terminal for memorizing and processing optical information remains unexplored. Here, a ferroelectric&#8208;gated phototransistor (FGPT) incorporating ferroelectric polymers and organic photoactive channels is revisited for neuromorphic vision systems. It is demonstrated that partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric gate insulator enables linear control of the photoactive channel. Furthermore, the photogating effect induced by charge trapping at the ferroelectric insulator/photoactive channel interface further enhances the photonic non&#8208;volatile (PNV) characteristics of the FGPT. This allows memorized visual information, expressed as photoconductance, to be incrementally potentiated or depressed. The modulated photoconductance fully spans the current level within the dynamic range of the device (153&#160;dB). Finally, the feasibility of the device for all&#8208;day face recognition is shown by in&#8208;sensor processing of visual information obtained from unstructured environments into the pre&#8208;trained range. This approach results in up to a &#8776;40% improvement in recognition accuracy.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Delivery of Required Facilitators for Microenvironment Remodeling Propels Neural Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid conduit integrates electrospun nanofibers with bioactive hydrogels for spatiotemporal delivery of multiple bioactive factors, precisely targeting critical pathological cascades after SCI. Initially, CAT release reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, while subsequent EGF delivery provides a supportive substrate for axon growth. Combined with NT3 and GDNF, it enhances axon regeneration and synaptic plasticity, ultimately improving motor and bladder function.








Abstract
Intricate pathological responses and multiple components within the lesion make it challenging to repair spinal cord injury (SCI). A multifunctional hybrid neural restorative conduit is developed, composed of a sandwich&#8208;like hydrogel encapsulated within a polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber membrane. The sandwich structure consists of a hyaluronic acid&#8208;graft&#8208;dopamine (HADA)/HGF&#8208;(RADA)4&#8208;DGDRGDS (HRR) hydrogel loaded with epidermal growth factor (EGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT3), and glial&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), flanked by gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels containing catalase at both ends. The hybrid conduit enables the spatiotemporal release of multiple bioactive factors, precisely targeting critical pathological cascades after SCI. This approach reduces oxidative stress, promotes neuronal survival at the lesion borders, facilitates the relay of ascending and descending axons, and enhances signal transmission across the lesion. Restored serotonergic signaling enhances motor neuron excitability, facilitating functional recovery, while reconstitution of bladder reflexes improves urinary control. By orchestrating the reinstatement of multiple essential mechanisms to counteract the pathological progression of the hostile post&#8208;SCI microenvironment, this approach provides a strategy for regenerative therapies targeting SCI.

         <title>Biologically Switchable Volatility and Nonvolatility Toward Real Neurotransmitter Mediated Aqueous Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on neurotransmitter glutamate&#8208;mediated volatility and nonvolatility of a PCN&#8208;224/WO3&#8208;gated organic photoelectrochemical transistor, a complete aqueous reservoir computing system is developed and implemented for image preprocessing and recognition, in which the reservoir is constructed based on the volatile property, while the readout network is operated upon the nonvolatile property of the device.








Abstract
The study on aqueous reservoir computing (RC) has just come into being. Nevertheless, aqueous RC still faces significant challenges. Recently, with the participation of real biological receptors, aqueous neuromorphic engineering is promising to emulate the intricate human brain more closely due to their synaptic resemblance in electrolytes. In this work, biologically switchable volatility and nonvolatility are first explored for real neurotransmitter glutamate&#8208;mediated aqueous RC application, which is based on rational synergy between glutamate oxidase catalytic chemistry and porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework/tungsten oxide (PCN&#8208;224/WO3) photogate in the newly emerged organic photoelectrochemical transistor. As a proof of concept, the glutamate&#8208;mediated RC is then developed and explored for image recognition. These results have of potential for advancing real neurotransmitter&#8208;mediated aqueous RC toward in&#8208;biology application, which are also envisaged to promote bioinspired algorithm&#8208;hardware codesign in future aqueous neuromorphic engineering.

         <title>Microstructure Optimization via Grain&#8208;Boundary Segregation to Enhance DC Bias Dielectric Performance of BaTiO3 Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning grain size through nanoscale grain&#8208;boundary segregation of single&#8208;element additives, high&#8208;performance BaTiO&#8323;&#8208;based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) exhibit exceptionally low dielectric loss over a wide frequency range and excellent thermal stability. In particular, an optimal grain size is identified for maximizing effective capacitance under high DC bias fields, offering a key strategy to enable thinner dielectric layers in future MLCCs.








Abstract
BaTiO&#8323;&#8208;based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) are essential components in modern electronics. To enhance overall capacitance, achieving thinner ceramic layers has become a primary issue. However, this introduces two major challenges: controlling grain size during processing and ensuring stability under high electric fields. In this study, a novel strategy employing single&#8208;element additives such as Fe3&#8314; and Ni2&#8314; is presented to effectively suppress grain growth. These additives strongly segregate at grain boundaries, thereby limiting grain coarsening during sintering and enabling fine&#8208;grained microstructures. The optimized BaTiO&#8323; samples, free of costly rare&#8208;earth elements, exhibit stable high permittivity (&#8776;103), low dielectric loss, and improved reliability across varying temperatures and frequencies. More importantly, we identify the ideal grain size of &#8776;200&#160;nm for maximizing capacitance under a DC bias exceeding 4&#160;V&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. The findings suggest that further reducing the dielectric layer thickness to 200&#160;nm represents a promising direction for future MLCCs.

&lt;p&gt;By tuning grain size through nanoscale grain-boundary segregation of single-element additives, high-performance BaTiO&#8323;-based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) exhibit exceptionally low dielectric loss over a wide frequency range and excellent thermal stability. In particular, an optimal grain size is identified for maximizing effective capacitance under high DC bias fields, offering a key strategy to enable thinner dielectric layers in future MLCCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BaTiO&#8323;-based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) are essential components in modern electronics. To enhance overall capacitance, achieving thinner ceramic layers has become a primary issue. However, this introduces two major challenges: controlling grain size during processing and ensuring stability under high electric fields. In this study, a novel strategy employing single-element additives such as Fe&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; is presented to effectively suppress grain growth. These additives strongly segregate at grain boundaries, thereby limiting grain coarsening during sintering and enabling fine-grained microstructures. The optimized BaTiO&#8323; samples, free of costly rare-earth elements, exhibit stable high permittivity (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), low dielectric loss, and improved reliability across varying temperatures and frequencies. More importantly, we identify the ideal grain size of &#8776;200&#160;nm for maximizing capacitance under a DC bias exceeding 4&#160;V&#160;&#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The findings suggest that further reducing the dielectric layer thickness to 200&#160;nm represents a promising direction for future MLCCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inter&#8208;Ring Bonding Electron Donor Structure Triggers Efficient Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing an inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure with two linked phenyl rings, electron delocalization within the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) is enhanced. This increased delocalization improves the photocatalyst's oxidation capability and facilitates hole distribution at low&#8208;energy barrier sites, thereby triggering the efficient two&#8208;electron water oxidation reactions (2e&#8722; WOR).








Abstract
Low water oxidation efficiency is a major barrier to efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis under sacrificial agent&#8208;free conditions. Among various water oxidation pathways, the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) is promising due to its direct H2O2 generation and kinetic advantages. However, effective strategies to trigger the efficient 2e&#8722; WOR remain insufficient. In this study, conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor and acceptor units are designed and synthesized. By introducing an inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure with two linked phenyl rings, the efficient 2e&#8722; WOR is initiated, increasing H2O2 synthesis efficiency from 1657 to 4401 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 1.25%. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the 2e&#8722; WOR is initiated by the inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure, which enhances electron delocalization in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), increasing the valence band potential from 1.6 to 1.8 V, thereby meeting the oxidation potential required for the 2e&#8722; WOR. Additionally, this structure promotes hole accumulation at low&#8208;energy barrier sites, boosting water oxidation efficiency from 874 to 2767 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This work presents a promising strategy for improving photocatalytic water oxidation efficiency, advancing sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Synthesis of 2D Semiconductor Lateral Patterned Heterostructures Through Carving and Follow&#8208;Up Robust Epitaxial Growth Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using high&#8208;speed laser carving to achieve precisely controlled two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor material patterns. These patterns serve as a stable template for the lateral epitaxial growth of other 2D materials, enabling the fabrication of 2D lateral periodic heterostructures, heterostructure crossbar arrays, and patterned heterostructures.








Abstract
Precise control over the spatial distribution of chemical composition and electronic structure in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for the development of next&#8208;generation integrated circuits. However, fabricating 2D lateral patterned heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and high spatial periodicity remains a significant challenge. Herein, this work reports a general strategy to synthesize 2D semiconductor lateral patterned heterostructures through carving of 2D semiconductor single crystal and the follow&#8208;up robust epitaxial growth approach. Using the high&#8208;speed laser carving (HSLC) technique, this work obtains precisely controlled 2D semiconductor material patterns with clean edges, which are used as a robust template for laterally epitaxial growth to produce 2D lateral periodic heterostructures, heterostructure crossbar arrays and other complex patterned heterostructures. Systematic microscopic and spectral characterization reveal that heterostructures have atomically sharp interlines. The high periodicity of these heterostructures facilitates scalable device integration, providing a practical route toward large&#8208;area 2D electronic circuits. By constructing functional electronic components such as p&#8208;n diode and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) inverters arrays, this work demonstrates the potential of these heterostructures for monolithic circuit applications. This technique offers a new idea for micro/nano machining of 2D materials and lays a foundation for large&#8208;scale integrated circuits based on 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Bamboo&#8208;Inspired Composite Conduit Accelerates Peripheral Nerve Regeneration through Synergistic Oriented Structure and Piezoelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bamboo&#8208;inspired composite conduit is designed to promote the repair of long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury, where a directional hollow&#8208;tube bilayer structure provides topological guidance for cell migration, and the newly discovered piezoelectric property of poly(vinyl alcohol) of exceeding 100 mV enhances axon length by 3.1 times, ultimately improving nerve regeneration efficiency through accelerating neuronal migration, axonal extension, and vascularization.








Abstract
Slow axon growth is a critical factor that limits regeneration after long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Herein, a bamboo&#8208;inspired scaffold accelerates nerve regeneration through a directional hollow&#8208;tube bilayer structure and biomimetic piezoelectric property. The outer hydrogel of the scaffold exhibits sufficient fatigue resistance after 100 cycles of stretching, while the interior fiber provides an oriented topological cue. Inspired by the bending&#8208;piezoelectric property of bamboo cellulose, the piezoelectric signal in poly(vinyl alcohol) is detected for the first time, measuring approximately 20&#160;mV. To enhance voltage&#8208;driven nerve regeneration, the scaffold's piezoelectricity is improved to 0.95 &#177; 0.02&#160;V by optimizing its non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure, increasing permanent dipole moment, and facilitating electron&#8208;hole separation. Owing to its biomimetic structure and piezoelectricity, the scaffold promotes a 3.1&#8208;fold increase in axon length, a 1.6&#8208;fold improvement in myelin diameter, and maximizes angiogenesis, reaching 71.25 &#177; 21.87 vessels per mm2 in vivo. Overall, this bamboo&#8208;inspired conduit has the potential to significantly improve regeneration efficiency and functional reconstruction in cases of long&#8208;segment PNI.

         <title>Vascular&#8208;Mimetic 2D Membranes with Hemoglobin Catalysis for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
GO in GO&#8208;RBC membranes induces the reorganization of phospholipid bilayers to form hydrophobic &#8220;hemoglobin islands&#8221; embedded in a hydrophilic &#8220;phospholipid sea&#8221;. This structure forces the uranium ions to move along an &#8220;S&#8221; shaped trajectory, which greatly enhances their interaction with hemoglobin and improves the ability to catalyze the conversion of uranium (VI) to uranium (IV).








Abstract
The extraction of uranium from seawater is crucial for sustainable nuclear energy development but is challenged by its ultralow concentration, the presence of competing ions, and the high energy demands of conventional methods. Membrane separation is a promising alternative, owing to its in simplicity, low energy consumption, and scalability. However, current membranes fail to achieve the selectivity and efficiency required for uranium capture. Herein, this study introduces a bioinspired graphene oxide&#8208;red blood cells (GO&#8208;RBC) membrane, that mimics vascular transport for ultra&#8208;selective uranium extraction. In the innovative GO&#8208;induced remodeling of red blood cell, hemoglobin (Hb) adsorbs onto the hydrophobic regions of GO and, phospholipids self&#8208;assemble into concentric hydrophilic rings around Hb. This unique &#8220;island&#8208;reef&#8221; structure within the membrane channels forces ions to follow an S&#8208;shaped path, thereby enhancing interactions with Hb. In addition, Hb catalytically reduces U(VI) to U(IV), enabling trapping of uranium while allowing competing ions to pass through. The membrane achieves an unprecedented U/V selectivity (110.6), far outperforming current technologies. Moreover, the GO&#8208;RBC membrane exhibited exceptional antifouling properties, mechanical robustness, and long&#8208;term stability. This study provides a scalable, energy&#8208;efficient solution for uranium extraction from seawater, further opening new pathways for the development of biomimetic membranes for application in resource recovery.

This unique &#8220;island-reef&#8221; structure within the membrane channels forces ions to follow an S-shaped path, thereby enhancing interactions with Hb. In addition, Hb catalytically reduces U(VI) to U(IV), enabling trapping of uranium while allowing competing ions to pass through. The membrane achieves an unprecedented U/V selectivity (110.6), far outperforming current technologies. Moreover, the GO-RBC membrane exhibited exceptional antifouling properties, mechanical robustness, and long-term stability. This study provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for uranium extraction from seawater, further opening new pathways for the development of biomimetic membranes for application in resource recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A Generative Artificial Intelligence Driven Workflow for the Discovery of Novel Magnesium&#8208;Based Solvents.








Abstract
Traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods are inefficient and costly in discovering novel solvents for next&#8208;generation magnesium (Mg) metal&#8208;based batteries. Therefore, this work establishes a simple yet efficient screening criterion for solvents by integrating artificial intelligence techniques with a virtual molecular database, potentially revolutionizing the traditional solvent design pathway. A total of 823 solvents are generated using a self&#8208;developed algorithm, and LUMO, &#916;LUMO, ESPmin, ESPmax&#8201;, and Eb are identified to establish the screening criterion through the analysis with machine learning (ML) models. Eighteen candidate solvents are successfully identified, and two of which are subsequently selected and experimentally validated, i.e., C1COCOC1 and COCC(C)OC (abbreviated as &#8220;DOX&#8221; and &#8220;DMP&#8221;). Notably, neither of these solvents has been previously reported for use in Mg batteries. Experimental results indicate that the DOX solvent, when paired with the Mg boron&#8208;based salt, i.e., Mg[B(hfip)4]2, can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance. At a current density of 1.0&#8201;mAcm&#8722;2, the average coulombic efficiency for Mg plating/stripping reaches 99.54&#8201;% after 5200 cycles. Furthermore, the Mg//Cu cell achieves a cumulative capacity exceeding 2000&#8201;mAhcm&#8722;2, surpassing previously reported results. In summary, this work establishes a virtual molecular database and develops a streamlined screening methodology for Mg battery solvents based on their physicochemical properties, reducing the candidate pool from 823 to 18 and improving efficiency by nearly 50&#8208;fold. This research paradigm is not limited to the development of Mg batteries and can be readily extended to the exploration of other battery systems.

         <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra&#8208;Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi&#8208;bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum are leveraged to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate ultra&#8208;strong coupling to an epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero mode in an ultra&#8208;thin SiO2 layer.The platform achieves exceptional mode overlap, reaching a normalized coupling strength of &#951; = 0.10&#8197;and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero mode energy.








Abstract
A platform is introduced to achieve ultra&#8208;strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light&#8211;matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single&#8208;photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low&#8208;threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q&#8208;factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi&#8208;bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum are leveraged to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra&#8208;thin SiO2 layer. The strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields in tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of &#951; = 0.10&#8197;and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four&#8208;to&#8208;five&#8208;fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of the approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low&#8208;energy optical modulators.

         <title>Targeted Cascade Therapy with Multifunctional Nanovesicles Engineered from Synergistic Antibacterial Agents for Precision Treatment of Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Infections and Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, a multifunctional nanovesicle platform is prepared, combining membrane&#8208;disruptive sulfonium polypeptoids, pH&#8208;responsive polypeptoids for acid&#8208;triggered amine release, enzymatic cell wall degradation via lysostaphin, and targeted delivery using D&#8208;phenylalanine ligands. This precision&#8208;guided system integrates synergistic antibacterial mechanisms to effectively tackle drug&#8208;resistant bacteria in various tissue environments.








Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), classified as a high&#8208;priority tier II pathogen, poses a glowing threat to global health. Single&#8208;mode antibacterial approaches often fall short of achieving optimal effects, necessitating the development of combination therapies. To address these challenges, pH&#8208;responsive antibacterial nanovesicles, termed DAClLy, are developed by integrating targeting ligand and multiple antimicrobial agents with complementary modes of action to target MDR bacteria with enhanced efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. DAClLy are engineered through the complexation of sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;bearing antibacterial polypeptoids, and primary amine&#8208;containing polypeptoids modified with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl maleic anhydride, encapsulating lysostaphin, a bacteriolytic enzyme. Upon reaching the acidic microenvironment of bacterial infections, the DAClLy vesicles disassemble, releasing their antimicrobial components. The released lysostaphin degrades bacterial cell walls, while the polypeptoids synergistically disrupt bacterial membranes, resulting in a multi&#8208;action bactericidal effect. This synergistic mechanism demonstrates remarkable efficacy against MDR S. aureus, including its resilient biofilm formations. In vivo studies have shown that the DAClLy vesicles exhibit potent antibacterial activity against MDR S. aureus&#8208;induced skin and lung infections. The nanovesicles effectively penetrate the lung mucus barrier, addressing both surface&#8208;level and deep&#8208;tissue infections. By integrating multiple strategies, DAClLy offers a promising therapeutic strategy to combat MDR pathogens across diverse tissue contexts.

         <title>Gridized Nanopolymer Catalysis with Atomically Dispersed Iron Achieves the Nearly 100% Selective Electrosynthesis of Methanol From CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;based nanomolecular/nanopolymer catalysts with super&#8208;hindrance and low&#8208;coordination Fe sites enable efficient CO2 electroreduction to methanol (CH3OH). The super&#8208;hindrance prevents aggregation to guarantee active site dispersion. The stronger *CO adsorption, compared to Fe porphyrin, is crucial for the high selective production of CH3OH instead of CO. Fe&#8208;based nanopolymer catalyst demonstrates 60.5% CH3OH FE, 98.3% CH3OH selectivity, and 100 h stability in an H&#8208;cell.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH) offers a highly promising avenue for zero&#8208;emission carbon recycling and renewable energy storage. However, achieving high CH3OH selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalysts remains rare, presenting central challenges on the path to their commercialization. It is emerging to make multiscale design of metal centers of active sites and their surrounding environments under the crucial mechanism of pathway selection. Herein, the gridized nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysts are reported for high effective electroreduction of CO2 to CH3OH. An A&#8208;type nanogrid (AG) and its organic nanopolymers with atomically dispersed iron (Fe) are well identified with the unique catalytic active sites of Fe&#8208;N1C3Cl1. Notably, Fe&#8208;based AG nanopolymer (FePAG) catalyst exhibits a CH3OH Faradaic efficiency of 60.5%, a CH3OH selectivity of 98.3%, and a stability of up to 100 h, outperforming currently reported molecular catalysts. The superior selectivity is probably attributed to the cooperation between the stronger *CO adsorption and the super&#8208;hindrance that suppresses aggregates to guarantee the dispersion of single active sites. This study provides new insights in the exploration of nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysis.

Herein, the gridized nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysts are reported for high effective electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH. An A-type nanogrid (AG) and its organic nanopolymers with atomically dispersed iron (Fe) are well identified with the unique catalytic active sites of Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Notably, Fe-based AG nanopolymer (FePAG) catalyst exhibits a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH Faradaic efficiency of 60.5%, a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity of 98.3%, and a stability of up to 100 h, outperforming currently reported molecular catalysts. The superior selectivity is probably attributed to the cooperation between the stronger *CO adsorption and the super-hindrance that suppresses aggregates to guarantee the dispersion of single active sites. This study provides new insights in the exploration of nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Nanoagents with Efficient Free Radicals Generation and Photothermal Conversion Performance for Enhanced Tumor Photoimmunotherapy via Targeting Lactate Metabolism&#8208;Immune Circuit Rewiring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a lactate metabolism&#8208;immune circuit rewiring strategy using L8@SY NPs to inhibit lactate efflux and enhance photoimmunotherapy. L8@SY NPs with high free radical generation and photothermal conversion performance can induce immunogenic cell death. Meanwhile, lactate efflux blockade effectively augments photoimmunotherapy by reshaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment, demonstrating significant tumor growth suppression and reduced metastasis.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) have emerged as promising modalities against tumor growth and distant metastases via inducing apoptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, their therapeutic efficacy is profoundly compromised by the acidic tumor microenvironment fueled by lactate extrusion, orchestrating multifaceted immunosuppression. Herein, a lactate metabolism checkpoint blockade strategy targeting monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) is proposed to augment photoimmunotherapy by co&#8208;delivering MCT4 inhibitor syrosingopine (SY) and a phototheranostic agent L8BO (L8). Boasting robust intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics and an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated architecture with lengthy alkyl chains, L8 possesses a diminished singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;S&#8208;T) alongside elevated light&#8208;harvesting property, achieving exceptional free radicals generation and 46.2% photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Triggered by lactate sequestration&#8208;induced intracellular acidification, L8@SY nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;enabled photoimmunotherapy potently activates dendritic cells (DCs) maturation while eliciting substantial infiltration of T lymphocytes. Concurrently, natural killer (NK) cell activation and memory T&#8208;cell differentiation are achieved, thereby suppressing both localized and distal tumor progression whilst concomitantly curtailing pulmonary metastatic dissemination. In brief, this study provides a novel combinatorial paradigm to potentiate photoimmunotherapy by targeting the lactate metabolism&#8208;immune circuit rewiring strategy.

         <title>Recyclable Polyurethane Thermosets with High Rigidness and Toughness via Side Chain Induced Dual Phase Separation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable rigid polyurethane thermoset is presented via a side chain&#8208;induced dual phase separation strategy. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded hard domains and side&#8208;chain nanodomains synergistically enhance toughness, while urethane transesterification ensures catalyst&#8208;free reprocessability. The material achieves high modulus (1.13 GPa), exceptional toughness (77.8 MJ m&#8722;3), and demonstrates recyclability in glass fiber composites.








Abstract
Polyurethane thermosets with high strength, rigidity, and cost efficiency are highly desirable for industrial applications. However, they always suffer from brittleness and poor recyclability owing to their crosslinked structure, causing an unacceptable level of sustainability concerns. Here, a side chain induced dual phase separation strategy is proposed to tackle these limitations. Specifically, a crosslinked rigid polyurethane is designed, synthesized from small&#8208;molecule diols with a side chain. The urethane groups form hard domains by hydrogen bonding and induce a primary phase separation. Moreover, the curing process immobilizes part of the polymer segments with side chains to promote a secondary phase separation and generate a heterogeneous crosslinked structure. The primary phase separation enables energy dissipation, while the secondary phase separation serves as stress concentrations or crack initiation points to enhance the toughness. Notably, the transesterification between urethane groups, coupled with hydrogen bonding, facilitates catalyst&#8208;free reprocessability, extending thermosets lifespan. This recyclable polyurethane thermoset exhibits a high Young's modulus (1.13 GPa) and exceptional toughness (77.76 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Furthermore, its application and recyclability in glass fiber&#8208;reinforced composites are demonstrated. This strategy provides a viable route toward sustainable thermosetting polymers, addressing key environmental concerns associated with their widespread use.

         <title>Fine and Uniform Ultrathin Film Coating on Fiber via Nonequilibrium Liquid/Liquid Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber coated with an unprecedentedly micro&#8208;/nanoscale uniform layer, which is long&#8208;sought&#8208;after yet unachievable by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coating technologies, is constructed by locking even liquid film on the fiber in a multiphase fluid coating. The resultant coated composite fiber owns highly efficient function coupling (e.g., supersensitive sensing feature), and can be widespreadly applied to fabric devices.








Abstract
Coating a thin layer on fibers enables their function coupling or integration into differentiated wearable devices, or may unlock unexplored potentials. The thin layer coating's uniformity and controllability is the prerequisite to ensure device's efficiency, but remain, yet, a formidable challenge. Currently, only a few specific composite fibers have been fabricated from flow coating associated with rapid polymerizing liquid monomers, fibers&#8217; parallel handling, or physical scraping, seriously lacking fineness and universality, especially inability reaching nanometer or sub&#8208;micrometer thickness coating. Here, a new method of coating an even liquid film on fiber in another immiscible liquid via capitalizing on fast interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the liquid/liquid interface is proposed. The consequently dried uniform, ultrathin common polymer or composite (predissolved in coated liquid) coating&#8212;with otherwise unattainable thickness ranging 50 nm&#8211;20 &#181;m&#8212;offers fiber with high device performance, including robust service in extreme circumstances (allowing Cu fiber work over the whole range of pH), high efficient display function (with luminous elements &lt;0.01%), and supersensitive sensing with sensor's resistance variation over 90% by less 1 N pressure. The strategy can find extensively diverse applications in wearable electronics and intelligent textiles, as fiber, chemicals of coating liquid, and components, are variable.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Prestressed Niobium Tungsten Oxide Enables Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change and Ultrafast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By one&#8208;step slow&#8208;gradient thermal synthesis strategy to precisely regulate lattice distortion, a novel lattice&#8208;prestressed Nb14W3O44 overcomes its intrinsic structural limitations, enabling near&#8208;zero volume change and ultrafast lithium storage during cycling. This prestressed structure delivers a 78% capacity retention at 100C after 20&#160;000 cycles and no risk of the battery catching fire or exploding under severe stress conditions.








Abstract
Niobium tungsten oxide offers rapid ionic transport and high safety in fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but suffers from challenges of large structure stresses and low capacity retention at rates exceeding 20C. Here, a novel lattice&#8208;prestressed Nb14W3O44 (LP&#8208;NWO) is reported that overcomes its intrinsic structural limitations, enabling near&#8208;zero volume change and ultrafast lithium storage. The lattice&#8208;prestressed structure involves the alternating distribution of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#215;&#8734; and 4&#160;&#215;&#160;3&#215;&#8734; rectangle units, along with octahedra distortion, which leads to the formation of specific and ordered lattice prestresses. The rectangle units induce tensile stresses, while the octahedra distortion results in compressive stresses. This prestressed structure not only preserves continuous diffusion channels but also enhances both ion and electron conductivity. Importantly, the presence of prestress greatly relieves the strain generated during lithium insertion and extraction. This can be observed through a reversible curve&#8208;to&#8208;straight evolution of lattice fringes, resulting in near&#8208;zero volume change during cycling. The LP&#8208;NWO delivers a 78% capacity retention at 100C after 20&#160;000 cycles and more than 2&#160;000 cycles of full cells at 50C, as well as no safety risk under severe stress conditions. This prestressed strategy offers implications for the development of zero&#8208;strain electrodes, aiming to overcome fast&#8208;charge limitations through internal means.

         <title>A Multimodal Smart Window with Visible&#8208;NIR&#8208;LWIR Electro&#8208;Modulation for All Weather</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart windows with dynamic regulation of solar visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) transmittance and long&#8208;wave infrared (LWIR) emittance present a crucial solution for improving building energy efficiency. We demonstrate a multimodal smart window with independent electro&#8208;modulation for visible, NIR, and LWIR, ensuring thermal comfort and energy conservation for all weather while offering multifunctionalities of illumination, glare reduction, and privacy protection.








Abstract
Intelligent modulation of solar and thermal radiation for a smart window, including visible, near&#8208;infrared (NIR), and long&#8208;wave infrared (LWIR) spectral tri&#8208;bands (0.38&#8211;25&#160;&#181;m), to achieve indoor comfort and energy efficiency is a critical frontier in sustainable building design. However, independent regulations of multi&#8208;functional radiation of visible lighting, NIR heating, and LWIR radiative cooling for dynamic operational requirements and weather conditions are not fully solved. A PET/ITO/PB/Pt&#8208;NPs electrode featuring separated reactions of ion insertion and metal electrodeposition for dual&#8208;band modulation of visible and NIR via precise potential control, enabling multifunctionalities such as illumination, glare reduction, and privacy protection is proposed. A multimodal smart window of lighting&#8208;heating&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;modulation device (LHE&#8208;ED), wherein electrochromism and dynamic emittance are delicately manipulated for tri&#8208;band modulation, possesses six independent electro&#8208;driven states of multi&#8208;scene lighting&#8208;heating&#8208;emitting regulations for the first time, exhibiting excellent wavelength selectivity of &#9651;TVis&#160;=&#160;41.24%, &#9651;TNIR&#160;=&#160;53.95%, and &#916;&#949;8&#8208;13&#160;&#181;m&#160;=&#160;0.35. Building energy simulations demonstrate the LHE&#8208;ED outperforms commercial low&#8208;E glass across diverse climate zones, showcasing a maximum reduction in CO2 emissions of 34.01&#160;kg&#160;(m2&#160;year)&#8722;1 and a decrease in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)&#160;energy consumption by 34.18% annually, which paves the way for next&#8208;generation smart window in terms of energy saving and environmental preservation.

         <title>Levetiracetam&#8208;Assisted Perovskite Crystallization and Tripartite Lead Iodide Reduction in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective method for suppressing residual PbI2: Add chiral LEV molecules to the PbI2 precursor solution to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, release intracellular stress, passivate vacancies and defects, reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi&#8208;interfaces and bulk, and achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Sequential deposition technique is widely used to fabricate perovskite films with large grain size in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Residual lead halide (PbI2) in the perovskite film tends to be decomposed into metallic lead (Pb0) under long&#8208;term heating or light soaking. Here, a chiral levetiracetam (LEV) dopant containing &#945;&#8208;amide and pyrrolidone groups is introduced into the PbI2 precursor solution. The carbonyl oxygen (labeled O1) and amide oxygen (labeled O2) in the pyrrolidone ring have significant electronegativity and form coordination bonds with Pb2+ ions through electron transfer, thereby regulating the nucleation and crystallization process of perovskite. The chirality of LEV induces spatial selectivity in perovskite precursor coordination, promoting oriented growth along the (100) crystallographic facet. Additionally, it enables selective defect passivation, preferentially addressing Pb and I vacancies. Ultimately, LEV doping reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi&#8208;interfaces and bulk. Besides, the resulted PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 26% with a stabilized power output of 25.8% and maintained 90% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking for 1000 h. This study offers a novel research paradigm to advance the development of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Growth of Two&#8208;Inch Perovskite CsPbBr3 Single&#8208;Crystal with High Irradiation Resistance for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

Two&#8208;inch CsPbBr3 SC were grown with vertical Bridgman method, and the X&#8208;ray detection stability of Au/CsPbBr3/Bi devices after high&#8208;dose irradiation was investigated. We found the change in the Fermi level after irradiation endows the enhancement in sensitivity, demonstrating ultra&#8208;high irradiation hardness for the devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 crystals have demonstrated considerable promise in &#947;&#8208;ray and X&#8208;ray detection, owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the growth of large single crystals (SCs) and the stability of CsPbBr3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors under high&#8208;energy radiation exposure remain unexplored. In this study, a two&#8208;inch CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal is grown using the vertical Bridgman (VB) method, and its irradiation resistance in X&#8208;ray detection performance is investigated after exposure to 60Co &#947;&#8208;ray radiation. Compared with unirradiated samples, the crystals irradiated with a dose of 10&#160;Mrad exhibit a higher trap density (1.59 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;3) and a lower resistivity (8.2 &#215; 107 &#937; cm). However, the Bi/CsPbBr3/Au devices with asymmetric electrode structure exhibit an enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (14), a stable and low dark current density (7 nA cm&#8722;2) with a current drift of 5.8 &#215; 10&#8722;15 A cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1, and a high sensitivity of 55722 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for X&#8208;ray detection at an electric field of 3000&#160;V cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the irradiated device remained stable X&#8208;ray response characteristics after 220 days aging. These findings highlight the exceptional defect tolerance and irradiation stability of CsPbBr3 devices for high&#8208;performance radiation detections, offering critical insights for their long&#8208;term deployment in high&#8208;radiation environments.

         <title>Synergies Between Atomically Dispersed Ru Single Atoms and Nanoparticles on CeAlOx for Enhanced Photo&#8208;Thermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an efficient strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 by fabricating Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalysts that harness the synergistic effects of Ru single atoms and nanoparticles. Ru single atoms facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation and subsequent conversion, while Ru nanoparticles promote H2 dissociation, with their synergistic interplay driving superior performance.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts integrating single&#8208;atom species and nanoparticles maximize atom utilization and hydrogen dissociation for hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges in maintaining consistent metal loadings during synthesis complicate direct performance comparisons with the single&#8208;atom and nanoparticle&#8208;based systems, which obscures rational assessment of their catalytic potential. Herein, Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx photothermal catalysts are reported which leverage the synergy between Ru single atoms and Ru nanoparticles to enhance CO2 hydrogenation to CH4. Under light irradiation (3.1 W cm&#8722;2, 200&#8211;1100 nm) at 200&#160;&#176;C, the Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalyst achieves a CH4 production rate of 197.2 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with near&#8208;100% selectivity, surpassing single&#8208;atom Ru1/CeAlOx catalysts and nanoparticle&#8208;based RuNPs/CeAlOx catalysts, with equivalent metal contents. Mechanistic studies revealed that in Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalysts, Ru single atoms facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation and subsequent conversion, while Ru nanoparticles promote H2 dissociation, with their synergistic interplay driving superior performance. Moreover, the CeAlOx support effectively stabilizes the dual&#8208;site structure and facilitates the formation of reaction intermediates through its abundant oxygen vacancies and surface Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, thereby further enhancing the catalytic reaction. This work highlights the critical role of synergistic effects between single atoms and nanoparticles, offering new approaches for designing high&#8208;efficiency hydrogenation catalysts.

Ru single atoms facilitate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/activation and subsequent conversion, while Ru nanoparticles promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation, with their synergistic interplay driving superior performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous catalysts integrating single-atom species and nanoparticles maximize atom utilization and hydrogen dissociation for hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges in maintaining consistent metal loadings during synthesis complicate direct performance comparisons with the single-atom and nanoparticle-based systems, which obscures rational assessment of their catalytic potential. Herein, Ru&lt;sub&gt;1+NPs&lt;/sub&gt;/CeAlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; photothermal catalysts are reported which leverage the synergy between Ru single atoms and Ru nanoparticles to enhance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Under light irradiation (3.1 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 200&#8211;1100 nm) at 200&#160;&#176;C, the Ru&lt;sub&gt;1+NPs&lt;/sub&gt;/CeAlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst achieves a CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 197.2 mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with near-100% selectivity, surpassing single-atom Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CeAlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts and nanoparticle-based Ru&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt;/CeAlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts, with equivalent metal contents. Mechanistic studies revealed that in Ru&lt;sub&gt;1+NPs&lt;/sub&gt;/CeAlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts, Ru single atoms facilitate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/activation and subsequent conversion, while Ru nanoparticles promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation, with their synergistic interplay driving superior performance. Moreover, the CeAlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; support effectively stabilizes the dual-site structure and facilitates the formation of reaction intermediates through its abundant oxygen vacancies and surface Lewis acid-base pairs, thereby further enhancing the catalytic reaction. This work highlights the critical role of synergistic effects between single atoms and nanoparticles, offering new approaches for designing high-efficiency hydrogenation catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crack&#8208;Free Transfer of Wafer&#8208;Scale Freestanding Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanomembranes Enabled by Elastically Graded Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastically graded polymer (EGP) support is developed to achieve wafer&#8208;scale crack&#8208;free transfer of freestanding single&#8208;crystalline oxide membranes. The engineered elastic gradient accommodates tensile and compressive strain by tuning interfacial stiffness, effectively minimizing crack formation during lift&#8208;off. Using this approach, large&#8208;area membranes exhibit pristine surfaces with &#8776;99% intactness, overcoming the critical fracture bottleneck.








Abstract
Freestanding single&#8208;crystalline nanomembranes have gained increasing attention as promising platforms for both fundamental research and advanced electronic applications. However, internal stress gradients arising from epitaxial strain within the oxide membranes often result in high crack density during fabrication, leading to unsatisfactory yield and limited reliability. Here, an elastically graded polymer (EGP) support that enables wafer&#8208;scale crack&#8208;free transfer of single&#8208;crystalline oxide membranes are developed. The engineered elastic gradient within the EGP accommodates the internal strain of the oxide membrane, effectively minimizing crack formation during lift&#8208;off. Notably, this ability to spatially control the interfacial stiffness between the polymer and the oxide film enables crack suppression under both tensile and compressive strain. This approach provides a robust and scalable route to producing high&#8208;quality freestanding oxide membranes, paving the way not only for their integration into novel device architecture but also opening new avenues for scientific exploration of functional systems.

         <title>A Trilayer Nanofluidic Ionic Diode for High&#8208;Performance Moisture&#8208;Enabled Energy Harvesting and Ionic Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the design of p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells, the first trilayer p&#8208;i&#8208;n moist&#8208;electric generator has been developed. This device integrates a positively charged (p&#8208;type) layer, a neutral hygroscopic layer (i&#8208;type), and a negatively charged (n&#8208;type) layer, overcoming the limitations of conventional bilayer p&#8208;n devices and enabling the integration of efficient carrier generation with controllable carrier transport.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ionic diodes enable directional ion transport through confined nanochannels, holding great promise for energy harvesting and iontronic applications. However, their development in moisture&#8208;enabled power generation remains limited by insufficient carrier generation and unstable device performance. Here, a trilayer nanofluidic ionic diode&#8208;based moist&#8208;electric generator is reported, integrating positively charged fabrics, lithium chloride&#8208;doped neutral fabrics, and negatively charged fabrics into a p&#8208;i&#8208;n configuration. The hygroscopic neutral layer promotes efficient moisture absorption and ion dissociation, while the adjacent charged layers, featuring nanochannels formed by graphene oxides, establish a built&#8208;in electric field to rectify cation and anion fluxes. This unique structural and functional synergy enables continuous carrier generation and directional transport, achieving both a remarkable voltage of &#8776;1.38 V and a current of &#8776;35 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 and further exhibiting a peak voltage of &#8776;1.6 V with stable operation for over 600 h by employing active metal electrodes. Beyond energy harvesting, the diode&#8208;like rectification allows implementation of ionic logic gates and foldable configurations for powering portable electronics. This work establishes a versatile platform for high&#8208;performance nanofluidic diode&#8208;based devices, bridging sustainable power generation with emerging iontronic systems.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework and Carbon Nitride Composite for Scalable Solar Reforming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular composite, containing a covalent organic framework, indium tin oxide, carbon nitride and nickel based molecular catalyst, enables solar reforming under neutral aqueous conditions, converting polyols and sugars into formate while generating H2. The composite forms scalable photoleaf and photopanel devices, achieving continuous solar&#8208;driven waste valorization and hydrogen production outdoors.








Abstract
Solar reforming uses sunlight to valorize waste and offers a promising route to circular chemistry, but most current systems operate under corrosive conditions, lack scalability and processability, or suffer from poor selectivity in oxidative waste valorization. Here, a modular composite photocatalyst, comprising a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF), cyanamide&#8208;functionalized carbon nitride (CNx), indium tin oxide (ITO), and a nickel&#8208;based molecular catalyst (NiME), capable of driving selective waste valorization and H2 generation using visible light under pH neutral aqueous conditions is reported. The porous structure of the COF provides nanoconfinement, thereby supporting the targeted oxidation of polyols and sugars into formate (HCOO&#8722;), while carbon nitride in the presence of the molecular catalyst facilitates H2 evolution. ITO functions as a solid&#8208;state electron mediator, enabling coupled oxidative and reductive processes for the concurrent solar&#8208;driven production of H2 and HCOO&#8722;. The high processability of the COF|ITO|CNx|NiME composite allows for the construction of a standalone photoleaf and photopanel, which have been integrated into a single&#8208;window and a scalable multi&#8208;window reactor, respectively. Continuous operability over seven days, along with testing under outdoor conditions with pretreated plastic under direct sunlight, offers a pathway toward practical and scalable solar reforming using structurally tunable organic semiconductor composites.

         <title>Dynamic Protective Multi&#8208;Layers for MnO2 Cathodes: Ion Sorting and Structural Protection for Superior Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired dynamic multi&#8208;layer interface combines a stable outer shield, an Mn2+ selective buffer, and a conductive base enriched with oxygen vacancies. The cooperative architecture blocks manganese dissolution, relieves lattice strain, and accelerates ion and electron transport, addressing key stability and kinetic bottlenecks of MnO2 cathodes in aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are characterized by high safety, low cost, and eco&#8208;friendliness, among which manganese&#8208;based cathodes stand out due to their abundance and high theoretical capacity. However, failure behaviors such as lattice collapse, Mn dissolution, and sluggish kinetics hinder their application. Herein, a dynamic multi&#8208;protective interface has been designed through a simple one&#8208;step manufacturing process, emulating the structural and functional attributes of biological membranes and cell walls. It comprises three distinct layers: an outer high&#8208;valent oxide layer that enhances chemical stability and selectively facilitates proton intercalation while governing the intercalation of Zn2+; a middle low&#8208;valent oxide and metal composite layer, which functions as a buffer to selectively adsorb Mn2+, thereby inhibiting Mn dissolution and augmenting the chemical stability of the cathode; and an inner heterojunction layer, which boosts conductivity and alleviates Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion through lattice distortion and entropy&#8208;mediated electronic delocalization. The surface modified cathode exhibits outstanding stability, with nearly zero capacity decay observed over 300 cycles at a low current density of 0.4 A g&#8722;1, and 15&#160;000 cycles under a high current of 10 A g&#8722;1. With significantly enhanced cycling stability, rate capability, and electrochemical reversibility, this strategy presents a promising solution for high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8208;based cathodes in AZMBs.

It comprises three distinct layers: an outer high-valent oxide layer that enhances chemical stability and selectively facilitates proton intercalation while governing the intercalation of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; a middle low-valent oxide and metal composite layer, which functions as a buffer to selectively adsorb Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby inhibiting Mn dissolution and augmenting the chemical stability of the cathode; and an inner heterojunction layer, which boosts conductivity and alleviates Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion through lattice distortion and entropy-mediated electronic delocalization. The surface modified cathode exhibits outstanding stability, with nearly zero capacity decay observed over 300 cycles at a low current density of 0.4 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 15&#160;000 cycles under a high current of 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With significantly enhanced cycling stability, rate capability, and electrochemical reversibility, this strategy presents a promising solution for high-performance MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based cathodes in AZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pre&#8208;Anchored Ionic Bond Mediators Enabling Controllable Monolayer Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;anchoring Arg on NiOx concurrently mitigates SAM amphiphilicity via ionic bonding and suppresses SAM self&#8208;aggregation by acting as a physical barrier. This bifunctional mechanism enables rapid, controlled assembly of dense, uniform SAM monolayers, yielding PCEs of 26.67% (small&#8208;area PSC, active area: 0.049 cm2) and 21.05% (module, active area: 64.68 cm2).








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) has emerged as an indispensable hole&#8208;selective contact for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the formation of dense, uniform SAMs via wet deposition poses challenges due to two thermodynamically feasible yet competing processes: the self&#8208;aggregation of SAM molecules and chemisorption&#8208;driven substrate anchoring. Herein, a rapid and controllable strategy for SAM assembly is presented, enabled by pre&#8208;adsorbed ionic bond mediators. The pre&#8208;anchored arginine (Arg) molecules on nickel oxid (NiOx) can weaken the amphiphilic nature of SAM molecules through ionic bond interaction, while also acting as steric barriers, thereby suppressing the self&#8208;aggregation of SAM molecules. This strategy is compatible with both spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating techniques, enabling rapid and controllable assembly of high&#8208;quality SAM of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl] phosphonic acid. Moreover, the polar guanidinium tail of Arg passivates defects at the buried perovskite interface while strengthening interfacial coupling with the perovskite layer&#8211;enhancing both mechanical stability and electrical contact. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, the PSCs achieve high PCEs of up to 26.67% and 21.05% for small&#8208;area devices (active area: 0.049 cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (active area: 64.68 cm2), respectively. Notably, the devices exhibit exceptional operational stability, retaining 93% of their initial PCE after 1700 h of maximum power point tracking under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Enabling Ultra&#8208;High Work Capacity and Scalable Processability of Liquid Crystal Actuators through Densely Entangled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with densely entangled structures are designed and synthesized. These entanglements significantly enhance the mechanical properties, resulting in an unprecedented work capacity during thermal actuation. The reversible nature of the entanglements makes the material easy to process, similar to conventional thermoplastic materials. This combination achieves both high work capacity and scalable processability for LCEs.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are important soft actuators that show strong promise in many fields where traditional rigid actuators or robotics are impractical. However, their real&#8208;world applications are lacking primarily due to inadequate actuation performance and complicated fabrication processes. Here, a novel design is reported that significantly enhances actuation performance while simplifying the fabrication process. The design involves constructing densely entangled structures by synthesizing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear LCEs (&gt;180&#160;kDa) with a moderate number of side groups in a single step. These entangled structures greatly enhance mechanical strength while maintaining toughness, resulting in an ultra&#8208;high actuation work capacity (1427&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). By applying melt shearing or solvent treatment, these entanglements can be temporarily disrupted, providing thermoplastic&#8208;like processability. With these properties, lightweight wearable devices (&lt;10 g) capable of generating over 30&#160;N of contractile force are developed, which is sufficient to reversibly lift an adult male's arm. This work employs a single fabrication step to develop densely entangled LCEs with exceptional actuation performance and thermoplastic&#8208;like processability, signaling a bright future for their applications in rehabilitation devices, wearables, and beyond.

         <title>Thermal Phase Transition Electrolyte for High&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal phase transition aqueous electrolyte incorporating a upper critical solution temperature (UCST)&#8208;type polymer undergoes adaptive phase transitions, forming dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks that suppress water mobility and evaporation, provide self&#8208;regulated thermal buffering under localized heating, and restructure Zn2+ solvation to lower water activity, thereby stabilizing the Zn/electrolyte interface and substantially prolonging the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
The operational stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) under extreme temperatures is crucial for long&#8208;term energy storage, yet remains hindered by intensified water activity and thermodynamic instability that exacerbate zinc dendrite growth and parasitic reactions. While incorporation of high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point organic solvents has shown effectiveness for high&#8208;temperature operation by reducing water content and disrupting hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, it compromises the intrinsic safety of aqueous electrolyte especially in high&#8208;temperature scenario. Here, a thermoresponsive electrolyte approach is reported leveraging phase transition of a synthesized polymer with upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which achieves temperature&#8208;adaptive electrochemical performance in AZMBs. By modulating polymer&#8208;water interactions and entropy&#8208;enthalpy balance, the engineered aqueous electrolyte undergoes reversible phase transformation above 40 &#176;C, forming a dynamically polymer&#8208;water network that essentially suppresses water reactivity. Consequently, the optimized Zn&#8211;Zn symmetric cells exhibit stable Zn plating/stripping for 450 h at 60 &#176;C and 210 h even under extreme 80 &#176;C conditions. High&#8208;loading Zn&#8211;I2 full batteries with enhanced cycling stability further validate practical viability of the thermal phase transition electrolyte at elevated temperature. This work establishes a polymer phase transition paradigm for developing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes, providing mechanistic insights into interfacial stabilization and advancing metal anode technologies for extreme&#8208;condition energy storage systems.

         <title>Engineering the Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Electricity Generation from Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite oxide family is demonstrated for the first time to enable efficient electricity generation from water evaporation, and the key role of oxygen vacancies in promoting the performance is discovered. Oxygen vacancies in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept La0.95FeO3&#8208;&#948; can enhance surface charges and facilitate water dissociation, resulting in stronger water&#8208;solid interaction/more ions transport in capillary channels and ultimately boosting voltage output.








Abstract
The development of new suitable material systems is paramount for water evaporation&#8208;induced electricity generation associated with the energy harvesting technology. Herein, to the best of the knowledge, the first demonstration of perovskite oxides for efficient electricity generation from water evaporation is presented and discover the key role of oxygen vacancies in promoting the performance. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example, the A&#8208;site&#8208;deficient La0.95FeO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite with abundant oxygen vacancies in a single generator can achieve an absolute value of output voltage up to &#8776;1.5&#160;V for 200&#160;h under ambient conditions and even up to &#8776;2.5&#160;V at specific conditions, about one order of magnitude higher than the stoichiometric LaFeO3 counterpart. Noticeably, a voltage reversal phenomenon during the evaporation process is observed due to the zeta potential inversion mediated by the surface functional hydroxyl groups on the perovskite films. Theoretical calculations and systematic experiments demonstrate that oxygen vacancies in La0.95FeO3&#8208;&#948; enable to enhance surface charges and facilitate water dissociation, leading to stronger water&#8208;solid interfacial interaction and more ion transport in capillary networks, ultimately boosting the voltage output. More importantly, it is found that the promoting effect of oxygen vacancy in water evaporation&#8208;induced electricity is universal and applicable for metal oxides with varied structures and compositions.

Noticeably, a voltage reversal phenomenon during the evaporation process is observed due to the zeta potential inversion mediated by the surface functional hydroxyl groups on the perovskite films. Theoretical calculations and systematic experiments demonstrate that oxygen vacancies in La&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;3-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; enable to enhance surface charges and facilitate water dissociation, leading to stronger water-solid interfacial interaction and more ion transport in capillary networks, ultimately boosting the voltage output. More importantly, it is found that the promoting effect of oxygen vacancy in water evaporation-induced electricity is universal and applicable for metal oxides with varied structures and compositions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regenerative Redox Cycling Enables Stable Tin Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regenerative redox cycling strategy is developed to enable continuous reduction of Sn4+ and dual&#8208;site defect passivation during device operation, thereby enhancing the long&#8208;term stability of tin perovskite devices. The optimized device achieved an efficiency of 15.15% and exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, maintaining 100% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of simulated day&#8211;night cycling.








Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (THPs) suffer from low stability due to the easy oxidation of Sn (II). Although traditional reduction strategies effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn (II), the gradual depletion of reducing agents during continuous device operation significantly weakens their antioxidative capacity, thereby limiting the long&#8208;term stability of the device. Herein, a regenerative redox cycling strategy utilizing 4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (4&#8208;MBA) is proposed. Under operational conditions, UV irradiation enables 4&#8208;MBA regeneration, which concurrently drives continuous Sn (IV)&#8208;to&#8208;Sn (II) reduction and facilitates dual&#8208;site defect passivation, significantly enhancing device efficiency and stability. Ultimately, an excellent efficiency of 15.15% is achieved and maintained 100% of the initial efficiency for 1100 h in a simulated day&#8211;night cycle maximum power point tracking (MPPT) test. This work provides a sustainable reduction strategy that effectively addresses the long&#8208;term stability issue of tin perovskite photovoltaic cells.

Although traditional reduction strategies effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn (II), the gradual depletion of reducing agents during continuous device operation significantly weakens their antioxidative capacity, thereby limiting the long-term stability of the device. Herein, a regenerative redox cycling strategy utilizing 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) is proposed. Under operational conditions, UV irradiation enables 4-MBA regeneration, which concurrently drives continuous Sn (IV)-to-Sn (II) reduction and facilitates dual-site defect passivation, significantly enhancing device efficiency and stability. Ultimately, an excellent efficiency of 15.15% is achieved and maintained 100% of the initial efficiency for 1100 h in a simulated day&#8211;night cycle maximum power point tracking (MPPT) test.

         <title>Engineering Aging: Approaches to Model and Deconstruct Biological Complexity</title>

The macro&#8208;experiences of aging are the result of an accumulation of micro&#8208;changes that occur over time.








Abstract
The disparity between the global increase in life expectancy and the steady decline in health outcomes with age has been a major driver for developing new ways to research aging. Although this current tools for studying aging outside of the human body&#8212;such as animal models and cells in a dish&#8212;have improved this fundamental understanding of the markers and key mechanisms underlying this process, several limitations remain. Animal models are poor biological representations of humans and have a weak track record of translating pre&#8208;clinical results into successful clinical applications. Similarly, current 2D cellular models do not recapitulate the dynamic 3D environment of human tissue. This gap between the need for accurate biological mimicry and the limitations of current aging models presents an exciting opportunity for the field of biofabrication. Over the past decade, the combination of biofabrication and advanced biomaterials has shown potential to engineer high&#8208;resolution features that change over time or respond to specific stimuli. In this perspective, the current state of in vitro aging models is reflected, identify the key features that new models must emulate, discuss the technologies available to meet these complex specifications, and consider some of the potential challenges facing the field.

         <dc:description>
Membrane technologies can enhance the efficiency and selectivity of chemical separations in energy&#8208;water systems. Improving our understanding and design of separation membranes will require studying their properties at the molecular scale, mesoscale, and macroscale. This perspective highlights advanced characterization techniques for revealing membrane properties and performance across length scales and discusses the challenges involved with characterizing membranes under realistic conditions.








Abstract
Membrane technologies can enhance the efficiency and selectivity of chemical separations in energy&#8208;water systems. Advanced characterization tools are critical for discerning separation mechanisms, revealing degradation processes, and designing novel materials and material systems for new and emerging challenges. The pursuit of next&#8208;generation membranes for water and energy applications requires understanding phenomena at the molecular scale, mesoscale, and macroscale. This perspective highlights advanced characterization techniques for elucidating and enhancing membrane performance, while addressing fundamental trade&#8208;offs involved in characterizing membranes under realistic conditions.
