         <title>Surface Defects Control Bulk Carrier Densities in Polycrystalline Pb&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping, the controlled addition of imperfections or impurities to a material, is crucial for semiconductors. This study shows that for&#160;Halide Perovskites, which have (very) low (intrinsic) defect densities because of&#160;effective self&#8208;healing and defect tolerance,&#160;the title's statement holds in an unprecedented fashion.








Abstract
The (opto)electronic behavior of semiconductors depends on their (quasi&#8208;)free electronic carrier densities. These are regulated by semiconductor doping, i.e., controlled &#8220;electronic contamination&#8221;. For metal halide perovskites (HaPs), the functional materials in several device types, which already challenge some of the understanding of semiconductor properties, this study shows that doping type, density and properties derived from these, are to a first approximation controlled via their surfaces. This effect, relevant to all semiconductors, and already found for some, is very evident for lead (Pb)&#8208;HaPs because of their intrinsically low electrically active bulk and surface defect densities. Volume carrier densities for most polycrystalline Pb&#8208;HaP films (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m grain diameter) are below those resulting from even &lt; 0.1% of surface sites being electrically active defects. This implies and is consistent with interfacial defects controlling HaP devices in multi&#8208;layered structures with most of the action at the two HaP interfaces. Surface and interface passivation effects on bulk electrical properties are relevant to all semiconductors and are crucial for developing those used today. However, because bulk dopant introduction in HaPs at controlled ppm levels for electronic&#8208;relevant carrier densities is so difficult, passivation effects are vastly more critical and dominate, to first approximation, their optoelectronic characteristics in devices.

         <title>Chiral Nematic Graphene Films with a mesoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition method is presented for the precise fabrication of chiral nematic graphene film, which exhibits uniform Na plating without dendrite formation and noteworthy thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding performance. This work paves the way for creating a large family of chiral nematic materials in various applications of photoelectric conversion, energy storage, electromagnetism, and separation.








Abstract
Ordering a crucial material like pure&#8208;graphene into the chiral nematic structure can potentially revolutionize the fields of photonics, chiral separation, and energy storage. However, the controlled fabrication of highly ordered graphene films with a long&#8208;range chiral nematic mesoporous structure is very challenging and as such, has not been achieved. Here, a chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition growth strategy is presented for the precise fabrication of mesoporous chiral nematic graphene films by using nanocrystalline cellulose as templates. It is evidenced that such graphene films possess the left&#8208;hand helical ordering, chiral nematic mesoporous structure with adjustable pore sizes (6.4&#8211;13.1&#160;nm), tailored pitch, excellent electrical conductivity (556 S cm&#8722;1), high specific surface area (1508 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and mechanical flexibility. By coating Na anode with this film, uniform Na plating is achieved with no dendrite formation, resulting from its unique chiral nematic structure and tunable physicochemical properties. The films also achieved impressive thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding, i.e., 35&#8211;63&#160;dB, demonstrating their potentially multi&#8208;disciplinary applications.

         <title>Unlocking Electrostrain in Plastically Deformed Barium Titanate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dislocation engineering strategy is introduced to unlock electrostrains and piezoelectric properties in lead&#8208;free BaTiO3 single crystals, achieving a record&#8208;high strain energy density and large piezoelectric coefficient through domain structure design and controlled switching, with broad implications for advanced actuator applications.








Abstract
Achieving substantial electrostrain alongside a large effective piezoelectric strain coefficient (d33*) in piezoelectric materials remains a formidable challenge for advanced actuator applications. Here, a straightforward approach to enhance these properties by strategically designing the domain structure and controlling the domain switching through the introduction of arrays of ordered {100}&lt;100&gt; dislocations is proposed. This dislocation engineering yields an intrinsic lock&#8208;in steady&#8211;state electrostrain of 0.69% at a low field of 10&#160;kV&#160;cm&#8722;1 without external stress and an output strain energy density of 5.24&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 in single&#8208;crystal BaTiO3, outperforming the benchmark piezoceramics and relaxor ferroelectric single&#8208;crystals. Additionally, applying a compression stress of 6&#160;MPa fully unlocks electrostrains exceeding 1%, yielding a remarkable d33* value over 10&#160;000&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 and achieving a record&#8208;high strain energy density of 11.67&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3. Optical and transmission electron microscopy, paired with laboratory and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, is employed to rationalize the observed electrostrain. Phase&#8208;field simulations further elucidate the impact of charged dislocations on domain nucleation and domain switching. These findings present an effective and sustainable strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, lead&#8208;free piezoelectric materials without the need for additional chemical elements, offering immense potential for actuator technologies.

         <title>A Synergistically Enhanced Triboelectric&#8208;Electromagnetic Hybrid Generator Enabled by Multifunctional Amorphous Alloy for Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Powered System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating multifunctional Fe72Si8B20 into the hybrid generator not only increases the output current and current retention of TENG by 28.75% and 85.24%, respectively, but also boosts the output power of EMG by 51.05%. Additionally, the variable impedance system effectively utilizes the output characteristics of TENG and EMG, resulting in a 198% improvement in energy utilization efficiency compared to conventional constant impendence systems.








Abstract
Triboelectric&#8208;electromagnetic hybrid generator (TEHG) has emerged as an effective technology for mechanical energy harvesting. However, the independent operation of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and electromagnetic generator (EMG), along with tribo&#8208;materials wear and magnetic field divergence, constrain the device's overall performance. To address these challenges, a synergistically enhanced TEHG (SE&#8208;TEHG) is proposed based on the multifunctional amorphous alloy. Following detailed material analyses, Fe72Si8B20 is selected as the synergistic layer for its low surface roughness, high Vickers&#8208;hardness, amorphous structure, and high magnetization. Compared to Al, this material not only boosts TENG's output current and current retention rate by 28.75% and 85.24%, but also improves EMG's output power by 51.05%. In constructing a self&#8208;powered system with TEHG, a significant impedance discrepancy exists between the energy harvester (with matched impendence of 16 M&#937; for TENG and 110 k&#937; for EMG) and the application end. Without power management circuits, the demonstrated self&#8208;powered variable impedance system achieves an energy utilization efficiency that is 2.98 times greater than the conventional constant impedance system. The integration of multifunctional materials to realize strong&#8208;coupling hybrid generators, combined with the customization of variable impedance systems, set a milestone in efficient mechanical energy harvesting and utilization.

By integrating the electromagnetic switching device with Salisbury screen and double&#8208;layer resonant cavity structure, dynamic camouflage and wave&#8208;absorbing switch are achieved, respectively. This versatile device holds promise for future advanced electromagnetic protection, stealth, camouflage, and other applications.








Abstract
The increasingly complex electromagnetic (EM) environment necessitates advanced electrically controllable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials that can adapt to varying EM conditions. This study develops a flexible electrochemically tunable EMI shielding device based on ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene films, exhibiting reversible shielding effectiveness (SE) modulation from 18.9 to 26.2&#160;dB in X band at 0.1 and &#8722;1.5&#160;V. Unlike the previously reported mechanism relying on interlayer spacing adjustments, the work leverages transformations of charging state and surface chemistry for tunability during the electrochemical process. The Ti3C2Tx flake size is also evidenced to play a crucial role, with smaller flakes offering higher absorption modulation despite lower SE modulation, enabling the device with high designability. When integrated with Salisbury screen structure, the device achieves adjustable absorption from 93.560% at 0.1&#160;V to 99.996% at &#8722;1&#160;V, showing a tunable reflection suppression ratio up to 32&#160;dB with an effective bandwidth of 4.2&#160;GHz. Additionally, incorporating resonant cavity structure enables absorption&#8208;dominated (over 90%) microwave&#8208;responsive switching at 0.1 and &#8722;1.5&#160;V. This work highlights significant potential of adaptive EMI shielding materials for applications in smart electronic protection, EM switch, and radar camouflage.

         <title>Impact of Dilute DIO Additive on Local Microstructure of Fluorinated, pNDI&#8208;Based Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of PBDBT: N2200&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer solar cells can be enhanced by processing with dilute diiodooctane solvent additive. This study reveals the microstructural mechanisms that drive charge transport enhancements in these solar cells by combining X&#8208;ray techniques with electron microscopy. Ultimately, the study finds that processing with dilute diiodooctane promotes efficient vertical charge transport pathways while preserving donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.








Abstract
The performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells is often enhanced by incorporating solvent additives during solution processing. In particular, blends based on the model all&#8208;polymer system PBDBT:N2200 have been shown to have increased short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor when processed with dilute diiodooctane (DIO). However, the morphological mechanism that drives the increase in performance is often not well understood due to limitations in common characterization techniques. In this study, it is shown that a combination of X&#8208;ray techniques with cryogenic high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis can provide a quantitative and spatially resolved picture of polymer chain orientation and alignment in all&#8208;polymer blends. It is found that DIO induces vertical phase separation in PBDBT&#8208;2F:F&#8208;N2200 and increases donor crystallite thickness in the pi&#8208;stacking direction leading to an acceptor&#8208;rich film surface. However, it is also shown that DIO does not disrupt the formation of face&#8208;on donor&#8211;acceptor interfaces. These findings suggest that dilute DIO primarily affects crystalline domain formation in single component regions as opposed to mixed regions; thus, dilute DIO can impact vertical charge transport pathways without sacrificing donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.

         <title>Microenvironment Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanomedicine Promotes Spinal Cord Repair by Suppressing Inflammation Cascade and Neural Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine (RHNP&#8208;Cur) is capable of consistently crossing the blood spinal cord barrier and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of spinal cord injury through changes of surface structure and targeted peptide modification, promoting spinal cord repair by suppressing inflammation cascade and neural apoptosis.








Abstract
Despite various biomaterial&#8208;based strategies are tried in spinal cord injury (SCI), developing safe and effective microinvasive pharmacotherapy strategies is still an unmet clinical need. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomedicine has emerged as a promising non&#8208;invasion technology, which enhances drug delivery and promotes functional recovery following SCI. Considering the multiple progressive pathological events and the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) associating SCI, a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanoparticle (custom&#8208;designed with rabies virus glycoprotein 29&#8208;RVG29 and hyaluronic acid&#8208;HA, RHNP) capable of consistently crossing the BSCB and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of SCI are developed. The data indicated that RHNP can effectively traverse the BSCB through RVG29, and adaptively modulate cellular internalization by selectively exposing either HA or RVG29 through diselenide bonds, depending on pathological reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals. Furthermore, curcumin is loaded into RHNP (RHNP&#8208;Cur) to improve motor function and coordination of hind&#8208;limbs in a traumatic SCI mouse model. This study finds that RHNP&#8208;Cur exhibited inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cascade originating from M1 microglia/macrophages and neurotoxic astrocytes, and protected neural cells from inflammation&#8208;induced apoptosis during nerve regeneration. Collectively, the work provides a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine which enables efficient microinvasive treatment of SCI.

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Ultra&#8208;Efficient Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hygroscopic Nanofibers for Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Tillandsia, a thermo&#8208;responsive hygroscopic nanofiber called PCP@LiCl is prepared for atmospheric water harvesting. PCP@LiCl exhibits unique kinetics due to the porous structure, capable of adsorbing moisture to saturation within 2&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and 15%&#8211;30% relative humidity and oozing liquid water within 5&#160;min under sunlight.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising approach for supplying water in off&#8208;grid arid regions. However, it is difficult to improve the SAWH efficiency because water undergoes multiple phase transformations, such as water vapor&#8211;water (desorption and condensation) in the desorption phase. To address this issue, an ultrahygroscopic temperature&#8208;responsive hydrogel nanofiber inspired by Tillandsia is developed, comprising poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide, poly N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, and carbon nanotubes and impregnated with lithium chloride (PCP@LiCl). The hydrophobicity of the nanofiber membrane is enhanced with increasing temperature, facilitating water separation from the hydrogel in liquid form. Moreover, PCP@LiCl exhibits unique kinetics at 25 &#176;C and 15%&#8211;30% relative humidity, capable of adsorbing moisture to saturation within 2&#160;h, and oozing liquid water within 5&#160;min under sunlight. Through global potential modeling, it is demonstrated that PCP@LiCl has potential applications in arid and semiarid regions. This study provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance composites for solar&#8208;powered atmospheric water harvesting.

         <title>High Performance and Colorful Polymer Thermoelectrics with Imprinted Porous Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer films featuring highly ordered periodic porous structures not only demonstrate exceptional thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, reaching up to 0.52, but also exhibit captivating structural colors and remarkable stretchability.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things and wearable electronics has generated growing interest in creating high&#8208;performance and visually striking polymer thermoelectric (TE) devices. However, existing polymer TE materials have yet to fully meet these diverse demands. In this study, imprinted porous polymer films are introduced that exhibit both high TE performance and a spectrum of structural colors. The porous architecture not only preserves excellent charge transport properties but also significantly enhances phonon&#8208;like scattering, resulting in a more than 50% reduction in thermal conductivity for the PDPPSe&#8208;12 film. This leads to a 170% increase in the figure of merit (ZT), achieving a peak value of 0.52 at 363&#160;K. Furthermore, the highly ordered porous structure imparts the PDPPSe&#8208;12 films with both a wide range of structural colors and remarkable stretchability, making them ideal for wearable TE generators. This approach is widely applicable to various polymeric systems, offering a novel strategy for advancing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art plastic TE materials through microstructural engineering.

         <title>Tailorable Fluorescent Perovskite Quantum Dots for Multiform Manufacturing via Two&#8208;Step Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is introduced for the tailorable fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (T&#8208;PQDs). A protective shell is formed around the PQDs in the first step, while chemical cross&#8208;linking between PQD and thiol&#8208;ene polymer occurs in the second step. The T&#8208;PQDs offer high efficiency, stability, and processability, facilitating their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.








Abstract
In practical applications, fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) must exhibit high efficiency, stability, and processibility. So far, it remains a challenge to synthesize PQDs with stable dispersibility in tailorable monomers both before and after photocuring. In this work, a novel strategy of UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is proposed to prepare PQDs with these attributes. The first step aims to epitaxially grow a shell around the PQD core to ensure stable dispersibility in a thiol&#8208;ene monomer solution. The second step is to achieve stable dispersibility in the photocured thiol&#8208;ene matrixes for multiform manufacturing processes. The tailorable PQDs (T&#8208;PQDs) not only have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;100% for green emission and over 96% for red emission, but also exhibit remarkable stability under severe conditions, including &#8220;double 85&#8221; aging, water exposure, and mechanical stress. Moreover, their exceptional processability allows for various processing techniques, including slot&#8208;die coating, inkjet printing, direct&#8208;laser writing, UV&#8208;light 3D printing, nanoimprinting, and spin coating. The high efficiency and stability of T&#8208;PQDs facilitate their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Charge Generation and Enhancement of Key Components of Triboelectric Nanogenerators: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) with the design and synthesis of functional dielectric materials, the exploration of novel dynamic charge transport mechanisms, and the innovative design of architecture, making it one of the most crucial technologies for energy harvesting. High output charge density is fundamental for TENG to expand its application scope and accelerate industrialization; it depends on the dynamic equilibrium of charge generation, trapping, de&#8208;trapping, and migration within its core components. Here, this review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of the charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art principles and techniques for generating high charge density and suppressing charge decay are discussed and highlighted in detail, and the distinct charge transport mechanisms, the technologies of advanced materials preparation, and the effective charge excitation strategy are emphatically introduced. Lastly, the bottleneck and future research priorities for boosting the output charge density are summarized. A summary of these cutting&#8208;edge developments intends to provide readers with a deep understanding of the future design of high&#8208;output TENG.

         <title>Engineering Radiocatalytic Nanoliposomes with Hydrophobic Gold Nanoclusters for Radiotherapy Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoliposomes containing hydrophobic gold nanoclusters are engineered, characterized, and evaluated for their radiocatalytic properties for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. These nanoliposomes exhibit promising radiotherapy&#8208;enhancing properties, potential for radiotherapy&#8208;controlled drug delivery, and improved chemoradiotherapy outcomes on 3D pancreatic microtumors. The nanoliposomes exhibit excellent tumor accumulation and also identify further innovations to pave the way toward more effective chemoradiotherapy strategies.








Abstract
Chemoradiation therapy is on the forefront of pancreatic cancer care, and there is a continued effort to improve its safety and efficacy. Liposomes are widely used to improve chemotherapy safety, and may accurately deliver high&#8208;Z element&#8208; radiocatalytic nanomaterials to cancer tissues. In this study, the interaction between X&#8208;rays and long&#8208;circulating nanoliposome formulations loaded with gold nanoclusters is explored in the context of oxaliplatin chemotherapy for desmoplastic pancreatic cancer. Hydrophobic gold nanoclusters stabilized with dodecanethiol (AuDDT) are efficiently incorporated in nanoliposomal bilayers. AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augmented radiation&#8208;induced &#8226;OH production, which is most effective with monochromatic X&#8208;rays at energies that exceed the K&#8208;shell electron binding energy of Au (81.7&#160;keV). Cargo release assays reveal that AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes can permeabilize lipid bilayers in an X&#8208;ray dose&#8208; and formulation&#8208;dependent manner. The radiocatalytic effect of AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augments radiotherapy and oxaliplatin&#8208;chemoradiotherapy outcomes in 3D pancreatic microtumors. The PEGylated AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes display high tumor accumulation in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, showing promise for nanoliposomes as carriers for radiocatalytic nanomaterials. Altogether, compelling proof for chemo&#8208;radiation dose&#8208;enhancement using AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes is presented. Further improving the nanoliposomal loading of high&#8208;Z elements will advance the safety, efficacy, and translatability of such chemoradiation dose&#8208;enhancement approaches.

         <title>Synthesis Strategies for High Entropy Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for high entropy materials nanoparticles preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) of high entropy materials (HEMs) have attracted significant attention due to their versatility and wide range of applications. HEM NPs can be synthesized by fragmenting bulk HEMs or disintegrating and recrystallizing them. Alternatively, directly producing HEMs in NP form from atomic/ionic/molecular precursors presents a significant challenge. A widely adopted strategy involves thermodynamically driving HEM NP formation by leveraging the entropic contribution but incorporating strategies to limit NP growth at the elevated temperatures used for maximizing entropy. A second approach is to kinetically drive HEM NP formation by promoting rapid reactions of homogeneous reactant mixtures or using highly diluted precursor dissolutions. Additionally, experimental evidence suggests that enthalpy plays a significant role in driving HEM NP formation processes at moderate temperatures, with the high energy cost of generating additional surfaces and interfaces at the nanoscale stabilizing the HEM phase. This review critically assesses the various synthesis strategies developed for HEM NP preparation, highlighting key illustrative examples and offering insights into the underlying formation mechanisms. Such insights are critical for fine&#8208;tuning experimental conditions to achieve specific outcomes, ultimately enabling the effective synthesis of optimized generations of these advanced materials for both current and emerging applications across various scientific and technological fields.

         <title>Durable Organic Coating&#8208;Free Superhydrophobic Metal Surface by Paracrystalline State Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic coating&#8208;free durable self&#8208;superhydrophobic metal surface is achieved by a strategy of femtosecond laser element doping microstructuring on Al alloys followed by repetitive low&#8208;temperature annealing in this work. This novel design, which endows the metal surface with properties of unique air storage nanostructures, low free energy, and high chemical stability, can effectively avoid disadvantages of traditional sticking organic modifiers to long&#8208;termly keep the extreme water repellency.








Abstract
The chemical instability of traditional organically&#8208;decorated superhydrophobic metal surfaces is a significant issue, severely limiting practical applications. This is due to the susceptibility of low surface energy coatings to ion permeation, decomposition, and exfoliation, especially in harsh environments. Here, organic coating&#8208;free, durable superhydrophobic surfaces on Al alloys by developing the paracrystalline state of a bionic anthill tribe structure is successfully achieved, using femtosecond laser element&#8208;doping microstructuring followed by repetitive annealing processes. Remarkably, the inherent superhydrophobic properties of the sample are maintained for &#8776;2000 h in a corrosive 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, significantly surpassing the performance of traditional organic coatings. Moreover, this inherent superhydrophobicity remains nearly unchanged, even after rigorous electrochemical reaction measurements. Additional tests involving UV irradiation (&gt;100 h), freezing cycles (&gt;100 cycles), and acid/alkali resistance (&gt;65 h) further demonstrate that the environmental adaptability of the surface far exceeds that of silane&#8208;coated surfaces. Ab initio calculations reveal that the formation of the paracrystalline state reduces surface energy and enhances chemical stability, thereby extending the durability of the superhydrophobic metal. These findings offer a powerful strategy for utilizing atomic&#8208;level structural rearrangements to design inherent superhydrophobic surfaces without the need for organic coatings.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulation of Atomically Precise Nanoclusters in Reticular Frameworks via Mechanochemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical synthesis approach to encapsulate atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) in reticular frameworks in a controlled manner is proposed. This method significantly broadens the range of APNC@framework composites, facilitating the on&#8208;demand construction and regulation of component&#8208;specific nanocomposites.








Abstract
The combination of atomically precise nanoclusters (APNCs) and reticular frameworks is promising for generating component&#8208;specific nanocomposites with emergent properties. However, traditional liquid&#8208;phase synthesis often hampers this potential by damaging APNCs and limiting combination diversity. Here, mechanochemical synthesis to explore the encapsulation of diverse oil&#8208; and water&#8208;soluble APNCs within various reticular frameworks is employed, establishing a database of 21 unique APNC&#8722;framework combinations, including metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8722;organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen&#8722;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), and multivariate MOFs. These framework coatings not only spatially immobilize APNCs but also secure their structures, preventing aggregation and degradation while enhancing stability and activity. Encapsulating Au25 in HOFs resulted in a remarkable 315&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Au25 homogeneous catalyst, highlighting the framework's crucial role in catalytic enhancement. The mechanochemical synthesis strategy facilitates tailored support screening, catering to specific needs, and shows promise for developing multifunctional systems, including enzyme&#8722;APNC@frameworks material for cascade reactions.

         <title>Reversible Configurations of 3&#8208;Coordinate and 4&#8208;Coordinate Boron Stabilize Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathodes with Superior Cycling Stability for Practical Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work demonstrates a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, delivering a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This is the first time to realize the real B&#8208;doping, which exists in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations with high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, greatly stabilizing oxygen anions and impeding Ni&#8208;ion migration with high structure stability and rapid Li&#8208;ion diffusion.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathodes are the leading candidate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and ultrahigh capacity. However, the increased Ni content causes larger volume variations and worse lattice oxygen stability during cycling, resulting in capacity attenuation and kinetics hysteresis. Herein, a Li2SiO3&#8208;coated Li(Ni0.95Co0.04Mn0.01)0.99B0.01O2 ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode that well&#8208;addresses all the above issues, which is also the first time to realize the real doping of B ions is demonstrated. The as&#8208;obtained cathode delivers a reversible capacity of up to 237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 (924 Wh kg&#8722;1cathode) and a superior capacity retention of 84.2% after 500 cycles at 1C in pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cells. Advanced characterizations and calculations verify that the boron&#8208;doping is existed in terms of 3&#8208;coordinate and 4&#8208;coordinate configurations and their high electrochemical reversibility during de&#8208;/lithiation, which greatly stabilizes oxygen anions and impedes Ni&#8208;ion migration to Li layer. Furthermore, the B&#8208;doping engineers the primary particle microstructure for better relaxing the lattice strain and accelerating Li&#8208;ion diffusion. This work advances the energy density of cathode materials into the domain of above 900&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and the concept will inspire more intensive study on ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>Industrial Scale Sea&#8208;Island Melt&#8208;Spun Continuous Ultrafine Fibers for Highly Comfortable Insulated Aerogel Felt Clothing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Industrial&#8208;scale sea&#8208;island melt spinning technology is demonstrated to construct 3D porous thermal insulating aerogels with corrugated lamellar structure through freeze&#8208;shaping technology. This aerogel is only 1/3 the thickness of down but performs similarly. It also has excellent mechanical properties to meet fabric elasticity and comfort needs, while also exhibiting versatility, making it suitable for applications in extreme environments.









Abstract
Aerogels are most attractive for thermal clothing. However, mechanical fragility and structural instability restrict their practical applications. These issues are overcome by developing industrial scale sea&#8208;island melt&#8208;spun ultrafine fibers with large and uniform length&#8208;to&#8208;diameter as building blocks, which are assembled into aerogel felts with corrugated lamellar structure through freeze&#8208;shaping technology. These aerogels possess excellent mechanical properties to meet fabric elasticity and comfort needs, including super&#8208;flexibility (25% tensile strain, 95% compression, 180&#176; bending performance) and fatigue resistance of over 10,000 cycles. The aerogels are also self&#8208;cleaning, waterproof, breathable, and flame&#8208;retardant, making them suitable for application requirements in extreme environments. Moreover, the obtained aerogel felt clothing exhibits excellent thermal insulation properties close to that of dry air, and is only one&#8208;third as thick as down clothing with similar insulating properties. Expanding sea&#8208;island melt&#8208;spun fiber to construct aerogel in this strategy provides scalable potential for developing multifunctional insulating aerogel clothing.

         <title>Dirac&#8208;Like Fermions Anomalous Magneto&#8208;Transport in a Spin&#8208;Polarized Oxide 2D Electron System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous magneto&#8208;transport dominated by non&#8208;trivial Berry curvature and Dirac&#8208;like fermions is exhibited by an engineered 2D electron system (2DES) at (111) LaAlO3/EuTiO3/SrTiO3 interface, where structural and electronic properties are tailored to mimic that of magnetic gapped topological insulators.









Abstract
In a 2D electron system (2DES) the breaking of the inversion, time&#8208;reversal and bulk crystal&#8208;field symmetries is interlaced with the effects of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) triggering exotic quantum phenomena. Here, epitaxial engineering is used to design and realize a 2DES characterized simultaneously by ferromagnetic order, large Rashba SOC and hexagonal band warping at the (111) interfaces between LaAlO3, EuTiO3, and SrTiO3 insulators. The 2DES displays anomalous quantum corrections to the magneto&#8208;conductance driven by the time&#8208;reversal&#8208;symmetry breaking occurring below the magnetic transition temperature. The results are explained by the emergence of a non&#8208;trivial Berry phase and competing weak anti&#8208;localization/weak localization back&#8208;scattering of Dirac&#8208;like fermions, mimicking the phenomenology of gapped topological insulators. These findings open perspectives for the engineering of novel spin&#8208;polarized functional 2DES holding promises in spin&#8208;orbitronics and topological&#160;electronics.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Shearing Chemistry Directed Closed&#8208;Pore Regeneration in Biomass&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative DES cell&#8208;shearing strategy to tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure in bamboo&#8208;derived hard carbons. The optimized structure with appropriate closed&#8208;pore size (&#8764;2nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) walls exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. This work significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.








Abstract
The closed&#8208;pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure&#8208;electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell&#8208;shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed&#8208;pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed&#8208;pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 A g&#8722;1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons.

&lt;p&gt;The closed-pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure-electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell-shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed-pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed-pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra-thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30 mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 6 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons.

         <title>Omics&#8208;Enhanced Nanomedicine for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the integration of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, with nanomedicine for cancer therapy. Leveraging advanced next&#8208;generation sequencing techniques, it explores how these synergistic approaches enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize therapeutic strategies, and assess nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses, offering insights into future development in personalized cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapies, offering enhanced efficacy and safety in cancer management. However, the inherent heterogeneity of tumors presents increasing challenges for the application of cancer nanomedicine in both diagnosis and treatment. This heterogeneity necessitates the integration of advanced and high&#8208;throughput analytical techniques to tailor nanomedicine strategies to individual tumor profiles. Omics technologies, encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more, provide unparalleled insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cancer. By dissecting tumor heterogeneity across multiple levels, these technologies offer robust support for the development of personalized and precise cancer nanomedicine strategies. In this review, the principles, techniques, and applications of key omics technologies are summarized. Especially, the synergistic integration of omics and nanomedicine in cancer therapy is explored, focusing on enhanced diagnostic accuracy, optimized therapeutic strategies and the assessment of nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses. Moreover, this review addresses current challenges and outlines future directions in the field of omics&#8208;enhanced nanomedicine. By offering valuable insights and guidance, this review aims to advance the integration of omics with nanomedicine, ultimately driving improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer.

         <title>Magnetic Field&#8208;Induced Polar Order in Monolayer Molybdenum Disulfide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field (B)&#8208;induced giant electric hysteretic responses to back&#8208;gate voltages in monolayer (ML) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) below 20 Kelvin are observed and attributed to asymmetric lattice expansion with increasing |B| in ML&#8208;MoS2 FETs on rigid SiO2/Si substrates, leading to mirror symmetry breaking in ML&#8208;MoS2 and the emergence of a tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric&#8208;like polar order.








Abstract
In semiconducting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML&#8208;TMDs), broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling result in spin&#8208;valley lock&#8208;in effects so that the valley degeneracy may be lifted by external magnetic fields, potentially leading to real&#8208;space structural transformation. Here, magnetic field (B)&#8208;induced giant electric hysteretic responses to back&#8208;gate voltages are reported in ML&#8208;MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) on SiO2/Si at temperatures &lt;&#160;20 K. The observed hysteresis increases with |B| up to 12 T and is tunable by varying the temperature. Raman spectroscopic and scanning tunneling microscopic studies reveal significant lattice expansion with increasing |B| at 4.2 K, and this lattice expansion becomes asymmetric in ML&#8208;MoS2 FETs on rigid SiO2/Si substrates, leading to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror symmetry breaking and the emergence of a tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric&#8208;like polar order. This broken symmetry&#8208;induced polarization in ML&#8208;MoS2 shows typical ferroelectric butterfly hysteresis in piezo&#8208;response force microscopy, adding ML&#8208;MoS2 to the single&#8208;layer material family that exhibits out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar order&#8208;induced ferroelectricity, which is promising for such technological applications as cryo&#8208;temperature ultracompact non&#8208;volatile memories, memtransistors, and ultrasensitive magnetic field sensors. Moreover, the polar effect induced by asymmetric lattice expansion may be further generalized to other ML&#8208;TMDs and achieved by nanoscale strain engineering of the substrate without magnetic fields.

         <title>An Antagonistic Photovoltaic Memristor for Bioinspired Active Contrast Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired optoelectronic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. The memristor arrays are capable of capturing a high&#8208;contrast scene up to 94 dB with a faster active adaptation speed (less than 1.2 s) than that of biological systems.








Abstract
Machine vision systems that consist of cameras and image&#8208;processing components for visual inspection and identification tasks play a critical role in various intelligent applications, including pilotless vehicles and surveillance systems. However, current systems usually possess a limited dynamic range and fixed photoresponsivity, restricting their capability of gaining high&#8208;fidelity images when encoding a high&#8208;contrast scene. Here, it is shown that a photovoltaic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. Due to the dynamic photodoping effect at the p&#8208;n junction with an asymmetrical profile, the photocurrent polarities of the antagonistic memristor can be changed as the light intensity increases. The light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent switchable photovoltaic behaviors match Weber's law where photosensitivity is inversely proportional to the light stimuli. An 11&#160;&#215;&#160;11 memristor array is used to detect a high&#8208;contrast scene with light intensities ranging from 1 to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;104 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, achieving a similar active contrast adaptation performance compared with the human visual systems (less than 1.2 s at 94 dB). This work paves the way for innovative neuromorphic device designs and may lead to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active visual adaptation photosensors.

         <title>A DNAzyme&#8208;Based Nanohybrid for Ultrasound and Enzyme Dual&#8208;Controlled mRNA Regulation and Combined Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled DNAzyme nanohybrid is developed for ultrasound&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation and combined tumor treatment. This system enables ultrasound&#8208;enhanced endosomal escape and specific enzyme activation of DNAzyme function, thereby improving efficacy and cell&#8208;type specificity in target gene silencing and combinational tumor therapy.








Abstract
Despite the significant potential of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes for gene regulation, their application is limited by low therapeutic efficacy and lack of cell&#8208;specific control. Here, a DNAzyme&#8208;based nanohybrid designed for ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation is presented, enabling tumor cell&#8208;selective combination therapy. The nanohybrid is constructed by coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of an enzymatically&#8208;triggerable therapeutic DNAzyme (En&#8208;Dz) and natural sonosensitizer hemoglobin (Hb). Controlled US exposure induces reactive oxygen species generation from Hb units, which not only facilitates efficient endosomal escape of En&#8208;Dz, but also promotes the translocation of specific enzyme from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby enhancing gene regulation efficacy. Notably, the enzyme&#8208;triggered, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled activation of En&#8208;Dz's catalytic activity results in enhanced cancer&#8208;cell selectivity in the therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, the combination of enzyme&#8208;activated mRNA regulation and sonodynamic therapy significantly enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the potential of integrating a sonodynamic strategy to overcome the current limitations of DNAzyme&#8208;based gene regulators, providing a spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled approach for precise tumor treatment.

         <title>Solution Processable Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Strategy and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in design strategies for synthesizing solution&#8208;processable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF&#8208;based systems, including methods such as direct dispersion in ionic liquids, direct synthesis, etc. It emphasizes their applications in fabricating structured objects, membranes, and/or films for molecular storage, separation, and chemical sensing. The review also discusses future challenges and perspectives. 








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by inorganic secondary building units with organic linkers via reticular chemistry, inherently suffer from poor solution processability due to their insoluble nature, resulting from their extensive crystalline networks and structural rigidity. The ubiquitous occurrence of precipitation and agglomeration of MOFs upon formation poses a significant obstacle to the scale&#8208;up production of MOF&#8208;based monolith, aerogels, membranes, and electronic devices, thus restricting their practical applications in various scenarios. To address the previously mentioned challenge, significant strides have been achieved over the past decade in the development of various strategies aimed at preparing solution&#8208;processable MOF systems. In this review, the latest advance in the synthetic strategies for the construction of solution&#8208;processable MOFs, including direct dispersion in ionic liquids, surface modification, controllable calcination, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis, is comprehensively summarized. The respective advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Additionally, the intriguing applications of solution&#8208;processable MOF systems in the fields of liquid adsorbent, molecular capture, sensing, and separation are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities about the continued advancement of solution&#8208;processable MOFs and their potential applications are outlooked.

         <title>Full van der Waals Ambipolar Ferroelectric Configurable Optical Hetero&#8208;Synapses for In&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes an optical synapse based on van der Waals heterojunction. Based on this device, an optical reservoir neural network and a visible light communication system were developed, which successfully imitated the signal preprocessing and data transmission process of the human visual system for color images. This provides new ideas for the development of intelligent imaging systems.








Abstract
The rapid development of visual neuromorphic hardware can be attributed to their ability to capture, store and process optical signals from the environment. The main limitation of existing visual neuromorphic hardware is that the realization of complex functions is premised on the increase of manufacturing cost, hardware volume and energy consumption. In this study, we demonstrated an optical synaptic device based on a three&#8208;terminal van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction that can realize the sensing functions of light wavelength and intensity as well as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. In the image recognition task, we constructed an optical reservoir neural network (ORNN) and a visible light communication system (VLC) composed of this optical synaptic device. The ORNN has a recognition rate of up to 84.9% for 50 000 color images in 10 categories in the CIFAR&#8208;10 color image dataset, and the VLC system can achieve high&#8208;speed transmission with an ultra&#8208;low power consumption of only 0.4 nW. This work shows that through reasonable design, vdW heterojunction structures have great application potential in low&#8208;power multifunctional fusion application tasks such as visual bionics.

         <title>Nanobodies Outperform Antibodies &#8211; Rapid Functionalization with Equal In Vivo Targeting Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocarrier system functionalized with nanobodies for the targeting of dendritic cells is presented. The system possesses a highly specific targeting in vivo and can be synthesized at low cost over the course of a few hours. The combination of these properties suggests a better performance compared to antibody&#8208;based systems in current literature.








Abstract
Highly specific targeting of dendritic cells in vivo is crucial for the development of effective tumor nanovaccines. This group recently presented an antibody&#8208;functionalized nanocarrier system able to maintain its targeting properties when transferred from in vitro to in vivo studies. However, producing this system requires long synthesis times and involves high expenses due to the involved site&#8208;specific enzymatic multi&#8208;step modification procedure of the antibody. Consequently, improving the previously proposed system is necessary in order to accelerate the development. Here, a novel system utilizing nanobodies for the targeting of dendritic cells is presented. A C&#8208;terminal cysteine tag facilitates an easy attachment of the nanobody to the nanocarrier via a thiol&#8208;maleimide conjugation technique. This reduces the functionalization time from several days to mere hours. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, it is shown that the optimized system possesses equal targeting properties as the antibody&#8208;based system. As a result, nanobodies and the coupling chemistry are found to be a superior strategy for the in vivo targeting of dendritic cells when compared to antibodies, due to their rapid attachment to nanocarriers and equal targeting specificity. This would replace antibodies as the current &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of targeting moieties.

         <title>Wearable Haptics for Orthotropic Actuation Based on Perpendicularly Nested Auxetic SMA Knotting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable haptics for orthotropic actuation (WHOA) can be used for teleoperation of drones and robots with directional sensory perception in 3D space. The perpendicularly nested auxetic pattern with parylene coating provide orthotopically decoupled tactile feedback and wearable multimodal haptics.








Abstract
Smart wearable tactile systems, designed to deliver different types of touch feedback on human skin, can significantly improve engagement through diverse actuation patterns in virtual or augmented reality environments. Here, a perpendicularly nested auxetic wearable haptic interface is reported for orthotropically decoupled multimodal actuation (WHOA), capable of producing diverse tactile feedback modes with 3D sensory perception. WHOA incorporates shape memory alloy wires that are intricately knotted into an auxetic structure oriented along orthotropic dual axes. Its perpendicularly nested auxetic structure enables orthotropic actuation, allowing independent expansion and contraction along both x and y&#8208;axes, as confirmed by force&#8208;strain and displacement&#8208;time performance tests. Additionally, the perylene coating provides orthogonal electrical isolation to WHOA, allowing for stripe&#8208;specific localized actuation and enabling multiple tactile feedback modes. As an orthotropic wearable haptic interface, WHOA distinguishes between x&#8208;axis and y&#8208;axis directions and ultimately delivers multi&#8208;dimensional information regarding movements in 3D space through tactile feedback. As a result, when worn on the foot or arm, WHOA naturally delivers spatiotemporal tactile information to the user, facilitating navigation and teleoperation with 3D sensory perception.

         <title>Digital Light Process 3D Printing of Magnetically Aligned Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Free&#8211;forms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the use of a Halbach array to magnetically align a novel liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) ink which can be used for vat&#8208;based digital light process (DLP) 3D printing. This approach enables 3D printing of geometrically complex LCE free&#8211;forms with tailorable alignment, enabling exciting possibilities for designing advanced biomedical devices, soft robotics, or energy&#8208;damping structures.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) are anisotropic soft materials capable of large dimensional changes when subjected to a stimulus. The magnitude and directionality of the stimuli&#8208;induced thermomechanical response is associated with the alignment of the LCE. Recent reports detail the preparation of LCEs by additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, predominately using direct ink write printing. Another AM technique, digital light process (DLP) 3D printing, has generated significant interest as it affords LCE free&#8208;forms with high fidelity and resolution. However, one challenge of printing LCEs using vat polymerization methods such as DLP is enforcing alignment. Here, we document the preparation of aligned, main&#8208;chain LCEs via DLP 3D printing using a 100 mT magnetic field. Systematic examination isolates the contribution of magnetic field strength, alignment time, and build layer thickness on the degree of orientation in 3D printed LCEs. Informed by this fundamental understanding, DLP is used to print complex LCE free&#8208;forms with through&#8208;thickness variation in both spatial orientations. The hierarchical variation in spatial orientation within LCE free&#8208;forms is used to produce objects that exhibit mechanical instabilities upon heating. DLP printing of aligned LCEs opens new opportunities to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in form factors optimized for functional use in soft robotics and energy absorption.

         <title>Designing Impact Resistance and Robustness into Slippery Lubricant Infused Porous Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) are presented which seek to address the lubricant drainage issue that impairs such surfaces. The strong lubricant retention achieved enables the SLIPS to maintain their slipperiness under high&#8208;speed liquid impact and other dynamic/flow conditions. These findings should widen the practical applications of SLIPS.








Abstract
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have the potential to address daunting challenges such as undesirable surface fouling/biofouling, icing, etc. However, the depletion of lubricants hampers their practical utility. As a solution, here a rational strategy is introduced that operates synergistically in three parts. First, ultra&#8208;high capillary pressure is exploited from the reticular structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with sub&#8208;nanometer pores. Second, the need for geometric compatibility is demonstrated; the lubricant chain diameter must be smaller than the MOF pore to enable lubricant chain intercalation. Lastly, the MOF pore chemistry is tailored to achieve a strong intermolecular interaction for any given MOF/lubricant combination. The strategy is investigated through experiments and quantum/molecular simulations, which show that the approach helps lock the intercalated lubricant chains inside the MOF pores and forms a non&#8208;conventional supramolecular structure. The resulting SLIPS (including those with fluorine&#8208;free chemistry) not only show typical low wetting hysteresis, friction, and ice adhesion but are uniquely resistant to more stringent tests such as continuous dripping and sliding of water droplets (up to 50&#160;hrs), repeated impacts of high&#8208;speed water jets (liquid impact Weber number &gt;&#160;4&#160;&#215;&#160;104) and prevent bacterial biofilm formation even in dynamic flow conditions. The findings may widen the practical applications of SLIPS.

         <title>Silk Proteins: Designs from Nature with Multipurpose Utility and Infinite Future Possibilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex evolutionary pressures result in unique protein fiber designs for silks. This includes multi&#8208;domain features and novel amino acid content that accommodate aqueous processing environments with remarkable functional properties. Bioengineering approaches inform new material formats and functions realized with silks. These design features provide a blueprint for future polymer designs with robust functions and sustainability as guideposts.








Abstract
This is a Perspective on nature as a story&#8208;teller, where inputs of evolution drove the remarkable protein designs found in silks. This selection process has resulted in silk materials with novel chemistry and properties to support organism survival in nature, yet with newfound utility in everything from comic books and automobiles to medicine. With growing global concerns related to environmental health, silks also serve as an invaluable instructional guide to the future of sustainable material designs.

         <title>Disrupting Intracellular Homeostasis by Copper&#8208;Based Nanoinducer with Multiple Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Activities to Induce Disulfidptosis&#8208;Enhanced Pyroptosis for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) aimed to disrupt intracellular metabolism and redox homeostasis for inducing tumor cells disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced immunogenic pyroptosis. The combination of these two cell death modes could promote the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines, reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immune cells infiltration. The evoked robust immune responses helped to suppress tumor progression.








Abstract
Given the crucial role of abnormal homeostasis in tumor cells for maintaining their growth, it may be more efficient with less effort to develop anti&#8208;tumor strategies that target multiple combined mechanisms by disrupting intracellular homeostasis. Here, a copper&#8208;based nanoinducer (CGBH NNs) with multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities is designed and constructed to induce disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis through disrupting multiple intracellular homeostasis for effective tumor immunotherapy. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), CGBH NNs can disrupt intracellular glucose homeostasis and inhibit NADPH production, leading to accumulation of cystine, which further blocked the substrate and key enzyme for synthesizing glutathione. Subsequently, through cascade catalytic reactions involving enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like, glucose oxidase and peroxidase&#8208;like activities), CGBH NNs can produce massive reactive oxygen species&#160;(ROS) and further disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis, resulting in the disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis. The tumor cells undergoing immunogenic pyroptosis can release various cytosolic contents and inflammatory factors, eliciting robust immune responses by facilitating immune cell infiltration, and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME. After the combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, CGBH NNs can effectively suppress the tumor growth and prolong the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work presents a novel paradigm to trigger disulfidptosis&#8208;enhanced pyroptosis by destroying intracellular homeostasis for anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Recent Advances in High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The basic concepts, design principles, synthetic methods, advanced characterization, and theoretical calculations of high&#8208;entropy layered oxides are summarized here for alkali metal&#8208;ion battery (AMIB) cathodes. It highlights the recent advances in high&#8208;entropy strategies for improving the electrochemical performance of layered oxide cathodes, and existing problems and possible solutions, providing guidance for the development of layered oxides for highly efficient AMIB cathodes.








Abstract
Since the electrochemical de/intercalation behavior is first detected in 1980, layered oxides have become the most promising cathode material for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (Li+/Na+/K+; AMIBs) owing to their facile synthesis and excellent theoretical capacities. However, the inherent drawbacks of unstable structural evolution and sluggish diffusion kinetics deteriorate their electrochemical performance, limiting further large&#8208;scale applications. To solve these issues, the novel and promising strategy of high entropy has been widely applied to layered oxide cathodes for AMIBs in recent years. Through multielement synergy and entropy stabilization effects, high&#8208;entropy layered oxides (HELOs) can achieve adjustable activity and enhanced stability. Herein, the basic concepts, design principles, and synthesis methods of HELO cathodes are introduced systematically. Notably, it explores in detail the improvements of the high&#8208;entropy strategy on the limitations of layered oxides, highlighting the latest advances in high&#8208;entropy layered cathode materials in the field of AMIBs. In addition, it introduces advanced characterization and theoretical calculations for HELOs and proposes potential future research directions and optimization strategies, providing inspiration for researchers to develop advanced HELO cathode materials in the areas of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Scalable Synaptic Transistor Memory from Solution&#8208;Processed Carbon Nanotubes for High&#8208;Speed Neuromorphic Data Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable synaptic transistor memory from solution&#8208;processed carbon nanotubes, exhibiting&#160;reconfigurable weights and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity, enables parallel neuromorphic data processing with a speed of 1 M bit per second per input channel.








Abstract
Neural networks as a core information processing technology in machine learning and artificial intelligence demand substantial computational resources to deal with the extensive multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. Neuromorphic computing is an emergent solution to address this problem, allowing the computation performed in memory arrays in parallel with high efficiencies conforming to the neural networks. Here, scalable synaptic transistor memories are developed from solution&#8208;sorted carbon nanotubes. The transistors exhibit a large switching ratio of over 105, a significant memory window of &#8776;12&#160;V arising from charge trapping, and low response delays down to tens of nanoseconds. These device characteristics endow highly stabilized reconfigurable conductance states, successful emulation of synaptic functions, and a high data processing speed. Importantly, the devices exhibit uniform characteristic metrics, e.g., with a 1.8% variation in the memory window, suggesting an industrial&#8208;scale manufacturing capability of the fabrication. Using the memories, a hardware convolution kernel is designed and parallel image processing is demonstrated at a speed of 1&#160;M bit per second per input channel. Given the efficacy of the convolution kernel, a promising prospect of the memories in implementing neuromorphic computing is envisaged. To explore the potential, large&#8208;scale convolution kernels are simulated and high&#8208;speed video processing is realized for autonomous driving.

         <title>Voxel Interface Control in Multimaterial Extrusion 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces are vital in natural and synthetic systems, enhancing performance and functionality, but are difficult to control in manufacturing. Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP) is introduced, enabling precise control of voxel&#8208;to&#8208;voxel interfaces in extrusion 3D&#8208;printed objects. With interface thicknesses significantly smaller than voxel size, VI3DP unlocks applications in data encoding, mechanisms, bio&#8208;inspired composites, and capacitive touch sensors, among others.








Abstract
Interfaces are crucial in natural and engineered systems, dictating essential biological, ecological, and technological properties that augment performance, functionality, and user experience. Yet, achieving precise interfacial control poses significant challenges in both conventional and additive manufacturing, where scalability constraints impede the controlled deposition of quasi&#8208;2D layers within 3D objects. This paper introduces Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP), which enables comprehensive control over extruded voxel interfaces irrespective of the printhead diameter that conventionally dictates feature size. Various optical, mechanical, and electrical functionalizations, attaining interface thicknesses up to three orders of magnitude smaller than the voxel size are reported. Notable applications include encoding data in soft matter through fluorescent interfaces, creating tight fits and movable mechanisms through non&#8208;adhesive interfaces, fabricating bio&#8208;inspired composites with tailored failure modes, and developing a single filament capacitive touch sensor. VI3DP opens new avenues for enhanced functionality and efficiency across multiple fields, including biomedical technology, electronics, optics, and&#160;nanotechnology.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with electronegative atoms (O/N/F)&#8208;containing functional groups facilitate the optimization of the electron distribution around them, which endows the facile optimization of the interaction strength between the positively charged and negatively charged species, leading to desired thermal and kinetical optimal states, and thus benefiting the stabilization of the Zn anode for potential flexible devices.








Abstract
The rapid development of wearable and intelligent flexible devices has posed strict requirements for power sources, including excellent mechanical strength, inherent safety, high energy density, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Zn&#8208;ion batteries with aqueous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (AQSSEs) with various functional groups that contain electronegative atoms (O/N/F) with tunable electron accumulation states are considered as a promising candidate to power the flexible devices and tremendous progress has been achieved in this prospering area. Herein, this review proposes a comprehensive summary of the recent achievements using the AQSSE in flexible devices by focusing on the significance of different functional groups. The fundamentals and challenges of the ZIBs are introduced from a chemical view in the first place. Then, the mechanism behind the stabilization of the flexible ZIBs with the functionalized AQSSE is summarized and explained in detail. Then the recent progress regarding the enhanced electrochemical stability of the ZIBs with the AQSSE is summarized and classified based on the functional groups on the polymer chain. The advanced characterization methods for the AQSSE are briefly introduced in the following sections. Last but not least, current challenges and future perspectives for this promising area are provided from the authors' point of view.

         <title>Bidirectional Photovoltage&#8208;Driven Oxide Transistors for Neuromorphic Visual Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor is constructed by connecting the different electrodes of two perovskite solar cells to the two gates of ion&#8208;regulated In2O3 transistors. The mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition.








Abstract
Biological vision is one of the most important parts of the human perception system. However, emulating biological visuals is challenging because it requires complementary photoexcitation and photoinhibition. Here, the study presents a bidirectional photovoltage&#8208;driven neuromorphic visual sensor (BPNVS) that is constructed by monolithically integrating two perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with dual&#8208;gate ion&#8208;gel&#8208;gated oxide transistors. PSCs act as photoreceptors, converting external visual stimuli into electrical signals, whereas oxide transistors generate neuromorphic signal outputs that can be adjusted to produce positive and negative photoresponses. This device mimics the human vision system's ability to recognize colored and color&#8208;mixed patterns. The device achieves a static color recognition accuracy of 96% by utilizing the reservoir computing system for feature extraction. The BPNVS mem&#8208;reservoir chip is also proposed for handing object movement and dynamic color recognition. This work is a significant step forward in neuromorphic sensing and complex pattern recognition.

         <title>In Situ Reversible and Robust Mechano&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Phosphorescence of Polyurethane Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ, sensitive, and rapidly reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) phosphorescence from a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer has been achieved from the reversible MR polymer chain orientation and hydrogen bonding interactions among the system. Based on their MR afterglow, these PU materials have demonstrated various applications without interruption of background, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Though mechano&#8208;responsive luminescent materials obtained much attention, most of their responses are non&#8208;reversible, let alone in situ reversible. Here, the study presents a new strategy to push through this limitation for their applications, which relies on the reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) hydrogen bonding interactions and polymer chain orientation among a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer. The radiative and nonradiative transitions inside these phosphorescent triphenylene&#8208;based aromatic secondary amines (TpNP and TpNPO) doped in the PU matrix can be accordingly modulated by these MR variations, including the PU chains orientation and the interactions between emitters and PU, respectively. Surprisingly, the intensities, quantum yields, and even lifetimes of their ultralong phosphorescence correlate well with the stress of PU, showing triple mechano&#8208;enhancement with a small threshold value of 7.9&#160;MPa. Importantly, these in situ and rapidly reversible MR phosphorescences possess excellent repeatability, which is still displayed even after &gt;500 cycles of loading/unloading. Based on such a robust and highly sensitive MR afterglow, these PU materials have been demonstrated applications with no interruption of background in several fields, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption. This work provides new insights for developing innovative ultralong phosphorescence materials with improved luminescence and reversible mechano&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>Ultrafast Charge and Exciton Diffusion in Monolayer Films of 9&#8208;Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>Schematic representation of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons subjected to a pump pulse, which generates charge carriers. The spatial and temporal dynamics of these carriers are investigated using a probe pulse with variable time delay &#916;t and a controllable spatial offset.








Abstract
Determining the electronic transport properties of graphene nanoribbons is crucial for assessing their suitability for applications. So far, this has been highly challenging both through experimental and theoretical approaches. This is particularly the case for graphene nanoribbons that are prepared by chemical vapor deposition, which is a scalable and industry&#8208;compatible bottom&#8208;up growth method that results in closely packed arrays of ribbons with relatively short lengths of a few tens of nanometers. In this study, the experimental technique of spatiotemporal microscopy is applied to study monolayer films of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons prepared using this growth method, and combined with linear&#8208;scaling quantum transport calculations of arrays of thousands of nanoribbons. Both approaches directly resolve electronic spreading in space and time through diffusion and give an initial diffusivity approaching 200 cm2 s&#8722;1 during the first picosecond after photoexcitation. This corresponds to a mobility up to 550 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The quasi&#8208;free carriers then form excitons, which spread with a diffusivity of tens of cm2 s&#8722;1. The results indicate that this relatively large charge carrier mobility is the result of electronic transport not being hindered by defects nor inter&#8208;ribbon hopping. This confirms their suitability for applications that require efficient electronic&#160;transport.

         <title>Suppressing Static and Dynamic Disorder for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells via Synergistic Dilution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a synergistic dilution strategy to suppress traps of transport and active layers, restrain static, and dynamic disorder, to fabricate efficient and stable thick&#8208;film OSCs. It mitigates dynamic disorder through electron&#8208;phonon coupling suppression and static disorder via molecular stacking enhancement, ensuring practicality and cost&#8208;effectiveness for large&#8208;scale use.








Abstract
Developing stable and highly efficient thick&#8208;film organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucial for the large&#8208;scale commercial application of organic photovoltaics. A novel synergistic dilution strategy to address this issue, using Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) &#8208;modified zinc oxide (ZnO) as the interfacial layer, is introduced. This strategy effectively mitigates oxygen defects in ZnO while also regulating the self&#8208;assembly process of the active layer to achieve an ordered distribution of donors and acceptors. In synergistic diluted devices, the dynamic disorder is reduced owing to the suppression of electron&#8208;phonon coupling, while the static disorder is suppressed by improved molecular stacking and enhanced intermolecular interactions. Consequently, the 300&#160;nm PM6:L8&#8208;BO device post&#8208;synergistic dilution manifests a marked enhancement in device performance, achieving a photovoltaic power conversion efficiency (PCE) &gt;17% with excellent thermal stability. A typical ternary system is selected to explore the general applicability of synergistic dilution strategy, the PCE has been enhanced significantly from 17.89% to 18.72%, which falls within the range of the highest values among inverted single junction OSCs. As a practical application that depends on the pivotal synergy between high efficiency and stability, this approach paves the way for large&#8208;scale implementation of OSCs and ensures cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Facet&#8208;Selective Copper Nanowires for Activating CO&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research reports a nickel&#8208;doped copper nanowire catalyst for highly selective ethanol production from CO electroreduction. The theoretical calculations and operando spectroelectrochemical investigations cooperatively demonstrate that nickel&#8208;doping onto copper surface can regulate the interfacial water structure and water dissociation kinetics, which significantly influences the hydrogenation kinetics of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH), and thus leading to a high selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol.








Abstract
Ethanol isa promising energy vector for closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle through reversible electrochemical redox. Currently, ethanol electrosynthesissuffers from low product selectivity due to the competitive advantage of ethylene in CO2/CO electroreduction. Here, a facet&#8208;selective metal&#8208;doping strategy is reported, tuning the reaction kinetics of CO reduction paths and thus enhancing the ethanol selectivity. The theoretical calculations reveal that nickel (Ni)doped Cu(100) surface facilitates water dissociation to form adsorbed hydrogen, which promotesselective electrochemical hydrogenation of a key C2 intermediate (*CHCOH) toward ethanol path over ethylene path. Experimentally, a solution&#8208;phase synthesis of a Ni&#8208;doped {100}&#8208;dominated Copper nanowires (Cu NWs) catalyst is reported, enabling an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 56% and a selectivity ratio of ethanol to ethylene of 2.7, which are &#8776;4 and 15 times larger than those of undoped Cu NWs, respectively. The operando spectroscopic characterizations&#160;confirm that Ni&#8208;doping in Cu NWs can alter the interfacial water activity and thus regulate the C2 product selectivity. With further electrode engineering, a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer using Ni&#8208;doped Cu NWs catalysts demonstrates an ethanol Faradaic efficiency over 50% at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a full cell voltage of &#8776;2.7&#160;V and operates stably for over 300 h.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Empowered Customized Chiral Metasurface for Calibration&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a deep learning&#8208;driven data iteration strategy alongside a global optimization network, showcasing excellent capabilities in expediting metasurface design and unearthing complex light&#8208;matter interactions. As anticipated, it enables the customized and easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement design of chiral metasurfaces and advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples in a calibration&#8208;free manner.








Abstract
As a 2D metamaterial, metasurfaces offer an unprecedented avenue to facilitate light&#8208;matter interactions. The current &#8220;one&#8208;by&#8208;one design&#8221; method is hindered by time&#8208;consuming, repeated testing within a confined space. However, intelligent design strategies for metasurfaces, limited by data&#8208;driven properties, have rarely been explored. To address this gap, a data iterative strategy based on deep learning, coupled with a global optimization network is proposed, to achieve the customized design of chiral metasurfaces. This methodology is applied to precisely identify different chiral molecules in a label&#8208;free manner. Fundamentally different from the traditional approach of collecting data purely through simulation, the proposed data generation strategy encompasses the entire design space, which is inaccessible by conventional methods. The dataset quality is significantly improved, with a 21&#8208;fold increase in the number of chiral structures exhibiting the desired circular dichroism (CD) response (&gt;0.6). The method's efficacy is validated by a monolayer structure that is easily prepared, demonstrating advanced sensing abilities for enantiomer&#8208;specific analysis of bio&#8208;samples. These results demonstrate the superior capability of data&#8208;driven schemes in photonic design and the potential of chiral metasurface&#8208;based platforms for calibration&#8208;free biosensing applications. The proposed approach will accelerate the development of complex systems for rapid molecular detection, spectroscopic imaging, and other applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage of Twisted Structures in Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using machine learning, a variety of PU&#8208;based polymers are forecasted and successfully synthesized two with a high dielectric constant (K) and thermal stability. Combining these with PI via hydrogen bonds to form twisted HNP, both K and Eb are improved. Impressively, HNP&#8208;20% reaches an Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess outstanding advantages for high&#8208;power energy storage applications such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while both of them decrease rapidly at elevated temperatures. Although several strategies have been evaluated to enhance Eb and heat resistance, the discharged energy density (Ud) is still limited by the planar conjugated structure. In this study, a novel approach to manipulate polymer morphology is introduced, thereby influencing dielectric properties. A range of polyurea (PU)&#8208;based polymers are predicted from different structural unit combinations by machine learning and synthesized two representative polymers with high dielectric constants (K) and thermal stability. These polymers are combined with PI to form a twisted polymer via hydrogen bonding interactions (HNP). Both experimental results and computational simulations demonstrate the twisted structure disrupts the conjugated structure to widen the bandgap and increase dipole moment through the twisting of polar groups, leading to simultaneous improvements in both K and Eb. Consequently, HNP&#8208;20% achieves an ultrahigh Ud of 6.42 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency exceeding 90% at 200 &#176;C. This work opens a new avenue to scalable high Ud all&#8208;polymer dielectric for high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Transcytosable and Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Liposome Enables Deep Penetration of Biofilm for Surgical Site Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascular&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1)&#8208;targeted and ultrasound&#8208;activated liposome (ligand&#8208;modified, perfluoropentane&#8208;encapsulated, and dual Ce6 and OTM&#8208;integrated liposome) is capable of overcoming the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection. VCAM1&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic&#8208;cavitation&#8208;induced EPS collapse consecutively achieve efficient drug accumulation and deep penetration, then lead to potent biofilm eradication.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated surgical site infection (BSSI) is a common and grievous postoperative complication lacking effective remedies, mainly due to the poor drug accumulation and penetration in the biofilms featured by dense extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Here, it is found that the vascular cell adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (VCAM1) is highly overexpressed in the vascular cells of BSSI. It is proposed that the combination of VCAM1&#8208;mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation can consecutively overcome the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and EPS for biofilm eradication. To demonstrate the feasibility, a VCAM1&#8208;targeted and ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated liposome (LPCOTML) loaded with a reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;responsive lipoid prodrug of oleoyl meropenem, sonosensitizer of lipoid Ce6, and perfluoropentane is developed. LPCOTML can recognize the receptors on vascular cells, and initiate receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis for transendothelial transport into the BSSI periphery. LPCOTML subsequently transforms from nanoparticle into microbubble via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition under US irradiation, triggering strong ultrasonic cavitation to blow up the EPS and deeply penetrate the biofilms. The sonosensitizer Ce6 induces ROS production under US irradiation and triggers the release of meropenem to induce potent antibacterial effect in a BSSI model.

     alt="Transcytosable and Ultrasound-Activated Liposome Enables Deep Penetration of Biofilm for Surgical Site Infection Management"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vascular-cell-adhesion-molecule-1 (VCAM1)-targeted and ultrasound-activated liposome (ligand-modified, perfluoropentane-encapsulated, and dual Ce6 and OTM-integrated liposome) is capable of overcoming the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in biofilm-associated surgical site infection. VCAM1-receptor-mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic-cavitation-induced EPS collapse consecutively achieve efficient drug accumulation and deep penetration, then lead to potent biofilm eradication.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biofilm-associated surgical site infection (BSSI) is a common and grievous postoperative complication lacking effective remedies, mainly due to the poor drug accumulation and penetration in the biofilms featured by dense extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Here, it is found that the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) is highly overexpressed in the vascular cells of BSSI. It is proposed that the combination of VCAM1-mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation can consecutively overcome the biological barriers of vascular endothelial cells and EPS for biofilm eradication. To demonstrate the feasibility, a VCAM1-targeted and ultrasound (US)-activated liposome (LPCOTML) loaded with a reactive-oxygen-species (ROS)-responsive lipoid prodrug of oleoyl meropenem, sonosensitizer of lipoid Ce6, and perfluoropentane is developed. LPCOTML can recognize the receptors on vascular cells, and initiate receptor-mediated transcytosis for transendothelial transport into the BSSI periphery. LPCOTML subsequently transforms from nanoparticle into microbubble via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition under US irradiation, triggering strong ultrasonic cavitation to blow up the EPS and deeply penetrate the biofilms. The sonosensitizer Ce6 induces ROS production under US irradiation and triggers the release of meropenem to induce potent antibacterial effect in a BSSI model. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the biological barriers in BSSI via combining receptor-mediated transcytosis and ultrasonic cavitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using a Supramolecular Monomer Formulation Approach to Engineer Modular, Dynamic Microgels, and Composite Macrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels with engineerable properties are created using supramolecular monomers. The inherent modularity offers versatility, allowing inclusion of functionalities, e.g. dyes and cell adhesive additives, providing control over microgel composition. Integrated into robust and dynamic macrogels, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization and reinforcing mechanical properties. This modular control spans across the nano, micro, and macro length scale.








Abstract
Microgels show advantages over bulk hydrogels due to convenient control over microgel size and composition, and the ability to use microgels to modularly construct larger hierarchical scaffold hydrogel materials. Here, supramolecular chemistry is used to formulate supramolecular polymer, dynamic microgels solely held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions. Four&#8208;fold hydrogen bonding ureido&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) monomers with different functionalities are applied to precisely tune microgel properties in a modular way, via variations in monomer concentration, bifunctional crosslinker ratio, and the incorporation of supramolecular dyes and peptides. Functionalization with a bioactive supramolecular cell&#8208;adhesive peptide induced selectivity of cells toward the bioactive microgels over non&#8208;active, non&#8208;functionalized versions. Importantly, the supramolecular microgels can also be applied as microscale building blocks into supramolecular bulk macrogels with tunable dynamic behavior: a robust and weak macrogel, where the micro&#8208; and macrogels are composed of similar molecular building blocks. In a robust macrogel, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization, while in a weak macrogel, microgels reinforce and enhance mechanical properties. This work demonstrates the potential to modularly engineer higher&#8208;length&#8208;scale structures using small molecule supramolecular monomers, wherein microgels serve as versatile and modular micro&#8208;building units.

         <title>Bifunctional Fluorocarbon Electrode Additive Lowers the Salt Dependence of Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional fluorocarbon electrode additive (BFEA) is proposed to construct solid electrolyte interphase independent of aqueous electrolyte. The LiF from reduction of BFEA suppresses hydrogen evolution, increasing coulombic efficiency while the carbon byproduct lowers battery polarization, improving round&#8208;trip efficiency. The unique advantages of BFEA make it highly compatible with aqueous batteries and promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in extending the life of aqueous batteries. The traditional anion&#8208;derived SEI formation in aqueous electrolytes highly depends on high&#8208;concentrated organic fluorinating salts, resulting in low forming efficiency and long&#8208;term consumption. In response, this study proposes a bifunctional fluorocarbon electrode additive (BFEA) that enables electrochemical pre&#8208;reduction instead of TFSI anion to form the LiF&#8208;rich SEI and in situ produce conductive graphite inside the anode before the lithiation. The BFEA lowers the salt dependence of aqueous electrolytes, enabling the inorganic LiCl electrolyte to work first, but also successfully achieves a high SEI formation efficiency in the relatively low 10&#160;m LiTFSI without mass transfer concerns, suppressing the parasitic hydrogen evolution from 11.24 to 4.35&#160;nmol min&#8722;1. Besides, BFEA strengthens the intrinsic superiority of Li storage reaction by lowering battery polarization resulting from the in situ production of graphite, promoting charge transfer of electrode kinetics. Compared with the control group, the demonstrated Ah&#8208;level pouch cell employing BFEA exhibits better cycle stability above 300 cycles with higher capacity retention of 78.2% and the lower decay of the round&#8208;trip efficiency (&#9651;RTE = 2%), benefiting for maintaining the high efficiency and reducing heat accumulation in large&#8208;scale electric energy storage.

         <title>A Versatile Microporous Design toward Toughened yet Softened Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed microporous design is demonstrated to transform soft and weak into soft yet ultra&#8208;tough self&#8208;healing materials. This approach not only achieves unprecedented improvements in crack propagation resistance and centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive lengths, but also enhances mechanical softness while preserving self&#8208;healing kinetics, which is crucial for fully exploiting the potential of soft yet tough self&#8208;healing materials in stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Realizing the full potential of self&#8208;healing materials in stretchable electronics necessitates not only low modulus to enable high adaptivity, but also high toughness to resist crack propagation. However, existing toughening strategies for soft self&#8208;healing materials have only modestly improves mechanical dissipation near the crack tip (&#1043;D), and invariably compromise the material's inherent softness and autonomous healing capabilities. Here, a synthetic microporous architecture is demonstrated that unprecedently toughens and softens self&#8208;healing materials without impacting their intrinsic self&#8208;healing kinetics. This microporous structure spreads energy dissipation across the entire material through a bran&#8208;new dissipative mode of adaptable crack movement (&#1043;A), which substantially increases the fracture toughness by 31.6 times, from 3.19 to 100.86 kJ m&#8722;2, and the fractocohesive length by 20.7 times, from 0.59 mm to 12.24 mm. This combination of unprecedented fracture toughness (100.86 kJ m&#8722;2) and centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length (1.23 cm) surpasses all previous records for synthetic soft self&#8208;healing materials and even exceeds those of light alloys. Coupled with significantly enhanced softness (0.43 MPa) and nearly perfect autonomous self&#8208;healing efficiency (&#8776;100%), this robust material is ideal for constructing durable kirigami electronics for wearable devices.

         <title>A Universal Ternary Solvent System of Surface Passivator Enables Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 26%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suitable solvent system of passivator can maximize the passivation effect, further improving the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This work proposes a ternary solvent system of 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;PEAI, which can inhibit the solvent&#8208;induced additional defects and achieve a sufficient passivated perovskite surface simultaneously. The resulting PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, and the devices can maintain 95.23% and 95.68% of their initial PCE after 2000&#160;h storage in ambient air and 800&#160;h light&#8208;soaking in N2&#8208;glovebox.








Abstract
Surface passivation is a vital approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), in which the passivator solvent is an inevitable but easy&#8208;ignored factor on passivation effects. Herein, a universal ternary solvent system of surface passivators is proposed through comprehensively considering the solubility and selective perovskite dissolution of the solvent to maximize the passivation effect. Tetrahydrothiophene 1&#8208;oxide (THTO) is selected as the passivation promoter by comparing the binding energy with perovskite and the ability to distort the perovskite lattice among various aprotic polar solvent molecules, which can facilitate the passivator's reaction with perovskite and achieve sufficient passivation on perovskite surface. Besides, chlorobenzene (CB) is used as the diluting agent to minimize the amount of isopropanol (IPA), inhibiting the additional solvent&#8208;induced defects. As a result, the planar PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, (certificated 25.66%). Besides, the unencapsulated devices exhibit enhanced stability, which can maintain 95.23% and 95.68% of their initial PCE after 2000&#160;h of storage in ambient air and 800&#160;h of light&#8208;soaking in N2&#8208;glovebox. Moreover, this ternary solvent system also exhibits a well applicability and reliability in different passivator such as PEAI, BAI, and so on.

         <title>Programmable Artificial Skins Accomplish Antiscar Healing with Multiple Appendage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel regeneration&#8208;directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is introduced, which is constructed from DNA supramolecular hydrogels. This multi&#8208;layered RDAS effectively mimics natural skin matrices with high fidelity, thereby creating a supportive environment conducive to wound healing. It also precisely modulates the regenerative activities of repair cells throughout the healing process. Ultimately, the RDAS facilitates rapid&#160;scarless healing and promotes the in situ regeneration of multiple functional skin appendages in damaged skin.








Abstract
Functional appendage regeneration is essential for skin rehabilitation, but it has always failed by current existing healing approaches, owing to their inefficacy in preventing disfiguring scars. In this study, a novel regeneration&#8208;directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is presented, which is based on the rational design of multi&#8208;layered hydrogels that closely mimic natural skin matrices. By leveraging the programmability and architectural rigidity of DNA components, without the need for exogenous cell transplantation, such RDAS effectively minimizes tissue fibrosis by accurately guiding the regenerative process in wound fibroblasts, enabling rapid scarless wound repair, restoration of dermal function, and successful in situ regeneration of multiple appendages, such as hair follicles (HFs), sebaceous glands (SGs), and sweat glands (SwGs). Therefore, the RDAS offers a cell&#8208;free antiscarring therapeutic strategy for regenerative wound healing, resulting in improved outcomes. This innovative approach holds great potential for future clinical applications and burn rehabilitation.

         <title>Piezoelectric Heterojunctions as Bacteria&#8208;Killing Bone&#8208;Regenerative Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2/Bi2WO6 piezoelectric heterojunctions with engineered oxygen vacancies, interfacial built&#8208;in electric fields and piezoelectric properties are constructed as bone implants. The heterojunctions achieve highly efficient and dynamic antimicrobial functions through near infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggered photothermal and photodynamic therapies. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implants trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields in situ, significantly promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Heterojunctions are widely used in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and photodetection, but have not been fully explored in regenerative medicine. In particular, piezoelectric heterojunctions have never been examined in tissue regeneration. Here the development of piezoelectric heterojunctions is shown to promote bone regeneration while eradicating pathogenic bacteria through light&#8208;cellular force&#8208;electric coupling. Specifically, an array of heterojunctions (TiO2/Bi2WO6), made of piezoelectric nanocrystals (Bi2WO6) decorating TiO2 nanowires, is fabricated as a biocompatible implant. Upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light, the piezoelectric heterojunctions generate reactive oxygen species and heat to kill bacteria through photodynamic and photothermal therapy, respectively. Meanwhile, the mechanical forces of the stem cells grown on the implant trigger the heterojunctions to produce electric fields that further promote osteogenesis to achieve osteointegration. The heterojunctions effectively suppress postoperative recurrent infections while promoting osseointegration through the local electric fields induced by cells. Therefore, the piezoelectric heterojunctions represent a promising antibacterial tissue&#8208;regenerative implant.

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells With Full Lifecycle Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;step air&#8208;processed efficient PSCs with full lifecycle management are effectively realized by the polymer&#8208;stabilized precursor ink. The modified PSCs deliver an impressive efficiency of 25.18% with superior environmental and mechanical stability. The end&#8208;of&#8208;life PSCs with lead leakage suppression and device regeneration will not pose a threat to the environmental and biological safety.








Abstract
Despite the outstanding power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) realized over the years, the entire lifecycle from preparation and operation to discarding of PSCs still needs to be carefully considered when it faces the upcoming large&#8208;scale production and deployment. In this study, bio&#8208;derived chitin&#8208;based polymers are employed to realize the full lifecycle regulation of air&#8208;processed PSCs by forming multiple coordinated and hydrogen bonds to stabilize the lead iodide and organic salt precursor inks, accelerating the solid&#8211;liquid reaction and crystallization of two&#8208;step deposition process, then achieving the high crystalline and oriented perovskites with less notorious charge defects in the open air. The air&#8208;prepared PSCs exhibit a decent efficiency of 25.18% with high preparation reproducibility and improved operational stability toward the harsh environment and mechanical stress stimuli. The modified PSCs display negligible fatigue behavior with keeping 92% of its initial efficiency after operating for 32 diurnal cycles (ISOS&#8208;LC&#8208;1 protocol). Meanwhile, closed&#8208;loop lead management of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PSCs including suppression of lead leakage, toxicity evaluation of broken devices, and recycling of lead iodide components are comprehensively investigated. This work sheds light on a promising avenue to realize the entire lifecycle regulation of air&#8208;processed efficient and stable PSCs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses recent advancements in metal and nonmetal single&#8208;atom sites for the electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 via the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation reaction pathways. Comprehensive discussions cover the influence of local physicochemical environments on the electronic structures and catalytic behaviors of isolated sites, the atomic catalytic mechanisms underlying these pathways for H2O2 production, and recent applications of H2O2 in advanced chemical transformations.








Abstract
Direct electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 through the 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) offer promising alternatives for on&#8208;demand and on&#8208;site production of this chemical. Exploring robust and selective active sites is crucial for enhancing H2O2 production through these pathways. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), featuring isolated active sites on supports, possess attractive properties for promoting catalysis and unraveling catalytic mechanisms. This review first systematically summarizes significant advancements in atomic engineering of both metal and nonmetal single&#8208;atom sites for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalytic 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2, as well as the dynamic behaviors of active sites during catalytic processes. Next, the progress of single&#8208;atom sites in H2O2 production through 2e&#8722; WOR is overviewed. The effects of the local physicochemical environments on the electronic structures and catalytic behaviors of isolated sites, along with the atomic catalytic mechanism involved in these H2O2 production pathways, are discussed in detail. This work also discusses the recent applications of H2O2 in advanced chemical transformations. Finally, a perspective on the development of single&#8208;atom catalysis is highlighted, aiming to provide insights into future research on SACs for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 and other advanced catalytic applications.

         <title>Efficient and Ultrastable Seawater Electrolysis at Industrial Current Density with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction and Dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;Repelling Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a novel Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar catalyst with strong metal&#8208;support interaction, this work presents a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis. It highlights the innovative dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;repelling layer to suppress chloride oxidation, significantly enhancing stability and catalytic activity, representing a revolutionary advancement in catalyst development for seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis is emerging as a promising renewable energy technology for large&#8208;scale hydrogen generation. The development of Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar arrays with strong metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis is reported. The micropillar structure enhances electron and mass transfer, extending catalytic reaction steps and improving seawater electrolysis efficiency. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong MSI between Os and Ni4Mo/MoO2 optimizes the surface electronic structure of the catalyst, reducing the reaction barrier and thereby improving catalytic activity. Importantly, for the first time, a dual Cl&#8722; repelling layer is constructed by electrostatic force to safeguard active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during seawater oxidation. This includes a strong Os&#9472;Cl adsorption and an in situ&#8208;formed MoO42&#8722; layer. As a result, the Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 113 and 336&#160;mV to reach 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and OER in natural seawater from the South China Sea (without purification, with 1&#160;m KOH added). Notably, it demonstrates superior stability, degrading only 0.37 &#181;V h&#8722;1 after 2500 h of seawater oxidation, significantly surpassing the technical target of 1.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 set by the United States Department of Energy.

It highlights the innovative dual Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-repelling layer to suppress chloride oxidation, significantly enhancing stability and catalytic activity, representing a revolutionary advancement in catalyst development for seawater electrolysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct seawater electrolysis is emerging as a promising renewable energy technology for large-scale hydrogen generation. The development of Os-Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo/MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; micropillar arrays with strong metal-support interaction (MSI) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis is reported. The micropillar structure enhances electron and mass transfer, extending catalytic reaction steps and improving seawater electrolysis efficiency. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong MSI between Os and Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo/MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; optimizes the surface electronic structure of the catalyst, reducing the reaction barrier and thereby improving catalytic activity. Importantly, for the first time, a dual Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; repelling layer is constructed by electrostatic force to safeguard active sites against Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; attack during seawater oxidation. This includes a strong Os&#9472;Cl adsorption and an in situ-formed MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layer. As a result, the Os-Ni&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo/MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 113 and 336&#160;mV to reach 500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for HER and OER in natural seawater from the South China Sea (without purification, with 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH added). Notably, it demonstrates superior stability, degrading only 0.37 &#181;V h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 2500 h of seawater oxidation, significantly surpassing the technical target of 1.0 &#181;V h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; set by the United States Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Filler Utilization of Composite Gel Electrolytes via In Situ Solution&#8208;Processable Method for Sustainable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable method is developed to fabricate composite gel electrolytes with high filler utilization. Uniform distributed UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 fillers enhance its mechanical toughness, ionic conductivity, and cation transference number, and stabilize the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This strategy enables the sodium&#8208;ion batteries to achieve excellent cycling and wide&#8208;temperature performance.








Abstract
The composite gel electrolyte (CGE), which combines the advantages of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes, is regarded as the ultimate candidate for constructing batteries with high safety and superior electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface contact. However, the ubiquitous agglomeration of nanofillers results in low filler utilization, which seriously reduces structural uniformity and ion transport efficiency, thus restricting the development of consistent and durable batteries. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable method to in situ construct CGE with high filler utilization is introduced. The homogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework fillers contribute to uniform ionic and electronic filed distribution, realizing a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the CGE with high filler utilization achieves an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.2%. This work provides guidance for constructing high&#8208;performance CGEs in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Iodide Management and Oriented Crystallization Modulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Air Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The EGT&#8208;optimization firmly anchors I&#8722; and inhibits their oxidation to I2. The optimized all&#8208;air processed device achieves a remarkable PCE of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;related defects at the buried interface not only cause nonradiative recombination, but also seriously impair the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The findings demonstrate that EGT not only passivates uncoordinated Sn4+/Pb2+ defects, but also firmly anchors iodide ions and inhibits their oxidation to I2. Additionally, the modification by EGT enhances the oriented crystallization of perovskite, improves the carrier dynamics, and releases residual stresses. Consequently, the optimized all&#8208;air processed device (Rb0.02(FA0.95Cs0.05)0.98PbI2.91Br0.03Cl0.06) achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air, along with ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.191&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 84.9%. The optimized device without encapsulation exhibits strong humidity, thermal, and operational stability under ISOS protocol. Specifically, the initial efficiency of the device is retained at 90.12% after 1512 h of thermal ageing at 65&#160;&#176;C and 90.14% after 930 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under simulated AM1.5 illumination.

         <title>Scanning Acousto&#8208;Optoelectric Spectroscopy on a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and surface acoustic waves provide a powerful tool for investigating charge carrier dynamics in 2D materials. When interacting with the 2D semiconductor WSe2, dynamic acoustic Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of traps enhances the optical emission efficiency. The sub&#8208;nanosecond modulation of the optical signal serves as a sensitive local probe of defects and charge carrier trapping sites.








Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics are investigated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) inside a WSe2 monolayer on LiNbO3 by scanning acousto&#8208;optoelectric spectroscopy. A strong enhancement of the PL emission intensity is observed almost over the entire area of the flake. This enhancement increases with increasing amplitude of the wave and is especially strong at or in the vicinity to defects. The latter is attributed to the SAW&#8208;driven Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of trapped charge carriers bound to trapping sites at these defects. In addition, the PL intensity exhibit clear periodic modulations at the SAW's frequency&#160;fSAW and at 2 fSAW. These modulations are clear and unambiguous fingerprints of spatio&#8208;temporal carrier dynamics driven by the SAW. These occur on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales which are found in good agreement with calculated exciton dissociation times. Mapping and analyzing both effects, this study shows that scanning acousto&#8208;electric spectroscopy provides a highly sensitive and local contact&#8208;free probe which uncovers distinct local features not resolved by conventional quasi&#8208;static photoluminescence techniques. The method is ideally suited to study carrier transport in 2D and other types of nanoscale materials and to reveal dynamic exciton modulation, and carrier localization and activation dynamics in the technologically important megahertz to gigahertz frequency range.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the developments of lead&#8208;free perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, with a particular emphasis on tin&#8208;based devices. Recent progress in device efficiency enhancements through the refinement of material properties and the optimization of device configurations are discussed.

Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have been identified as a promising class of materials for light&#8208;emitting applications. The development of lead&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has led to substantial improvements, with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) now surpassing 30% and operational lifetimes comparable to those of organic LEDs (OLEDs). However, the concern over the potential toxicity of lead has motivated a search for alternative materials that are both eco&#8208;friendly and possess excellent optoelectronic properties, with lead&#8208;free perovskites emerging as a strong contender. In this review, the properties of various lead&#8208;free perovskite emitters are analyzed, with a particular emphasis on the more well&#8208;reported tin&#8208;based variants. Recent progress in enhancing device efficiencies through refined crystallization processes and the optimization of device configurations is also discussed. Additionally, the remaining challenges are examined, and propose strategies that may lead to stable device operation. Looking forward, the potential future developments for lead&#8208;free PeLEDs are considered, including the extension of spectral range, the adoption of more eco&#8208;friendly deposition techniques, and the exploration of alternative materials.

Cross&#8208;linked poly(ether&#8208;urethane) solid&#8208;state electrolytes covalently interconnected with amino&#8208;modified Zr&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs and poly(ethylene glycol) provides a high&#8208;speed transmission of Li+ ions. The ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis&#8208;acid sites contribute to a high ionic conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.84). A 1.5 Ah pouch cell with an areal capacity of &#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 delivers a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Utilizing solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries is a promising strategy for achieving high energy density and safety. However, the SPEs face the challenges such as undesirable mechanical strength, low ionic conductivity and incompatible high&#8208;voltage interface. Here, a novel crosslinked poly(ether&#8208;urethane)&#8208;based SPE with a molecular cross&#8208;linked structure is fabricated to create high&#8208;throughput Li+ transport pathway. The amino&#8208;modified Zr&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ZrMOF) are introduced as multisite cross&#8208;linking nodes and polymer chain extenders. The abundant ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis acid sites in the SPE achieve high Li+ conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and Li+ transference number (0.84). The interpenetrating cross&#8208;linked structure of SPE with robust mechanical strength results in a record cycle life of 8000&#160;h in Li||Li symmetric cell. The high structural stability of ZrMOF and abundant electron&#8208;withdrawing urethane/ureido groups in the SPE with high oxidation potential (5.1&#160;V) enables a discharge capacity of 182 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 500 cycles in a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cell. Remarkably, a high energy density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 1.5&#8208;Ah pouch cell is obtained with high loading cathode (&#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating a great prospect of the current SPE for practical application in solid&#8208;state, high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>A Metalgel with Liquid Metal Continuum Immobilized in Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221;. The 92.40% vol interconnected liquid metal expands throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks with polymer domain size down to nanometer scale. Liquid metal is stably immobilized in metalgel via electrostatic interactions. Metalgel exhibits ultrahigh electrical conductivity (up to 3.18 &#215; 106 S&#183;m&#8722;1) and tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70 kPa).








Abstract
Gels are formed by fluids that expand throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks. To unlock unprecedented properties, exploring new fluids immobilized in polymer networks is crucial. Here, a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221; is introduced via fluid replacement strategy, featuring 92.40%&#160;vol liquid metal fluid as a continuum immobilized by interconnected nanoscale polymer network. The unique structure endows metalgel with high electrical conductivity (up to 3.18&#160;&#215;&#160;106 S&#183;m&#8210;1), tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70&#160;kPa), and low gas permeability (4.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8210;22&#160;m2&#183;s&#8210;1&#183;Pa&#8210;1). Besides, metalgel demonstrates electrical stability under extreme deformations, such as being run over by a 4.5&#8208;metric&#8208;tonne truck, and maintains its integrity in various environments for up to 180 days. The immobilization of high&#8208;volume&#8208;fraction liquid metal fluid is realized by electrostatic interactions is further revealed. Potential applications for metalgel are diverse and include soft electromagnetic shielding, hermetic sealing, and stimulating/sensing electrodes in implantable bioelectronics, underscoring its broad applicability.

         <title>Dynamic Lock&#8208;And&#8208;Release Mechanism Enables Reduced &#916;G at Low Temperatures for High&#8208;Performance Polyanionic Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy, underpinned by a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism, is proposed for the first time to dynamically regulate the coordination field of reactant ions. This dynamic regulation improves reaction kinetics and reduces &#916;G at low temperatures, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature synthesis of polyanionic cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries is highly desirable but often plagued by prolonged reaction times and suboptimal crystallinity. To address these challenges, a novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy based on a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism is introduced. Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically &#8220;locks&#8221; and &#8220;releases&#8221; vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously &#8220;locking&#8221; H+ ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self&#8208;adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real&#8208;time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) at 90 &#176;C within just 3 hours. The as&#8208;prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy. This work pioneers the regulation of coordination field chemistry for polyanionic cathode synthesis, providing transformative insights into material design.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Based Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key green energy oxidant with growing interest. This review examines non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), aiming to optimize H2O2 production through active site regulation, heterometallic effects, oxygen vacancy engineering, and local electronic environment. It suggests a future research direction for more advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a high&#8208;value chemical widely used in electronics, textiles, paper bleaching, medical disinfection, and wastewater treatment. Traditional production methods, such as the anthraquinone oxidation process and direct synthesis, require high energy consumption, and involve risks from toxic substances and explosions. Researchers are now exploring photochemical, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical synthesis methods to reduce energy use and pollution. This review focuses on the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, and discusses how catalyst active sites influence O2 adsorption. Strategies to enhance H2O2 selectivity by regulating these sites are presented. Catalysts require strong O2 adsorption to initiate reactions and weak *OOH adsorption to promote H2O2 formation. The review also covers advances in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), multi&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts, and highlights non&#8208;noble metal oxides, especially perovskite oxides, for their versatile structures and potential in 2e&#8722; ORR. The potential of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects to enhance catalyst performance is also discussed. In conclusion, emphasis is placed on optimizing catalyst structures through theoretical and experimental methods to achieve efficient and selective H2O2 production, aiming for sustainable and commercial applications.

The review also covers advances in single-atom catalysts (SACs), multi-metal-based catalysts, and highlights non-noble metal oxides, especially perovskite oxides, for their versatile structures and potential in 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR. The potential of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects to enhance catalyst performance is also discussed. In conclusion, emphasis is placed on optimizing catalyst structures through theoretical and experimental methods to achieve efficient and selective H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, aiming for sustainable and commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Collagen Mineralization Decreases NK Cell&#8208;Mediated Cytotoxicity of Breast Cancer Cells via Increased Glycocalyx Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skeletal metastasis in advanced breast cancer involves immune evasion by disseminated tumor cells. Using synthetic bone models with controlled mineral content and advanced imaging techniques, it is revealed that collagen type I mineralization in the bone matrix upregulates mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and sialylation in tumor cells, thickening their glycocalyx and enhancing resistance to natural killer cells.








Abstract
Skeletal metastasis is common in patients with advanced breast cancer and often caused by immune evasion of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). In the skeleton, tumor cells not only disseminate to the bone marrow but also to osteogenic niches in which they interact with newly mineralizing bone extracellular matrix (ECM). However, it remains unclear how mineralization of collagen type I, the primary component of bone ECM, regulates tumor&#8208;immune cell interactions. Here, a combination of synthetic bone matrix models with controlled mineral content, nanoscale optical imaging, and flow cytometry are utilized to evaluate how collagen type I mineralization affects the biochemical and biophysical properties of the tumor cell glycocalyx, a dense layer of glycosylated proteins and lipids decorating their cell surface. These results suggest that collagen mineralization upregulates mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and sialylation by tumor cells, which increases their glycocalyx thickness while enhancing resistance to attack by natural killer (NK) cells. These changes are functionally linked as treatment with a sialylation inhibitor decreased mineralization&#8208;dependent glycocalyx thickness and made tumor cells more susceptible to NK cell attack. Together, these results suggest that interference with glycocalyx sialylation may represent a therapeutic strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapies targeting bone&#8208;metastatic breast cancer.

         <title>Microparticles Decorated with Cell&#8208;Instructive Surface Chemistries Actively Promote Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single application of poly(tetrahydro furfuryl acrylate)&#8208;decorated microparticles to wound beds in a full thickness diabetic wound model promotes almost complete healing and tissue granulation. The wound closure, granulation tissue formation, and neovascularization are through active instruction of fibroblasts and macrophages toward pro&#8208;healing phenotypes as evidenced by changes in collagen deposition, matrix metalloproteinases expression profile, and cytokine environments.








Abstract
Wound healing is a complex biological process involving close crosstalk between various cell types. Dysregulation in any of these processes, such as in diabetic wounds, results in chronic nonhealing wounds. Fibroblasts are a critical cell type involved in the formation of granulation tissue, essential for effective wound healing. 315 different polymer surfaces are screened to identify candidates which actively drive fibroblasts toward either pro&#8208; or antiproliferative functional phenotypes. Fibroblast&#8208;instructive chemistries are identified, which are synthesized into surfactants to fabricate easy to administer microparticles for direct application to diabetic wounds. The pro&#8208;proliferative microfluidic derived particles are able to successfully promote neovascularization, granulation tissue formation, and wound closure after a single application to the wound bed. These active novel bio&#8208;instructive microparticles show great potential as a route to reducing the burden of chronic wounds.

         <title>Photoinduced Dithiolane Crosslinking for Multiresponsive Dynamic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disulfide&#8208;crosslinked adaptable hydrogels capable of multiple responses to stimuli are prepared using initiator&#8208;free photocrosslinking of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, which are inherently photoresponsive cyclic disulfides. Using a variety of stimuli, multiple dynamic transformations are demonstrated in these hydrogels; a series of complex cell culture experiments highlight the versatility of this system for studying effects of mechanical manipulation of the cellular microenvironment.








Abstract
While many hydrogels are elastic networks crosslinked by covalent bonds, viscoelastic hydrogels with adaptable crosslinks are increasingly being developed to better recapitulate time and position&#8208;dependent processes found in many tissues. In this work, 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes are presented as dynamic covalent photocrosslinkers of hydrogels, resulting in disulfide bonds throughout the hydrogel that respond to multiple stimuli. Using lipoic acid as a model dithiolane, disulfide crosslinks are formed under physiological conditions, enabling cell encapsulation via an initiator&#8208;free light&#8208;induced dithiolane ring&#8208;opening photopolymerization. The resulting hydrogels allow for multiple photoinduced dynamic responses including stress relaxation, stiffening, softening, and network functionalization using a single chemistry, which can be supplemented by permanent reaction with alkenes to further control network properties and connectivity using irreversible thioether crosslinks. Moreover, complementary photochemical approaches are used to achieve rapid and complete sample degradation via radical scission and post&#8208;gelation network stiffening when irradiated in the presence of reactive gel precursor. The results herein demonstrate the versatility of this material chemistry to study and direct 2D and 3D cell&#8208;material interactions. This work highlights dithiolane&#8208;based hydrogel photocrosslinking as a robust method for generating adaptable hydrogels with a range of biologically relevant mechanical and chemical properties that are varied on demand.

         <title>Programmable Tissue Folding Patterns in Structured Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue folds such as in the upper airways have important functions in organ development and homeostasis. Engineered hydrogels provide a system to recreate tissue folding patterns in vitro but are almost exclusively limited to static platforms. In this work, the design of a dynamic and cytcompatible hydrogel folding system based on magnetoactive biocomposites for on&#8208;demand and reversible folding is described.








Abstract
Folding of mucosal tissues, such as the tissue within the epithelium of the upper respiratory airways, is critical for organ function. Studying the influence of folded tissue patterns on cellular function is challenging mainly due to the lack of suitable cell culture platforms that can recreate dynamic tissue folding in vitro. Here, a bilayer hydrogel folding system, composed of alginate/polyacrylamide double&#8208;network (DN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels, to generate static folding patterns based on mechanical instabilities, is described. By encapsulating human fibroblasts into patterned HA hydrogels, human bronchial epithelial cells form a folded pseudostratified monolayer. Using magnetic microparticles, DN hydrogels reversibly fold into pre&#8208;defined patterns and enable programmable on&#8208;demand folding of cell&#8208;laden hydrogel systems upon applying a magnetic field. This hydrogel construction provides a dynamic culture system for mimicking tissue folding in vitro, which is extendable to other cell types and organ systems.

         <title>The Importance of Effective Ligand Concentration to Direct Epithelial Cell Polarity in Dynamic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over the effective ligand concentration is engineered into dynamic, supramolecular hydrogels via bioactive peptide ligands that are robustly incorporated in supramolecular fibers. Epithelial cell polarity is regulated by a tension&#8208;based balance between cell&#8211;matrix and cell&#8722;cell interactions, which is dominated by the effective ligand concentration in 2D, while in 3D also the bulk stiffness plays a role.








Abstract
Epithelial cysts and organoids are multicellular hollow structures formed by correctly polarized epithelial cells. Important in steering these cysts from single cells is the dynamic regulation of extracellular matrix presented ligands, and matrix dynamics. Here, control over the effective ligand concentration is introduced, decoupled from bulk and local mechanical properties, in synthetic dynamic supramolecular hydrogels formed through noncovalent crosslinking of supramolecular fibers. Control over the effective ligand concentration is realized by 1) keeping the ligand concentration constant, but changing the concentration of nonfunctionalized molecules or by 2) varying the ligand concentration, while keeping the concentration of non&#8208;functionalized molecules constant. The&#160;results show that in 2D, the effective ligand concentration within the&#160;supramolecular fibers rather than gel stiffness (from 0.1 to 8&#160;kPa) regulates epithelial polarity. In 3D, increasing the effective ligand concentration from 0.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m strengthens the effect of increased gel stiffness from 0.1 to 2&#160;kPa, to synergistically yield more correctly polarized cysts. Through integrin manipulation, it is&#160;shown that epithelial polarity is regulated by tension&#8208;based homeostasis between cells and matrix.

     alt="The Importance of Effective Ligand Concentration to Direct Epithelial Cell Polarity in Dynamic Hydrogels"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control over the effective ligand concentration is engineered into dynamic, supramolecular hydrogels via bioactive peptide ligands that are robustly incorporated in supramolecular fibers. Epithelial cell polarity is regulated by a tension-based balance between cell&#8211;matrix and cell&#8722;cell interactions, which is dominated by the effective ligand concentration in 2D, while in 3D also the bulk stiffness plays a role.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epithelial cysts and organoids are multicellular hollow structures formed by correctly polarized epithelial cells. Important in steering these cysts from single cells is the dynamic regulation of extracellular matrix presented ligands, and matrix dynamics. Here, control over the effective ligand concentration is introduced, decoupled from bulk and local mechanical properties, in synthetic dynamic supramolecular hydrogels formed through noncovalent crosslinking of supramolecular fibers. Control over the effective ligand concentration is realized by 1) keeping the ligand concentration constant, but changing the concentration of nonfunctionalized molecules or by 2) varying the ligand concentration, while keeping the concentration of non-functionalized molecules constant. The&#160;results show that in 2D, the effective ligand concentration within the&#160;supramolecular fibers rather than gel stiffness (from 0.1 to 8&#160;kPa) regulates epithelial polarity. In 3D, increasing the effective ligand concentration from 0.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; strengthens the effect of increased gel stiffness from 0.1 to 2&#160;kPa, to synergistically yield more correctly polarized cysts. Through integrin manipulation, it is&#160;shown that epithelial polarity is regulated by tension-based homeostasis between cells and matrix. The&#160;results reveal the effective ligand concentration as influential factor in regulating epithelial polarity and provide insights on engineering of synthetic biomaterials for cell and organoid culture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Drug Release from a Flexible, Tissue&#8208;Adherent, Hybrid Hydrogel Actuator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of hybrid hydrogel actuator (HHA) that facilitates enhanced mechanoresponsive drug delivery is introduced. The HHA consists of a soft actuator with a tough drug&#8208;eluting hydrogel layer that can conformally adhere to wet tissue and locally deliver drug in a spatially targeted manger in response to controlled soft robotic actuation.








Abstract
Soft robotic technologies for therapeutic biomedical applications require conformal and atraumatic tissue coupling that is amenable to dynamic loading for effective drug delivery or tissue stimulation. This intimate and sustained contact offers vast therapeutic opportunities for localized drug release. Herein, a new class of hybrid hydrogel actuator (HHA) that facilitates enhanced drug delivery is introduced. The multi&#8208;material soft actuator can elicit a tunable mechanoresponsive release of charged drug from its alginate/acrylamide hydrogel layer with temporal control. Dosing control parameters include actuation magnitude, frequency, and duration. The actuator can safely adhere to tissue via a flexible, drug&#8208;permeable adhesive bond that can withstand dynamic device actuation. Conformal adhesion of the hybrid hydrogel actuator to tissue leads to improved mechanoresponsive spatial delivery of the drug. Future integration of this hybrid hydrogel actuator with other soft robotic assistive technologies can enable a synergistic, multi&#8208;pronged treatment approach for the treatment of disease.

         <title>Age&#8208;associated Senescent &#8211; T Cell Signaling Promotes Type 3 Immunity that Inhibits the Biomaterial Regenerative Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging alters immune responses, impairing tissue repair and response to regenerative treatments. In aged animals, injury increases inflammation and IL&#8208;17 signaling, revealing age&#8208;related communication between T cells and senescent cells that promotes type 3 immunity. Inhibiting this response with IL17&#8208;neutralizing antibodies improves healing and biomaterial efficacy, suggesting potential strategies for countering age&#8208;related immune dysregulation to promote tissue repair.








Abstract
Aging is associated with immunological changes that compromise response to infections and vaccines, exacerbate inflammatory diseases and can potentially mitigate tissue repair. Even so, age&#8208;related changes to the immune response to tissue damage and regenerative medicine therapies remain unknown. Here, it is characterized how aging induces changes in immunological signatures that inhibit tissue repair and therapeutic response to a clinical regenerative biological scaffold derived from extracellular matrix. Signatures of inflammation and interleukin (IL)&#8208;17 signaling increased with injury and treatment both locally and regionally in aged animals, and computational analysis uncovered age&#8208;associated senescent&#8208;T cell communication that promotes type 3 immunity in T cells. Local inhibition of type 3 immune activation using IL17&#8208;neutralizing antibodies improves healing and restores therapeutic response to the regenerative biomaterial, promoting muscle repair in older animals. These results provide insights into tissue immune dysregulation that occurs with aging that can be targeted to rejuvenate repair.

Bio&#8208;Interfaced Pressure Sensors
Bio&#8208;interfaced pressure sensors deployed on the surfaces of organs or within internal cavities of the body can monitor health condition and track disease progression. Strain gauges buckled into a 3D form represent one type of emerging bio&#8208;interfaced pressure sensors. Such 3D geometries enhance the deformations in the direction perpendicular to the substrate, thereby increasing the sensitivity to normal pressure. More details can be found in article number 2205609 by Zhongyi Nie, Jean Won Kwak, Mengdi Han, and John A. Rogers.

         <title>Fundamentals and Applications of Raman&#8208;Based Techniques for the Design and Development of Active Biomedical Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential and benefits of Raman spectroscopy as an analytical method for non&#8208;invasive biomaterial characterization are presented. After a comprehensive description of the theoretical and practical background, the advantages of Raman spectroscopy are introduced through a selection of relevant examples from the literature. Practical recommendations on the integration of Raman techniques into the experimental laboratory toolbox are also discussed.









Abstract
Raman spectroscopy is an analytical method based on light&#8211;matter interactions that can interrogate the vibrational modes of matter and provide representative molecular fingerprints. Mediated by its label&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive nature, and high molecular specificity, Raman&#8208;based techniques have become ubiquitous tools for in situ characterization of materials. This review comprehensively describes the theoretical and practical background of Raman spectroscopy and its advanced variants. The numerous facets of material characterization that Raman scattering can reveal, including biomolecular identification, solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transitions, and spatial mapping of biomolecular species in bioactive materials, are highlighted. The review illustrates the potential of these techniques in the context of active biomedical material design and development by highlighting representative studies from the literature. These studies cover the use of Raman spectroscopy for the characterization of both natural and synthetic biomaterials, including engineered tissue constructs, biopolymer systems, ceramics, and nanoparticle formulations, among others. To increase the accessibility and adoption of these techniques, the present review also provides the reader with practical recommendations on the integration of Raman techniques into the experimental laboratory toolbox. Finally, perspectives on how recent developments in plasmon&#8208; and coherently&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy can propel Raman from underutilized to critical for biomaterial development are&#160;provided.

         <title>Intravascularly Deliverable Biomaterial Platforms for Tissue Repair and Regeneration Post&#8208;Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind intravascularly administered biomaterials for the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). First, biomaterials can utilize passive diffusion into the infarct. Second, biomaterials can utilize specific cellular presence in the infarct for localization. Finally, these active materials can be leveraged to localize to the ischemic heart based on the MI pathophysiology.








Abstract
Each year, nearly 19 million people die of cardiovascular disease with coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction (MI) as the leading cause of the progression of heart failure. Due to the high risk associated with surgical procedures, a variety of minimally invasive therapeutics aimed at tissue repair and regeneration are being developed. While biomaterials delivered via intramyocardial injection have shown promise, there are challenges associated with delivery in acute MI. In contrast, intravascularly injectable biomaterials are a desirable category of therapeutics due to their ability to be delivered immediately post&#8208;MI via less invasive methods. In addition to passive diffusion into the infarct, these biomaterials can be designed to target the molecular and cellular characteristics seen in MI pathophysiology, such as cells and proteins present in the ischemic myocardium, to reduce off&#8208;target localization. These injectable materials can also be stimuli&#8208;responsive through enzymes or chemical imbalances. This review outlines the natural and synthetic biomaterial designs that allow for retention and accumulation within the infarct via intravascular delivery, including intracoronary infusion and intravenous injection.

         <title>Enzymatically Activatable Polymers for Disease Diagnosis and Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irregular expression or activity of enzymes in the human body is associated with various pathological disorders, making them attractive targets for disease treatment. The incorporation of enzyme&#8208;responsive groups into polymers with potential biological applications offers a new approach to address these diseases. Through advanced synthetic strategies and rational experimental design, certain polymers have now progressed to the clinical trial stage.








Abstract
The irregular expression or activity of enzymes in the human body leads to various pathological disorders and can therefore be used as an intrinsic trigger for more precise identification of disease foci and controlled release of diagnostics and therapeutics, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and therapeutic efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. Advanced synthesis strategies enable the preparation of polymers with enzymatically activatable skeletons or side chains, while understanding enzymatically responsive mechanisms promotes rational incorporation of activatable units and predictions of the release profile of diagnostics and therapeutics, ultimately leading to promising applications in disease diagnosis and treatment with superior biocompatibility and efficiency. By overcoming the challenges, new opportunities will emerge to inspire researchers to develop more efficient, safer, and clinically reliable enzymatically activatable polymeric carriers as well as prodrugs.

         <title>Mechanically Active Materials and Devices for Bio&#8208;Interfaced Pressure Sensors&#8212;A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest progress in bio&#8208;interfaced pressure sensors is reviewed. Challenges lie in the development of high&#8208;performance sensors that can softly interface with biological tissues to enable accurate, safe monitoring for extended periods of time. Recent advances in mechanically active materials and structural designs provide a range of application opportunities for implantable and skin&#8208;mounted systems.








Abstract
Pressures generated by external forces or by internal body processes represent parameters of critical importance in diagnosing physiological health and in anticipating injuries. Examples span intracranial hypertension from traumatic brain injuries, high blood pressure from poor diet, pressure&#8208;induced skin ulcers from immobility, and edema from congestive heart failure. Pressures measured on the soft surfaces of vital organs or within internal cavities of the body can provide essential insights into patient status and progression. Challenges lie in the development of high&#8208;performance pressure sensors that can softly interface with biological tissues to enable safe monitoring for extended periods of time. This review focuses on recent advances in mechanically active materials and structural designs for classes of soft pressure sensors that have proven uses in these contexts. The discussions include applications of such sensors as implantable and wearable systems, with various unique capabilities in wireless continuous monitoring, minimally invasive deployment, natural degradation in biofluids, and/or multiplexed spatiotemporal mapping. A concluding section summarizes challenges and future opportunities for this growing field of materials and biomedical research.

         <title>Bioresponsive Immunotherapeutic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 43, October 24, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioresponsive materials with abundant functional motifs and flexible structural designs can deliver immunoactive agents to the lesion location and spatiotemporally modulate immune responses to maximize the efficacy of immunotherapy as well as minimize the potential side effects. This review highlights the design principles of bioresponsive materials and discusses the critical effect of on&#8208;demand immunoactive agent release in recruiting, housing, or manipulating immune cells for boosting immunotherapy.








Abstract
The human immune system is an interaction network of biological processes, and its dysfunction is closely associated with a wide array of diseases, such as cancer, infectious diseases, tissue damage, and autoimmune diseases. Manipulation of the immune response network in a desired and controlled fashion has been regarded as a promising strategy for maximizing immunotherapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects. Integration of &#8220;smart&#8221; bioresponsive materials with immunoactive agents including small molecules, biomacromolecules, and cells can achieve on&#8208;demand release of agents at targeted sites to reduce overdose&#8208;related toxicity and alleviate off&#8208;target effects. This review highlights the design principles of bioresponsive immunotherapeutic materials and discusses the critical roles of controlled release of immunoactive agents from bioresponsive materials in recruiting, housing, and manipulating immune cells for evoking desired immune responses. Challenges and future directions from the perspective of clinical translation are also discussed.

Cell&#8208;surface&#8208;associated materials (e.g., nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings) can prevent cell damage or loss, control cell transport and biodistribution, mask cell&#8208;surface antigens, regulate cell phenotypes, and deliver therapeutic agents to target&#160;tissues.








Abstract
Cell therapies are emerging as a promising new therapeutic modality in medicine, generating effective treatments for previously incurable diseases. Clinical success of cell therapies has energized the field of cellular engineering, spurring further exploration of novel approaches to improve their therapeutic performance. Engineering of cell surfaces using natural and synthetic materials has emerged as a valuable tool in this endeavor. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of technologies for decorating cell surfaces with various materials including nanoparticles, microparticles, and polymeric coatings, focusing on the ways in which surface decorations enhance carrier cells and therapeutic effects. Key benefits of surface&#8208;modified cells include protecting the carrier cell, reducing particle clearance, enhancing cell trafficking, masking cell&#8208;surface antigens, modulating inflammatory phenotype of carrier cells, and delivering therapeutic agents to target tissues. While most of these technologies are still in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stage, the promising therapeutic efficacy of these constructs from in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies has laid a strong foundation for eventual clinical translation. Cell surface engineering with materials can imbue a diverse range of advantages for cell therapy, creating opportunities for innovative functionalities, for improved therapeutic efficacy, and transforming the fundamental and translational landscape of cell therapies.

         <title>Biomaterial&#8208;Based In Situ Cancer Vaccines</title>

Biomaterials&#8208;based in situ cancer vaccines can generate endogenous antigens directly from tumors and fully exploit the generated tumor antigens to elicit potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and antitumor efficacy. An overview of biomaterials&#8208;based in situ cancer vaccines is presented, either living or artificial materials, under development or in the clinic.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapies have reshaped the paradigm for cancer treatment over the past decade. Among them, therapeutic cancer vaccines that aim to modulate antigen&#8208;presenting cells and subsequent T cell priming processes are among the first FDA&#8208;approved cancer immunotherapies. However, despite showing benign safety profiles and the capability to generate antigen&#8208;specific humoral and cellular responses, cancer vaccines have been limited by the modest therapeutic efficacy, especially for immunologically cold solid tumors. One key challenge lies in the identification of tumor&#8208;specific antigens, which involves a costly and lengthy process of tumor cell isolation, DNA/RNA extraction, sequencing, mutation analysis, epitope prediction, peptide synthesis, and antigen screening. To address these issues, in situ cancer vaccines have been actively pursued to generate endogenous antigens directly from tumors and utilize the generated tumor antigens to elicit potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Biomaterials&#8208;based in situ cancer vaccines, in particular, have achieved significant progress by taking advantage of biomaterials that can synergize antigens and adjuvants, troubleshoot delivery issues, home, and manipulate immune cells in situ. This review will provide an overview of biomaterials&#8208;based in situ cancer vaccines, either living or artificial materials, under development or in the clinic, and discuss the design criteria for in situ cancer vaccines.

If the heart fails, mechanical support is required for survival. Artificial muscle actuators are poised to transform the way the heart is supported clinically today. Learning from the challenges in current practice, this article addresses bottlenecks across all actuator types and provides inspiring research perspectives for innovative future technology.








Abstract
Artificial muscles enable the design of soft implantable devices which are poised to transform the way we&#160;mechanically support the heart today. Heart failure is a prevalent and deadly disease, which is treated with the implantation of rotary blood pumps as the only alternative to heart transplantation. The clinically used mechanical devices are associated with severe adverse events, which are reflected here in a comprehensive list of critical requirements for soft active devices of the future: low power, no blood contact, pulsatile support, physiological responsiveness, high cycle life, and less&#8208;invasive implantation. In this review, prior art in artificial muscles for their applicability in the short and long term is investigated and critically evaluated. The main challenges regarding the effectiveness, controllability, and implantability of recently proposed actuators are highlighted and the future perspectives for attachment, physiological responsiveness, durability, and biodegradability as well as equitable design considerations are explored.

         <title>Silver Recovery from Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Solar Cells Using Continuous Stirred&#8208;Tank Reactors</title>

Silver can be recycled from the end&#8208;of&#8208;life crystalline silicon photovoltaic, yet the recycling and its technology scale&#8208;up are still at an early stage. This work understands and optimizes the silver recovery from the solar cells in continuously stirred tank reactors from the point of view of silver recovery efficiency, through integrating experimental and numerical investigations.








Abstract
Silver can be recycled from the end&#8208;of&#8208;life crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV), yet the recycling and its technology scale&#8208;up are still at an early stage especially in continuously operations e.g., continoursely stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Here, the silver recovery from the solar cells is technically understood and optimized in the CSTR system from the point of view of silver recovery efficiency, through integrating experimental and numerical investigations. Specifically, based on the experiments, a kinetics model is developed and scanning electron microscopy surface morphology is characterized; and a computational fluid dynamics&#8211;discrete element method (CFD&#8211;DEM) particle&#8208;scale model is integrated with the kinetics model and validated against the fluid&#8208;flow pattern and silver leaching performance results from lab measurements. The validated CFD&#8211;DEM model is then applied to understand the particle&#8208;scale behavior of silver leaching in the CSTR system in terms of hydrodynamics and AgNO3 distribution under different impeller speeds. The simulation results show that the silver leaching performance is improved in an improved CSTR design with a lower impeller position and doubled impeller layers. This work reveals the effectiveness and underlying hydrodynamics of silver leaching in CSTR systems and lays a foundation for improving silver recovery in PV recycling.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Carbon Co&#8208;Catalysts for Up&#8208;Conversion Photo&#8208;Induced Catalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed metal&#8208;free GQD/P&#8208;C3N4 hybrid carbon catalyst with GQD to upconvert the NIR light to visible light to activate P&#8208;C3N4 for photocatalytic oxidation of glucose into H2O2, followed by GQD&#8208;induced ROS generation from H2O2 for efficient catalytic cancer therapy through the cascade reactions, as demonstrated by experimental results and therapeutic outcomes.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;free carbon co&#8208;catalysts that convert glucose into H2O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) are developed from phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride (P&#8208;C3N4) and graphene quantum dots (GQD) composites, for enhanced photocatalytic cancer therapy by light exposure in the targeted tumor microenvironment. Upon irradiation, the NIR light is converted by GQD with up&#8208;conversion function into visible light to excite P&#8208;C3N4 for photocatalytic conversion of glucose into H2O2, which subsequently decomposes into ROS. ROS thus generated exhibits an excellent anticancer efficacy for efficient cancer therapy with minimal side effects, as evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo studies. This study demonstrates, for the first time, a cancer therapeutic of GQD/P&#8208;C3N4 composite that utilizes a two&#8208;step cascade effect using initially NIR&#8208;triggered GQD nanoparticles to activate P&#8208;C3N4 to photocatalytically generate ROS for effective and targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Dynamic Electric Discharge Paths in Liquid Metal Marble Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal marble pixelated arrays consisting of electroluminescent ZnS&#8208;coated eutectic&#8208;gallium&#8208;indium droplets are made. Electric discharges within the inter&#8208;marble air gaps are generated under voltage activation. The platform allows visualization of dynamic discharge paths and collective system behaviors of configurable liquid metal marble arrays, macroscopic &#8216;crystal lattices&#8217;, marble&#8208;based logic gates, and granular and soft matters.








Abstract
Electric discharge occurs ubiquitously in both natural and engineered systems, where the discharge paths provide critical information. However, control and visualization of discharge patterns is a challenging task. Here arrays of liquid metal marbles, droplets of a gallium&#8208;indium eutectic alloy with a copper&#8208;doped ZnS luminescent coating, are designed for pixelated visualization of electric discharge paths at optical imaging length&#8208;scales. The ZnS particles embed themselves into the surface of liquid metal droplets and are anchored by a self&#8208;limiting gallium oxide layer. The operation is achieved by generating spark discharges at inter&#8208;marble air gaps and reduced voltage drop across highly conducting liquid metal droplets. By taking advantage of the malleability of soft liquid metal marbles, the dynamic visualization platforms allow the manipulation of discharge path selections in configurable marble arrays and the embedding of artificial defect features. The systems are further integrated for characterizing dynamic changes in granular and soft systems, and for enabling logic computing and information encoded display. This demonstration holds promises for creating new&#8208;generation electric discharge&#8208;based optoelectronics.

Carbon&#8208;Based Flame Retardants
How do flame retardants work at the atomistic scale? A heterogenous structure of a graphitic sheet being retarded against intense heat is depicted, which leads to the carbonisation of carbon&#8208;based flame retardants at elevated temperatures. Article number 2403835 by Guan Heng Yeoh and co&#8208;workers outlines the state&#8208;of&#8208;art review towards the molecular understanding of carbon&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant mechanisms for polymers via detailed analytical assessments and computational material science.

         <title>Biologicals and Biomaterials for Corneal Regeneration and Vision Restoration in Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scaffolds with stem cells to rehabilitate the ocular surface in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency. Native and synthetic scaffolds, as carriers of stem cells, are being developed and transplanted to treat individuals with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). Successful outcomes include restoration of tissue architecture and improvements in ocular health and vision without causing complications.








Abstract
The mammalian cornea is decorated with stem cells bestowed with the life&#8208;long task of renewing the epithelium, provided they remain healthy, functional, and in sufficient numbers. If not, a debilitating disease known as limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) can develop causing blindness. Decades after the first stem cell (SC) therapy is devised to treat this condition, patients continue to suffer unacceptable failures. During this time, improvements to therapeutics have included identifying better markers to isolate robust SC populations and nurturing them on crudely modified biological or biomaterial scaffolds including human amniotic membrane, fibrin, and contact lenses, prior to their delivery. Researchers are now gathering information about the biomolecular and biomechanical properties of the corneal SC niche to decipher what biological and/or synthetic materials can be incorporated into these carriers. Advances in biomedical engineering including electrospinning and 3D bioprinting with surface functionalization and micropatterning, and self&#8208;assembly models, have generated a wealth of biocompatible, biodegradable, integrating scaffolds to choose from, some of which are being tested for their SC delivery capacity in the hope of improving clinical outcomes for patients with LSCD.

         <title>Label&#8208;Free Assessment of Key Biological Autofluorophores: Material Characteristics and Opportunities for Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This literature review examines the pivotal roles and applications of autofluorophores&#8212;endogenous fluorescent compounds intrinsic to all tissues. The utility of their assessment is explored in non&#8208;invasive, label&#8208;free clinical assessments for disease detection, surgical guidance, and continuous in vivo tissue characterization, highlighting their significance in biomedical research and clinical practice.








Abstract
Autofluorophores are endogenous fluorescent compounds that naturally occur in the intra and extracellular spaces of all tissues and organs. Most have vital biological functions &#8211; like the metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD+, as well as the structural protein collagen. Others are considered to be waste products &#8211; like lipofuscin and advanced glycation end products &#8211; which accumulate with age and are associated with cellular dysfunction. Due to their natural fluorescence, these materials have great utility for enabling non&#8208;invasive, label&#8208;free assays with direct ties to biological function. Numerous technologies, with different advantages and drawbacks, are applied to their assessment, including fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, hyperspectral microscopy, and flow cytometry. Here, the applications of label&#8208;free autofluorophore assessment are reviewed for clinical and health&#8208;research applications, with specific attention to biomaterials, disease detection, surgical guidance, treatment monitoring, and tissue assessment &#8211; fields that greatly benefit from non&#8208;invasive methodologies capable of continuous, in vivo characterization.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;based Flame Retardants for Polymers: A Bottom&#8208;up Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Is it really understood how flame retardants work at the molecular level? The use of cutting&#8208;edge simulations via molecular dynamics sets a precedence for an alternative bottom&#8208;up approach to better comprehend the thermal resisting process of carbon&#8208;based flame retardants, such as the char formation and radical capturing offered by the unique carbon bonding arrangements and microscopic in situ architectures.








Abstract
This state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review is geared toward elucidating the molecular understanding of the carbon&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant mechanisms for polymers via holistic characterization combining detailed analytical assessments and computational material science. The use of carbon&#8208;based flame retardants, which include graphite, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon dots (CDs), and fullerenes, in their pure and functionalized forms are initially reviewed to evaluate their flame retardancy performance and to determine their elevation of the flammability resistance on various types of polymers. The early transition metal carbides such as MXenes, regarded as next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;based flame retardants, are discussed with respect to their superior flame retardancy and multifunctional applications. At the core of this review is the utilization of cutting&#8208;edge molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which sets a precedence of an alternative bottom&#8208;up approach to fill the knowledge gap through insights into the thermal resisting process of the carbon&#8208;based flame retardants, such as the formation of carbonaceous char and intermediate chemical reactions offered by the unique carbon bonding arrangements and microscopic in&#8208;situ architectures. Combining MD simulations with detailed experimental assessments and characterization, a more targeted development as well as a systematic material synthesis framework can be realized for the future development of advanced flame&#8208;retardant polymers.

         <title>Advancing Synthetic Hydrogels through Nature&#8208;Inspired Materials Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human tissue displays complex mechanical behavior that is challenging to mimic using traditional synthetic polymers. This review discusses frontier biomaterials inspired by native extracellular matrices, where supramolecular assembly fosters broad mechanical diversity. Advances in synthetic hydrogel chemistry, biofabrication, and organoid engineering are presented, with a focus on how these research areas intersect to drive progress in organotypic and microphysiological systems.








Abstract
Synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics that can recapitulate the complex biochemical and mechanical nature of native tissues are needed for advanced models of development and disease. Biomedical research has heavily relied on the use of animal&#8208;derived biomaterials, which is now impeding their translational potential and convoluting the biological insights gleaned from in vitro tissue models. Natural hydrogels have long served as a convenient and effective cell culture tool, but advances in materials chemistry and fabrication techniques now present promising new avenues for creating xenogenic&#8208;free ECM substitutes appropriate for organotypic models and microphysiological systems. However, significant challenges remain in creating synthetic matrices that can approximate the structural sophistication, biochemical complexity, and dynamic functionality of native tissues. This review summarizes key properties of the native ECM, and discusses recent approaches used to systematically decouple and tune these properties in synthetic matrices. The importance of dynamic ECM mechanics, such as viscoelasticity and matrix plasticity, is also discussed, particularly within the context of organoid and engineered tissue matrices. Emerging design strategies to mimic these dynamic mechanical properties are reviewed, such as multi&#8208;network hydrogels, supramolecular chemistry, and hydrogels assembled from biological monomers.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in energy harvesters, wireless energy transfer, and energy storage are reviewed, emphasizing the crucial role of advanced materials in achieving a future where wearable and implantable medical devices are self&#8208;powered, eliminating the need for battery replacement or manual recharging.








Abstract
Wearable and implantable active medical devices (WIMDs) are transformative solutions for improving healthcare, offering continuous health monitoring, early disease detection, targeted treatments, personalized medicine, and connected health capabilities. Commercialized WIMDs use primary or rechargeable batteries to power their sensing, actuation, stimulation, and communication functions, and periodic battery replacements of implanted active medical devices pose major risks of surgical infections or inconvenience to users. Addressing the energy source challenge is critical for meeting the growing demand of the WIMD market that is reaching valuations in the tens of billions of dollars. This review critically assesses the recent advances in energy harvesting and storage technologies that can potentially eliminate the need for battery replacements. With a key focus on advanced materials that can enable energy harvesters to meet the energy needs of WIMDs, this review examines the crucial roles of advanced materials in improving the efficiencies of energy harvesters, wireless charging, and energy storage devices. This review concludes by highlighting the key challenges and opportunities in advanced materials necessary to achieve the vision of self&#8208;powered wearable and implantable active medical devices, eliminating the risks associated with surgical battery replacement and the inconvenience of frequent manual recharging.

This review summarizes recent research achievements and key challenges facing single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts. The new strategies to address these challenges including increasing intrinsic activity of metal sites, enhancing the utilization of metal sites, improving the stability, optimizing the local environment, developing new fabrication techniques, leveraging insights from theoretical studies, and expanding potential applications are highlighted.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SACs) are a class of promising materials for driving electrochemical energy conversion reactions due to their intrinsic advantages, including maximum metal utilization, well&#8208;defined active structures, and strong interface effects. However, SACs have not reached full commercialization for broad industrial applications. This review summarizes recent research achievements in the design of SACs for crucial electrocatalytic reactions on their active sites, coordination, and substrates, as well as the synthesis methods. The key challenges facing SACs in activity, selectivity, stability, and scalability, are highlighted. Furthermore, it is pointed out the new strategies to address these challenges including increasing intrinsic activity of metal sites, enhancing the utilization of metal sites, improving the stability, optimizing the local environment, developing new fabrication techniques, leveraging insights from theoretical studies, and expanding potential applications. Finally, the views are offered on the future direction of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis toward commercialization.

         <title>Advancing Superconductivity with Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of superconducting materials with high transition temperatures (TC) has sparked intense interest. Efforts have been focused on interfaces of materials, including superconductivity induced at non&#8208;superconducting material interfaces or augmenting TC at the interface between superconducting/non&#8208;superconducting materials. This review explores interfacial and interface&#8208;enhanced superconductivity, and propelling superconductivity research toward practical, high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
The development of superconducting materials has attracted significant attention not only for their improved performance, such as high transition temperature (TC), but also for the exploration of their underlying physical mechanisms. Recently, considerable efforts have been focused on interfaces of materials, a distinct category capable of inducing superconductivity at non&#8208;superconducting material interfaces or augmenting the TC at the interface between a superconducting material and a non&#8208;superconducting material. Here, two distinct types of interfaces along with their unique characteristics are reviewed: interfacial superconductivity and interface&#8208;enhanced superconductivity, with a focus on the crucial factors and potential mechanisms responsible for enhancing superconducting performance. A series of materials systems is discussed, encompassing both historical developments and recent progress from the perspectives of technical innovations and the exploration of new material classes. The overarching goal is to illuminate pathways toward achieving high TC, expanding the potential of superconducting parameters across interfaces, and propelling superconductivity research toward practical, high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes: Fundamentals and Advances in Catalysis, Sensing, and Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs), formed through electron transfer between electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) components, present unprecedented capabilities for diverse applications. As semiconductors, they offer tunable bandgap and charge&#8208;transport properties. Their flexible chemistry allows tailoring matter at the molecular and atomic levels. Owing to these unique features, CTCs are promising candidates for applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, and sensing.








Abstract
Supramolecular assemblies, formed through electronic charge transfer between two or more entities, represent a rich class of compounds dubbed as charge&#8208;transfer complexes (CTCs). Their distinctive formation pathway, rooted in charge&#8208;transfer processes at the interface of CTC&#8208;forming components, results in the delocalization of electronic charge along molecular stacks, rendering CTCs intrinsic molecular conductors. Since the discovery of CTCs, intensive research has explored their unique properties including magnetism, conductivity, and superconductivity. Their more recently recognized semiconducting functionality has inspired recent developments in applications requiring organic semiconductors. In this context, CTCs offer a tuneable energy gap, unique charge&#8208;transport properties, tailorable physicochemical interactions, photoresponsiveness, and the potential for scalable manufacturing. Here, an updated viewpoint on CTCs is provided, presenting them as emerging organic semiconductors. To this end, their electronic and chemical properties alongside their synthesis methods are reviewed. The unique properties of CTCs that benefit various related applications in the realms of organic optoelectronics, catalysts, and gas sensors are discussed. Insights for future developments and existing limitations are described.

         <title>Rational Design of Earth&#8208;Abundant Catalysts toward Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts are vital for clean energy and green chemistry but often rely on expensive metals. This review highlights advancements in earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, focusing on innovative strategies, including descriptor&#8208;guided design, high&#8208;throughput calculation, machine learning, and biomimetic design. It provides a roadmap for high&#8208;performance catalyst development toward sustainability, discussing fundamental principles, current challenges, and outlook.








Abstract
Catalysis is crucial for clean energy, green chemistry, and environmental remediation, but traditional methods rely on expensive and scarce precious metals. This review addresses this challenge by highlighting the promise of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and the recent advancements in their rational design. Innovative strategies such as physics&#8208;inspired descriptors, high&#8208;throughput computational techniques, and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted design with machine learning (ML) are explored, moving beyond time&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches. Additionally, biomimicry, inspired by efficient enzymes in nature, offers valuable insights. This review systematically analyses these design strategies, providing a roadmap for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts from abundant elements. Clean energy applications (water splitting, fuel cells, batteries) and green chemistry (ammonia synthesis, CO2 reduction) are targeted while delving into the fundamental principles, biomimetic approaches, and current challenges in this field. The way to a more sustainable future is paved by overcoming catalyst scarcity through rational design.

         <title>Harnessing Radicals: Advances in Self&#8208;Assembly and Molecular Machinery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free radicals have long been a source of interesting chemistry. Their ability to form complexes with other radicals provides many opportunities for self&#8208;assembly. This review discusses the recent advancements in the field of radical assembly that have allowed the construction of complex chemical systems and the powering of artificial molecular machines.








Abstract
Radicals, with their unpaired electrons, exhibit unique chemical and physical properties that have long intrigued chemists. Despite early skepticism about their stability, the discovery of persistent radicals has opened new possibilities for molecular interactions. This review examines the mechanisms and applications of radically driven self&#8208;assembly, focusing on key motifs such as naphthalene diimides, tetrathiafulvalenes, and viologens, which serve as models for radical assembly. The potential of radical interactions in the development of artificial molecular machines (AMMs) are also discussed. These AMMs, powered by radical&#8208;radical interactions, represent significant advancements in non&#8208;equilibrium chemistry, mimicking the functionalities of biological systems. From molecular switches to ratchets and pumps, the versatility and unique properties of radically powered AMMs are highlighted. Additionally, the applications of radical assembly in materials science are explored, particularly in creating smart materials with redox&#8208;responsive properties. The review concludes by comparing AMMs to biological molecular machines, offering insights into future directions. This overview underscores the impact of radical chemistry on molecular assembly and its promising applications in both synthetic and biological systems.

         <title>Materials Advances in Photocatalytic Solar Hydrogen Production: Integrating Systems and Economics for a Sustainable Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic solar hydrogen generation, including both overall water splitting and organic reforming, presents a promising route for green hydrogen production. To advance the commercialization of this technology, this review offers an integrated, multidisciplinary perspective on photocatalyst and system designs aimed at enhancing solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency, while also considering cost and scalability factors.








Abstract
Photocatalytic solar hydrogen generation, encompassing both overall water splitting and organic reforming, presents a promising avenue for green hydrogen production. This technology holds the potential for reduced capital costs in comparison to competing methods like photovoltaic&#8208;electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, owing to its simplicity and fewer auxiliary components. However, the current solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of photocatalytic solar hydrogen production has predominantly remained low at &#8776;1&#8211;2% or lower, mainly due to curtailed access to the entire solar spectrum, thus impeding practical application of photocatalytic solar hydrogen production. This review offers an integrated, multidisciplinary perspective on photocatalytic solar hydrogen production. Specifically, the review presents the existing approaches in photocatalyst and system designs aimed at significantly boosting the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency, while also considering factors of cost and scalability of each approach. In&#8208;depth discussions extending beyond the efficacy of material and system design strategies are particularly vital to identify potential hurdles in translating photocatalysis research to large&#8208;scale applications. Ultimately, this review aims to provide understanding and perspective of feasible pathways for commercializing photocatalytic solar hydrogen production technology, considering both engineering and economic standpoints.

         <title>Unlocking Efficiency: Minimizing Energy Loss in Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oversight of catalyst energy consumption in water electrolysis stems from intricate catalyst&#8208;microstructure relationships, electrolyte interactions, and electrode resistance. Strategies to address this include enhancing mass exchange, facilitating charge transfer among catalyst particles, and utilizing low&#8208;resistance current collectors. These insights prompt the potential application of hierarchically structured electrodes to mitigate energy usage in electrolysis.








Abstract
Catalysts play a crucial role in water electrolysis by reducing the energy barriers for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Research aims to enhance the intrinsic activities of potential catalysts through material selection, microstructure design, and various engineering techniques. However, the energy consumption of catalysts has often been overlooked due to the intricate interplay among catalyst microstructure, dimensionality, catalyst&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;gas dynamics, surface chemistry, electron transport within electrodes, and electron transfer among electrode components. Efficient catalyst development for high&#8208;current&#8208;density applications is essential to meet the increasing demand for green hydrogen. This involves transforming catalysts with high intrinsic activities into electrodes capable of sustaining high current densities. This review focuses on current improvement strategies of mass exchange, charge transfer, and reducing electrode resistance to decrease energy consumption. It aims to bridge the gap between laboratory&#8208;developed, highly efficient catalysts and industrial applications regarding catalyst structural design, surface chemistry, and catalyst&#8208;electrode interplay, outlining the development roadmap of hierarchically structured electrode&#8208;based water electrolysis for minimizing energy loss in electrocatalysts for water splitting.

         <title>Recent Advances on Carbon&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Energy and Chemical Conversions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively examines the latest advancements in carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts for applications in energy, chemical conversions, and environmental remediation. It highlights the related carbon materials, innovative design strategies, and theoretical studies, along with current challenges and forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the future directions of this rapidly evolving research field.








Abstract
Over the last decade, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts (C&#8208;MFECs) have become important in electrocatalysis. This field is started thanks to the initial discovery that nitrogen atom doped carbon can function as a metal&#8208;free electrode in alkaline fuel cells. A wide variety of metal&#8208;free carbon nanomaterials, including 0D carbon dots, 1D carbon nanotubes, 2D graphene, and 3D porous carbons, has demonstrated high electrocatalytic performance across a variety of applications. These include clean energy generation and storage, green chemistry, and environmental remediation. The wide applicability of C&#8208;MFECs is facilitated by effective synthetic approaches, e.g., heteroatom doping, and physical/chemical modification. These methods enable the creation of catalysts with electrocatalytic properties useful for sustainable energy transformation and storage (e.g., fuel cells, Zn&#8208;air batteries, Li&#8208;O2 batteries, dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells), green chemical production (e.g., H2O2, NH3, and urea), and environmental remediation (e.g., wastewater treatment, and CO2 conversion). Furthermore, significant advances in the theoretical study of C&#8208;MFECs via advanced computational modeling and machine learning techniques have been achieved, revealing the charge transfer mechanism for rational design and development of highly efficient catalysts. This review offers a timely overview of recent progress in the development of C&#8208;MFECs, addressing material syntheses, theoretical advances, potential applications, challenges and future directions.

Abstract
Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions are common in chemical processes presented in diverse applications, such as synthesis, catalysis, batteries, semiconductors, and solar cells. The Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions allow precise tuning of material properties from the molecular level to more aggregated and organized structures. This review will focus on the origin, development, and prospects of applying Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for the materials design and mechanism understanding in the advancement of battery materials and chemistries. The covered topics relate to aqueous batteries, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state batteries, alkali metal&#8208;sulfur batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;oxygen batteries. In this review, the Lewis acid&#8208;base theories will be first introduced. Thereafter the application strategies for Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions in solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;based batteries will be introduced from the aspects of liquid electrolyte, solid polymer electrolyte, metal anodes, and high&#8208;capacity cathodes. The underlying mechanism is highlighted in regard to ion transport, electrochemical stability, mechanical property, reaction kinetics, dendrite growth, corrosion, and so on. Last but not least, perspectives on the future directions related to Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for next&#8208;generation batteries are like to be shared.

         <title>State of Play of Critical Mineral&#8208;Based Catalysts for Electrochemical E&#8208;Refinery to Synthetic Fuels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 42, October 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the clean energy transition accelerates, the demand for critical minerals is expected to increase significantly. However, supply vulnerabilities and sustainability concerns remain significant issues. This review outlines strategies to reduce critical minerals use in electrocatalysis for CO2 reduction to C2+ and C&#8211;N products, focusing on design enhancements to active sites and mass activity to maintain high performance while reducing dependency on scarce resources.








Abstract
The pursuit of decarbonization involves leveraging waste CO2 for the production of valuable fuels and chemicals (e.g., ethanol, ethylene, and urea) through the electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The efficacy of this process heavily depends on electrocatalyst performance, which is generally reliant on high loading of critical minerals. However, the supply of these minerals is susceptible to shortage and disruption, prompting concerns regarding their usage, particularly in electrocatalysis, requiring swift innovations to mitigate the supply risks. The reliance on critical minerals in catalyst fabrication can be reduced by implementing design strategies that improve the available active sites, thereby increasing the mass activity. This review seeks to discuss and analyze potential strategies, challenges, and opportunities for improving catalyst activity in CO2RR with a special attention to addressing the risks associated with critical mineral scarcity. By shedding light onto these aspects of critical mineral&#8208;based catalyst systems, this review aims to inspire the development of high&#8208;performance catalysts and facilitates the practical application of CO2RR technology, whilst mitigating adverse economic, environmental, and community impacts.

Schematic illustration of the periodic single&#8208;metal site catalysts (PSMSCs) with the atomically dispersed and uniform structure of metal sites, exhibiting enhanced activity, optimized selectivity, mechanism exploration ability, predictable reactivity, and intricate reaction suitability.








Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts (SMSCs), often referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), demonstrate promising catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability across a wide spectrum of reactions due to their rationally designed microenvironments encompassing coordination geometry, binding ligands, and electronic configurations. However, the inherent disorderliness of SMSCs at both atomic scale and nanoscale poses challenges in deciphering working principles and establishing the correlations between microenvironments and the catalytic performances of SMSCs. The rearrangement of randomly dispersed single metals into homogeneous and atomic&#8208;precisely structured periodic single&#8208;metal site catalysts (PSMSCs) not only simplifies the chaos in SMSCs systems but also unveils new opportunities for manipulating catalytic performance and gaining profound insights into reaction mechanisms. Moreover, the synergistic effects of adjacent single metals and the integration effects of periodic single&#8208;metal arrangement further broaden the industrial application scope of SMSCs. This perspective offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements and outlines prospective avenues for research in the design and characterizations of PSMSCs, while also acknowledging the formidable challenges encountered and the promising prospects that lie ahead.

         <title>Autonomous Atmospheric Water Harvesting over a Wide RH Range Enabled by Super Hygroscopic Composite Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium alginate/carbon nanotubes/magnesium complexes&#160;(SA/CNTs/MC) composite aerogel is developed with high water uptake and rapid water vapor absorption/desorption kinetics.&#160;A fully solar&#8208;driven autonomous atmospheric water generator is designed and constructed with two SA/CNTs/MC&#8208;based absorption layers, which can alternately conduct the water absorption/desorption process without any other energy consumption.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) offers a sustainable strategy to address the global freshwater shortage. However, obtaining sorbents with excellent performance over a wide relative humidity (RH) range and devices with fully autonomous water production remains challenging. Herein, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is innovatively converted into super hygroscopic magnesium complexes(MC), which can effectively solve the problems of salt deliquescence and agglomeration. The MC are then integrated with photothermal aerogels composed of sodium alginate and carbon nanotubes (SA/CNTs) to form composite aerogels, which showed high water uptake over a wide RH range, reaching 5.43 and 0.27&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 at 95% and 20% RH, respectively. The hierarchical porous structure enables the as&#8208;prepared SA/CNTs/MC to exhibit rapid absorption/desorption kinetics with 12 cycles per day at 70% RH, equivalent to a water yield of 10.0 L kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1. To further realize continuous and practical freshwater production, a fully solar&#8208;driven autonomous atmospheric water generator is designed and constructed with two SA/CNTs/MC&#8208;based absorption layers, which can alternately conduct the water absorption/desorption process without any other energy consumption. The design provides a promising approach to achieving autonomous, high&#8208;performance, and scalable SAWH.

         <title>Bioinspired Capillary Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric re&#8208;entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are 3D printed to promote the unidirectional capillary rise, whose capillary heights have approached the theoretical limits. Capillary transistors based on asymmetric and symmetric re&#8208;entrant structures are proposed to provide a new strategy for microfluidic devices in 3D space.








Abstract
Inspired by the unidirectional liquid spreading on Nepenthes peristome, Araucaria leaf, butterfly wings, etc., various microfluidic devices have been developed for water collection, irrigation, physical/chemical reaction, and oil&#8211;water separation. Despite extensive progress, most natural and artificial structures fail to enhance the Laplace pressure difference or capillary force, thus suffering from a low unidirectional capillary height (&lt;30&#160;mm). In this work, asymmetric re&#8208;entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are fabricated by 3D printing, resulting in a significantly increased unidirectional capillary height of 102.3&#160;mm for water, which approximately corresponds to the theoretical limit. The overhangs can partially overlap the forward microchannels of the front structures without direct contact, thus enhancing the Laplace pressure difference and capillary force simultaneously. Based on asymmetric and symmetric re&#8208;entrant structures, capillary transistors are proposed and realized to programmably adjust the capillary direction, height, and width, which are envisioned to function as switches/valves and amplifiers/attenuators for highly efficient liquid patterning, desalination, and biochemical microreaction in 3D space.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the unidirectional liquid spreading on &lt;i&gt;Nepenthes&lt;/i&gt; peristome, &lt;i&gt;Araucaria&lt;/i&gt; leaf, butterfly wings, etc., various microfluidic devices have been developed for water collection, irrigation, physical/chemical reaction, and oil&#8211;water separation. Despite extensive progress, most natural and artificial structures fail to enhance the Laplace pressure difference or capillary force, thus suffering from a low unidirectional capillary height (&amp;lt;30&#160;mm). In this work, asymmetric re-entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are fabricated by 3D printing, resulting in a significantly increased unidirectional capillary height of 102.3&#160;mm for water, which approximately corresponds to the theoretical limit. The overhangs can partially overlap the forward microchannels of the front structures without direct contact, thus enhancing the Laplace pressure difference and capillary force simultaneously. Based on asymmetric and symmetric re-entrant structures, capillary transistors are proposed and realized to programmably adjust the capillary direction, height, and width, which are envisioned to function as switches/valves and amplifiers/attenuators for highly efficient liquid patterning, desalination, and biochemical microreaction in 3D space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biointerface&#8208;Engineered Hybrid Nanovesicles for Targeted Reprogramming of Tumor Microenvironment</title>

         <dc:description>
A nanoplatform combining M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified liposomes is developed, as P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs, exhibiting enhanced cargo&#8208;loading capability and stability. P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs can effectively facilitate oxygen and photosensitizer delivery, achieving in situ engineering of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and alleviation of tumor hypoxia. This approach reprograms tumor microenvironment and suppresses tumor growth, demonstrating a promising strategy for antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) of typical tumor types such as triple&#8208;negative breast cancer is featured by hypoxia and immunosuppression with abundant tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), which also emerge as potential therapeutic targets for antitumor therapy. M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes (M1&#8208;Exos) have emerged as a promising tumor therapeutic candidate for their tumor&#8208;targeting and macrophage&#8208;polarization capabilities. However, the limited drug&#8208;loading efficiency and stability of M1&#8208;Exos have hindered their effectiveness in antitumor applications. Here, a hybrid nanovesicle is developed by integrating M1&#8208;Exos with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;conjugated liposomes (AApt&#8208;Lips), termed M1E/AALs. The obtained M1E/AALs are loaded with&#160;perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA)&#160;and IR780, as P&#8208;I, to construct P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs for reprogramming TME by alleviating tumor hypoxia and engineering TAMs. P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL&#8208;mediated tumor therapy enhances the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species, repolarizes TAMs toward an antitumor phenotype, and promotes the infiltration of T lymphocytes. The synergistic antitumor therapy based on P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs significantly suppresses tumor growth and prolongs the survival of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. By integrating multiple treatment modalities, P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL nanoplatform demonstrates a promising therapeutic approach for overcoming hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME by targeted TAM reprogramming and enhanced tumor photodynamic immunotherapy. This study highlights an innovative TAM&#8208;engineering hybrid nanovesicle platform for the treatment of tumors characterized by hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wide Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells With Tunneling Junction by Self&#8208;Assembled 2D Dielectric Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembled 2D perovskite layer (BA&#8322;PbBr&#8324;) is engineered as a tunneling layer to mitigate the band alignment mismatch between SnO&#8322; and wide bandgap perovskite layers. This approach significantly enhanced the open&#8208;circuit voltage, achieving values of 1.30 and 1.33&#160;V, and resulted in power conversion efficiencies of 21.54% and 19.16% for bandgaps of 1.7 and 1.8 eV, respectively.








Abstract
Reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and addressing band alignment mismatches at interfaces remain major challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. This study proposes the self&#8208;organization of a thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite BA2PbBr4 layer beneath a wide&#8208;bandgap three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, forming a 2D/3D bilayer structure on a tin oxide (SnO2) layer. This process is driven by interactions between the oxygen vacancies on the SnO2 surface and hydrogen atoms of the n&#8208;butylammonium cation, aiding the self&#8208;assembly of the BA2PbBr4 2D layer. The 2D perovskite acts as a tunneling layer between SnO2 and the 3D perovskite, neutralizing the energy level mismatch and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. This results in high power conversion efficiencies of 21.54% and 19.16% for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with bandgaps of 1.7 and 1.8 eV, with open&#8208;circuit voltages over 1.3 V under 1&#8208;Sun illumination. Furthermore, an impressive efficiency of over 43% is achieved under indoor conditions, specifically under 200 lux white light&#8208;emitting diode light, yielding an output voltage exceeding 1 V. The device also demonstrates enhanced stability, lasting up to 1,200 hours.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Enzymatic Microgels for Precise Hydrogel Sculpturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;enzymatic microgels, consisting of collagenase and magnetic nanoparticles, are used to sculpt internal channels within biomimetic hydrogels through the synergy of enzymatic degradation and remote magnetic guidance. This approach enhances cell viability by optimizing nutrient and oxygen distribution beyond conventional methods. Wireless control enables intricate hydrogel topographies, advancing vascularization and targeted drug delivery, marking a notable achievement in biofabrication.








Abstract
The inclusion of hollow channels in tissue&#8208;engineered hydrogels is crucial for mimicking the natural physiological conditions and facilitating the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Although bio&#8208;fabrication techniques provide diverse strategies to create these channels, many require sophisticated equipment and time&#8208;consuming protocols. Herein, collagenase, a degrading agent for methacrylated gelatin hydrogels, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are combined and processed into enzymatically active spherical structures using a straightforward oil bath emulsion methodology. The generated microgels are then used to microfabricate channels within biomimetic hydrogels via a novel sculpturing approach that relied on the precise coupling of protein&#8208;enzyme pairs (for controlled local degradation) and magnetic actuation (for directional control). Results show that the sculpting velocity can be tailored by adjusting the magnetic field intensity or concentration of MNPs within the microgels. Additionally, varying the magnetic field position or microgel size generated diverse trajectories and channels of different widths. This innovative technology improves the viability of encapsulated cells through enhanced medium transport, outperforming non&#8208;sculpted hydrogels and offering new perspectives for hydrogel vascularization and drug/biomolecule administration. Ultimately, this novel concept can help design fully controlled channels in hydrogels or soft materials, even those with complex tortuosity, in a single wireless top&#8208;down biocompatible step.

         <title>Ionizable Drugs Enable Intracellular Delivery of Co&#8208;Formulated siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of small molecule drugs and ribonucleic acids (RNA) in the same nanocarrier can unlock the benefits of combination therapies, but current formulation strategies are typically limited by low drug loading. Here, ionizable analogs of a colloid&#8208;forming drug, fulvestrant, are used to formulate high&#8208;content nanoparticles that encapsulate small interfering RNA (siRNA). This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrates effective siRNA delivery by ionizable drugs.








Abstract
Targeting complementary pathways in diseases such as cancer can be achieved with co&#8208;delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) and small molecule drugs; however, current formulation strategies are typically limited to one, but not both. Here, ionizable small molecule drugs and siRNA are co&#8208;formulated&#160;in drug&#8208;rich nanoparticles. Ionizable analogs of the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant self&#8208;assemble into colloidal drug aggregates and cause endosomal disruption, allowing co&#8208;delivery of siRNA against a non&#8208;druggable target. siRNA is encapsulated in lipid&#8208;stabilized, drug&#8208;rich colloidal nanoparticles where the ionizable lipid used in conventional lipid nanoparticles is replaced with an ionizable fulvestrant analog. The selection of an appropriate phospholipid and formulation buffer enables endocytosis and potent reporter gene knockdown in cancer cells. Importantly, siRNA targeting cyclin E1 is effectively delivered to drug&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells, demonstrating the utility of this approach. This strategy opens the possibility of using ionizable drugs to co&#8208;deliver RNA and ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes.

This strategy opens the possibility of using ionizable drugs to co-deliver RNA and ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnetic Polarization by Charge Localization in a Chiral Supramolecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect is a fascinating phenomenon that correlates the molecular structure with electron spin&#8208;polarization. In this work, chiral crystals of imide&#8208;substituted coronene bisimide ((S)&#8208;CBI&#8208;GCH) are studied to show that current flows dynamically, controlled by the voltage sweep rate. This observation is crucial for redox group molecules, and sheds light on the possible origin of spin&#8208;polarization in chiral molecules. 








Abstract
The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is a fascinating phenomenon that correlates the molecular structure with electron spin&#8208;polarization (SP). Experimental procedures to quantify the spin&#8208;filtering magnitude have extensively used magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent conductive AFM. In this work chiral crystals of imide&#8208;substituted coronene bisimide ((S)&#8208;CBI&#8208;GCH) are studied to explain the dynamics of the current&#8211;voltage I &#8722; V spectra and the origin of superimposed peaks are investigated. A dynamic voltage&#8208;sweep rate&#8208;dependent phenomenon can give rise to complex I &#8722; V curves. The redox group, capable of localization of charge, acts as a localized state that interferes with the continuum of the &#960; &#8211; &#960; stacking, giving rise to Fano resonances. A novel mechanism for dynamic transport is introduced, which provides insight into the origin of spin&#8208;polarized charge in crystallized CBI&#8208;GCH molecules after absorption on a metallic substrate, guided by transient charge polarization. Crucially, interference between charge localization and delocalization during transport may be important properties in understanding the magnetochiral phenomena observed by electrostatic force microscopy. Finally, it is observed that charge trapping sensitively modifies the injection barrier from direct tunneling to Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling transport supporting nonlinearity in CISS for this class of molecules.

         <title>Programmable Chemical Reactions Enable Ultrastrong Soft Pneumatic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating thermoelectric materials and preprogramming strategy into the management of reversible reactions, an soft pneumatic actuation is realized with high regulation, high pressure, and the ability to transport gas over long distances. The soft pneumatic actuation is successfully applying the programmable chemical reactions to soft assistive wearables, haptic devices, and lifting a sightseeing car.








Abstract
Soft pneumatic actuation is widely used in wearable devices, soft robots, artificial muscles, and surgery machines. However, generating high&#8208;pressure gases in a soft, controllable, and portable way remains a substantial challenge. Here, a class of programmable chemical reactions that can be used to controllably generate gases with a maximum pressure output of nearly 6&#160;MPa is reported. It is proposed to realize the programmability of the chemical reaction process using thermoelectric material with programmable electric current and employing preprogrammed reversible chemical reactants. The programmable chemical reactions as soft pneumatic actuation can be operated independently as miniature gas sources (&#8764;20&#8211;100&#160;g) or combined with arbitrary physical structures to make self&#8208;contained machines, capable of generating unprecedented pressures of nearly 6&#160;MPa or forces of about 18&#160;kN in a controllable, portable, and silent manner. Striking demonstrations of breaking a brick, a marble, and concrete blocks, raising a sightseeing car, and successful applications in artificial muscles and soft assistive wearables illustrate tremendous application prospects of soft pneumatic actuation via programmable chemical reactions. The study establishes a new paradigm toward ultrastrong soft pneumatic actuation.

         <title>Exciton Dissociation and Recombination Afford Narrowband Organic Afterglow Through Efficient FRET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent fluorophores in a steroid&#8208;type host capable of exciton dissociation and recombination. Through efficient FRET, the LPL exhibits a small full&#8208;width at a half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm, persistent time exceeding 10&#160;s, and tunable color among 414&#8211;600&#160;nm.








Abstract
Organic afterglow with long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) after photoexcitation is highly attractive, but the realization of narrowband afterglow with small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) is a huge challenge since it is intrinsically contradictory to the triplet&#8208; and solid&#8208;state emission nature of organic afterglow. Here, narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic LPL is realized by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) fluorophores in a glassy steroid&#8208;type host through a facile melt&#8208;cooling treatment. Such prepared host becomes capable of exciton dissociation and recombination (EDR) upon photoirradiation for both long&#8208;lived fluorescence and phosphorescence; and, the efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the host to various MR&#8208;TADF emitters leads to high&#8208;performance LPL, exhibiting small FWHM of 33&#160;nm, long persistent time over 10&#160;s, and facile color&#8208;tuning in a wide range from deep&#8208;blue to orange (414&#8211;600&#160;nm). Moreover, with the extraordinary narrowband LPL and easy processability of the material, centimeter&#8208;scale flexible optical waveguide fibers and integrated FWHM/color/lifetime&#8208;resolved multilevel encryption/decryption devices have been designed and fabricated. This novel EDR and singlet/triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet FRET strategy to achieve excellent LPL performances illustrates a promising way for constructing flexible organic afterglow with easy preparation methods, shedding valuable scientific insights into the design of narrow&#8208;band emission in organic afterglow.

         <title>Multicompartment Polyion Complex Micelles Based on Triblock Polypept(o)ides Mediate Efficient siRNA Delivery to Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts for Antistromal Therapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a novel identified target of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5), ABC&#8208;triblock copolymer&#8208;based multicompartment polyion complex micelle delivers siRNA against MFAP&#8208;5 (siMFAP&#8208;5) and the cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine simultaneously. The codelivery of DES facilitates intracellular siRNA delivery, resulting in a knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and significantly reduced&#160;tumor burden in a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma.








Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent type of primary liver cancer and the third leading cause for cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. The tumor is difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat due to its inherent resistance to chemotherapy. Antistromal therapy is a novel therapeutic approach, targeting cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the tumor microenvironment. CAF&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5) is identified as a novel target for antistromal therapy of HCC with high translational relevance. Biocompatible polypept(o)ide&#8208;based polyion complex micelles (PICMs) constructed with a triblock copolymer composed of a cationic poly(l&#8208;lysine) complexing anti&#8208;MFAP&#8208;5 siRNA (siMFAP&#8208;5) via electrostatic interaction, a poly(&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate) block loading cationic amphiphilic drug desloratatine (DES) via &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#160;interaction as endosomal escape enhancer and polysarcosine poly(N&#8208;methylglycine) for introducing stealth properties, are generated for siRNA delivery. Intravenous injection of siMFAP&#8208;5/DES PICMs significantly reduces the hepatic tumor burden in a syngeneic implantation model of HCC, with a superior MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown effect over siMFAP&#8208;5 PICMs or lipid nanoparticles. Transcriptome and histological analysis reveal that MFAP&#8208;5 knockdown inhibited CAF&#8208;related tumor vascularization, suggesting the anti&#8208;angiogenic effect of RNA interference therapy. In conclusion, multicompartment PICMs combining siMFAP&#8208;5 and DES in a single polypept(o)ide micelle induce a specific knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and demonstrate a potent antitumor efficacy (80% reduced tumor burden vs untreated control) in a clinically relevant HCC model.

In conclusion, multicompartment PICMs combining siMFAP-5 and DES in a single polypept(o)ide micelle induce a specific knockdown of MFAP-5 and demonstrate a potent antitumor efficacy (80% reduced tumor burden vs untreated control) in a clinically relevant HCC model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Single Au Atoms Loaded Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ strategy with pre&#8208;metallated monomers is employed to achieve a new porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;164) with Au single atoms loading up to a record high 45.3 wt.%. The serial PAF supported Au single atoms catalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising in heterogeneous catalysis because of their atom economy, unusual transformations, and mechanistic clarity. The metal SAs loading, however, limits the catalytic efficiency. Herein, an in situ pre&#8208;metallated monomer&#8208;based preparation strategy is shown to achieve ultrahigh Au SAs loading in catalyst formations. The polymerization of single&#8208;atom loaded monomers yield a new porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;164) with Au SAs loading up to a record high 45.3 wt.%. SACs of Au&#8208;PAFs exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity in hydrogen (H2) evolution, and the H2 evolution rate of Au100%&#8208;SAs&#8208;PAF&#8208;164 can reach 4.82&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with great recyclability.

         <title>Operando Colorations from Real&#8208;Time Growth of 3D&#8208;Printed Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering that most colors fade with time, this work develops an additive approach to diversify colors over time. This color enrichment is realized by operando observation and measurement of the real&#8208;time growth of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures during 3D nanoprinting. The dimensions and geometries of these growing nanoarchitectures change in real time, thereby generating a magnificent library of time&#8208;varying colors.








Abstract
While artificial 3D nanostructures can generate precise and flexible coloration, their real&#8208;time color changes during 3D nanoprinting remain unexplored owing&#160;to the inherent challenges of in situ transient measurements and observations. In this study, a 3D&#8208;printing system which supports the operando observation/measurement of the color dynamics of subwavelength metallic nanoarchitectures fabricated in real time is developed and evaluated. During 3D printing, the dimensions and geometries of the 3D nanostructures grow over time, producing a large library of optical spectra associated with real&#8208;time color changes. Only a timer is needed to define the expected colors from a single 3D print run. Fin&#8208;like nanostructures are used to toggle colors based on the polarization effect and produce color gradients. Based on structural coloration, nanoarchitectures are designed and printed to animate desired color patterns. Moreover, the resulting color dynamics can also serve as an operando identifier for real&#8208;time structural information during 3D nanoprinting. A single print run enables the efficient creation of a comprehensive library of desired colorations owing to the flexibility in time&#8208;dependent controllability and 3D geometries at the subwavelength scale. 3D nanoprinted plasmonic structures exhibiting time&#8208;varying colorations (4D printing of colors) uniquely redefines the coloring stategy,&#160;offering considerable potential for numerous&#160;applications.

         <title>Ternary Logic Circuit and Neural Network Integration via Small Molecule&#8208;Based Antiambipolar Vertical Electrochemical Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiambipolar behavior is observed in a small molecule&#8208;based vertical organic electrochemical transistor with a current density &gt; 30&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and low driving voltage (0.6&#160;V). Consequently, a vertically stacked ternary inverter (VSTI) is fabricated with three distinguishable logic states, along with the demonstration for image recognition tasks based on ternary neural networks with such VSTI array.








Abstract
Circuits based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have great potential in the fields of biosensors and artificial neural computation due to their biocompatibility and neural similarity. However, the integration of OECT&#8208;based circuits lags far behind other emerging electronics. Here, ternary inverters based on antiambipolar vertical OECTs (vOECTs) and their integration with the establishment of neural networks are demonstrated. Specifically, by adopting a small molecule (t&#8208;gdiPDI) as the channel of vOECT, high antiambipolar performance, with current density&#160;of 33.9&#160;&#177;&#160;2.1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 under drain voltage of 0.1&#160;V, peak voltage &#8776;0&#160;V, low driving voltage &lt; &#177; 0.6&#160;V, and current on/off ratio&#160;&gt;&#160;106, are realized. Consequently, vertically stacked ternary circuits based solely on OECTs are constructed for the first time, showing three distinct logical states and high integration density. By further developing inverter array as the internal fundamental units of ternary weight network hardware circuits for ternary processing and computation, it demonstrates excellent data classification and recognition capabilities. This work demonstrates the possibility of constructing multi&#8208;valued logic circuits by OECTs and promotes a new strategy for high&#8208;density integration and multivalued computing systems based on organic circuits.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Au&#8208;Pt Bimetallic Aerogels for Catalyzing the Glucose Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work leverages the structural versatility of aerogels to regulate the Au&#8211;Pt bimetallic system into three representative structures, including segregated, alloy, and core&#8211;shell configurations and investigates the structure&#8211;activity relationship toward glucose cascade catalysis. Among them, the Au&#8211;Pt segregated structure exhibits the optimal enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic performances, which is ascribed to the synergistic effect and abundant grain boundaries.








Abstract
Bimetallic nanostructures are promising candidates for the development of enzyme&#8208;mimics, yet the deciphering of the structural impact on their catalytic properties poses significant challenges. By leveraging the structural versatility of nanocrystal aerogels, this study reports a precise control of Au&#8211;Pt bimetallic structures in three representative structural configurations, including segregated, alloy, and core&#8211;shell structures. Benefiting from a synergistic effect, these bimetallic aerogels demonstrate improved peroxidase&#8208; and glucose oxidase&#8208;like catalytic performances compared to their monometallic counterparts, unleashing tremendous potential in catalyzing the glucose cascade reaction. Notably, the segregated Au&#8211;Pt aerogel shows optimal catalytic activity, which is 2.80 and 3.35 times higher than that of the alloy and core&#8211;shell variants, respectively. This enhanced activity is attributed to the high&#8208;density Au&#8211;Pt interface boundaries within the segregated structure, which foster greater substrate affinity and superior catalytic efficiency. This work not only sheds light on the structure&#8211;property relationship of bimetallic catalysts but also broadens the application scope of aerogels in biosensing and biological detections.

         <title>Asymmetric Wettability Hydrogel Surfaces for Enduring Electromyographic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversal wettability inducing strategy based on hydrophobic interaction is proposed to integrally synthesize Janus hydrogel without affecting the mechanical elasticity and electrical properties. This interfacial engineering successfully realizes the optional inducing on the hydrogel surfaces. A combination of asymmetric wettability surfaces, excellent elasticity, and compatible conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with a high&#8208;fidelity EMG signal in a perspiration environment.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrode interfaces have shown tremendous promise in the acquisition of surface electromyography (EMG) signals. However, the perspiration or moisture environments will trigger the deadhesion between hydrogel electrodes and human skin. Despite the hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces can perform the anti&#8208;moisture or adhesion respectively, it remains a challenge to integrally form a Janus hydrogel with homogeneous mechanical elasticity and electronic performance. Herein, a surface induction strategy is proposed to approach the hydrophobic/hydrophilic hydrogel surfaces. The hydrophobic interaction between surfactants and molds regulates the distribution of hydrophobic/hydrophilic monomers on the surface. The hydrophobic molds induce a hydrophilic hydrogel surface, while the hydrophilic molds induce a hydrophobic surface. It presents a new phenomenon of reversal wettability inducing and optional hydrogel surfaces. The integral Janus hydrogel can be easily obtained by the hydrophilic molds. Balance of adhesion, elasticity, and conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with durable conformal adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity EMG signals even in the sweaty epidermis due to the asymmetric wettability surfaces. This hydrogel performs the quantitative description of muscle strength and accurate fatigue assessment. It offers a reliable candidate for future practical applications in continuous digital healthcare and intelligent human&#8211;machine interaction, even the Metaverse.

         <title>Human Circulatory/Respiratory&#8208;Inspired Comprehensive Air Purification System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulatory/respiratory&#8208;inspired air purification system (CAPS) is reported, a novel bioinspired approach that integrates microbubble&#8208;based gas exchange and circulating liquid (water) mechanisms akin to alveoli, capillary beds, and the bloodstream. By incorporating waste removal, CAPS ensures continuous particulate matter removal and gas exchange between indoor and outdoor spaces, with the potential for networked integration across various internal and external environments.








Abstract
The circulatory and respiratory systems in humans are marvels of biological engineering that exhibit competence in maintaining homeostasis. These systems not only shield the organism from external contaminants but also orchestrate the vital gases via the bloodstream to sustain cellular respiration and metabolic processes across diverse tissues. It is noticed that spaces inhabited encounter challenges akin to those of the human body: protecting the indoor air from external pollutants while removing anthropogenic byproducts like carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matters (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tooutside. A biomimetic approach, composed of a microbubble&#8208;based gas exchanger and circulating liquid inspired by alveoli, capillary beds, and bloodstream of the human circulatory/respiratory system, offer an innovative solution for comprehensive air purification of hermetic spaces. Circulatory/respiratory&#8208;inspired air purification system (CAPS) ensure both continuous removal of PM and exchange of gas species between indoor and outdoor environments to maintain homeostasis. The effectiveness of this system is also supported by animal behavior experiments with and without CAPS, showing an effect of reducing CO2 concentration by 30% and increasing mice locomotor activity by 53%. CAPS is expected to evolve into robust and comprehensive air purification schemes through the networked integration of plural internal and external environments.

         <title>Proximal High&#8208;Index Metamaterials based on a Superlattice of Gold Nanohexagons Targeting the Near&#8208;Infrared Band</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic gold nanohexagons (AuNHs) assembled into a planar superlattice serve as optical metamaterials for precise refractive index (RI) control. With controlled gap proximities in an edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge manner, they exhibit unprecedented optical properties in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band, achieving an RI of 10.04 at &#955; = 1.5 &#181;m. The RI tunability is shown by varying nanometer&#8208;scale gaps, promising significant optical advancements.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles can be assembled into a superlattice, to form optical metamaterials, particularly targeting precise control of optical properties such as refractive index (RI). The superlattices exhibit enhanced near&#8208;field, given the sufficiently narrow gap between nanoparticles supporting multiple plasmonic resonance modes only realized in proximal environments. Herein, the planar superlattice of plasmonic Au nanohexagons (AuNHs) with precisely controlled geometries such as size, shape, and edge&#8208;gaps is reported. The proximal AuNHs superlattice realized over a large area with selective edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembly exhibited the highest&#8208;ever&#8208;recorded RI values in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band, surpassing the upper limit of the RI of the natural intrinsic materials (up to 10.04 at &#955; = 1.5&#160;&#181;m). The exceptionally enhanced RI is derived from intensified in&#8208;plane surface plasmon coupling across the superlattices. Precise control of the edge&#8208;gap of neighboring AuNHs systematically tuned the RI as confirmed by numerical analysis based on the plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, a 1D photonic crystal, composed of alternating layers of AuNHs superlattices and low&#8208;index polymers, is constructed to enhance the selectivity of the reflectivity operating in the NIR band. It is expected that the proximal AuNHs superlattices can be used as new optical metamaterials that can be extended to the NIR range.

         <title>A High Capacity Gas Diffusion Electrode for Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous positive electrode. Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode with a polymer that can transport O2, it is possible to reach energy densities that significantly exceed Li&#8208;ion batteries and previously reported Li&#8211;O2 cells.








Abstract
The very high theoretical specific energy of the lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;O2) battery (3500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) compared with other batteries makes it potentially attractive, especially for the electrification of flight. While progress has been made in realizing the Li&#8211;air battery, several challenges remain. One such challenge is achieving a high capacity to store charge at the positive electrode at practical current densities, without which Li&#8211;air batteries will not outperform lithium&#8208;ion. The capacity is limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous carbon positive electrode. Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode by a polymer with the intrinsic ability to transport O2, it is possible to reach capacities as high as 31 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a 300&#160;&#181;m thick electrode. This corresponds to a positive electrode energy density of 2650&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and specific energy of 1716&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, exceeding significantly Li&#8208;ion batteries and previously reported Li&#8211;O2 cells. Due to the enhanced oxygen diffusion imparted by the gas diffusion polymer, Li2O2 (the product of O2 reduction on discharge) fills a greater volume fraction of the electrode and is more homogeneously distributed.

         <title>In Situ&#8208;Constructed Multifunctional Composite Anode with Ultralong&#8208;Life Toward Advanced Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional Li/SnS2 composite anode is rationally designed through an in situ melt&#8208;infusion approach utilizing SnS2 as &#8216;solute&#8217; and molten lithium as the &#8216;solvent&#8217;. The 3D porous Li2S/Li22Sn5 framework possesses a&#160;low Li+ diffusion barrier, high electronic conductivity, and&#160;Li&#8208;clusters decomposition capability, thus effectively eliminating the growth of dendrite and enabling ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan, especially at high rates.








Abstract
Metallic lithium is the most competitive anode material for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, the extensive volume expansion and uncontrolled Li dendrite growth of lithium metal not only cause potential safety hazards but also lead to low Coulombic efficiency and inferior cycling lifespan for Li metal batteries. Herein, a multifunctional dendrite&#8208;free composite anode (Li/SnS2) is proposed through an in situ melt&#8208;infusion strategy. In this configuration, the 3D cross&#8208;linked porous Li2S/Li22Sn5 framework facilitates the rapid penetration of electrolytes and accommodates the volume expansion during the repeated Li&#8722;plating process. Meanwhile, the lithiophilic Li2S phases with a low Li+ transport barrier ensure preferential Li deposition, effectively avoiding uneven electron distribution. Moreover, the Li22Sn5 electron conductors with appropriate Li+ bonding ability guarantee rapid charge transport and mass transfer. Most importantly, the steady multifunctional skeleton with sufficient inner interfaces (Li2S/Li22Sn5) in the whole electrode, not only realizes the redistribution of the localized free electron, contributing to the decomposition of Li clusters, but also induces a planar deposition model, thus restraining the generation of Li dendrites. Consequently, an unprecedented cyclability of over 6&#160;500&#160;h under an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a current rate of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved for the prepared Li2S/Li22Sn5 composite anode. Moreover, the assembled Li/SnS2||LiFePO4 (LFP) pouch full&#8208;cells also demonstrate remarkable rate capability and a convincing cycling lifespan of more than 2&#160;000 cycles at 2 C.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional Li/SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composite anode is rationally designed through an in situ melt-infusion approach utilizing SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as &#8216;solute&#8217; and molten lithium as the &#8216;solvent&#8217;. The 3D porous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Li&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; framework possesses a&#160;low Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion barrier, high electronic conductivity, and&#160;Li-clusters decomposition capability, thus effectively eliminating the growth of dendrite and enabling ultra-long cycling lifespan, especially at high rates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallic lithium is the most competitive anode material for next-generation high-energy batteries. Nevertheless, the extensive volume expansion and uncontrolled Li dendrite growth of lithium metal not only cause potential safety hazards but also lead to low Coulombic efficiency and inferior cycling lifespan for Li metal batteries. Herein, a multifunctional dendrite-free composite anode (Li/SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is proposed through an in situ melt-infusion strategy. In this configuration, the 3D cross-linked porous Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Li&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; framework facilitates the rapid penetration of electrolytes and accommodates the volume expansion during the repeated Li&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;plating process. Meanwhile, the lithiophilic Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S phases with a low Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport barrier ensure preferential Li deposition, effectively avoiding uneven electron distribution. Moreover, the Li&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; electron conductors with appropriate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bonding ability guarantee rapid charge transport and mass transfer. Most importantly, the steady multifunctional skeleton with sufficient inner interfaces (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Li&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) in the whole electrode, not only realizes the redistribution of the localized free electron, contributing to the decomposition of Li clusters, but also induces a planar deposition model, thus restraining the generation of Li dendrites. Consequently, an unprecedented cyclability of over 6&#160;500&#160;h under an ultrahigh areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a current rate of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved for the prepared Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Li&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; composite anode. Moreover, the assembled Li/SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LFP) pouch full-cells also demonstrate remarkable rate capability and a convincing cycling lifespan of more than 2&#160;000 cycles at 2 C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical&#8208;Propulsion Metastructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces optical&#8208;propulsion metastructures, for enhanced laser micropropulsion performance. This metastructure achieves 99% light absorption efficiency and a material density of 0.958 g cm&#8722;3. It maintains exceptional energy conversion and structural integrity under adverse conditions. The cost&#8208;effective fabrication technique suggests scalability for future microspacecraft and nanosatellite propulsion systems.








Abstract
Pulsed laser micropropulsion (PLMP) offers a promising avenue for miniature space craft, yet conventional propellants face challenges in balancing efficiency and stability. An optical&#8208;propulsion metastructure strategy using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is presented to generate graphene&#8208;metal metastructures (GMM), specifically GMM&#8208;(HKUST&#8208;1), which significantly enhances PLMP performance. This novel approach leverages the unique interaction between pulsed lasers and the precisely engineered GMMs&#8212;comprising optimized metal nanoparticle size, graphene layers, and inter&#8208;particle gaps&#8212;to boost both propulsion efficiency and stability. Experimental and numerical analyses reveal that GMM&#8208;(HKUST&#8208;1) achieves aspecific impulse of 1072.94 s, ablation efficiency of 51.22%, and impulse thrust per mass of 105.15 &#181;N &#181;g&#8722;1, surpassing traditional propellants. With an average particle size of &#8776;12 nm and a density of 0.958&#160;g&#160;cm&#8722;3, these metastructures exhibit 99% light absorption efficiency and maintain stability under atmospheric and humid conditions. The graphene nanolayer efficiently absorbs and converts laser energy, while the metal nanostructures enhance light&#8208;matter interactions, promoting energy transfer and material stability. These findings suggest that this GMM&#8208;based optical&#8208;propulsion strategy can revolutionize microspacecraft propulsion and energy systems, offering significant advancements across various domains.

         <title>Robust Field&#8208;Free Switching Using Large Unconventional Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque in an All&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study uses the low&#8208;symmetry Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 to achieve the field&#8208;free magnetization switching. The unconventional SOT effective field efficiency is determined to be 0.37, and the switching&#8208;polarity&#8208;change magnetic field is as high as 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust field&#8208;free switching against the external magnetic field.








Abstract
The emerging all&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructure provides a new platform to control the magnetization by the electric field beyond the traditional spintronics devices. One promising strategy is using unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) exerted by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current to enable deterministic magnetization switching and enhance the switching efficiency. However, in all&#8208;vdW heterostructures, large unconventional SOT remains elusive and the robustness of the field&#8208;free switching against external magnetic field has not been examined, which hinders further applications. Here, the study demonstrates the field&#8208;free switching in an all&#8208;vdW heterostructure combining a type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The fully field&#8208;free switching can be achieved at 2.56 &#215; 1010 A&#160;m&#8722;2 at 300&#160;K and a large SOT effective field efficiency of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generated by TaIrTe4 is determined to be 0.37. Moreover, it is found that the switching polarity cannot be changed until the external in&#8208;plane magnetic field reaches 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust switching against the magnetic field. The numerical simulation suggests the large unconventional SOT reduces the switching current density and enhances the robustness of the switching. The work shows that all&#8208;vdW heterostructures are promising candidates for future highly efficient and stable SOT&#8208;based devices.

         <dc:description>
Bionic electrical stimulation (Bio&#8208;ES), spontaneously synchronized with target neural signatures in a convenient and electronics&#8208;free form, has always been a coveted goal for the development of flexible bioelectronics technology. Targeting the above goal, the study develops a Bio&#8208;ES strategy synchronized with the vagal nerve impulses peak envelope for physiological feedback electronic modulation of visceral organs innervated by the vagal interoceptive system. In particular, it can operate self&#8208;sustainably without the need for any external energy input through a conformal self&#8208;adhesive design of tissue&#8208;device interface to realize dynamic synergizing with the real&#8208;time physiological environment via the electromechanical coupling effect.








Abstract
Bionic electrical stimulation (Bio&#8208;ES) aims to achieve personalized therapy and proprioceptive adaptation by mimicking natural neural signatures of the body, while current Bio&#8208;ES devices are reliant on complex sensing and computational simulation systems, thus often limited by the low&#8208;fidelity of simulated electrical signals, and failure of interface information interaction due to the mechanical mismatch between soft tissues and rigid electrodes. Here, the study presents a flexible and ultrathin self&#8208;sustainable bioelectronic patch (Bio&#8208;patch), which can self&#8208;adhere to the lesion area of organs and generate bionic electrical signals synchronized vagal nerve envelope in situ to implement Bio&#8208;ES. It allows adaptive adjustment of intensity, frequency, and waveform of the Bio&#8208;ES to fully meet personalized needs of tissue regeneration based on real&#8208;time feedback from the vagal neural controlled organs. With this foundation, the Bio&#8208;patch can effectively intervene with excessive fibrosis and microvascular stasis during the natural healing process by regulating the polarization time of macrophages, promoting the reconstruction of the tissue&#8208;engineered structure, and accelerating the repair of damaged liver and kidney. This work develops a practical approach to realize biomimetic electronic modulation of the growth and development of soft organs only using a multifunctional Bio&#8208;patch, which establishes a new paradigm for precise bioelectronic medicine.

Living Bdello is engineered with polydopamine and a multinuclear cerium (IV) complex to construct Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello for blocking the spread of drug resistance. Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello exhibits synergistic functions in penetrating biofilms, killing bacteria and degrading drug&#8208;resistant genes, rendering it a versatile therapeutic for treating P. aeruginosa (KanR) infected scald/burn&#160;wounds by simultaneously eliminating resistant pathogens and blocking bacterial drug&#8208;resistance dissemination.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant pathogens significantly threaten human health and life. Simply killing drug&#8208;resistant pathogens cannot effectively eliminate their threat since the drug&#8208;resistant genes (DRGs) released from dead drug&#8208;resistant pathogens are difficult to eliminate and can further spread via horizontal gene transfer, leading to the spread of drug resistance. The development of antibacterial materials with sterilization and DRGs cleavage activities is highly crucial. Herein, a living system, Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello, is fabricated with bacterial killing and DRGs cleavage activities for blocking bacterial drug resistance dissemination by engineered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (Bdello). Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello is obtained by engineering Bdello with dopamine and a multinuclear cerium (IV) complex. Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello can penetrate and eliminate kanamycin&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa (KanR) biofilms via the synergistic effect of predatory Bdello and photothermal polydopamine under near&#8208;infrared light. Additionally, the DNase&#8208;mimicking ability of Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello endows it with genome and plasmid DNA cleavage ability. An in vivo study reveals that Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello can eliminate P. aeruginosa (KanR) and cleave DRGs in scald/burn infected wounds to block the spread of drug resistance and accelerate wound healing. This bioactive system constructed from natural living materials offers a promising means for blocking the spread of drug resistance.

         <title>Sensitive SWIR Organic Photodetectors with Spectral Response Reaching 1.5&#160;&#181;m</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new non&#8208;fullerene acceptor exhibiting an ultralow bandgap of 0.83 eV and strong absorption extending up to 1.5 &#181;m is developed by rationally regulating its molecular packing order. The resulting photodetectors achieve an unprecedented detectivity&#160;over 1011 Jones from 0.4 to 1.5 &#181;m with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 1012 Jones at 1.16 &#181;m under 0 V bias.








Abstract
The performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs) sensitive to the short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light lags behind commercial indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) photodetectors primarily due to the scarcity of organic semiconductors with efficient photoelectric responses exceeding 1.3&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the Energy&#8208;gap law, ultralow&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors usually suffer from severe non&#8208;radiative transitions, resulting in low external quantum efficiency (EQE). Herein, a difluoro&#8208;substituted quinoid terminal group (QC&#8208;2F) with exceptionally strong electron&#8208;negativity is developed for constructing a new non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA), Y&#8208;QC4F with an ultralow bandgap of 0.83&#160;eV. This subtle structural modification significantly enhances intermolecular packing order and density, enabling an absorption onset up to 1.5&#160;&#181;m while suppressing non&#8208;radiation recombination in Y&#8208;QC4F films. SWIR OPDs based on Y&#8208;QC4F achieve an impressive detectivity (D*) over 1011 Jones from 0.4 to 1.5&#160;&#181;m under 0&#160;V bias, with a maximum of 1.68 &#215; 1012 Jones at 1.16&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the resulting OPDs demonstrate competitive performance with commercial photodetectors for high&#8208;quality SWIR imaging even under 1.4&#160;&#181;m irradiation.

         <title>Facilitating Oriented Dense Deposition: Utilizing Crystal Plane End&#8208;Capping Reagent to Construct Dendrite&#8208;Free and Highly Corrosion&#8208;Resistant (100) Crystal Plane Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oriented dense Zn anodes with high corrosion resistance are fabricated by introducing a Zn (100) crystal plane end&#8208;capping reagent into the electrolyte, which mitigates the dendrite growth and corrosive behavior of Zn anodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries and improves their durability. This study deepens the understanding of diverse Zn crystal planes and broadens the choice of crystal plane modulation.








Abstract
Dendrite growth and corrosion issues have significantly hindered the usability of Zn anodes, which further restricts the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). In this study, a zinc&#8208;philic and hydrophobic Zn (100) crystal plane end&#8208;capping reagent (ECR) is introduced into the electrolyte to address these challenges in AZIBs. Specifically, under the mediation of 100&#8208;ECR, the electroplated Zn configures oriented dense deposition of (100) crystal plane texture, which slows down the formation of dendrites. Furthermore, owing to the high corrosion resistance of the (100) crystal plane and the hydrophobic protective interface formed by the adsorbed ECR on the electrode surface, the Zn anode demonstrates enhanced reversibility and higher Coulombic efficiency in the modified electrolyte. Consequently, superior electrochemical performance is achieved through this novel crystal plane control strategy and interface protection technology. The Zn//VO2 cells based on the modified electrolyte maintained a high&#8208;capacity retention of &#8776;80.6% after 1350 cycles, corresponding to a low&#8208;capacity loss rate of only 0.014% per cycle. This study underscores the importance of deposition uniformity and corrosion resistance of crystal planes over their type. And through crystal plane engineering, a high&#8208;quality (100) crystal plane is constructed, thereby expanding the range of options for viable Zn anodes.

         <title>Strategically Modulating Proton Activity and Electric Double Layer Adsorption for Innovative All&#8208;Vanadium Aqueous Mn2+/Proton Hybrid Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel all&#8208;vanadium symmetric manganese ion batteries are developed for the first time based on tunnel&#8208;type monoclinic VO2 electrode materials. Through further rational electrolyte design and advanced multi&#8208;scale in situ characterization, the effective modulation of proton activity and electric double&#8208;layer structure at the interface is fully revealed and a unique mechanism of manganese ion/proton hybrid energy storage is demonstrated.








Abstract
Aqueous Mn&#8208;ion batteries (MIBs) exhibit a promising development potential due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, high safety, and potential for high energy density. However, the development of MIBs is hindered by the lack of electrode materials capable of storing Mn2+ ions due to acidic manganese salt electrolytes and large ion radius. Herein, the tunnel&#8208;type structure of monoclinic VO2 nanorods to effectively store Mn2+ ions via a reversible (de)insertion chemistry for the first time is reported. Utilizing exhaustive in situ/ex situ multi&#8208;scale characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, the co&#8208;insertion process of Mn2+/proton is revealed, elucidating the capacity decay mechanism wherein high proton activity leads to irreversible dissolution loss of vanadium species. Further, the Grotthuss transfer mechanism of protons is broken via a hydrogen bond reconstruction strategy while achieving the modulation of the electric double&#8208;layer structure, which effectively suppresses the electrode interface proton activity. Consequently, the VO2 demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance at both ambient temperatures and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, especially maintaining a high capacity of 162&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after a record&#8208;breaking 20&#160;000 cycles. Notably, the all&#8208;vanadium symmetric pouch cells are successfully assembled for the first time based on the &#8220;rocking&#8208;chair&#8221; Mn2+/proton hybrid mechanism, demonstrating the practical application potential.

         <title>Approaching 20% Efficiency in Ortho&#8208;Xylene Processed Organic Solar Cells by a Benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;Core&#8208;Based 3D Network Acceptor with Large Electronic Coupling and Long Exciton Diffusion Length</title>

A series of benzo[a]phenazine (BP)&#8208;based acceptors achieved through an isomerization chlorination strategy is presented, namely NA1, NA2, NA3, and NA4. The ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed binary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:NA3 yields an efficiency of 18.94%. Importantly, the o&#8208;XY processed ternary OSC device based on PM6:D18&#8208;Cl:NA3 exhibits an efficiency as high as 19.75%.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic solar cells often rely on halogen&#8208;containing solvents, which restrict the photovoltaic industry. Therefore, it is imperative to develop efficient organic photovoltaic materials compatible with halogen&#8208;free solvents. Herein, a series of benzo[a]phenazine (BP)&#8208;core&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) achieved through an isomerization chlorination strategy is presented, comprising unchlorinated NA1, 10&#8208;chlorine substituted NA2, 8&#8208;chlorine substituted NA3, and 7&#8208;chlorine substituted NA4. Theoretical simulations highlight NA3's superior orbit overlap length and tight molecular packing, attributed to interactions between the end group and BP unit. Furthermore, NA3 demonstrates dense 3D network structures and a record electronic coupling of 104.5 meV. These characteristics empower the ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed PM6:NA3 device with superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.94%, surpassing PM6:NA1 (15.34%), PM6:NA2 (7.18%), and PM6:NA4 (16.02%). Notably, the significantly lower PCE in the PM6:NA2 device is attributed to excessive self&#8208;aggregation characteristics of NA2 in o&#8208;XY. Importantly, the incorporation of D18&#8208;Cl into the PM6:NA3 binary blend enhances crystallographic ordering and increases the exciton diffusion length of the donor phase, resulting in a ternary device efficiency of 19.75% (certified as 19.39%). These findings underscore the significance of incorporating new electron&#8208;deficient units in the design of efficient SMAs tailored for environmentally benign solvent processing of OSCs.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Regulated Motion and Energy Conversion of Polyelectrolyte Membrane Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the shape&#8208;dependent motion and adaptive rotation of self&#8208;powered Marangoni actuators on the water surface. Among them, circular actuators show regular motion and passage properties that enable energy harvesting and wireless sensing for obstruction location in closed pipes.








Abstract
Smart actuators hold great potential in soft robotics and sensors, but their movement at the fluid interface is less understood and controlled, hindering their performances and applications in complicated fluids. Here an ethanol&#8208;containing polyelectrolyte actuator is prepared that demonstrates excellent actuating performance via the Marangoni effect. These actuators exhibit enduring (17&#160;min), repeatable (50 cycles), and autonomous motion on the water surface. More importantly, the motion of actuators are dependent on their shapes. Polygonal actuators with more edges exhibit round motion attached to walls of containers, while the actuators with few edges move randomly. On the basis of this property, the circular actuators can pass through pipe bends with S&#8208;shaped complex geometry. These unique advantages lend the actuators to successful applications in wireless sensing (standard 0&#8211;5&#160;V level signals) for locating obstructions inside invisible pipes and continuous energy harvesting (7700&#160;nC per cycle) for micro mechanical energy.

         <title>Sulfate Radical Based In Situ Vaccine Boosts Systemic Antitumor Immunity via Concurrent Activation of Necroptosis and STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfate radical based in situ vaccine (ISV) is developed by intercalating peroxydisulfate into manganese&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanoparticles. This ISV mediates advanced oxidation process in tumor microenvironment to produce SO4&#183;&#8722; that induces immunogenic necroptosis of tumor cells, and concurrently activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING)&#160;signaling pathway that augments immune cells maturation, leading to remarkable systemic T cell immunity against primary and distant/metastatic tumors.








Abstract
In situ vaccine (ISV) can provoke systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). The development of ISV technology has been restricted by the limited and suboptimal ICD driven tumor antigen production which are currently relying on chemo&#8208;drugs, photo&#8208;/radio&#8208;sensitizers, oncolytic&#8208;virus and immunostimulatory agents. Herein, a sulfate radical (SO4&#183;&#8722;) based ISV is reported that accomplishes superior tumor immunotherapy dispense from conventional approaches. The ISV denoted as P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH is constructed by intercalating peroxydisulfate (PDS, a precursor of SO4&#183;&#8722;) into manganese layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;LDH). This design allows the stabilization of PDS under ambient condition, but triggers a Mn2+ mediated PDS decomposition in acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to generate in situ SO4&#183;&#8722;. Importantly, it is found that the SO4&#183;&#8208; radicals not only effectively kill cancer cells, but also induce a necroptotic cell death pathway, leading to robust ICD signaling for eliciting adaptive immunity. Further, the P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to further boost anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Collectively, the P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH based ISV exhibited potent activity in inhibiting tumor growth and lung metastasis. When combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor, significant inhibition of distant tumors is achieved. This study underpins the promise of SO4&#183;&#8208; based vaccine technology for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Reviving Sodium Tunnel Oxide Cathodes Based on Structural Modulation and Sodium Compensation Strategy Toward Practical Sodium&#8208;Ion Cylindrical Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is proposed to slove the problems of surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity in the tunnel oxide cathode material (Na0.44MnO2). In addition, Prussian blue analog (PBA)&#8208;Na0.44Mn1&#8208;xTixO2 composites are designed to construct practical sodium&#8208;ion cylindrical battery with hard carbon anodes for the first time, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.








Abstract
As a typical tunnel oxide, Na0.44MnO2 features excellent electrochemical performance and outstanding structural stability, making it a promising cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, it suffers from undesirable challenges such as surface residual alkali, multiple voltage plateaus, and low initial charge specific capacity. Herein, an internal and external synergistic modulation strategy is adopted by replacing part of the Mn with Ti to optimize the bulk phase and construct a Ti&#8208;containing epitaxial stabilization layer, resulting in reduced surface residual alkali, excellent Na+ transport kinetics and improved water/air stability. Specifically, the Na0.44Mn0.85Ti0.15O2 using water&#8208;soluble carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder can realize a capacity retention rate of 94.30% after 1,000 cycles at 2C, and excellent stability is further verified in kilogram large&#8208;up applications. In addition, taking advantage of the rich Na content in Prussian blue analog (PBA), PBA&#8208;Na0.44Mn1&#8208;xTixO2 composites are designed to compensate for the insufficient Na in the tunnel oxide and are matched with hard carbon to achieve the preparation of coin full cell and 18650 cylindrical battery with satisfactory electrochemical performance. This work enables the application of tunnel oxides cathode for SIBs in 18650 cylindrical batteries for the first time and promotes the commercialization of SIBs.

         <title>Evidence of Lone Pair Crafted Emphanisis in the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Halide Perovskite Cs2PbI2Cl2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emphanisis, or local symmetry reduction upon warming, in Cs2PbI2Cl2, is revealed by synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering analysis. Origin of emphanisis is traced to Pb 6s2 lone&#8208;pair&#8208;induced cooperative structural distortion, featuring thermally activated Pb off&#8208;centering and static Cl displacement. Insights from inelastic neutron scattering and theoretical studies shed light on impact of these distortions on the ultralow thermal conductivity of Cs2PbI2Cl2.








Abstract
A hallmark of typical structural transformations is an increase in symmetry upon heating due to entropic favourability. However, local symmetry breaking upon warming is recently evidenced in rare crystalline phases. Termed as emphanisis, the phenomenon implores exploration of fascinating thermodynamic nuances that drive unusual structural evolutions. Here, synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering measurements are presented on a Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper mixed halide perovskite, Cs2PbI2Cl2, which reveal signatures of emphanisis. The genesis of symmetry lowering upon heating is traced to a lone pair&#8208;driven cooperative local structural distortion composed of thermally actuated Pb off&#8208;centring and static Cl displacement. Mapping the thermal evolution of low&#8208;lying phonon modes with inelastic neutron scattering uncovers instances of mode hardening with picosecond lifetime and an intriguing soft mode at the X&#8208;point of the Brillouin zone&#8212;features conducive to ultralow thermal transport. Together, these observations highlight the fundamental and functional implications of chemical design in engendering unconventional phenomena in crystalline materials and associated properties.

         <title>Ultrastable Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large family of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs with high porosity for gas separation have been synthesized. New Cr&#8208;MOFs are exceptionally stable in boiling water, extremely acidic (pH &lt; 0) or basic (pH &gt; 14) conditions and can be deprotonated and re&#8208;protonated following cycle of base&#8208;acid treatments, opening up applications under harsh conditions. New materials exhibit excellent adsorption properties such as high uptake capacity and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C6H6/C6H12.








Abstract
Isoreticular chemistry, which enables property optimization by changing compositions without changing topology, is a powerful synthetic strategy. One of the biggest challenges facing isoreticular chemistry is to extend it to ligands with strongly coordinating substituent groups such as unbound &#8722;COOH, because competitive interactions between such groups and metal ions can derail isoreticular chemistry. It is even more challenging to have an isoreticular series of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs capable of encompassing chemically disparate metal ions. Here, with the simultaneous introduction of carboxyl functionalization and pore space partition, a family of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized materials is developed in diverse compositions from homometallic Cr3+ and Ni2+ to heterometallic Co2+/V3+, Ni2+/V3+, Co2+/In3+, Co2+/Ni2+. Cr&#8208;MOFs remain highly crystalline in boiling water. Unprecedentedly, one Cr&#8208;MOF can withstand the treatment cycle with 10m NaOH and 12m HCl, allowing reversible inter&#8208;conversion between unbound &#8722;COOH acid form and &#8722;COO&#8722; base form. These materials exhibit excellent sorption properties such as high uptake capacity for CO2 (100.2 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and hydrocarbon gases (e.g., 142.1 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 for C2H2, 110.5 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 for C2H4) at 1 bar and 298K, high benzene/cyclohexane selectivity (up to &#8776;40), and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4.

         <title>Chiral Intranasal Nanovaccines as Antivirals for Respiratory Syncytial Virus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral intranasal vaccines are fabricated to target the Respiratory Syncytial Virus and promote the immunological response by controlling the composition, size, and chirality of the nanostructures.








Abstract
This study aimed to develop an intranasal nanovaccine by combining chiral nanoparticles with the RSV pre&#8208;fusion protein (RSV protein) to create L&#8208;nanovaccine (L&#8208;Vac). The results showed that L&#8208;NPs increased antigen attachment in the nasal cavity by 3.83 times and prolonged its retention time to 72&#160;h. In vivo experimental data demonstrated that the intranasal immunization with L&#8208;Vac induced a 4.86&#8208;fold increase in secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) secretion in the upper respiratory tract, a 1.85&#8208;fold increase in the lower respiratory tract, and a 20.61&#8208;fold increase in RSV&#8208;specific immunoglobin G (IgG) titer levels in serum, compared with the commercial Alum Vac, while the neutralizing activity against the RSV authentic virus is 1.66&#8208;fold higher. The mechanistic investigation revealed that L&#8208;Vac activated the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway in nasal epithelial cells (NECs), in turn increasing the expression levels of interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6) and C&#8211;C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) by 1.67&#8208;fold and 3.46&#8208;fold, respectively, through the downstream nuclear factor kappa&#8208;B (NF&#8208;&#954;B) signaling pathway. Meanwhile, CCL20 recruited dendritic cells (DCs) and L&#8208;Vac activated the Toll&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway in DCs, promoting IL&#8208;6 expression and DCs maturation, and boosted sIgA production and T&#8208;cell responses. The findings suggested that L&#8208; Vac may serve as a candidate for the development of intranasal medicine against various types of respiratory infections.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via In Situ Passivation Directed Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ passivation (ISP) method is introduced to adjust the crystal growth kinetics and obtain the (111)&#8208;orientated perovskite films with the passivated boundaries and interfaces, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.7% (certified as 26.09% at a 5.97 square millimeters active area).








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the influential photovoltaic technologies with promising cost&#8208;effectiveness. Though with mild processabilities to massive production, inverted PSCs have long suffered from inferior photovoltaic performances due to intractable defective states at boundaries and interfaces. Herein, an in situ passivation (ISP) method is presented to effectively adjust crystal growth kinetics and obtain the well&#8208;orientated perovskite films with the passivated boundaries and interfaces, successfully enabled the new access of high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs. The study unravels that the strong yet anisotropic ISP additive adsorption between different facets and the accompanied additive engineering yield the high&#8208;quality (111)&#8208;orientated perovskite crystallites with superior photovoltaic properties. The ISP&#8208;derived inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.7% (certified as 26.09% at a 5.97 mm2 active area) and 24.5% (certified as 23.53% at a 1.28 cm2 active area), along with decent operational stabilities.

         <title>Aggregate&#8208;Dominated Dilute Electrolytes with Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Ion&#8208;Conducting Channels for Highly Reversible Na Plating/Stripping</title>

A 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte is designed with weak dissociation of Na+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion pairs and a highly efficient network for ultrafast Na+ hopping, which breaks through the LT ion&#8208;conducting limitation of conventional electrolytes. The methyl&#8208;regulated electronic structure induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic&#8208;organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility. A record&#8208;high CE beyond 99.9% is achieved even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Developing rechargeable batteries with high power delivery at low temperatures (LT) below 0&#160;&#176;C is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications. Initial anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) promise high LT performances because of the low de&#8208;solvation energy and smaller Stokes radius of Na+, nondiffusion&#8208;limited plating/stripping electrochemistry, and maximized energy density. However, the severe reduction in electrolyte ionic conductivity and formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) hinder their practical applications at LT. In this study, a 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran&#8208;based dilute electrolyte is designed to concurrently achieve an anion&#8208;coordinated solvation structure and impressive ionic conductivity of 3.58&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The dominant aggregate solvates enable the formation of highly efficient and LT&#8208;resistant Na+ hopping channels in the electrolyte. Moreover, the methyl&#8208;regulated electronic structure in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic&#8208;organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility, composition homogeneity, and mechanical robustness. As such, a record&#8208;high Coulombic efficiency beyond 99.9% is achieved even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;constructed AFSMBs sustain 300 cycles with 80% capacity maintained, and a 0.5&#8208;Ah level pouch cell delivers 85% capacity over 180 cycles at &#8722;25&#160;&#176;C. This study affords new insights into electrolyte formulation for fast ionic conduction and superior Na reversibility at ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Multifunctional Scavenger Boosts Cathode Interfacial Stability with Reduced Water Footprint for Direct Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A refined direct recycling process to improve cathode interface stability by leveraging in situ reaction between surface residual lithium species and a weak inorganic acid to form a conformal Li+ conductive coating stabilizes the regenerated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with significantly reduced water footprint. This intensified recycling process offers a more sustainable approach with the potential to transition from laboratory to industrial&#8208;scale applications, improving both product quality and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
The burgeoning accumulation of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), a byproduct from the widespread adoption of portable electronics and electric vehicles, necessitates efficient recycling strategies. Direct recycling represents a promising strategy to maximize the value of LIB waste and minimize harmful environmental outcomes. However, current efforts to large&#8208;scale direct recycling face challenges stemming from heterophase residues (e.g., Li2CO3, LiOH) in the recycled products and uncontrolled interfacial instability, often requiring repeated washing that generates significant wastewater. Here, a refined direct recycling process is proposed to improve cathode interface stability by leveraging in situ reaction between surface residual lithium species and a weak inorganic acid to form a conformal Li+ conductive coating that stabilizes the regenerated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with significantly reduced water footprint. The findings reveal that the conductive coating also prevents direct contact between contaminants and the cathode surface, thus improving the ambient storage stability. By eliminating the need for extensive washing, this intensified recycling process offers a more sustainable approach with the potential to transition from laboratory to industrial&#8208;scale applications, improving both product quality and environmental sustainability.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Asymmetric Charge Distribution for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic catalytic system by precisely controlling the asymmetric charge density distribution in an Au&#8208;doped cpCu7CF catalyst is developed and successfully applied in regulating the multiple steps of sequential reactions in urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Constructing dual catalytic sites with charge density differences is an efficient way to promote urea electrosynthesis from parallel NO3&#8722;${\mathrm{NO}}_3^ - $ and CO2 reduction yet still challenging in static system. Herein, a dynamic system is constructed by precisely controlling the asymmetric charge density distribution in an Au&#8208;doped coplanar Cu7 clusters&#8208;based 3D framework&#160;catalyst (Au@cpCu7CF). In Au@cpCu7CF, the redistributed charge between Au and Cu atoms changed periodically with the application of pulse potentials switching between &#8722;0.2 and &#8722;0.6&#8201;V and greatly facilitated the electrosynthesis of urea. Compared with the static condition of pristine cpCu7CF (FEurea = 5.10%), the FEurea of Au@cpCu7CF under pulsed potentials is up to 55.53%. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V improved the adsorption of *HNO2 and *NH2 on Au atoms and inhibited the reaction pathways of by&#8208;products. While at the low potential of &#8722;0.2&#160;V, the charge distribution between Au and Cu atomic sites facilitated the thermodynamic C&#8211;N coupling step. This work demonstrated the important role of asymmetric charge distribution under dynamic regulation for urea electrosynthesis, providing a new inspiration for precise control of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogel Bioadhesives for Chronic Wound Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel bioadhesive patch, which is featured with a gradual increase in mechanics in an autonomous and self&#8208;growing manner is exploited for the chronic wound management through long&#8208;term yet dynamic mechanical modulation.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives have emerged as a promising alternative to wound dressings for chronic wound management. However, many existing bioadhesives do not meet the functional requirements for efficient wound management through dynamically mechanical modulation, due to the reduced wound contractibility, frequent wound recurrence, incapability to actively adapt to external microenvironment variation, especially for those gradually&#8208;expanded chronic wounds. Here, a self&#8208;growing hydrogel bioadhesive (sGHB) patch that exhibits instant adhesion to biological tissues but also a gradual increase in mechanical strength and interfacial adhesive strength within a 120&#8208;h application is presented. The gradually increased mechanics of the sGHB patch could effectively mitigate the stress concentration at the wound edge, and also resist the wound expansion at various stages, thus mechanically contracting the chronic wounds in a programmable manner. The self&#8208;growing hydrogel patch demonstrated enhanced wound healing efficacy in a mouse diabetic wound model, by regulating the inflammatory response, promoting the faster re&#8208;epithelialization and angiogenesis through mechanical modulation. Such kind of self&#8208;growing hydrogel bioadhesives have potential clinical utility for a variety of wound management where dynamic mechanical modulation is indispensable.

         <title>Sequential Targeted Enzyme&#8208;Instructed Self&#8208;Assembly Supramolecular Nanofibers to Attenuate Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>

         <dc:description>
Inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence collectively contribute to the intervertebral disc degeneration. Enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly supramolecular nanofibers (Fbp&#8208;GFFYPLGLAG(E)nRGD) are developed to target the overexpression of two crucial enzymes, MMP&#8208;2 and COX&#8208;2. These nanofibers can effectively block the synergistic effect of the inflammatory cascade and aging&#8208;related secretion phenotype and reduce the extracellular matrix damage caused by inflammation and aging cell accumulation. Finally, it can mitigate the progression of disc degeneration.








Abstract
As an age&#8208;related disease, intervertebral disc degeneration is closely related to inflammation and aging. Inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence collectively contribute to the degradation of intervertebral disc. Blocking this synergy reduces disc extracellular matrix damage caused by inflammation and aging. In this study, drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers with sequential targeting functions are constructed through intelligent response, hydrophilicity, and in situ self&#8208;assembly empowerment of flurbiprofen. The peptide precursor responds to the cleavage of overexpressed MMP&#8208;2 in the degenerative intervertebral disc microenvironment (intracellular and extracellular), resulting in the formation of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers that enable the on&#8208;demand release of flurbiprofen and COX&#8208;2 response. In vitro, Comp. 1 (Flurbiprofen&#8208;GFFYPLGLAGEEEERGD) reduces the expression of inflammation&#8208;related genes and proteins and the polarization of M1 macrophages by competitively inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and increases the expression of extracellular matrix proteins COL&#8208;2 and aggrecan. Additionally, it can reduce the expression of Senescence&#8208;Associated Secretory Phenotype and DNA damage in aged nucleus pulposus cells and promote the recovery of proliferation and cell cycle. In vivo, drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers delay intervertebral disc degeneration by inhibiting inflammation and preventing the accumulation of senescent cells. Therefore, the sequentially targeted self&#8208;assembled drug&#8208;loaded nanofibers can delay intervertebral disc degeneration by blocking the synergistic effect of inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence.

         <title>Near 100% Conversion of Acetylene to High&#8208;purity Ethylene at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>

The delicately prepared CuO nanoribbons electrocatalyst with abundant vacancies exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in the C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 flow cell and Zn&#8208;C2H2 battery. The integrated system achieves near 100% C2H2 conversion and higher than 96.1% C2H4 specific selectivity, generating polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 products.








Abstract
Direct production of high&#8208;purity ethylene from acetylene using renewable energy through electrocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation presents a promising alternative to traditional thermocatalytic processes. However, the low conversion of acetylene results in a significant amount of acetylene impurities in the product, necessitating additional purification steps. Herein, a tandem electrocatalytic system that integrates acetylene electrolyzer and zinc&#8208;acetylene battery units for high&#8208;purity ethylene production is designed. The ultrathin CuO nanoribbons with enriched oxygen vacancies (CuO1&#8208;x NRs) as electrocatalysts achieve a remarkable 93.2% Faradaic efficiency of ethylene at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in an acetylene electrolyzer, and the power density reaches 3.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a zinc&#8208;acetylene battery under acetylene stream. Moreover, the tandem electrocatalysis system delivers a single&#8208;pass acetylene conversion of 99.998% and ethylene selectivity of 96.1% at a high current of 1.4&#160;A. Experimental data and calculations demonstrate that the presence of oxygen vacancies accelerates water dissociation to produce active hydrogen atoms while preventing the over&#8208;hydrogenation of ethylene. Furthermore, techno&#8208;economic analysis reveals that the tandem system can dramatically reduce the overall ethylene production cost compared to the conventional thermocatalytic processes. A novel strategy for complete acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion under mild conditions, establishing a non&#8208;petroleum route for the production of ethylene is reported.

         <title>Local Dipole Modulation Toward High Fill Factor in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local dipole modulation in organic solar cells can significantly enhance device performance. By adjusting molecular asymmetries, two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are synthesized. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 led to an improved balanced charge transport, resulting in an exceptional fill factor of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency of 18.3%.








Abstract
Dipole moment arrangement in organic semiconductors plays a critical role in affecting the intermolecular packing, determining optoelectronic properties and device performance. Here, to get the desired fill factor (FF) values in organic solar cells (OSCs), the local dipole of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is modulated by changing the molecular asymmetries. Two NFAs, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are designed and synthesized, which have different substitutions of alkyl and alkoxyl groups. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 creates distinct local dipoles, while the bidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;1 mitigates dipole variation. Despite the minimal impact on monomolecular properties, the local dipole moment significantly influences terminal group packing modes in the film state. This, in turn, enhances the relative dielectric constant, prolongs exciton lifetime, and reduces sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:AA&#8208;2&#8208;based OSCs achieve an exceptional FF of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3%, with a ternary device reaching a PCE of 19.3%. This work highlights the potential of dipole modulation in material design to get ideal FF values for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Constructing Multiscale Fibrous Morphology to Achieve 20% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Mixing High and Low Molecular Weight D18</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIX&#8208;D18, by mixing HW&#8208;D18 (high molecular weight D18) and LW&#8208;D18 (low molecular weight D18), can form multiscale fibrous morphology. The finer nanofibers of HW&#8208;D18 can increase Donor/Acceptor contact, enhancing exciton dissociation and collection efficiency, while the thicker nanofibers of LW&#8208;D18 can improve crystallinity and boost charge transport capability. Ultimately, a efficiency of 20.0% is achieved by MIX&#8208;D18:L8&#8208;BO device.








Abstract
This study underscores the significance of precisely manipulating the morphology of the active layer in organic solar cells (OSCs). By blending polymer donors of D18 with varying molecular weights, a multiscale interpenetrating fiber network structure within the active layer is successfully created. The introduction of 10% low molecular weight D18 (LW&#8208;D18) into high molecular weight D18 (HW&#8208;D18) produces MIX&#8208;D18, which exhibits an extended exciton diffusion distance and orderly molecular stacking. Devices utilizing MIX&#8208;D18 demonstrate superior electron and hole transport, improves exciton dissociation, enhances charge collection efficiency, and reduces trap&#8208;assisted recombination compared to the other two materials. Through the use of the nonfullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.0% is achieved. This methodology, which integrates the favorable attributes of high and low molecular weight polymers, opens a new avenue for enhancing the performance of OSCs.

These Gm&#8208;EVs significantly improve the treatment outcomes against ulcerative colitis by reducing inflammation, restoring colonic barrier function, and rebalancing intestinal microbiota, offering an alternative to fecal microbiota transplant.








Abstract
The biosafety concerns associated with fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) limit their clinical application in treating ulcerative colitis (UC). Gut microbiota secrete abundant extracellular vesicles (Gm&#8208;EVs), which play a critical role in bacteria&#8208;to&#8208;bacteria and bacteria&#8208;to&#8208;host communications. Herein, intestinal microbiota are trained using tea leaf lipid/pluronic F127&#8208;coated curcumin nanocrystals (CN@Lp127s), which can maintain stability during transit through the gastrointestinal tract. Compared with FMT, Gm&#8208;EVs derived from healthy mice significantly improve treatment outcomes against UC by reducing colonic inflammatory responses, restoring colonic barrier function, and rebalancing intestinal microbiota. Strikingly, Gm&#8208;EVs obtained from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice exhibit a superior therapeutic effect on UC compared to groups receiving FMT from healthy mice, Gm&#8208;EVs from healthy mice, and FMT from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice. Oral administration of Gm&#8208;EVs from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice not only alleviates colonic inflammation, promotes mucosal repair, and regulates gut microbiota but also regulates purine metabolism to decrease the uric acid level, resulting in a robust improvement in the UC. This study demonstrates the UC therapeutic efficacy of Gm&#8208;EVs derived from nanomedicine&#8208;trained gut microbiota in regulating the immune microenvironment, microbiota, and purine metabolism of the colon. These EVs provide an alternative platform to replace FMT as a treatment for UC.

         <title>Bottom Contact Engineering for Ambient Fabrication of &gt;25% Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium gluconate (SG) is used to disperse tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) in order to create a uniform SG&#8208;SnO2 film and control the buried interface. This allows for the deposition of perovskite films with nearly pinhole&#8208;free at the bottom contact interface in ambient air. The SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%). Additionally, these PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of operation (T90 = 1000&#160;h). Microstructure analysis revealed that light&#8208;induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes, so SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs enhance light stability by suppressing the formation of holes at the buried interface.








Abstract
The bottom contact in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is easy to cause deep trap states and severe instability issues, especially under maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In this study, sodium gluconate (SG) is employed to disperse tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) and regulate the interface contact at the buried interface. The SG&#8208;SnO2 electron transfer layer (ETL) enabled the deposition of pinhole&#8208;free perovskite films in ambient air and improved interface contact by bridging effect. SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) exceeding 1.19&#160;V. The VOC loss is less than 0.34&#160;V relative to the 1.53&#160;eV bandgap, and the fill factor (FF) loss is only 2.02% due to the improved contact. The SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#160;h operation (T90 = 1000&#160;h), higher than T80 = 1000&#160;h for the control SnO2 PSC. Microstructure analysis revealed that light&#8208;induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes and grain boundaries and highlighted the importance of bottom&#8208;contact engineering.

         <title>Enabling Stable Operation of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries under Fast&#8208;Operating Conditions by Tuning the Electrolyte Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

Fluorinated ester&#8208;based fast&#8208;charging electrolytes (FCEs) facilitate an exceptional lifespan of 3000 cycles at charge rates of as high as 4 C with 0&#8211;100% state&#8208;of&#8208;charge in commercial 1 Ah graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells. The superior performance is due to the well&#8208;tuned solvation structure, enhanced solvent solvation ability, and ameliorated electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase chemistry.








Abstract
Inferior fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature performances remain a hurdle for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Overcoming this hurdle is extremely challenging primarily due to the low conductivity of commercial ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based electrolytes and the formation of undesirable solid electrolyte interphases with poor Li+&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Here, a series of EC&#8208;free fast&#8208;charging electrolytes (FCEs) by incorporating a fluorinated ester, methyl trifluoroacetate (MTFA), as a special cosolvent into a practically viable LiPF6&#8211;dimethyl carbonate&#8211;fluoroethylene carbonate system, is reported. With a solvent&#8208;dominated solvation structure, MTFA facilitates the formation of thin, yet robust, interphases on both the cathode and anode. Commercial 1 Ah graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells filled with the FCE exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 3 C and 4 C (15&#160;min) charging rates in the full range of 0&#8211;100% state&#8208;of&#8208;charge. Moreover, even at a low operating temperature of &#8722;20 &#176;C, the 1 Ah cell retains a high capacity of 0.65 Ah at a 2 C discharge rate and displays virtually no capacity fade on cycling at a C/5 rate. The work highlights the power of electrolyte design in achieving extra&#8208;fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature performances.

         <title>General Design of Aligned&#8208;Channel Porous Carbon Electrodes for Efficient High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Gas&#8208;Evolving Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of aligned&#8208;channel carbon electrodes by a general design strategy are developed, which not only facilitates the fast accessibility of liquid reactants and the timely detachment of gaseous products but also possesses a large pore area to accommodate abundant active sites, thus achieving high&#8208;performance gas&#8208;evolving electrocatalysis at high current densities, including urea oxidation reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Gas&#8208;evolving reactions (GERs) are important in many electrochemical energy conversion technologies and chemical industries. The operation of GERs at high current densities is critical for their industrial implementation but remains challenging as it poses stringent requirements on the electrodes in terms of reaction kinetics, mass transfer, and electron transport. Here the general and rational design of self&#8208;standing carbon electrodes with vertically aligned porous channels, appropriate pore size distribution, and high surface area as supports for loading a variety of catalytic species by facile electrodeposition are reported. These electrodes simultaneously possess high intrinsic activity, large numbers of active sites, and efficient transport highways for ions, gases, and electrons, resulting in significant performance improvements at high current densities in diverse GERs such as urea oxidation, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen evolution reactions, as well as overall urea/water electrolyzers. As an example, the carbon electrode decorated with Ni(OH)2 demonstrates a record&#8208;high current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.360&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, largely outperforming the conventional nickel foam&#8208;based counterpart and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Indium Oxide Electrochemical Sensor for Stable and Selective NO2 Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study pioneers the use of nonprecious metal electrochemical sensing materials, specifically nitrided In2O3, for NO2 detection. The In2O3 N&#8208;40 min sensor exhibits a robust response (771 nA to 10 ppm NO2), exceptional stability (&gt;30 days), and rapid recovery (5/16 s), outperforming Pt/C with 63 times higher selectivity and 98% longer stability.








Abstract
Efficient gas sensors are critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety. While metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors are cost&#8208;effective, they struggle with poor selectivity, high operating temperatures, and limited stability. Electrochemical sensors, though selective and energy&#8208;efficient, face high costs, and stability issues due to precious metal catalysts like platinum on carbon (Pt/C). Herein, a novel, cost&#8208;effective electrochemical sensor using nitrogen&#8208;doped indium oxide In2O3&#8722;xN2x/3Vx/3 (0.01&#8804;x&#8804;0.14), synthesized with varying nitriding times is presented. The optimized In2O3 N&#8208;40&#160;min sensor demonstrates a remarkable response current of 771 nA to 10&#160;ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at ambient temperature, with outstanding long&#8208;term stability (over 30 days) and rapid response/recovery times (5/16 s). Compared to Pt/C sensors, it shows 84% and 67% reductions in response and recovery times, respectively, and maintains 98% performance after a month, versus 68% for Pt/C. This cost&#8208;effective sensor presents a promising alternative for electrochemical gas sensing, eliminating the need for precious metal catalysts.

         <title>Targeting the Labile Iron Pool with Engineered DFO Nanosheets to Inhibit Ferroptosis for Parkinson's Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered DFO&#8208;nanosheets based multifunctional nanoregulator with sequential targeting and ROS&#8208;responsive release property is developed for targeting ferroptosis mitigate dopaminergic neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease through regulating labile iron pool&#8208;mediated iron metabolism, suppressing lipid peroxidation&#8208;mediated reduction of GPX4 expression, and improving mitochondrial dysfunction.








Abstract
Ferroptosis in neurons is considered one of the key factors that induces Parkinson's disease (PD), which is caused by excessive iron accumulation in the intracellular labile iron pool (LIP). The iron ions released from the LIP lead to the aberrant generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to trigger ferroptosis and exacerbate PD progression. Herein, a pioneering design of multifunctional nanoregulator deferoxamine (DFO)&#8208;integrated nanosheets (BDPR NSs) is presented that target the LIP to restrict ferroptosis and protect against PD. The BDPR NSs are constructed by incorporating a brain&#8208;targeting peptide and DFO into polydopamine&#8208;modified black phosphorus nanosheets. These BDPR NSs can sequester free iron ions, thereby ameliorating LIP overload and regulating iron metabolism. Furthermore, the BDPR NSs can decrease lipid peroxidation generation by mitigating ROS accumulation. More importantly, BDPR NSs can specifically accumulate in the mitochondria to suppress ROS generation and decrease mitochondrial iron accumulation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the BDPR NSs highly efficiently mitigated dopaminergic neuronloss and its associated behavioral disorders by modulating the LIP and inhibiting ferroptosis. Thus, the BDPR&#8208;based nanovectors holds promise as a potential avenue for advancing PD therapy.

         <title>Polymeric Nanocarriers Autonomously Cross the Plant Cell Wall and Enable Protein Delivery for Stress Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic high aspect ratio polymeric nanocarrier is developed to deliver functional protein in crops to enable species&#8208;independent plant engineering. The delivered sensor protein reduction&#8208;oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) successfully monitors stressors in tobacco, tomato, and maize. This functional protein delivery platform paves the way for new technologies in plant sensing and engineering, contributing to the design of new solutions that promote plant&#8208;based sustainable development.








Abstract
Delivery of proteins in plant cells can facilitate the design of desired functions by modulation of biological processes and plant traits but is currently limited by narrow host range, tissue damage, and poor scalability. Physical barriers in plants, including cell walls and membranes, limit protein delivery to desired plant tissues. Herein, a cationic high aspect ratio polymeric nanocarriers (PNCs) platform is developed to enable efficient protein delivery to plants. The cationic nature of PNCs binds proteins through electrostatic. The ability to precisely design PNCs&#8217; size and aspect ratio allowed us to find a cutoff of &#8776;14&#160;nm in the cell wall, below which cationic PNCs can autonomously overcome the barrier and carry their cargo into plant cells. To exploit these findings, a reduction&#8208;oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) is deployed as a stress sensor protein cargo in a model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and common crop plants, including tomato and maize. In vivo imaging of PNC&#8208;roGFP enabled optical monitoring of plant response to wounding, biotic, and heat stressors. These results show that PNCs can be precisely designed below the size exclusion limit of cell walls to overcome current limitations in protein delivery to plants and facilitate species&#8208;independent plant engineering.

         <title>Stabilization of Cu&#948;+ Sites Within MnO2 for Superior Urea Electro&#8208;Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical Cu&#8208;doped MnO2 (Cu&#8208;MnO2) with stable Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxygen vacancies (Ovs)&#8208;Mn3+ dual site (Cu&#948;+&#8208;Ovs&#8208;Mn3+) achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and urea yield rate in electrocatalytic CO2/NO3&#8722; reduction with a highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Mechanistic studies reveal that such stabilized Cu&#948;+ sites kinetically lower the energy barrier of C&#8208;N coupling.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling between NO3&#8208; and CO2 has emerged as a sustainable route for urea production. However, identifying catalytic active sites and designing efficient electrocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, the synthesis of Cu&#8208;doped MnO2 nanotube (denoted as Cu&#8208;MnO2) with stable Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxygen vacancies (Ovs)&#8208;Mn3+ dual sites is reported. Compared with pure MnO2, Cu&#948;+ doping can effectively enhance urea production performance in the co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8208;. Thus, Cu&#8208;MnO2 catalyst exhibits a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 54.7% and the highest yield rate of 116.7&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 in a flow cell. Remarkably, the urea yield rate remains over 78&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat.&#8722;1 across a wide potential range. Further experimental and theoretical results elucidate the unique role of Cu&#8208;MnO2 solid&#8208;solution for stabilizing Cu&#948;+ sites in Cu&#948;+&#8208;Ovs&#8208;Mn3+, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities. This thermodynamically promotes urea formation and kinetically lowers the energy barrier of C&#8208;N coupling.

         <title>Substrate Induced p&#8211;n Transition for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

Substrate&#8208;induced re&#8208;growth strategy is proposed to induce p&#8208; to n&#8208;transition of perovskite surface. Bulk perovskite grows on ITO/P3CT&#8208;N and shows p&#8208;type, while its surface re&#8208;grows on ITO/SnO2 and transits to n&#8208;type, introducing an interfacial junction. Resulting inverted perovskite solar cells exhibit &gt;25% efficiency with good stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after MPP tracking for 800&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The p&#8208; or n&#8208;type property of semiconductor materials directly determine the final performance of photoelectronic devices. Generally, perovskite deposited on p&#8208;type substrate tends to be p&#8208;type, while perovskite deposited on n&#8208;type substrate tends to be n&#8208;type. Motived by this, a substrate&#8208;induced re&#8208;growth strategy is reported to induce p&#8208; to n&#8208;transition of perovskite surface in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). p&#8208;type perovskite film is obtained and crystallized on p&#8208;type substrate first. Then an n&#8208;type ITO/SnO2 substrate with saturated perovskite solution is pressed onto the perovskite film and annealed to induce the secondary re&#8208;growth of perovskite surface region. As a result, p&#8208; to n&#8208;type transition happens and induces an extra junction at perovskite surface region, thus enhancing the built&#8208;in potential and promoting carrier extraction in PSCs. Resulting inverted PSCs exhibit high efficiency of over 25% with good operational stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 800&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C with ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Identifying Highly Active and Selective Cobalt X&#8208;Ides for Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinoline</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of Co X&#8208;ides are adopted as the models to investigate the catalytic behavior differences toward the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ). The Co3O4 undergoes an ideal 1,4/2,3&#8208;H* addition pathway and presents the best conversion and selectivity toward ECHQ. The key enhanced mechanism of Co3O4 toward ECHQ is demonstrated to be closely&#160;related to its favorable interfacial water adsorption and the spontaneous desorption of product.








Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant Co X&#8208;ides are emerging as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of quinoline (ECHQ), yet challenging due to the limited fundamental understanding of ECHQ mechanism on Co X&#8208;ides. This work identifies the catalytic performance differences of Co X&#8208;ides in ECHQ and provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of ECHQ. Among selected Co X&#8208;ides, the Co3O4 presents the best ECHQ performance with a high conversion of 98.2% and 100% selectivity at ambient conditions. The Co3O4 sites present a higher proportion of 2&#8208;coordinated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water at the interface than other Co X&#8208;ides at a low negative potential, which enhances the kinetics of subsequent water dissociation to produce H*. An ideal 1,4/2,3&#8208;H* addition pathway on Co3O4 surface with a spontaneous desorption of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline is demonstrated through operando tracing and theoretical calculations. In comparison, the Co9S8 sites display the lowest ECHQ performance due to the high thermodynamic barrier in the H* formation step, which suppresses subsequent hydrogenation; while the ECHQ on Co(OH)F and CoP sites undergo the 1,2,3,4&#8208; and 4,3/1,2&#8208;H* addition pathway respectively with the high desorption barriers and thus low conversion of quinoline. Moreover, the Co3O4 presents a wide substrate scope and allows excellent conversion of other quinoline derivatives and N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates.

         <title>Unveiling the Reaction Mystery Between Lithium Polysulfides and Lithium Metal Anode in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mystery of the reaction between lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and Li metal is revealed. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfony)imide (LiTFSI) slowly reacts with Li metal to form a SO42&#8722;&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). LiPSs react rapidly with Li metal to form a Li2S&#8208;rich SEI with poor stability. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) modulates the solvation structure of LiPSs to inherently suppress the reactivity of LiPSs and improves the Li anode stability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are widely regarded as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) corrode Li metal and deteriorate the cycling stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Understanding the reaction mechanism between LiPSs and Li metal anode is imperative. Herein, the reaction rate and products of LiPSs with Li metal anode, the composition and structure of the as&#8208;generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the mechanism of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) additives for inhibiting the corrosion reactions are systematically unveiled. Concretely, LiPSs react with Li metal anode more rapidly than Li salt and generate a Li2S&#8208;rich SEI. The Li2S&#8208;rich SEI is highly reactive with LiPSs, which exacerbates the formation of dendritic Li and the continuous corrosion of active Li. LiNO3 functions dominantly by modulating the solvation structure of LiPSs and inherently reducing the reactivity of LiPSs, rather than the conventional understanding of LiNO3 participating in the formation of SEI. This work reveals the reaction mechanism between LiPSs and Li metal anode and inspires rational regulating of the solvation structure of LiPSs for stabilizing Li metal anode in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Enhancing the Electrical Conductivity and Long&#8208;Term Stability of PEDOT:PSS Electrodes through Sequential Treatment with Nitric Acid and Cesium Chloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>

The conductivity of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm thin poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films is improved by treating them sequentially with HNO3 and CsCl. The resulting layers show enhanced crystallinity with electrical conductivity of up to 5500 S cm&#8722;1, with 85% of this value being retained after 270 d of storage in ambient air at room temperature without being encapsulated.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is an important polymeric conductor used extensively in organic flexible, wearable, and stretchable optoelectronics. However, further enhancing its conductivity and long&#8208;term stability while maintaining its superb mechanical properties remains challenging. Here, a novel post&#8208;treatment approach to enhance the electrical properties and stability of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thin PEDOT:PSS films processed from solution is introduced. The approach involves a sequential post&#8208;treatment with HNO3 and CsCl, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films to over 5500 S cm&#8722;1, along with improved carrier mobility. The post&#8208;treated films exhibit remarkable air stability, retaining over 85% of their initial conductivity even after 270 days of storage. Various characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Hall effect measurements, and grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering, coupled with density functional theory calculations, provide insights into the structural changes and interactions responsible for these improvements. To demonstrate the potential for practical applications, the ultrathin PEDOT:PSS films are connected to an inorganic light&#8208;emitting diode with a battery, showcasing their suitability as transparent electrodes. This work presents a promising approach for enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS while offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that can guide further advances.

         <title>Bubble&#8208;Guidance Breaking Gas Shield for Highly Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to break the gas shield by an anisotropic groove&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE) is demonstrated for achieving high&#8208;efficiency electrolytic water splitting. Gradient groove&#8208;micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high&#8208;speed bubble form, transport, and detach channels, and exhibit superior bubble&#8208;guidance capabilities, which cooperatively improve mass transfer.








Abstract
Overall water splitting is a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, but the primary challenge is removing bubbles from the electrode surface quickly to increase hydrogen production. Inspired by the directional fluid transport properties of natural biological surfaces like Nepenthes peristome and Morpho butterfly's wings, here a strategy is demonstrated to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting by a bubble&#8208;guidance electrode, that is, an anisotropic groove&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE). Gradient groove micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high&#8208;speed bubble transmission channels and exhibit superior bubble&#8208;guidance capabilities. The synergistic effect of the asymmetric Laplace pressure generated between microscale porous structure and groove patterns and the buoyancy along the groove patterns pushes the produced bubbles directionally to spread, transport, and detach from the electrode surface in time. Moreover, the low adhesive nanosheet arrays are beneficial to reduce bubble size and increase bubble release frequency, which cooperatively improve mass transfer with the microscale structure. Notably, GMPE outperforms planar&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (PMPE) in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions, with GMPE||GMPE showing better water splitting performance than commercially available RuO2||20 wt.% Pt/C. This work improves electrodes for better mass transfer and kinetics in electrochemical reactions at solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;gas interfaces, offering insight for designing and preparing gas&#8208;involved photoelectrochemical electrodes.

         <title>Monolithic DNApatite: An Elastic Apatite with Sub&#8208;Nanometer Scale Organo&#8211;Inorganic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel realization of an elastic&#8208;ceramic material, featuring &#8216;deoxyribonucleic apatite (DNApatite),&#8217; is newly synthesized, incorporating both ceramic (hydroxyapatite, HA) and polymeric (single&#8208;stranded DNA, ssDNA) elements at a sub&#8208;nm scale to overcome the limits of conventional ceramic materials. This novel non&#8208;composite material achieves synergistic effects from the combination of different material types, namely ceramic and polymer without additional phosphate ion.








Abstract
Hydroxyapatite (HA) exhibits outstanding biocompatibility, bioactivity, osteoconductivity, and natural anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Pure HA, ion&#8208;doped HA, and HA&#8208;polymer composites are investigated, but&#160;critical limitations such as brittleness remain; numerous efforts are being made to address them. Herein, the novel self&#8208;crystallization of a polymeric single&#8208;stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) without additional phosphate ions for synthesizing deoxyribonucleic apatite (DNApatite) is presented. The synthesized DNApatite, DNA1Ca2.2(PO4)1.3OH2.1, has a repetitive dual phase of inorganic HA crystals and amorphous organic ssDNA at the sub&#8208;nm scale, forming nanorods. Its mechanical properties, including toughness and elasticity, are significantly enhanced compared with those of HA nanorod, with a Young's modulus similar to that of natural bone.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Weak Polarization&#8208;Strain Coupling Effect Boosts Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the service electric field for MLCCs in pulsed circuit systems increases, electrostrain&#8208;induced vibration has become a critical failure mechanism. By employing a polarization&#8208;strain weak coupling strategy, the electrostriction coefficient of the relaxor dielectrics is significantly suppressed. This mitigation reduces the breakdown risk, enhancing the stability, performance, and lifespan of MLCCs.








Abstract
In pulse power systems, multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) encounter significant challenges due to the heightened loading electric field (E), which can lead to fatigue damage and ultrasonic concussion caused by electrostrictive strain. To address these issues, an innovative strategy focused on achieving an ultra&#8208;weak polarization&#8208;strain coupling effect is proposed, which effectively reduces strain in MLCCs. Remarkably, an ultra&#8208;low electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.012 m4 C&#8722;2 is achieved in the composition 0.55(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3&#8208;0.45Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3, resulting in a significantly reduced strain of 0.118% at 330&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. At the atomic scale, the local structural heterogeneity leads to an expanded and loose lattice structure, providing ample space for large ionic displacement polarization instead of lattice stretching when subjected to the applied E. This unique behavior not only promotes energy storage performance (ESP) but also accounts for the observed ultra&#8208;low Q33 and strain. Consequently, the MLCC device exhibits an impressive energy storage density of 14.6 J cm&#8722;3 and an ultrahigh efficiency of 93% at 720&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the superior ESP of the MLCC demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance and temperature stability, making it a promising solution for practical applications. Overall, this pivotal strategy offers a cost&#8208;effective solution for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MLCCs with ultra&#8208;low strain&#8208;vibration in pulse power systems.

         <title>Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Modulated Protonated Iridium Oxide for Acidic Water Oxidation in Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated iridium oxides, known for their durability in acidic water oxidation, have limited intrinsic catalytic performance. This study demonstrates that incorporating Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies within the Ir&#9472;O lattice can optimize oxygen intermediate binding and stabilize Ir active sites, significantly enhancing both catalytic activity and stability, leading to a highly efficient electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysers promise to usher in a new era of clean energy, but they remain a formidable obstacle in designing active and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, a protonated iridium oxide embedded with single&#8208;atom dispersed ruthenium atoms (H3.8Ir1&#8722;xRuxO4) that demonstrates exceptional activity and stability in acidic water oxidation is introduced. The single Ru dopants favorably induce localized oxygen vacancies in the Ir&#9472;O lattice, synergistically strengthening the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. In addition, the preferential oxidation of Ru and the electronegativity of the oxygen vacancies significantly stabilize the Ir&#9472;O active sites, improving the OER stability. Consequently, the H3.8Ir1&#9472;xRuxO4 catalyst shows an overpotential of 255&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and displays exceptional catalytic endurance in acidic electrolytes, surpassing 1100 h, representing a remarkable one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in stability compared to that of pristine H3.8IrO4. A proton exchange membrane electrolyser utilizing the H3.8Ir1&#8722;xRuxO4 catalyst as an anode exhibits stable performance for more than 1280 h under a high current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt&#8208;Vanadium Bimetal Catalysts for High&#8208;Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of Co&#8208;V bimetallic electrocatalyst are precisely modulated by nitrogen and phosphate anions to enhance hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, significantly promoting the performance of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer.








Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to effectively couple the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for developing high&#8208;efficiency anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). Herein, a coral&#8208;like nanoarray composed of nanosheets through the synergistic layering effect of cobalt and the 1D guiding of vanadium is synthesized, which promotes extensive contact between the active sites and electrolyte. The HER and OER activities can be enhanced by modulating the electronic structure through nitridation and phosphorization, respectively, enhancing the strength of metal&#8208;H bond to optimize hydrogen adsorption and facilitating the proton transfer to improve the transformation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Resultantly, the AEMWE achieves a current density of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.76 V for 1000 h in 1.0 M KOH at 70&#160;&#176;C. The energy consumption is 4.21 kWh Nm&#8211;3 with the producing hydrogen cost of $0.93 per kg H2. Operando synchrotron radiation and Bode phase angle analyses reveal that during the high&#8208;energy consumed OER, the dissolution of vanadium species transforms distorted Co&#8722;O octahedral into regular octahedral structures, accompanied by a shortening of the Co&#8722;Co bond length. This structural evolution facilitates the formation of oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

         <title>Efficient Permeable Monolithic Hybrid Tribo&#8208;Piezo&#8208;Electromagnetic Nanogenerator Based on Topological&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly efficient permeable and stretchable monolithic hybrid tribo&#8208;piezo&#8208;electromagnetic nanogenerator&#8208;based electronic skin is developed, by adopting a fairly facile and scalable design of two&#8208;layer porous topological insulator&#8208;piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers sandwiching liquid metal networks. It works not only as an efficient epidermal power source but also as a multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensor.








Abstract
Escalating energy demands of self&#8208;independent on&#8208;skin/wearable electronics impose challenges on corresponding power sources to offer greater power density, permeability, and stretchability. Here, a high&#8208;efficient breathable and stretchable monolithic hybrid triboelectric&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;electromagnetic nanogenerator&#8208;based electronic skin (TPEG&#8208;skin) is reported via sandwiching a liquid metal mesh with two&#8208;layer topological insulator&#8208;piezoelectric polymer composite nanofibers. TPEG&#8208;skin concurrently extracts biomechanical energy (from body motions) and electromagnetic radiations (from adjacent appliances), operating as epidermal power sources and whole&#8208;body self&#8208;powered sensors. Topological insulators with conductive surface states supply notably enhanced triboelectric and piezoelectric effects, endowing TPEG&#8208;skin with a 288&#160;V output voltage (10 N, 4&#160;Hz), &#8764;3 times that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. Liquid metal meshes serve as breathable electrodes and extract ambient electromagnetic pollution (&#177;60&#160;V, &#177;1.6&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2). TPEG&#8208;skin implements self&#8208;powered physiological and body motion monitoring and system&#8208;level human&#8208;machine interactions. This study provides compatible energy strategies for on&#8208;skin/wearable electronics with high power density, monolithic device integration, and multifunctionality.

Hybrid Biointerface Engineering
In article number 2401495, Wei Tao, Sicen Wang, Xiaoyu Xie, and co&#8208;workers present a novel biointerface&#8208;engineered hybrid nanovesicle (P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL), achieved by integrating M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;conjugated liposomes. The designed P&#8208;I@M1E/AAL nanoplatform combines multiple treatment modalities, offering a promising therapeutic approach to overcome the challenges of the hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. By reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and enhancing tumor&#8208;targeted photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy, this platform shows significant potential for improving anti&#8208;tumor treatment outcomes.

Ultrastrong Soft Pneumatic Actuation
In article number 2403954, Yang Qu, Wei Tang, Jun Zou, and co&#8208;workers have developed an ultra&#8208;strong pneumatic source enabled by programmable chemical reactions. By integrating thermoelectric materials and &#8220;pre&#8208;programming strategy&#8221; into the management of reversible reactions, a soft pneumatic actuation is realized with high regulation, high pressure, and the ability to transport gas over long distances. The soft pneumatic actuation is successfully applied to soft assistive wearables, haptic devices, and sightseeing car lifting.

Proximal High&#8208;Index Metamaterials from Gold Nanohexagons
Plasmonic nanoparticles, when arranged into periodic structures known as superlattices, can form metamaterials capable of manipulating light&#8208;matter interactions. In article number 2405650, Gi&#8208;Ra Yi and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the large&#8208;scale fabrication of a planar plasmonic superlattice composed of edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembled gold nanohexagons with precisely controlled gap proximities. The resulting metamaterial exhibits unprecedentedly high refractive index values in the near&#8208;infrared spectrum, surpassing the refractive index limits of naturally occurring materials.

siRNA co&#8208;Delivery
With a novel identified target of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;derived microfibrillar&#8208;associated protein 5 (MFAP&#8208;5), ABC&#8208;triblock copolymer based multicompartment polyion complex micelle (PICM) deliver siRNA against MFAP&#8208;5 and the cationic amphiphilic drug desloratadine simultaneously. The codelivery of desloratadine facilitates intracellular siRNA delivery, resulting in knockdown of MFAP&#8208;5 and significantly reduce tumor burden in a mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma. More details can be found in article number 2404784 by Heyang Zhang, Leonard Kaps, Matthias Barz, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Innovative Formulation Platform: Paving the Way for Superior Protein Therapeutics with Enhanced Efficacy and Broadened Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein therapeutics hold great promise for treating various diseases, yet their delivery remains challenging. This review introduces &#8220;Pcapsulation,&#8221; a protein formulation technology. Specifically, this review details the material design and summarizes the applications of formulated proteins across metabolic disorders, cancer, infectious diseases, and nervous system diseases. Perspectives on the future directions of protein delivery are also discussed.








Abstract
Protein therapeutics offer high therapeutic potency and specificity; the broader adoptions and development of protein therapeutics, however, have been constricted by their intrinsic limitations such as inadequate stability, immunogenicity, suboptimal pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and off&#8208;target effects. This review describes a platform technology that formulates individual protein molecules with a thin formulation layer of crosslinked polymers, which confers the protein therapeutics with high activity, enhanced stability, controlled release capability, reduced immunogenicity, improved pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and ability to cross the blood brain barriers. Based on currently approved protein therapeutics, this formulating platform affords the development of a vast family of superior protein therapeutics with improved efficacy and broadened indications at significantly reduced cost.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses the interfacial Na+ migration, desolvation, and deposition behaviors of sodium&#8208;metal anode in terms of fundamental understanding, influencing factors and optimization strategies, anode&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal batteries, advanced characterization techniques, etc.








Abstract
Interfacial Na+ behaviors of sodium (Na) anode severely threaten the stability of sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs). This review systematically and in&#8208;depth discusses the current fundamental understanding of interfacial Na+ behaviors in SMBs including Na+ migration, desolvation, diffusion, nucleation, and deposition. The key influencing factors and optimization strategies of these behaviors are further summarized and discussed. More importantly, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are highlighted by addressing key issues in the areas of limited Na sources and irreversible Na loss. Simultaneously, recent advanced characterization techniques for deeper insights into interfacial Na+ deposition behavior and composition information of SEI film are spotlighted to provide guidance for the advancement of SMBs and AFSMBs. Finally, the prominent perspectives are presented to guide and promote the development of SMBs and AFSMBs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Antimony Selenide Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports recent advances in Sb2Se3 photodetectors (PDs), focusing on fundamental characteristics, nanostructure tuning, applications in heart rate monitoring, and monolithic integrated matrix imaging. The challenges, including the broadening of the detection range, the reduction of dark current, and the potential applications of flexible devices are highlighted, which provide a valuable reference for Sb2Se3 PDs and expand application areas.








Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) rapidly capture optical signals and convert them into electrical signals, making them indispensable in a variety of applications including imaging, optical communication, remote sensing, and biological detection. Recently, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has achieved remarkable progress due to its earth&#8208;abundant, low toxicity, low price, suitable bandgap width, high absorption coefficient, and unique structural characteristics. Sb2Se3 has been extensively studied in solar cells, but there's a lack of timely updates in the field of PDs. A literature review based on Sb2Se3 PDs is urgently warranted. This review aims to provide a concise understanding of the latest progress in Sb2Se3 PDs, with a focus on the basic characteristics and the performance optimization for Sb2Se3 photoconductive&#8208;type and photodiode&#8208;type detectors, including nanostructure regulation, process optimization, and stability improvement of flexible devices. Furthermore, the application progresses of Sb2Se3 PDs in heart rate monitoring, and monolithic&#8208;integrated matrix images are introduced. Finally, this review presents various strategies with potential and feasibility to address challenges for the rapid development and commercial application of Sb2Se3 PDs.

         <title>Asymmetric Microenvironment Tailoring Strategies of Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction and CO2 Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work first presents the frequently&#8208;used experimental synthesis and characterization methods of dual&#8208;atom catalysts. Then, four synergistic catalytic mechanisms, including cascade, assistance, co&#8208;adsorption and bifunction mechanisms, are summarized. The emphasis is placed on four asymmetric microenvironment modulating strategies, including active site asymmetric strategy, transverse/axial&#8208;modification engineering, distance engineering and strain engineering, and their effects on oxygen/carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with atomically dispersed dual&#8208;sites, as an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), have recently become a new hot topic in heterogeneous catalysis due to their maximized atom efficiency and dual&#8208;site diverse synergy, because the synergistic diversity of dual&#8208;sites achieved by asymmetric microenvironment tailoring can efficiently boost the catalytic activity by optimizing the electronic structure of DACs. Here, this work first summarizes the frequently&#8208;used experimental synthesis and characterization methods of DACs. Then, four synergistic catalytic mechanisms (cascade mechanism, assistance mechanism, co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and bifunction mechanism) and four key modulating methods (active site asymmetric strategy, transverse/axial&#8208;modification engineering, distance engineering and strain engineering) are elaborated comprehensively. The emphasis is placed on the effects of asymmetric microenvironment of DACs on oxygen/carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, some perspectives and outlooks are also addressed. In short, the review summarizes a useful asymmetric microenvironment tailoring strategy to speed up synthesis of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for different reactions.

         <title>The Reinforced Separation of Intractable Gas Mixtures by Using Porous Adsorbents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 41, October 10, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the broad range of intractable gas mixtures, it is urgently necessitated to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art porous adsorbents used in this field. Herein, the review systematically summarizes the recent advancements in inorganic small molecules and light hydrocarbon separation, categorizes their separation modes, highlights the functionalization strategies of materials, and finally provides new insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships and future challenges.








Abstract
This review focuses on the mechanism and driving force in the intractable gas separation using porous adsorbents. A variety of intractable mixtures have been discussed, including air separation, carbon capture, and hydrocarbon purification. Moreover, the separation systems are categorized according to distinctly biased modes depending on the minor differences in the kinetic diameter, dipole/quadruple moment, and polarizability of the adsorbates, or sorted by the varied separation occasions (e.g., CO2 capture from flue gas or air) and driving forces (thermodynamic and kinetic separation, molecular sieving). Each section highlights the functionalization strategies for porous materials, like synthesis condition optimization and organic group modifications for porous carbon materials, cation exchange and heteroatom doping for zeolites, and metal node&#8208;organic ligand adjustments for MOFs. These functionalization strategies are subsequently associated with enhanced adsorption performances (capacity, selectivity, structural/thermal stability, moisture resistance, etc.) toward the analog gas mixtures. Finally, this review also discusses future challenges and prospects for using porous materials in intractable gas separation. Therein, the combination of theoretical calculation with the synthesis condition and adsorption parameters optimization of porous adsorbents may have great potential, given its fast targeting of candidate adsorbents and deeper insights into the adsorption forces in the confined pores and cages.

         <title>Scalable Atomic Arrays for Spin&#8208;Based Quantum Computers in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;implanted silicon donor spin qubits afford exceptional quantum performance and show promise for the maturation to powerful quantum computers using standard semiconductor industry processes. This study presents a comprehensive technological suite for the scalable deterministic construction of donor&#8208;based qubit and qudit arrays that could be used as quantum processor architectures.








Abstract
Semiconductor spin qubits combine excellent quantum performance with the prospect of manufacturing quantum devices using industry&#8208;standard metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) processes. This applies also to ion&#8208;implanted donor spins, which further afford exceptional coherence times and large Hilbert space dimension in their nuclear spin. Here multiple strategies are demonstrated and integrated to manufacture scale&#8208;up donor&#8208;based quantum computers. 31PF2 molecule implants are used to triple the placement certainty compared to 31P ions, while attaining 99.99% confidence in detecting the implant. Similar confidence is retained by implanting heavier atoms such as 123Sb and 209Bi, which represent high&#8208;dimensional qudits for quantum information processing, while Sb2 molecules enable deterministic formation of closely&#8208;spaced qudits. The deterministic formation of regular arrays of donor atoms with 300&#160;nm spacing is demonstrated, using step&#8208;and&#8208;repeat implantation through a nano aperture. These methods cover the full gamut of technological requirements for the construction of donor&#8208;based quantum computers in silicon.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic covalent organic frameworks (ICOFs) are porous and crystalline materials with ionic moieties installed on the backbone. They can conduct ions selectively, rapidly, and reliably. Recent efforts to improve ionic conductivity, lower manufacturing cost, and reduce contact resistance will enable nicely balanced ICOF electrolytes for the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable secondary batteries, widely used in modern technology, are essential for mobile and consumer electronic devices and energy storage applications. Lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries are currently the most popular choice due to their decent energy density. However, the increasing demand for higher energy density has led to the development of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Despite their potential, the commonly used liquid electrolyte&#8208;based LMBs present serious safety concerns, such as dendrite growth and the risk of fire and explosion. To address these issues, using solid&#8208;state electrolytes in batteries has emerged as a promising solution. In this Perspective, recent advancements are discussed in ionic covalent organic framework (ICOFs)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes, identify current challenges in the field, and propose future research directions. Highly crystalline ion conductors with polymeric versatility show promise as the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Specifically, the use of anionic or cationic COFs is examined for Li&#8208;based batteries, highlight the high interfacial resistance caused by the intrinsic brittleness of crystalline ICOFs as the main limitation, and presents innovative ideas for developing all&#8208; and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries using ICOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes. With these considerations and further developments, the potential for ICOFs is optimistic about enabling the realization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Sheet&#8208;Type Sulfide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Dual&#8208;Function Li4.4Si Alloy&#8208;Modified Nano Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regarding the large&#8208;scale fabrication of sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), silicon anode and thin free&#8208;standing sulfide electrolyte membranes are employed simultaneously toward potentially practical application. Dual&#8208;function Li4.4Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li4.4Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li+ but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling.








Abstract
The silicon&#8208;based anodes are one of the promising anodes to achieve the high energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Nano silicon (nSi) is considered as a suitable anode material for assembling sheet&#8208;type sulfide ASSBs using thin free&#8208;standing Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) membrane without causing short circuit. However, nSi anodes face a significant challenge in terms of rapid capacity degradation during cycling. To address this issue, dual&#8208;function Li4.4Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li4.4Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li+ but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling. Sheet&#8208;type ASSBs equipped with the Li4.4Si modified nSi anode, thin LPSC membrane, and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM811) cathode demonstrate exceptional cycle stability, with a capacity retention of 96.16% at 0.5 C (1.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) after 100 cycles and maintain stability for 400 cycles. Furthermore, a remarkable cell&#8208;level energy density of 303.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved at a high loading of 5.22 mAh cm&#8722;2, representing a leading level of sulfide ASSBs using electrolyte membranes at room temperature. Consequently, the chemically stable slurry process implemented in the fabrication of Li4.4Si&#8208;modified nSi anode sheet paves the way for scalable applications of high&#8208;performance sulfide ASSBs.

Nano silicon (nSi) is considered as a suitable anode material for assembling sheet-type sulfide ASSBs using thin free-standing Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (LPSC) membrane without causing short circuit. However, nSi anodes face a significant challenge in terms of rapid capacity degradation during cycling. To address this issue, dual-function Li&lt;sub&gt;4.4&lt;/sub&gt;Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li&lt;sub&gt;4.4&lt;/sub&gt;Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling. Sheet-type ASSBs equipped with the Li&lt;sub&gt;4.4&lt;/sub&gt;Si modified nSi anode, thin LPSC membrane, and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.11&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811) cathode demonstrate exceptional cycle stability, with a capacity retention of 96.16% at 0.5 C (1.18&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) after 100 cycles and maintain stability for 400 cycles. Furthermore, a remarkable cell-level energy density of 303.9&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved at a high loading of 5.22 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, representing a leading level of sulfide ASSBs using electrolyte membranes at room temperature. Consequently, the chemically stable slurry process implemented in the fabrication of Li&lt;sub&gt;4.4&lt;/sub&gt;Si-modified nSi anode sheet paves the way for scalable applications of high-performance sulfide ASSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Topotactic Phase Transition Achieving Superconducting Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of many new complex oxides involves topotactic reduction&#8212;a process used to alter electronic structure through the removal of specific oxygen ions. The reaction can be damaging to the crystal lattice, however, and little is known about the reduction process in ultrathin films. Li et&#160;al. observed the reaction in situ using synchrotron X&#8208;ray methods to probe formation of the superconducting nickelate, Nd0.8 Sr0.2NiO2, providing key insights into the nature of the phase transition.








Abstract
Topotactic reduction is critical to a wealth of phase transitions of current interest, including synthesis of the superconducting nickelate Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2, reduced from the initial Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. Due to the highly sensitive and often damaging nature of the topotactic reduction, however, only a handful of research groups have been able to reproduce the superconductivity results. A series of in situ synchrotron&#8208;based investigations reveal that this is due to the necessary formation of an initial, ultrathin layer at the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 surface that helps to mediate the introduction of hydrogen into the film such that apical oxygens are first removed from the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 / SrTiO3 (001) interface and delivered into the reducing environment. This allows the square&#8208;planar / perovskite interface to stabilize and propagate from the bottom to the top of the film without the formation of interphase defects. Importantly, neither geometric rotations in the square planar structure nor significant incorporation of hydrogen within the films is detected, obviating its need for superconductivity. These findings unveil the structural basis underlying the transformation pathway and provide important guidance on achieving the superconducting phase in reduced nickelate&#160;systems.

         <title>Functional Thermoplastic Polyurethane Elastomers with &#945;, &#969;&#8208;Hydroxyl End&#8208;Functionalized Polyacrylates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is developed by integrating &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl terminal&#8208;functionalized polyacrylate into the soft segment of traditional polyether polyol. This TPU exhibits exceptional toughness and self&#8208;healing properties, making it unique among standard TPUs. Furthermore, the inclusion of photo&#8208;crosslinkable moiety in the polyacrylate polyol has&#160;successfully demonstrated the first TPU that combines superior elastomeric qualities with photopatterning capabilities.








Abstract
Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is an essential class of materials for demanding applications, from soft robotics and electronics to medical devices and batteries. However, traditional TPU development is primarily relied on specific soft segments, such as polyether, polyester, and polycarbonate polyols. Here, a novel method is introduced for developing TPU elastomers with enhanced performance and superior functionalities compared to conventional TPUs, achieved through the use of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates. This approach involves a defect&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates through visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoiniferter polymerization. By strategically blending these functionalized polyacrylates with conventional polyols, TPUs that exhibit exceptional toughness and notable self&#8208;healing capabilities, traits rarely found in existing TPUs are engineered. Furthermore, incorporating photo&#8208;crosslinkable acrylic monomers has enabled the creation of the first TPU with superior elastomeric properties and photopatterning capabilities. This approach paves the way for a new direction in polyurethane engineering, introducing a novel class of soft segments and unlocking the potential for a wide range of advanced applications.

         <title>Soft, Tough, Antifatigue Fracture Elastomer Composites with Low Thermal Resistance through Synergistic Crack Pinning and Interfacial Slippage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, extreme fracture tough and antifatigue fracture polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite is developed by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The elastomer composite also maintains low thermal resistance, which makes it highly promising for thermal interface applications in heat dissipation of electronic devices.








Abstract
Soft elastomer composites are promising functional materials for engineer interfaces, where the miniaturized electronic devices have triggered increasing demand for effective heat dissipation, high fracture energy, and antifatigue fracture. However, such a combination of these properties can be rarely met in the same elastomer composites simultaneously. Here a strategy is presented to fabricate a soft, extreme fracture tough (3316&#160;J m&#8722;2) and antifatigue fracture (1052.56&#160;J m&#8315;2) polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite. These outstanding properties are achieved by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The dangling chains that lengthen the polymer chains between cross&#8208;linked points pin the cracks and the rigid fillers obstruct the cracks, enhancing the energy per unit area needed for fatigue failure. The dangling chains also promote polymer/filler interfacial slippage, enabling effective deflection and blunting of an advancing crack tip, thus enhancing mechanical energy dissipation. Moreover, the elastomer composite exhibits low thermal resistance (&#8776;0.12&#160;K cm2 W&#8722;1), due to the formation of a thermally conductive network. These remarkable characteristics render this elastomer composite promising for application as a thermal interface material in electronic devices.

         <title>Critical&#8208;Layered MoS2 for the Enhancement of Supercontinuum Generation in Photonic Crystal Fibre</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state 2D optical layers with ultrahigh nonlinearity are subtly integrated into the commercial photonic crystal fiber to boost its supercontinuum generation efficiency. The hybrid MoS2&#8208;PCF demonstrates a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning and manifests a critical&#8208;layered characteristic that only work under a real 2D regime.








Abstract
Supercontinuum generation (SCG) from silica&#8208;based photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) is of highly technological significance from microscopy to metrology, but has been hindered by silica's relatively low intrinsic optical nonlinearity. The prevailing approaches of filling PCF with nonlinear gases or liquids can endow fibre with enhanced optical nonlinearity and boosted SCG efficiency, yet these hybrids are easily plagued by fusion complexity, environmental incompatibility or transmission mode instability. Here this work presents&#160;a strategy of embedding solid&#8208;state 2D MoS2 atomic layers into the air&#8208;holes of PCF to efficiently enhance SCG. This work demonstrates a 4.8 times enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient and a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning in the MoS2&#8208;PCF hybrid. Furthermore, this work finds that the SCG enhancement is highly layer&#8208;dependent, which only manifests for a real 2D regime within the thickness of five atomic layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the critical thickness arises from the trade&#8208;off among the layer&#8208;dependent enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient, leakage of fundamental mode and redshift of zero&#8208;dispersion wavelength. This work provides significant advances toward efficient SCG, and highlights the importance of matching an appropriate atomic layer number in the design of functional 2D material optical fibers.

This work demonstrates a 4.8 times enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient and a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning in the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PCF hybrid. Furthermore, this work finds that the SCG enhancement is highly layer-dependent, which only manifests for a real 2D regime within the thickness of five atomic layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the critical thickness arises from the trade-off among the layer-dependent enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient, leakage of fundamental mode and redshift of zero-dispersion wavelength. This work provides significant advances toward efficient SCG, and highlights the importance of matching an appropriate atomic layer number in the design of functional 2D material optical fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concurrent Amorphization and Nanocatalyst Formation in Cu&#8208;Substituted Perovskite Oxide Surface: Effects on Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface amorphization and the nanocatalysts ex&#8208;solution are concurrently evolved on Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; through a straightforward reduction process with prolonged time. The investigation focuses on understanding the evolution process of these phenomena and identifying the factors that contribute to improvements in performance and durability. These findings offer a practical and novel strategy for designing catalysts with redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.








Abstract
The activity and durability of chemical/electrochemical catalysts are significantly influenced by their surface environments, highlighting the importance of thoroughly examining the catalyst surface. Here, Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; is selected, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), to explore the real&#8208;time evolution of surface morphology and chemistry under a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, in a pioneering observation, it is discovered that the perovskite surface starts to amorphize at an unusually low temperature of approximately 100 &#176;C and multicomponent metal nanocatalysts additionally form on the amorphous surface as the temperature raises to 400 &#176;C. Moreover, this investigation into the stability of the resulting amorphous layer under oxidizing conditions reveals that the amorphous structure can withstand a high&#8208;temperature oxidizing atmosphere (&#8805;650 &#176;C) only when it has undergone sufficient reduction for an extended period. Therefore, the coexistence of the active nanocatalysts and defective amorphous surface leads to a nearly 100% enhancement in the electrode resistance for the ORR over 200 h without significant degradation. These observations provide a new catalytic design strategy for using redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.

         <title>Molecule Anchoring Strategy Promotes Vertically Homogeneous Crystallization and Aligned Interfaces for Efficient Pb&#8211;Sn Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandem Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule anchoring strategy is proposed to construct Pb&#8211;Sn perovskite film with vertically aligned crystals and optimized interfaces, which produces narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% and a record&#8208;high fill factor of 82.14%. Corresponding four&#8208;terminal (4T) all&#8208;perovskite tandem device achieves a PCE of 27.1%.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) Pb&#8211;Sn perovskites are ideal candidates as rear subcell in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Because Pb&#8211;Sn perovskites contain multiple components, the rational regulation of vertical structure and both interfaces of the film is primarily crucial to achieve high&#8208;performing NBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a molecule anchoring strategy is developed to in situ construct Cs0.1MA0.3FA0.6Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite film with vertically aligned crystals and optimized interfaces. Specifically, l&#8208;alanine methyl ester is developed as an anchoring additive to induce the vertical crystal growth, while PEA2PbI3SCN film is introduced to promote the homogeneous crystallization at the buried interface via SCN&#8722; anchoring with cations. Further ethylenediamine dihalides (EDA(I/Cl)2) post&#8208;treatment leads to the gradient energy level alignment on the film surface. Pb&#8211;Sn PSCs based on such film show efficient charge transport and extraction, producing a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% with an impressive fill factor of 82.14%. Notably, combining with semitransparent 1.78 eV wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs, the four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem device achieves a PCE of 27.1%. This work opens up a new pathway to boost the performance of Pb&#8211;Sn PSCs and their tandem devices.

         <title>A Degradable Bioelectronic Scaffold for Localized Cell Transfection toward Enhancing Wound Healing in a 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The repair patch achieves synchronized healing of the epidermis and dermis layers of large skin wounds in a 3D space by providing a spatial distribution scaffold for repair&#8208;related cells and increasing the secretion of healing&#8208;related factors, and this repair method not only significantly shortens the healing time but also leads to skin characteristics that are more normal after healing.








Abstract
Large skin wounds, with extensive surface area and deep vertical full&#8208;thickness involvement, can pose significant challenges in clinical settings. Traditional routes for repairing skin wounds encompass three hallmarks: 1) scab formation for hemostasis; 2) proliferation and migration of epidermal cells for wound closure; 3) proliferation, migration, and functionalization of fibroblasts and endothelial cells for dermal remodeling. However, this route face remarkable challenges to healing large wounds, usually leading to disordered structures and loss of functions in the regenerated skin, due to limited control on the transition among the three stages. In this work, an implantable bioelectronics is developed that enables the synchronization of the three stages, offering accelerated and high&#8208;quality healing of large skin wounds. The system efficiently electro&#8208;transfect local cells near the wounds, forcing cellular proliferation, while providing a 3D porous environments for synchronized migration of epidermal and dermal cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the system achieved synchronous progression of multiple layers within the wounds, leading to the reconstruction of a complete skin structure similar to healthy skin, which presents a new avenue for the clinical translation of large wound healing.

         <title>Fourier Surfaces Reaching Full&#8208;Color Diffraction Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising demand for transformative optical devices derives the importance of optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs) minimizing optical loss of diffraction. To address the current&#160;challenges of OFSs regarding scalability and full&#8208;color diffraction, an integrative manufacturing strategy is presented for the first realization of scalable and fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental diffraction limits at the full&#8208;visible regimes.








Abstract
Optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), characterized by sinusoidally profiled diffractive optical elements, can outperform traditional binary&#8208;type counterparts by minimizing optical noise through selectively driving diffraction at desired frequencies. While scanning probe lithography (SPL), gray&#8208;scale electron beam lithography (EBL), and holographic inscriptions are effective for fabricating OFSs, achieving full&#8208;color diffractions at fundamental efficiency limits is challenging. Here, an integrated manufacturing process is presented, validated theoretically and experimentally, for fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental limit of diffraction efficiency. Leveraging holographic inscriptions and soft nanoimprinting, this approach effectively addresses challenges in conventional OFS manufacturing, enabling scalable production of noise&#8208;free and maximally efficient OFSs with record&#8208;high throughput (1010&#8211;1012 &#181;m2&#160;h&#8722;1), surpassing SPL and EBL by 1010 times. Toward this end, a wafer&#8208;scale OFSs array is demonstrated consisting of full&#8208;color diffractive gratings, color graphics, and microlenses by the one&#8208;step nanoimprinting, which is readily compatible with rapid prototyping of OFSs even on curved panels, demanding for transformative optical devices such as augmented and virtual reality displays.

         <title>Toward Predicting the Formation of Integral&#8208;Asymmetric, Isoporous Diblock Copolymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly and nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (SNIPS) of block copolymers and solvents enable the fabrication of integral&#8208;asymmetric, isoporous membranes. Using large&#8208;scale particle simulations, the dependence of the membrane morphology on structural, thermodynamic (e.g., incompatibility between matrix&#8208;forming block and nonsolvent), kinetic (e.g., vitrification threshold), and process parameters (e.g., duration of EISA) is predicted. Examining the top layer and substructure,&#160;the findings are verified through experiment.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly and nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (SNIPS) process of block copolymers and solvents enables the fabrication of integral&#8208;asymmetric, isoporous membranes. An isoporous top layer is formed by evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) and imparts selectivity for ultrafiltration of functional macromolecules or water purification. This selective layer is&#160;supported by a macroporous bottom structure that is formed by nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (NIPS) providing mechanical stability. Thereby the permeability/selectivity tradeoff is optimized. The SNIPS fabrication involves various physical phenomena&#8212;e.g.,&#160;evaporation, self&#8208;assembly, macrophase separation, vitrification &#8211; and multiple structural, thermodynamic, kinetic, and process parameters. Optimizing membrane properties and rationally designing fabrication processes is a challenge which particle simulation can significantly contribute to. Using large&#8208;scale particle simulations, it is observed that 1) a small incompatibility between matrix&#8208;forming block of the copolymer and nonsolvent, 2) a glassy arrest that occurs at a smaller polymer concentration, or 3) a higher dynamical contrast between polymer and solvent results in a finer, spongy substructure, whereas the opposite parameter choice gives rise to larger macropores with an elongated shape. These observations are confirmed by comparison to experiments on polystyrene (PS)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) diblock copolymer membranes, varying the chemical nature of the coagulant or the temperature of coagulation&#160;bath.

         <title>Flexible Single Microwire X&#8208;Ray Detector with Ultrahigh Sensitivity for Portable Radiation Detection System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible X&#8208;ray detector based on a single Ga2O3:In microwire is demonstrated, which exhibits excellent sensitivity and low detection limits. Then, based on this, a portable X&#8208;ray detection system that can detect X&#8208;rays in real&#8208;time is prepared. This work is of great significance for the development of sensitive, stable, and low false alarm rate X&#8208;ray detector.








Abstract
Sensitive, flexible, and low false alarm rate X&#8208;ray detector is crucial for medical diagnosis, industrial inspection, and scientific research. However, most semiconductors for X&#8208;ray detectors are susceptible to interference from ambient light, and their high thickness hinders their application in wearable electronics. Herein, a flexible visible&#8208;blind and ultraviolet&#8208;blind X&#8208;ray detector based on Indium&#8208;doped Gallium oxide (Ga2O3:In) single microwire is prepared. Joint experiment&#8722;theory characterizations reveal that the Ga2O3:In microwire possess a high crystal quality, large band gap, and satisfactory stability, and reliability. On this basis, an extraordinary sensitivity of 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 67.4&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 are achieved based on the prepared Ag/Ga2O3:In/Ag device, which has outstanding operation stability and excellent high temperature stability. Taking advantage of the flexible properties of the single microwire, a portable X&#8208;ray detection system is demonstrated that shows the potential to adapt to flexible and lightweight formats. The proposed X&#8208;ray detection system enables real&#8208;time monitor for X&#8208;rays, which can be displayed on the user interface. More importantly, it has excellent resistance to natural light interference, showing a low false alarm rate. This work provides a feasible method for exploring high&#8208;performance flexible integrated micro/nano X&#8208;ray detection devices.

         <title>Achieving Super&#8208;Metallophobicity on Silicon&#8208;based Ceramics at High Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;metallophobivity is achieved on silicon&#8208;based ceramics at high temperature by various non&#8208;ferrous molten metals (T&gt; 523&#160;K). The extraordinary property is induced by distinctive thermodynamic and dynamic wetting behavior on micro&#8208;nanostructured surface of Si2N2O, which offers worthy insights for expansive applications such as metallurgy, 3D printing and semiconductor industry and so on.








Abstract
As a critical concept in physical chemistry, superwettability is widely concerned in both fundamental science and practical engineering in past few decades. Despite this, investigation on high temperature superwettability is still a void, which is significant both in scientific and industrial fields. Herein, a ceramic with specific high temperature non&#8208;wetting property, Si2N2O is proposed. Compared with other materials, Si2N2O is elucidated with better practical non&#8208;wetting property against various non&#8208;ferrous metals. Combining with micro&#8208;nanostructures, the metallophobicity is further improved (contact angle &gt;150&#176; and contact angle hysteresis &#8776;0&#176;). The extraordinary metal repellency is defined as &#8220;super&#8208;metallophobicity&#8221;, which is proved to be induced by distinctive thermodynamic and dynamic wetting behavior on the rough surface. The research of super&#8208;metallophobicity not only sheds light on superwettability at high temperature, but also offers worthy insights for future potential material design in a wide range of applications, such as metallurgy, 3D printing and semiconductor industry.

         <title>Blue Laser Triggered Hemostatic Peptide Hydrogel for Gastrointestinal Bleeding Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) consists of a self&#8208;assembly peptide (PFV) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) to induce ultrafast hemostasis. Moreover, HPH can be triggered by blue laser endoscopy (BLE) for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment.








Abstract
In an emergency, nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB), endoscopic hemostasis is considered the gold standard intervention. However, current endoscopic hemostasis is very challenging to manage bleeding in large&#8208;diameter or deep lesions highly prone to rebleeding risk. Herein, a novel hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) is reported, consisting of a self&#8208;assembly peptide sequence CFLIVIGSIIVPGDGVPGDG (PFV) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), which can be triggered by blue laser endoscopy (BLE) for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment without recurring bleeding concerns. Upon contact with GelMA solution, PFV immediately fibrillates into &#946;&#8208;sheet nanofiber and solvent&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly to form HPH gel. HPH nanofiber networks induced ultrafast coagulation by enveloping blood cells and activating platelets and coagulation factors even to the blood with coagulopathy. Besides its remarkable hemostatic performance in artery and liver injury models, HPH achieves instant bleeding management in porcine NVUGIB models within 60&#160;s by preventing the rebleeding risk. This work demonstrates an extraordinary hemostatic agent for NVUGIB intervention by BLE for the first time, broadening potential application scenarios, including patients with coagulopathy and promising clinical prospects.

         <title>3D&#8208;Mapping and Manipulation of Photocurrent in an Optoelectronic Diamond Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical currents flowing inside diamond are detected in three dimensions using the charge state of nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) defects, which act as a trip&#8208;wire detector for hole current. Time&#8208;resolved imaging and direct measurement of photocurrent is combined with optical engineering of nitrogen impurities to reveal the complex dynamics of charge transport in a wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor.








Abstract
Establishing connections between material impurities and charge transport properties in emerging electronic and quantum materials, such as wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, demands new diagnostic methods tailored to these unique systems. Many such materials host optically&#8208;active defect centers which offer a powerful in situ characterization system, but one that typically relies on the weak spin&#8208;electric field coupling to measure electronic phenomena. In this work, charge&#8208;state sensitive optical microscopy is combined with photoelectric detection of an array of nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers to directly image the flow of charge carriers inside a diamond optoelectronic device, in 3D and with temporal resolution. Optical control is used to change the charge state of background impurities inside the diamond on&#8208;demand, resulting in drastically different current flow such as filamentary channels nucleating from specific, defective regions of the device. Conducting channels that control carrier flow, key steps toward optically reconfigurable, wide&#8208;bandgap optoelectronics are then engineered using light. This work might be extended to probe other wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors (SiC, GaN) relevant to present and emerging electronic and quantum&#160;technologies.

         <title>Impregnate Carbonation: CO2&#8208;Guided In Situ Growth of Robust Superhydrophobic Structures on Concrete Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by concrete carbonation phenomenon, a method for in situ growing superhydrophobic concrete surface is proposed: Concrete is impregnated in Mg2+&#8208;silane solution for carbonation. Mg2+ irregularly segments the morphology of CaCO3, and silane lowers the surface energy. The concrete by impregnate carbonation is divided into a three&#8208;layer structure of superhydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic, providing stable waterproof protection for the hydrophilic matrix.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces applying on concrete can greatly improve the durability of concrete by preventing the damage from water. However, traditional design of superhydrophobic concrete surfaces by external coating encounters to problems of flaking and poor surface robustness, while that by adding hydrophobic agents or particles faces the challenges of strength damage of concrete. Drawing inspiration from the carbonation phenomenon of concrete, here a new design of in situ growing superhydrophobic structures on concrete is proposed: The concrete sample is impregnated into Mg2+&#8208;containing silane&#8211;water system with continuous CO2 injection. The contact angle of the concrete surface achieves 171.9&#176; without obvious strength decrease after 120 min, which are mainly attributed to the formation of CaxMg1&#8722;xCO3 crystals with micro&#8208;nano&#8208;structures and the reduction of carbonates surface energy by silane. This superhydrophobic concrete structure can be divided into a superhydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic three layers structure, providing the stable water&#8208;proof protection under mechanical fatigue, capillary water absorption, UV aging, sulfate attack, and impurity water impact tests due to the in situ growing robust superhydrophobic structures. Furthermore, it captures 29.80&#160;g&#160;m&#8722;2 CO2 during the reaction process, providing new insights for the design and preparation of eco&#8208;friendly superhydrophobic concrete.

         <title>Direct Observations of Spontaneous In&#8208;Plane Electronic Polarization in 2D Te Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;element tellurium (Te) films are experimentally demonstrated to host an in&#8208;plane spontaneous electronic polarization, evident with reversed band&#8208;bending trends at opposite polarization edges in spatially resolved spectra and conductance mappings. The imaged moir&#233; superlattice can be effectively tuned at the polarization edges. The polarization can survive irrespective of the film thickness and supporting substrates, validating its robustness and universality.








Abstract
Single&#8208;element polarization in low dimensions is fascinating for constructing next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics with multiple functionalities, yet remains difficult to access with satisfactory performance. Here, spectroscopic evidences are presented for the spontaneous electronic polarization in tellurium (Te) films thinned down to bilayer, characterized by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The unique chiral structure and centrosymmetry&#8208;breaking character in 2D&#160;Te gives rise to sizable in&#8208;plane polarization with accumulated charges, which is demonstrated by the reversed band&#8208;bending trends at opposite polarization edges in spatially resolved spectra and conductance mappings. The polarity of charges exhibits intriguing influence on imaging the moir&#233; superlattice at the Te&#8208;graphene interface. Moreover, the plain spontaneous polarization robustly exists for various film thicknesses, and can universally preserve against different epitaxial substrates. The experimental validations of considerable electronic polarization in Te multilayers thus provide a realistic platform for promisingly facilitating reliable applications in microelectronic devices.

         <title>Realization of a 2D Lieb Lattice in a Metal&#8211;Inorganic Framework with Partial Flat Bands and Topological Edge States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities in the Lieb lattice, unveiling a multitude of fascinating physical phenomena, are still highly sought. Here, theoretical analysis with experimental validation is combined to explore an innovative approach circumventing structural instability to realize a 2D Lieb lattice, showcasing its partial flat bands and topological edge states.









Abstract
Flat bands and Dirac cones in materials are the source of the exotic electronic and topological properties. The Lieb lattice is expected to host these electronic structures, arising from quantum destructive interference. Nevertheless, the experimental realization of a 2D Lieb lattice remained challenging to date due to its intrinsic structural instability. After computationally designing a Platinum&#8208;Phosphorus (Pt&#8208;P) Lieb lattice, it has successfully overcome its structural instability and synthesized on a gold substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy verify the Lieb lattice's morphology and electronic flat bands. Furthermore, topological Dirac edge states stemming from pronounced spin&#8208;orbit coupling induced by heavy Pt atoms are predicted. These findings convincingly open perspectives for creating metal&#8211;inorganic framework&#8208;based atomic lattices, offering prospects for strongly correlated phases interplayed with topology.

         <title>Regulation of Molecular Microheterogeneity in Electrolytes Enables Ampere&#8208;Hour&#8208;Level Aqueous LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimally regulating molecular microheterogeneity in aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes provides an effective means to reorganize the spatial distribution of H2O molecules, isolating H2O&#8208;rich microclusters. This reorganization significantly impedes H2O activity, enhancing electrochemical stability without compromising rapid transport of Li cations. With this electrolyte design, ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level aqueous LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 pouch cell exhibits high energy density and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are attractive due to their high safety and fast reaction kinetics, but the narrow electrochemical stability window of H2O limits their applications. It is a big challenge to broaden the electrochemical operation window of aqueous electrolytes while retaining fast reaction kinetics. Here, a new organic aqueous mixture electrolyte of manipulatable (3D)&#160;molecular microheterogeneity with H2O&#8208;rich and H2O&#8208;poor domains is demonstrated. H2O&#8208;poor domains molecularly surround the reformed microclusters of H2O molecules through interfacial H&#8208;bonds, which thus not only inhibit the long&#8208;range transfer of H2O but also allow fast and consecutive Li+ transport. This new design enables low&#8208;voltage anodes reversibly cycling with aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes and high ionic conductivity of 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1. LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 1000 cycles under various C rates and a low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. 1 Ah pouch cell delivers a high energy density of 79.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% at 1 C over 200 cycles. This work provides new insights into the design of electrolytes based on the molecular microheterogeneity for rechargeable batteries.

With this electrolyte design, ampere-hour-level aqueous LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell exhibits high energy density and excellent cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous batteries are attractive due to their high safety and fast reaction kinetics, but the narrow electrochemical stability window of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O limits their applications. It is a big challenge to broaden the electrochemical operation window of aqueous electrolytes while retaining fast reaction kinetics. Here, a new organic aqueous mixture electrolyte of manipulatable (3D)&#160;molecular microheterogeneity with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-rich and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-poor domains is demonstrated. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-poor domains molecularly surround the reformed microclusters of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules through interfacial H-bonds, which thus not only inhibit the long-range transfer of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O but also allow fast and consecutive Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. This new design enables low-voltage anodes reversibly cycling with aqueous-based electrolytes and high ionic conductivity of 4.5 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; full cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 1000 cycles under various C rates and a low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. 1 Ah pouch cell delivers a high energy density of 79.3&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% at 1 C over 200 cycles. This work provides new insights into the design of electrolytes based on the molecular microheterogeneity for rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Lubrication and Protection of Cartilage Damage by Targeting Hydrogel Microsphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antibody&#8208;mediated targeting hydrogel microsphere is developed to specifically and precisely lubricate and protect the local injury site of early&#8208;stage osteoarthritis (OA). The in vivo experiments demonstrate that even with a single small dose injection, this precise lubrication strategy can effectively slow down the progression of early OA and alleviate the associated pain.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative bone and joint disease characterized by decreased cartilage lubrication, leading to continuous wear and ultimately irreversible damage. This situation is particularly challenging for early&#8208;stage OA, as current bio&#8208;lubricants lack precise targeting for small inflammatory lesions. In this work, an antibody&#8208;mediated targeting hydrogel microspheres (HMS) is developed to precisely lubricate the local injury site of cartilage and prevent the progression of early OA. Anti&#8208;Collagen type I (Anti&#8208;Col1) is an antibody that targets cartilage injury sites in early OA stages. It is anchored on a HMS matrix made of Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) to create targeted HMS (T&#8208;G/S HMS). The T&#8208;G/S HMS's high hydrophilicity, along with the dynamic interaction between its surficial Anti&#8208;Col1 and the Col1 on cartilage injury site, ensures its precise and effective lubrication of early OA lesions. Consequently, injecting T&#8208;G/S HMS into rats with early OA significantly slows disease progression and reduces symptoms. In conclusion, the developed injectable targeted lubricating HMS and the precisely targeted lubrication strategy represent a promising, convenient technique for treating OA, particularly for slowing the early&#8208;stage OA progression.

         <title>Tailoring Polaron Dimensions in Lead&#8208;Tin Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two bottles represent the perovskite lattices of MAPbI3 and MASn0.25Pb0.75I3, respectively. Upon photoexcitation, polarons are generated within the perovskites. The various balls illustrate polarons with different sizes. In MAPbI3, the polaron size is larger, resulting in a significantly limited polaron density. Conversely, in MASn0.25Pb0.75I3, the smaller polaron size facilitates a much higher polaron density.








Abstract
Charge carriers in the soft and polar perovskite lattice form so&#8208;called polaron quasiparticles, charge carriers dressed with a lattice deformation. The spatial extent of a polaron is governed by the material's electron&#8208;phonon interaction strength, which determines charge carrier effective mass, mobility, and the so&#8208;called Mott polaron density, that is, the maximum stable density of charge carriers that a perovskite can support. Despite its significance, controlling polaron dimensions has been challenging. Here, experimental substantial tuning of polaron dimensions is reported by lattice engineering, through Pb/Sn substitution in CH3NH3SnxPb1&#8722;xI3. The polaron dimension is deduced from the Mott polaron density, which can be composition&#8208;tuned over an order of magnitude, while charge carrier mobility occurs through band transport, and remains substantial across all compositions, ranging from 10&#160;s to 100 s&#160;cm2&#160;V s&#8722;1 at room temperature. The effective modulation of polaron size can be understood by considering the bond asymmetry after carrier injection as well as the random spatial distribution of Pb/Sn ions. This study underscores the potential for tailoring polaron dimensions, which is crucial for optimizing applications prioritizing either high charge carrier density or high mobility.

         <title>Inducing One&#8208;Step Dehydrogenation of Magnesium Borohydride via Confinement in Robust Dodecahedral Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2, realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility.








Abstract
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. The optimized mesoporous scaffold possesses an accumulated pore width of 2.65&#160;nm, high specific surface area (3955.9 m2&#160;g&#8722;1), and large pore volume (2.15 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), providing ample space for the confinement of Mg(BH4)2 particles and numerous surface active sites for interactions with the same. The confined Mg(BH4)2 system features a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 81.5&#160;&#176;C, an extremely high capacity of 10.2 wt% H2, and an almost single&#8208;step dehydrogenation profile. Moreover, the system exhibits superior capacity retention of 82.7% after 20 cycles at a moderate temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2 and realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation. The evolution of borohydride intermediates is systematically revealed throughout the cycling process. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate defective N heteroatoms within the scaffold are vital in reducing the strength of B&#9472;H bonds, and the N&#8208;doped carbon can facilitate decomposition of the irreversible MgB12H12 intermediate. This study opens up new avenues for designing robust carbon scaffolds doped with heteroatoms and analyzing intermediate evolution in nanoconfined Mg&#8208;based borohydride systems.

Assembling polar entities in structures of various shapes promises the design of the electronic properties of materials outside the beaten paths. The current perspective article suggests strategies for the application of such polar layers at hybrid interfaces, in van der Waals heterostructures, in polar metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and in covalent organic frameworks comprising pores decorated with polar groups.








Abstract
Collective electrostatic effects arise from the superposition of electrostatic potentials of periodically arranged (di)polar entities and are known to crucially impact the electronic structures of hybrid interfaces. Here, it is discussed, how they can be used outside the beaten paths of materials design for realizing systems with advanced and sometimes unprecedented properties. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by applying electrostatic design not only to metal&#8208;organic interfaces and adsorbed (complex) monolayers, but also to inter&#8208;layer interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures, to polar metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and to the cylindrical pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The presented design ideas are straightforward to simulate and especially for metal&#8208;organic interfaces also their experimental implementation has been amply demonstrated. For van der Waals heterostructures, the needed building blocks are available, while the required assembly approaches are just being developed. Conversely, for MOFs the necessary growth techniques exist, but more work on advanced linker molecules is required. Finally, COF structures exist that contain pores decorated with polar groups, but the electrostatic impact of these groups has been largely ignored so far. All this suggest that the dawn of the age of electrostatic design is currently experienced with potential breakthroughs lying ahead.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collective electrostatic effects arise from the superposition of electrostatic potentials of periodically arranged (di)polar entities and are known to crucially impact the electronic structures of hybrid interfaces. Here, it is discussed, how they can be used outside the beaten paths of materials design for realizing systems with advanced and sometimes unprecedented properties. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by applying electrostatic design not only to metal-organic interfaces and adsorbed (complex) monolayers, but also to inter-layer interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures, to polar metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and to the cylindrical pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The presented design ideas are straightforward to simulate and especially for metal-organic interfaces also their experimental implementation has been amply demonstrated. For van der Waals heterostructures, the needed building blocks are available, while the required assembly approaches are just being developed. Conversely, for MOFs the necessary growth techniques exist, but more work on advanced linker molecules is required. Finally, COF structures exist that contain pores decorated with polar groups, but the electrostatic impact of these groups has been largely ignored so far. All this suggest that the dawn of the age of electrostatic design is currently experienced with potential breakthroughs lying ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intelligent Supramolecular Modification for Implants: Endogenous Regulation of Bone Defect Repair in Osteoporosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent supramolecular modified implant surface suitable for bone defect repair under iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporosis. This intelligent surface modification tailors bone repair to individual conditions, automatically realize multiple endogenous regulation once implanted, and truly realize spontaneous activation of a series of responses conducive to bone repair in vivo. It providing new ideas for the refinement and specialized modification of the implant surface.








Abstract
Addressing osteoporosis&#8208;related bone defects, a supramolecular strategy is innovated for modifying carbon fiber reinforced polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) composites. By covalently attaching intelligent macromolecules via in situ RAFT polymerization, leveraging the unique pathological microenvironment in patients with iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporosis, intelligent supramolecular modified implant surface possesses multiple endogenous modulation capabilities. After implantation, surface brush&#8208;like macromolecules initially resist macrophage adhesion, thereby reducing the level of immune inflammation. Over time, the molecular chains undergo conformational changes due to Fe (III) mediated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, transforming into mechanistic signals. These signals are then specifically transmitted to pre&#8208;osteoblast cell through the binding capacity of the KRSR short peptide at the molecular terminus, induced their osteogenic differentiation via the YAP/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling axis. Furthermore, osteoblasts secrete alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which significantly hydrolyzes phosphate ester bonds in surface macromolecular side groups, resulting in the release of alendronate (ALN). This process further improves the local osteoporotic microenvironment. This intelligent surface modification tailors bone repair to individual conditions, automatically realize multiple endogenous regulation once implanted, and truly realize spontaneous activation of a series of responses conducive to bone repair in vivo. It is evidenced by improved bone regeneration in iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporotic rabbits and supported by in vitro validations.

         <title>Flexible Terahertz Metasurface Absorbers Empowered by Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study connects absorbers with bound states in the continuum by systematically exploring radiation properties from a perspective of lattice symmetry. A flexible terahertz absorber is demonstrated with stable and high absorption coefficient covering a large field of view, with tunable bandwidth, and multiband absorption. It would provide valuable insights for terahertz applications in communications, detection, sensing, and imaging.








Abstract
Terahertz absorbers are crucial to the cutting&#8208;edge techniques in the next&#8208;generation wireless communications, imaging, sensing, and radar stealth, as they fundamentally determine the performance of detectors and cloaking capabilities. It has long been a pressing task to find absorbers with customizable performance that can adapt to various environments with low cost and great flexibility. Here, perfect absorption empowered by bound states in the continuum (BICs)&#160;is demonstrated,&#160;allowing for the tailoring of absorption coefficient, bandwidth, and field of view. The one&#8208;port absorbers are interpreted using temporal coupled&#8208;mode theory highlighting the dominant role of BICs in the far&#8208;field radiation properties. Through a thorough investigation of BICs from the perspective of lattice symmetry, the radiation features of three BIC modes are unraveled using both multipolar and topological analysis. The versatile radiation capabilities of BICs provide ample freedom to meet specific requirements of absorbers, including tunable bandwidth, stable performance in a large field of view, and multiband absorption using a thin and flexible film without extreme geometric demands. These findings offer a systematic approach to developing optoelectronic devices and demonstrate the significant potential of BICs for optical and photonic applications, which will stimulate further studies on terahertz photonics and metasurfaces.

         <title>Efficient Generation of Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarized Spin Current in Polycrystalline Heavy Metal Devices with Broken Electric Symmetries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;spin current has the potential to enable energy&#8208;efficient switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. The work by Lijun Zhu and co&#8208;workers reports the first universal, energy&#8208;efficient, integration&#8208;friendly approach to generate z&#8208;spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low&#8208;power spin&#8211;torque memory and computing technologies.








Abstract
Spin currents of perpendicularly polarized spins (z spins) have received blooming interest for the potential in energy&#8208;efficient spin&#8211;orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. However, generation of z spins is limited mainly to magnetically or crystallographically low&#8208;symmetry single crystals that are hardly compatible with the integration to semiconductor circuits. This work reports efficient generation of z spins in sputter&#8208;deposited polycrystalline heavy metal devices via a new mechanism of broken electric symmetries in both the transverse and perpendicular directions. Both the damping&#8208;like and field&#8208;like spin&#8211;orbit torques of z spins can be tuned significantly by varying the degree of the electric asymmetries via the length, width, and thickness of devices as well as by varying the type of the heavy metals. The presence of z spins also enables deterministic, nearly&#8208;full, external&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching of a uniform perpendicularly magnetized FeCoB layer, the core structure of magnetic tunnel junctions, with high coercivity at a low current density. These results establish the first universal, energy&#8208;efficient, integration&#8208;friendly approach to generate z&#8208;spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low&#8208;power spin&#8208;torque memory and computing technologies and will stimulate investigation of z&#8208;spin currents in various polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Edible Ultralong Organic Phosphorescent Excipient for Afterglow Visualizing the Quality of Tablets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An edible excipient with intrinsically multistimuli responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) property is developed to achieve nondestructive detection of hardness with superb contrast (signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio up to 120) and moisture with improved sensitivity (5.0 times to conventional fluorescence) of drug tablets. The naked&#8208;eye visible UOP shows promise in both promoting continuous smart manufacturing and safe medicine for patients.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials that in response to external factors such as light, heat, and atmosphere have raised a tremendous research interest in fields of optoelectronics, anticounterfeiting labeling, biosensing, and bioimaging. However, for practical applications in life and health fields, some fundamental requirements such as biocompatibility and biodegradability are still challenging for conventional inorganic and aromatic&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive UOP systems. Herein, an edible excipient, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCC), of which UOP properties exhibit intrinsically multistimuli responses to excited wavelength, pressure, and moisture, is reported. Impressively, as a UOP probe, SCC enables nondestructive detection of hardness with superb contrast (signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio up to 120), while exhibiting a response sensitivity to moisture that is more than 5.0 times higher than that observed in conventional fluorescence. Additionally, its applicability for hardness monitoring and high&#8208;moisture warning for tablets containing a moisture&#8208;sensitive drug, with the quality of the drug being determinable through the naked&#8208;eye visible UOP, is demonstrated. This work not only elucidates the reason for stimulative corresponding properties in SCC but also makes a major step forward in extending the potential applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive UOP materials in manufacturing high&#8208;quality and safe medicine.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics Enabled by Robust Silver Nanowires/S&#8208;PH1000 Hybrid Transparent Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, superior stretchable transparent electrodes (STEs) that possess both high conductivity and stretchability are developed. The STEs enable intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) a remarkable PCE of 16.32% and commendable stretchability. Additionally, OPVs equipped with these STEs exhibit superior thermal stability compared to those using indium tin oxide electrode.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) hold significant promise for integration into self&#8208;powered wearable electronics. However, their potential is hindered by the lack of sufficient consistency between optoelectronic and mechanical properties. This is primarily due to the limited availability of stretchable transparent electrodes (STEs) that possess both high conductivity and stretchability. Here, a hybrid STE with exceptional conductivity, stretchability, and thermal stability is presented. Specifically, STEs are composed of the modified PH1000 (referred to as S&#8208;PH1000) and silver nanowires (AgNWs). The S&#8208;PH1000 endows the STE with good stretchability and smoothens the surface, while the AgNWs enhance the charge transport. The resulting hybrid STEs enable is&#8208;OPVs to a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.32%, positioning them among the top&#8208;performing is&#8208;OPVs. With 10% elastomer, the devices retain 82% of the initial PCE after 500 cycles at 20% strain. Additionally, OPVs equipped with these STEs exhibit superior thermal stability compared to those using indium tin oxide electrodes, maintaining 75% of the initial PCE after annealing at 85&#160;&#176;C for 390 h. The findings underscore the suitability of the designed hybrid electrodes for efficient and stable is&#8208;OPVs, offering a promising avenue for the future application of OPVs.

PVDF@PEI core&#8211;shell nanofibers are developed via symmetry&#8208;breaking design for efficient radiative cooling. The membranes show high thermal stability, hydrophobicity, UV protection, fluorescence enhancement, and breathability, enabling 8&#160;&#176;C daytime cooling. This innovation advances wearables and multifunctional materials research.








Abstract
Radiative cooling technology, which is renowned for its ability to dissipate heat without energy consumption, has garnered immense interest. However, achieving high performance, multifunctionality, and smart integration while addressing challenges such as film thickness and enhancing anisotropic light reflection remains challenging. In this study, a core&#8211;shell composite nanofiber, PVDF@PEI, is introduced and designed primarily from a symmetry&#8208;breaking perspective to develop highly efficient radiative cooling materials. Using a combination of solvent&#8208;induced phase separation (EIPS) inverse spinning and (aggregation) self&#8208;assembly methods (EISA or EIAA) and coaxial electrostatic spinning (ES), superconformal surface anisotropic porous nanofiber membranes are fabricated. These membranes exhibit exceptional thermal stability (up to 210&#160;&#176;C), high hydrophobicity (contact angle of 126&#176;), robust UV protection (exceeding 99%), a fluorescence multiplication effect (with a 0.6% increase in fluorescence quantum efficiency), and good breathability. These properties enable the material to excel in a wide range of application scenarios. Moreover, this material achieved a remarkable daytime cooling temperature of 8&#160;&#176;C. The development of this fiber membrane offers significant advancements in the field of wearables and the multifunctionality of materials, paving new paths for future research and innovation.

         <title>Crystalline Texture Reengineering of Zinc Powder&#8208;Based Fibrous Anode for Remarkable Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wet&#8208;spinning technique is utilized to fabricate Zn@CNTs fiber for anode of fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery with remarkable electrochemical performance after textural reengineering via thermal treatment. Fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery equipped with derived fiber anode showcase exceptional chemical stability and fatigue resistance after long&#8208;term fibrous battery deformation.








Abstract
The challenge of inadequate mechano&#8208;electrochemical stability in rechargeable fibrous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (FZIBs) has emerged as a critical challenge for their broad applications. Traditional rigid Zn wires struggle to maintain a stable electrochemical interface when subjected to external mechanical stress. To address this issue, a wet&#8208;spinning technique has been developed to fabricate Zn powder based fibrous anode, while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) introduced to enhance the spinnability of Zn powder dispersion. The followed annealing treatment has been conducted to reengineer the Zn crystalline texture with CNTs assisted surface tension regulation to redirect (002) crystallographic textural formation. The thus&#8208;derived annealed Zn@CNTs fiber demonstrates great mechano&#8208;electrochemical stability after a long&#8208;term bending and electrochemical process. The fabricated FZIB demonstrates a remarkable durability, surpassing 800&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with a marginal voltage hysteresis increase of 21.7&#160;mV even after 100 twisting cycles under 180 degree twisting angle. The assembled FZIB full cell displays an 88.6% capacity retention even after a long cycle of a series of bending, knotting, and straightening deformation. It has been also woven into a 200&#160;cm2 size textile to demonstrate its capability to integrate into smart textiles.

         <title>Systemic Multifunctional Nanovaccines for Potent Personalized Immunotherapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hematological malignancies (HM) like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often intractable. This study develops systemic nanovaccines consisting of tumor cell lysate and dual adjuvants muramyl dipeptide and CpG (MCA&#8208;NV) to induce strong, durable, and broad anti&#8208;AML immunity. Intravenous infusion of nanovaccines substantially outperforms subcutaneous administration and cures 78% of AML&#8208;bearing mice. MCA&#8208;NV provides a personalized immunotherapeutic strategy against HM.









Abstract
Hematological malignancies (HM) like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often intractable. Cancer vaccines possibly inducing robust and broad anti&#8208;tumor immune responses may be a promising treatment option for HM. Few effective vaccines against blood cancers are, however, developed to date partly owing to insufficient stimulation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the body and lacking appropriate tumor antigens (Ags). Here it is found that systemic multifunctional nanovaccines consisting of nucleotide&#8208;binding oligomerization domain&#8208;containing protein 2 (NOD2) and Toll&#8208;like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists &#8211; muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and CpG, and tumor cell lysate (TCL) as Ags (MCA&#8208;NV) induce potent and broad immunity against AML. MCA&#8208;NV show complementary stimulation of DCs and prime homing to lymphoid organs following systemic administration. Of note, in orthotopic AML mouse models, intravenous infusion of different vaccine formulations elicits substantially higher anti&#8208;AML efficacies than subcutaneous administration. Systemic MCA&#8208;NV cure 78% of AML mice and elicit long&#8208;term immune memory with 100% protection from rechallenging AML cells. Systemic MCA&#8208;NV can also serve as prophylactic vaccines against the same AML. These systemic nanovaccines utilizing patient TCL as Ags and dual adjuvants to elicit strong, durable, and broad immune responses can provide a personalized immunotherapeutic strategy against AML and other HM.

         <title>Above&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity and Giant Second Harmonic Generation in 1D vdW NbOI3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D vdW ferroelectric NbOI3 nanowires possess a high Curie temperature TC&#160;&gt; &#160;450&#160;K. Impressively, NbOI3 exhibits a giant second harmonic generation (SHG) effect with a susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 under the pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa.








Abstract
The realization of spontaneous ferroelectricity down to the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) limit is both fundamentally intriguing and practically appealing for high&#8208;density ferroelectric and nonlinear photonics. However, the 1D vdW ferroelectric materials are not discovered experimentally yet. Here, the first 1D vdW ferroelectric compound NbOI3 with a high Curie temperature TC&#160;&gt;&#160;450&#160;K and giant second harmonic generation (SHG) is reported. The 1D crystalline chain structure of the NbOI3 is revealed by cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, whereas the 1D ferroelectric order originated from the Nb displacement along the Nb&#8208;O chain (b&#8208;axis) is confirmed via obvious electrical and ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Impressively, NbOI3 exhibits a giant SHG susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at a fundamental wavelength of 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 under the applied hydrostatic pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa. Combing in situ pressure&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectra measurements, and first&#8208;principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the O atoms shift along the Nb&#9472;O atomic chain under compression, which can lead to the increased Baur distortion of [NbO2I4] octahedra, and hence induces the enhancement of SHG. This work provides a 1D vdW ferroelectric system for developing novel ferroelectronic and photonic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization of spontaneous ferroelectricity down to the one-dimensional (1D) limit is both fundamentally intriguing and practically appealing for high-density ferroelectric and nonlinear photonics. However, the 1D vdW ferroelectric materials are not discovered experimentally yet. Here, the first 1D vdW ferroelectric compound NbOI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with a high Curie temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;450&#160;K and giant second harmonic generation (SHG) is reported. The 1D crystalline chain structure of the NbOI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is revealed by cryo-electron microscopy, whereas the 1D ferroelectric order originated from the Nb displacement along the Nb-O chain (&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-axis) is confirmed via obvious electrical and ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Impressively, NbOI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a giant SHG susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a fundamental wavelength of 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under the applied hydrostatic pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa.

         <title>Water&#8208;Enhancing Gels Exhibiting Heat&#8208;Activated Formation of Silica Aerogels for Protection of Critical Infrastructure During Catastrophic Wildfire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic polymer&#8208;particle hydrogels are developed as sprayable water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels that transition into thermally insulative silica aerogels upon heat activation. These hydrogels exhibit superior viscoelastic properties, strong substrate adherence, and dramatically enhanced fire protection compared to commercial gels. This innovation significantly advances water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels, offering robust protection for critical infrastructure and homes during wildfires, thereby markedly improving wildfire prevention and mitigation strategies.








Abstract
A promising strategy to address the pressing challenges with wildfire, particularly in the wildland&#8208;urban interface (WUI), involves developing new approaches for preventing and controlling wildfire within wildlands. Among sprayable fire&#8208;retardant materials, water&#8208;enhancing gels have emerged as exceptionally effective for protecting civil infrastructure. They possess favorable wetting and viscoelastic properties that reduce the likelihood of ignition, maintaining strong adherence to a wide array of surfaces after application. Although current water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels effectively maintain surface wetness by creating a barricade, they rapidly desiccate and lose efficacy under high heat and wind typical of wildfire conditions. To address this limitation, unique biomimetic hydrogel materials from sustainable cellulosic polymers crosslinked by colloidal silica particles are developed that exhibit ideal viscoelastic properties and facile manufacturing. Under heat activation, the hydrogel transitions into a highly porous and thermally insulative silica aerogel coating in situ, providing a robust protective layer against ignition of substrates, even when the hydrogel fire suppressant becomes completely desiccated. By confirming the mechanical properties, substrate adherence, and enhanced substrate protection against fire, these heat&#8208;activatable biomimetic hydrogels emerge as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation water&#8208;enhancing fire suppressants. These advancements have the potential to dramatically improve the ability to protect homes and critical infrastructure during wildfire.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteromorphic Bi2WO6 Films With an Interpenetrate 1D/2D Network Structure for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Degradation of VOCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi2WO6 (BWO) film with a network structure of 2D (NSs) penetrated with 1D nanofibers (NFs) is reported. BWO NSs can grow radially in an orderly spaced arrangement along BWO NFs during sintering, thereby forming 1D/2D BWO junctions like eucalyptus leaves, which can rapidly degrade acetaldehyde under visible light and shows superior stability for eight cycles without any decays.








Abstract
2D layered Bi2WO6 (BWO) is a widely used attractive photocatalyst for degrading VOCs, but the low visible&#8208;light utilization and the easy stacking 2D nanosheets&#160;(NSs) limit photocatalysis efficiency and stability. Here, inspired by Eucalyptus, a synergistic strategy of multiscale domain&#8208;confinement and electrostatic force action, based on electrospinning is proposed, for fabricating a heteromorphic BWO photocatalyst. It is found that BWO NSs can grow radially in an orderly spaced arrangement along BWO nanofibers (NFs) during sintering, thereby forming 1D/2D BWO junctions like eucalyptus leaves. This interpenetrating 1D/2D network structure not only solves the easy stacking problem of BWO NSs but also selectively exposes the {010} crystal planes that exhibit efficient hole oxidation. In addition, this peculiar structure enriches electrons at the 1D/2D interface to avoid carrier recombination, thus improving the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalyst material with a reduced bandgap width from 2.56 to 2.49&#160;eV can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde under visible light without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers and shows superior stability for eight cycles without any decay. This study provides a feasible method to synthesize an efficient and stable BWO photocatalyst.

         <title>Porous Polymeric Electrodes for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active porous polymeric electrodes (PPEs) are developed with promoted advective gas transport and enhanced gas&#8208;electrolyte contact adsorption area in a flow&#8208;through mode for high&#8208;efficiency carbon dioxide capture. This strategy offers new possibilities for manufacturing scalable and cost&#8208;effective electrodes and is anticipated to be transferable to general electrochemically mediated separation technologies.








Abstract
Carbon capture is a promising technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net carbon neutrality. Electro&#8208;swing reactive adsorption has emerged as an attractive approach for sustainable decarbonization. However, current electrodes with limited gas transport present a major barrier that hinders their practical implementation. Herein, porous polymeric electrodes are developed to effectively enhance CO2 transport without the need for additional gas diffusion conduits. Such all&#8208;in&#8208;one porous electrodes also enable more accessible redox active sites (e.g., quinones) for CO2 sorption, leading to an increased materials utilization efficiency of &#8776;90%. A continuous flow&#8208;through carbon capture and release operation with high Faradaic efficiency and excellent stability under practical working conditions is further demonstrated. Together with low cost and robust mechanical properties, the as&#8208;developed porous polymeric electrodes highlight the potential to advance the future implementation of electrochemical separation technologies.

         <title>Stiffness and Interface Engineered Soft Electronics with Large&#8208;Scale Robust Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simultaneously regulating stiffness and enhancing interfacial binding force, this work provides an efficient path to realize robust large&#8208;scale deformable electronic skins. Stiff and elastic areas of the designed substrate have nearly four orders of magnitudes modulus contrast and cross&#8208;linked interfaces. Electronic devices and liquid metal interconnects are conformally attached at the stiff and elastic areas, respectively, through hydrogen bonds.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like stretchable electronics emerge as promising human&#8211;machine interfaces but are challenged by the paradox between superior electronic property and reliable mechanical deformability. Here, a general strategy is reported for establishing robust large&#8208;scale deformable electronics by effectively isolating strains and strengthening interfaces. A copolymer substrate is designed to consist of mosaic stiff and elastic areas with nearly four orders of magnitudes modulus contrast and cross&#8208;linked interfaces. Electronic functional devices and stretchable liquid metal (LM) interconnects are conformally attached at the stiff and elastic areas, respectively, through hydrogen bonds. As a result, functional devices are completely isolated from strains, and resistances of LM conductors change by less than one time when the substrate is deformed by up to 550%. By this strategy, solar cells, wireless charging antenna, supercapacitors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated into a self&#8208;powered electronic skin that can laminate on the human body and exhibit stable performances during repeated multimode deformations, demonstrating an efficient path for realizing highly deformable energy autonomous soft electronics.

By this strategy, solar cells, wireless charging antenna, supercapacitors, and light-emitting diodes are integrated into a self-powered electronic skin that can laminate on the human body and exhibit stable performances during repeated multimode deformations, demonstrating an efficient path for realizing highly deformable energy autonomous soft electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Responsive Hybrid System Achieves Cascade&#8208;Augmented Antitumor Immunity via Genetic Engineering of Both Bacteria and Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light&#8208;responsive genetic engineering of both bacteria and tumor cells is achieved by a hybrid therapeutic platform consisting of genetically engineered bacteria and photothermal nanoparticles for tumor&#8208;targeted and augmented immunotherapy of melanoma. A synergistic antitumor effect is achieved during the process of antioncogene transfection and NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated expression of the therapeutic immunomodulator.








Abstract
The combination of nanoparticles and tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria for cancer immunotherapy can overcome the shortcomings of poor nanoparticle accumulation, limited penetration, and restricted distribution. However, it remains a great challenge for the hybrid system to improve therapeutic efficacy through the simultaneous and controllable regulation of immune cells and tumor cells. Herein, a hybrid therapeutic platform is rationally designed to achieve immune cascade&#8208;augmented cancer immunotherapy. To construct the hybrids, photothermal nanoparticles responsive to light in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region are conjugated onto the surface of engineered bacteria through pH&#8208;responsive Schiff base bonds. Taking advantage of the hypoxia targeting and deep penetration characteristics of the bacteria, the hybrids can accumulate at tumor sites. Then nanoparticles detach from the bacteria to realize genetic engineering of tumor cells, which induces tumor cell apoptosis and down&#8208;regulate the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 to alleviate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The mild photothermal heating can not only induce tumor&#8208;associated antigen release, but also trigger sustainable expression of cytokine interleukin&#8208;2. Notably, a synergistic antitumor effect is achieved between the process of p53 transfection and NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated genetic engineering of bacteria. This work proposes a facile strategy for the construction of hybrid system to achieve cascade&#8208;augmented cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Reduction and Bone Tissue Engineering Towards a Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Therapy Strategy for Osteosarcoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;function 3D&#8208;printed bioscaffold equipped with CMB nanowheel crystals (CMB@BG) is designed and engineered for the comprehensive treatment of osteosarcoma. Due to their photothermally enhanced ROS&#8208;scavenging capacity, CMB@BG scaffolds exhibit exceptional NIR&#8208;II photothermal&#8208;conversion efficiency, osteogenic induction activity, and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities. Therefore, they are regarded as an ideal therapeutic strategy that balances clearance, protection, and repair for osteosarcoma.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma is one of the most dreadful bone neoplasms in young people, necessitating the development of innovative therapies that can effectively eliminate tumors while minimizing damage to limb function. An ideal therapeutic strategy should possess three essential capabilities: antitumor effects, tissue&#8208;protective properties, and the ability to enhance osteogenesis. In this study, self&#8208;assembled Ce&#8208;substituted molybdenum blue (CMB) nanowheel crystals are synthesized and loaded onto 3D&#8208;printed bioactive glass (CMB@BG) scaffolds to develop a unique three&#8208;in&#8208;one treatment approach for osteosarcoma. The CMB@BG scaffolds exhibit outstanding photothermally derived tumor ablation within the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II window due to the surface plasmon resonance properties of the CMB nanowheel crystals. Furthermore, the photothermally synergistic catalytic effect of CMB promotes the rapid scavenging of reactive oxygen species caused by excessive heat, thereby suppressing inflammation and protecting surrounding tissues. The CMB@BG scaffolds possess pro&#8208;proliferation and pro&#8208;differentiation capabilities that efficiently accelerate bone regeneration within bone defects. Altogether, the CMB@BG scaffolds that combine highly efficient tumor ablation, tissue protection based on anti&#8208;inflammatory mechanisms, and enhanced osteogenic ability are likely to be a point&#8208;to&#8208;point solution for the comprehensive therapeutic needs of osteosarcoma.

         <title>An Efficient Trifunctional Spinel&#8208;Based Electrode for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions and Nonoxidative Ethane Dehydrogenation on Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a novel spinel&#8208;based composite of Mn0.9Cs0.1Co2O4&#8208;&#948; (MCCO)&#8208;Co3O4 (CO) (MCCO&#8208;CO, 8:2 in mass ratio) oxide is reported as a trifunctional electrode for electricity generation and ethylene electro&#8208;production on protonic ceramic electrochemical cells.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) have received considerable attention as they can directly generate electricity and/or produce chemicals. Development of the electrodes with the trifunctionalities of oxygen reduction/evolution and nonoxidative ethane dehydrogenation is yet challenging. Here these findings are reported in the design of trifunctional electrodes for PCECs with a detailed composition of Mn0.9Cs0.1Co2O4&#8208;&#948; (MCCO) and Co3O4 (CO) (MCCO&#8211;CO, 8:2 mass ratio). At 600&#160;&#176;C, the MCCO&#8211;CO electrode exhibits a low area&#8208;specific resistance of 0.382 &#937; cm2 and reasonable stability for &#8776;105&#160;h with no obvious degradation. The single cell with the MCCO&#8211;CO electrode shows an encouraging peak power density of 1.73&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in the fuel cell (FC) mode and a current density of &#8208;3.93 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V in the electrolysis cell (EC) mode at 700&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the MCCO&#8211;CO cell displays promising operational stability in FC mode (223&#160;h), EC mode (209&#160;h), and reversible cycling stability (52 cycles, 208&#160;h) at 650&#160;&#176;C. The MCCO&#8211;CO single cell shows an encouraging ethane&#160;conversion to ethylene (with a conversion of 40.3% and selectivity of 94%) and excellent H2 production rates of 4.65&#160;mL min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;V and 700&#160;&#176;C, respectively, with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies.

         <title>Enriched Oxygen Coverage Localized within Ir Atomic Grids for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Atomic grid structure with high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10 atoms per nm2) on MnO2&#8211;x support realizes co&#8208;catalytic Ir&#8211;Mn interaction in water oxidation process, involving enriched oxygen coverage driven by Mn&#8208;Ov coordination defects to cooperate with highly electrophilic Ir&#8211;O(II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; species, which facilitates intensive O&#8211;O radical direct coupling within the grids for performance enhancement.








Abstract
Inefficient active site utilization of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have limited the energy efficiency of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Here, an atomic grid structure is demonstrated composed of high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10&#160;atoms per nm2) on reactive MnO2&#8211;x support which mediates oxygen coverage&#8208;enhanced OER process. Experimental characterizations verify the low&#8208;valent Mn species with decreased oxygen coordination in MnO2&#8211;x exert a pivotal impact in the enriched oxygen coverage on the surface during OER process, and the distributed Ir atomic grids, where highly electrophilic Ir&#9472;O(II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; bonds proceed rapidly, render intense nucleophilic attack of oxygen radicals. Thereby, this metal&#8208;support cooperation achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 166&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 283&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, together with a striking mass activity which is 380 times higher than commercial IrO2 at 1.53&#160;V. Moreover, its high OER performance also markedly surpasses the commercial Ir black catalyst in PEM electrolyzers with long&#8208;term stability.

Experimental characterizations verify the low-valent Mn species with decreased oxygen coordination in MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;x&lt;/sub&gt; exert a pivotal impact in the enriched oxygen coverage on the surface during OER process, and the distributed Ir atomic grids, where highly electrophilic Ir&#9472;O&lt;sup&gt;(II-&#948;)&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bonds proceed rapidly, render intense nucleophilic attack of oxygen radicals. Thereby, this metal-support cooperation achieves ultra-low overpotentials of 166&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 283&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, together with a striking mass activity which is 380 times higher than commercial IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 1.53&#160;V. Moreover, its high OER performance also markedly surpasses the commercial Ir black catalyst in PEM electrolyzers with long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Mechanically Responsive Smart Windows for Visible and Near&#8208;Infrared Multiwavelength Spectral Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy is proposed toward large&#8208;area fabricating mechanically responsive film for VIS and NIR multiwavelength spectral modulation smart windows. The excellent mechanical and optical cycling stability of the composite film provide a favorable basis for their practical applications. Furthermore, these spectral selective and dynamic smart windows will provide suitable solutions for the decarbonization of buildings.








Abstract
Mechanochromic light control technology that can dynamically regulate solar irradiation is recognized as one of the leading candidates for energy&#8208;saving windows. However, the lack of spectrally selective modulation ability still hinders its application for different scenarios or individual needs. Here, inspired by the generation of structure color and color change of living organisms, a simple layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly approach toward large&#8208;area fabricating mechanically responsive film for visible and near&#8208;infrared multiwavelength spectral modulation smart windows is reported here. The assembled SiO2 nanoparticles&#160;and W18O49 nanowires enable the film with an optical modulation rate of up to 42.4% at the wavelength of 550&#160;nm and 18.4% for the near&#8208;infrared region, separately, and the typical composite film under 50% stretching shows &#8776;41.6% modulation rate at the wavelength of 550&#160;nm with NIR modulation rate less than 2.7%. More importantly, the introduction of the multilayer assembly structure not only optimizes the film's optical modulation but also enables the film with high stability during 100&#160;000 stretching cycles. A cooling effect of 21.3 and 6.9 &#176;C for the blackbody and air inside a model house in the real environmental application is achieved. This approach provides theoretical and technical support for the new mechanochromic energy&#8208;saving windows.

         <title>Multifunctional Metamaterial with Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Scattering Properties for Advanced Stealth and Adaptive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bistable condition of the curved beam and design is studied with wave&#8208;absorbing metamaterials. So it has the bistable characteristic and the ability to absorb bandwidth switching. The absorbing mechanism is explained through the macroscopic and microscopic levels. The adjustable form is enriched with digital coding and applied to the satellite configuration to realize the reconstruction function of electromagnetic scattering properties.








Abstract
The rapid development of radar detection systems has led to an increased sensitivity to the electromagnetic (EM) scattering properties of detected targets. Flexible and adaptable EM scattering properties significantly enhance the survivability of battlefield weapons. This paper presents the design of a novel multifunctional metamaterial with reconfigurable EM scattering properties based on a bistable curved beam. In addition to the cushioning and energy absorption properties of curved beams, the metamaterial achieves more than 90% EM absorption in the frequency range of 2.17&#8211;17.31&#160;GHz, with a relative thickness of only 0.09&#955;L. The bistable nature of the metamaterial allows it to switch between different states. Moreover, combined with the digital coding, this metamaterial can continuously adjust the absorbing bandwidth and further enhance the EM absorption rate within a specific frequency band range. If applied to satellite configurations, the developed metamaterial significantly reduces the radar cross section and offers potential applications in reconfiguring EM scattering properties, when applied to satellite configurations. By actively controller and reconstructing the EM scattering properties at certain frequency points, the metamaterial can achieve camouflage, providing innovative solutions for future stealth technology, electronic countermeasures, and deception jamming in radar detection.

         <title>Water&#8208;Templated Growth of Interfacial Superglue Polymers for Tunable Thin Films and In Situ Fluid Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
WRAPPINGS is an eco&#8208;friendly concept that delivers thin poly(cyanoacrylate) films with precisely engineered properties. Exposing a water surface containing cationic surfactants to superglue vapors results in a film with tailored thickness, shape, and color. Using drops and bubbles as templates for film growth, the in situ packaging of chemical and biological liquid cargos and the encapsulation of gases is demonstrated.








Abstract
Thin polymer films (TPFs) are indispensable elements in numerous technologies ranging from liquid encapsulation to biotechnology to electronics. However, their production typically relies on wet chemistry involving organic solvents or chemical vapor deposition, necessitating elaborate equipment and often harsh conditions. Here, an eco&#8208;friendly, fast, and facile synthesis of water&#8208;templated interfacial polymers based on cyanoacrylates (superglues, CAs) that yield thin films with tailored properties is demonstrated. Specifically, by exposing a cationic surfactant&#8208;laden water surface to cyanoacrylate vapors, surfactant&#8208;modulated anionic polymerization produces a manipulable thin polymer film with a thickness growth rate of 8&#160;nm&#160;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, the shape and color of the film are precisely controlled by the polymerization kinetics, wetting conditions, and/or exposure to patterned light. Using various interfaces as templates for film growth, including the free surface of drops and soap bubbles, the developed method advantageously enables in situ packaging of chemical and biological cargos in liquid phase as well as the encapsulation of gases within solidified bubbles. Simple, versatile, and biocompatible, this technology constitutes a potent platform for programmable coating and soft/smart encapsulation of fluids.

         <title>Uncovering the Intrinsic High Fracture Toughness of Titanium via Lowered Oxygen Impurity Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here it is revealed that the low&#8208;oxygen titanium (Ti) has an intrinsic fracture toughness of 255 MPa m1/2. The low oxygen concentration promotes deformation twinning, and the numerous twin boundaries further stimulate the &#12296;c+a&#12297; slip at the crack tip. The operation of these two &#12296;c&#12297;&#8208;axis deformation modes enhances the uniform deformation abilities, resulting in a remarkable leap in fracture resistance of Ti.








Abstract
Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are known to exhibit room&#8208;temperature fracture toughness below 130 MPa m1/2, only about one half of the best austenitic stainless steels. It is purported that this is not the best possible fracture resistance of Ti, but a result of oxygen impurities that sensitively retard the activities of plasticity carriers in this hexagonal close&#8208;packed metal. By a reduction of oxygen content from the 0.14&#160;wt% in commercial purity Ti to 0.02&#160;wt%, the mode&#8208;&#921; fracture toughness of the low&#8208;oxygen Ti is measured to be as high as KJIc &#8776; 255 MPa m1/2, corresponding to J&#8208;integral&#8208;based crack&#8208;initiation toughness of up to JIc &#8776; 537&#160;kJ m&#8722;2. This extraordinary toughness, reported here for the first time for pure Ti, places Ti among the toughest known materials. The intrinsic high fracture resistance is attributed to the profuse plastic deformation in a significantly enlarged plastic zone, rendered by the pronounced deformation twinning ahead of the crack tip along with ample twin&#8208;stimulated &#12296;c+a&#12297; dislocation activities, in the absence of impeding oxygen. Controlling the content of a property&#8208;controlling impurity thus holds the promise to be a readily applicable strategy to reach for unprecedented damage tolerance in some other structural alloys.

         <title>SonoPrint: Acoustically Assisted Volumetric 3D Printing for Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SonoPrint merges sound energy with volumetric printing to create composite materials with aligned reinforcement patterning. This innovative 3D printing technique embeds particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene into photosensitive resin, forming intricate motifs and mechanically tunable geometries. Completing prints in minutes, SonoPrint enhances structural properties and advances applications in biohybrid robots, tissue engineering, and composite fabrication, broadening the horizons of volumetric printing.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics. A key aspect of enhancing properties of 3D&#8208;printed objects involves fine&#8208;tuning the material by embedding and orienting reinforcement within the structure. Existing methods for orienting these reinforcements are limited by pattern types, alignment, and particle characteristics. Acoustics offers a versatile method to control the particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge, enabling intricate pattern formations. However, integrating acoustics into 3D printing has been challenging due to the scattering of the acoustic field between polymerized layers and unpolymerized resin, resulting in unwanted patterns. To address this challenge, SonoPrint, an innovative acoustically assisted volumetric 3D printer is developed that enables simultaneous reinforcement patterning and printing of the entire structure. SonoPrint generates mechanically tunable composite geometries by embedding reinforcement particles, such as microscopic glass, metal, and polystyrene, within the fabricated structure. This printer employs a standing wave field to create targeted particle motifs&#8208;including parallel lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, hexagons, and polygons&#8208;directly in the photosensitive resin, completing the print in just a few minutes. SonoPrint enhances structural properties and promises to advance volumetric printing, unlocking applications in tissue engineering, biohybrid robots, and composite fabrication.

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Hydrogels via Reversible Photoswitching of Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Spiropyran Complexation Stoichiometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;spiropyran host&#8211;guest complex is designed to exhibit fast and reversible switching of binding ratios between 1:2 and 1:1 in response to UV and blue light. Such photoswitchable complexation stoichiometries are rationally exploited as (de)crosslinking units in multiple polymers for the design of supramolecular hydrogels displaying highly dynamic and switchable features that are spatiotemporally controlled by light.








Abstract
The integration of photoswitchable supramolecular units into hydrogels allows for spatiotemporal control over their nanoscale topological network and macroscale properties using light. Nevertheless, the current availability of photoswitchable supramolecular interactions for the development of such materials remains limited. Here, the molecular design of a novel photoswitchable cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;spiropyran host&#8211;guest complex exhibiting fast and reversible switching of binding ratios between 1:2 and 1:1 is reported. Photoswitchable complexation stoichiometries are rationally exploited as (de)crosslinking units in multiple polymers for the design of supramolecular hydrogels displaying highly dynamic and switchable features that are spatiotemporally controlled by light. The hydrogels exhibit rapid reversible mechanical softening&#8208;hardening upon alternating irradiation with blue and UV light, which is used to significantly accelerate and improve the efficiency of self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;remolding of hydrogels. Furthermore, spiropyran endows such materials with unique reversible photochromic properties for reproducible patterning/erasing and information storage. Using a dual&#8208;light&#8208;assisted extrusion process, meter&#8208;scale hydrogel fibers with enhanced structural integrity and photoswitchable ionic conductivity are constructed and woven into various slidable knots and fluorescent shapes. This work represents an innovative molecular design strategy for advancing the development of spatiotemporally engineered supramolecular hydrogels using light and opens avenues for their prospective applications in dynamic materials and adaptive systems.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanomodulators With Synergism of Photothermal Therapy and Vessel Normalization for Boosting Potent Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanomodulator Tm@PDA&#8208;GA with homologous targeting is developed for boosting potent anticancer immunity. Especially Tm@PDA&#8208;GA inhibits HSPs expression for chemo&#8208;photothermal synergetic anti&#8208;tumor and increases ICD to promote the maturation of dendritic cells. Additionally, it normalizes the vessels via HIF&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF inhibition to enhance immune infiltration. So Tm@PDA&#8208;GA combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 can effectively suppress tumor growth and lung metastasis.








Abstract
Combination therapy using photothermal therapy (PTT) and immunotherapy is one of the most promising approaches for eliciting host immune responses to ablate tumors. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited due to inefficient immune cell infiltration and cellular immune responses. In this study, a biomimetic immunostimulatory nanomodulator, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA (4T1 membrane@polydopamine&#8208;gambogic acid), with homologous targeting is developed. The 4T1 membrane (Tm) coating reduced immunogenicity and facilitated uptake of Tm@PDA&#8208;GA by tumor cells. Polydopamine (PDA) as a drug carrier can induce PTT under near&#8208;infrared ray (NIR) irradiation and immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate dendritic cells (DCs). Moreover, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA on&#8208;demand released gambogic acid (GA) in an acidic tumor microenvironment, inhibiting the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) for synergetic chemo&#8208;photothermal anti&#8208;tumor activity and increasing the ICD of 4T1 cells. More importantly, GA can normalize the vessels via HIF&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF inhibition to enhance immune infiltration and alleviate hypoxia stress. Thus, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA induced ICD, activated DCs, stimulated cytotoxic T cells, and suppressed Tregs. Moreover, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA is combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to further augment the tumor immune response and effectively suppress tumor growth and lung metastasis. In conclusion, biomaterial&#8208;mediated PTT combined with vessel normalization is a promising strategy for effective immunotherapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC).

         <title>Direct Chiral Discrimination with NMR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) elucidates molecular structures down to the atomic level. However, only with an auxiliary molecule, it is currently possible to distinguish the handedness of enantiomers directly with NMR. NMR is normally blind to chirality. A newly developed method now allows the distinction of enantiomers, just by using a standard NMR instrument, and without adulteration of the sample under investigation.








Abstract
Unaided nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is considered incapable of distinguishing enantiomers. However, as first derived by A.D. Buckingham, the tensor coupling the electric and magnetic dipoles is space&#8208;dependent, which varies according to the molecular structure, hence, would be different for two enantiomers. Exploiting the odd&#8208;parity coupling tensor, a new variant of a double&#8208;resonant radiofrequency (RF) NMR detector is developed, which is sensitive to both electric and magnetic dipoles. Using the detector, a new method for liquid&#8208;state NMR is developed and elaborated, with which two enantiomers are successfully discriminated.

         <title>Enhanced Self&#8211;Assembly and Spontaneous Separation for Ultrathin, Air&#8210;Floating Graphene Macrofilms and their Application in Ultrasensitive In&#8208;Site Growth Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of ethanol&#8208;based binary solution, the self&#8208;assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8211;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8210;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled graphene films at air&#8208;liquid interface have great potential for multiple applications. However, the large size and ultrathin thickness for graphene&#8208;based films are hardly achieved simultaneously because of poor assembly ability of graphene oxide (GO) and cautious film transfer process (FTP). Herein, the ethanol&#8208;based binary solution with supramolecular clusters and weak polarity is introduced to enhance the assembly performance of GO. In this regime, GO film is formed within 52 s, and its formation temperature can be as low as &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, the attractive force between the formed GO film and this binary solution is 62% lower than that between GO film and traditional aqueous solution. On this basis, for the first time a spontaneous separation of the self&#8208;assembled GO film from solution is reported, and the air&#8210;floating graphene films (AGFs) with nanoscale thickness and centimeter&#8208;scale diameter are prepared without FTP. By means of this separation behavior, the in situ growth AGFs sensors are fabricated, and they express fast response and ultrahigh sensitivity to imperceptible change in temperature and disturbances that are hardly recognized by common sensors.

     alt="Enhanced Self&#8211;Assembly and Spontaneous Separation for Ultrathin, Air&#8210;Floating Graphene Macrofilms and their Application in Ultrasensitive In-Site Growth Sensors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By means of ethanol-based binary solution, the self-assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8211;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8210;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled graphene films at air-liquid interface have great potential for multiple applications. However, the large size and ultrathin thickness for graphene-based films are hardly achieved simultaneously because of poor assembly ability of graphene oxide (GO) and cautious film transfer process (FTP). Herein, the ethanol-based binary solution with supramolecular clusters and weak polarity is introduced to enhance the assembly performance of GO. In this regime, GO film is formed within 52 s, and its formation temperature can be as low as &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, the attractive force between the formed GO film and this binary solution is 62% lower than that between GO film and traditional aqueous solution. On this basis, for the first time a spontaneous separation of the self-assembled GO film from solution is reported, and the air&#8210;floating graphene films (AGFs) with nanoscale thickness and centimeter-scale diameter are prepared without FTP. By means of this separation behavior, the in situ growth AGFs sensors are fabricated, and they express fast response and ultrahigh sensitivity to imperceptible change in temperature and disturbances that are hardly recognized by common sensors. Therefore, a new accessible strategy is demonstrated to prepare ultrathin graphene macrofilms, which can be the excellent candidates for multifunctional, ultrasensitive sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Densification of Cathode/Electrolyte Interphase to Enhance Reversibility of LiCoO2 at 4.65&#160;V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressively reinforced cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3) on Z&#8208;LCO, i.e. the fluorination of Zr&#9472;O and densification of CEI layer driven by the chemical reaction between ZrOxFy and LiF, greatly reinforcing the toughness of CEI containing inorganic species. Consequently, Z&#8208;LCO achieve an enhanced and reversible O3/H1&#8208;3 phase transition and excellent electrochemical performance at 4.6/4.65 V.








Abstract
For LiCoO2 (LCO) operated beyond 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+), it usually suffers from severe surface degradation. Constructing a robust cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is effective to alleviate the above issues, however, the correlated mechanisms still remain vague. Herein, a progressively reinforced CEI is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3) on LCO surface (i.e., Z&#8208;LCO). Upon cycle, these Zr&#9472;O deposits can promote the decomposition of LiPF6, and progressively convert to the highly dispersed Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species. In particular, the chemical reaction between LiF and Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species further leads to the densification of CEI, which greatly reinforces its toughness and conductivity. Combining the robust CEI and thin surface rock&#8208;salt layer of Z&#8208;LCO, several benefits are achieved, including stabilizing the surface lattice oxygen, facilitating the interface Li+ transport kinetics, and enhancing the reversibility of O3/H1&#8208;3 phase transition, etc. As a result, the Z&#8208;LCO||Li cells exhibit a high capacity retention of 84.2% after 1000 cycles in 3&#8211;4.65&#160;V, 80.9% after 1500 cycles in 3&#8211;4.6&#160;V, and a high rate capacity of 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 16 C (1 C&#160;=&#160;200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1). This work provides a new insight for developing advanced LCO cathodes.

         <title>Ultralong K0.5Mn0.75PS3 Nanowires Tailored by K&#8208;Ion Scissors for Extraordinary Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The concept of &#8220;K&#8208;ion scissors&#8221; is proposed for the first time to achieve rapid transformation of MnPS3 bulk to K0.5Mn0.75PS3 nanowires with extraordinary sodium storage performance.








Abstract
1D&#160;layered nanowires (NWs) are expected to be excellent electrode materials due to their efficient electron/ion transport and strain/stress relaxation. However, it is a great challenge to synthesize layered NWs by a top&#8208;down synthetic route. Herein, ultralong 1D layered K0.5Mn0.75PS3 NWs (length: &gt;100&#160;&#181;m; diameter: &#8776;300&#160;nm) are synthesized for the first time using &#8220;K&#8208;ion chemical scissors&#8221;, whose excellent sodium storage performance originates from the bifunctional structural unit, ingeniously combining the alloying energy storage functional unit (P&#8722;P dimer) with the quasi&#8208;intercalated functional unit ([MnS3]4&#8722; framework). Stress&#8208;driven K&#8208;ion scissors achieve the rapid transformation of MnPS3 bulk to K0.5Mn0.75PS3 NWs with directed tailoring. Compared to MnPS3, the NWs exhibit enlarged interlayer spacing (9.32 &#197;), enhanced electronic conductivity (8.17&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S m&#8722;1 vs 4.47&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;10 S m&#8722;1), and high ionic conductivity (2.14 mS cm&#8722;1). As expected, the NWs demonstrate high capacity (709 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling performance (&#8776;100% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1), ranking among metal thiophosphates. A quasi&#8208;topological intercalation mechanism of the NWs is revealed through further characterizations. This work expands the top&#8208;down synthesis approach and offers innovative insights for the cost&#8208;effective and large&#8208;scale fabrication of NWs with outstanding electrochemical performance.

         <title>Leidenfrost Effect&#8208;Induced Chaotic Vortex Flow for Efficient Mixing of Highly Viscous Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency mixing of viscous liquids in microfluidics manipulation is a long&#8208;standing challenge because of unfavorable diffusion kinetics. Here, a peculiar Leidenfrost phenomenon, which can achieve mixing of viscous droplets within several hundred ms due to internal vortex motion, is resorted to. This new mixing mechanism can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of the desired morphology.








Abstract
Efficiently mixing highly viscous liquids in microfluidic systems is appealing for green chemistry such as chemical synthesis and catalysis, but it is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the unfavorable diffusion kinetics. In this work, a new strategy is explored for mixing viscous droplets by harnessing a peculiar Leidenfrost state, where the substrate temperature is above the boiling point of the liquid without apparent liquid evaporation. Compared to the control experiment where the droplet stays at a similar temperature but in the contact boiling regime, the mixing time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the liquid mixing originates from the chaotic convection flow in the Leidenfrost droplet, characterized by the internal vortex motion evidenced by the microscale visualization. A correlation between mixing time and droplet volume is also proposed, showing a good agreement with experimental results. It is further shown that Leidenfrost droplets can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of the desired morphology, and it is anticipated that this simple and scalable fabrication approach will find applications in the biological, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.

         <title>Anisotropic Superprotonic Conduction in a Layered Single&#8208;Component Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Multiple In&#8208;Plane Open Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>

A layered single&#8208;component hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF), HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3, is prepared, which exhibited anisotropic superprotonic conduction via multiple in&#8208;plane open channels. A&#160;proton rectifier device is further demonstrated, highlighting the promise of HOFs as conducting media for ionic devices.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are promising proton conductive materials because of their inherent and abundant hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, most superprotonic&#8208;conductive HOFs are constructed from multiple components to enable favorable framework architectures and structural integrity. In this contribution, layered HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3 with a single component is synthesized and exfoliated. The exfoliated nanoplates exhibited anisotropic superprotonic conduction, with in&#8208;plane proton conductivities reaching 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 296 K and 98% relative humidity (RH). This outperforms the previously reported single&#8208;component HOFs and is comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiple&#8208;component HOFs. The high and anisotropic proton conductive properties can be attributed to the efficient proton transport along multiple open channels parallel to their basal planes. Moreover, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) proton rectifier device is demonstrated by combining HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3 and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide (LDH). This work suggests that single&#8208;component HOFs with multiple open channels offer more opportunities as versatile platforms for proton conductors, making them promising candidates for conducting media in protonic devices.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One 2D Molecular Crystal Optoelectronic Synapse for Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Neuromorphic Visual System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering all&#8208;in&#8208;one 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) optoelectronic synapse for polarization&#8208;sensitive neuromorphic visual system is demonstrated. The synaptic phototransistor exhibits remarkable photoelectric performance and simulates biological synapse functions. The in&#8208;plane crystal anisotropy of 2DMC endows the synaptic phototransistor with polarization perception capabilities, which is successfully applied to noncontact fingerprint detection with a high recognition accuracy.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual systems (NVSs) hold the potential to not only preserve but also enhance human visual capabilities. One such augmentation lies in harnessing polarization information from light reflected or scattered off surfaces like bees, which can disclose unique characteristics imperceptible to the human eyes. While creating polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronic synapses presents an intriguing avenue for equipping NVS with this capability, integrating functions like polarization sensitivity, photodetection, and synaptic operations into a singular device has proven challenging. This integration typically necessitates distinct functional components for each performance metric, leading to intricate fabrication processes and constraining overall performance. Herein, a pioneering linear polarized light sensitive synaptic organic phototransistor (OPT) based on 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs) with highly integrated, all&#8208;in&#8208;one functionality, is demonstrated. By leveraging the superior crystallinity and molecular thinness of 2DMC, the synaptic OPT exhibits comprehensive superior performance, including a linear dichroic ratio up to 3.85, a high responsivity of 1.47 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1, and the adept emulation of biological synapse functions. A sophisticated application in noncontact fingerprint detection achieves a 99.8% recognition accuracy, further highlights its potential. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one 2DMC optoelectronic synapse for polarization&#8208;sensitive NVS marks a new era for intelligent perception systems.

         <title>A Biomimetic Autophagosomes&#8208;Based Nanovaccine Boosts Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a biomimetic autophagosome&#8208;based (BAPs) personalized nanovaccine that integrates neoantigens sourced from tumor cell&#8208;derived autophagosomes, immunoadjuvants, and targeting nanovesicles to induce a potent tumor&#8208;specific immune response. The BAPs nanovaccine demonstrates significant efficacy in eradicating established tumors, providing comprehensive protection to mice against tumor rechallenges, and decreasing tumor incidence. This represents a highly versatile formulation for personalized cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Personalized cancer vaccines based on tumor cell lysates offer promise for cancer immunotherapy yet fail to elicit a robust therapeutic effect due to the weak immunogenicity of tumor antigens. Autophagosomes, obtained from pleural effusions and ascites of cancer patients, have been identified as abundant reservoirs of tumor neoantigens that exhibit heightened immunogenicity. However, their potential as personalized cancer vaccines have been constrained by suboptimal lymphatic&#8208;targeting performances and challenges in antigen&#8208;presenting cell endocytosis. Here,a reinforced biomimetic autophagosome&#8208;based (BAPs) nanovaccine generated by precisely amalgamating autophagosome&#8208;derived neoantigens and two types of adjuvants capable of targeting lymph nodes is developed to potently elicit antitumor immunity. The redox&#8208;responsive BAPs facilitate cytosolic vaccine opening within antigen&#8208;presenting cells, thereby exposing adjuvants and antigens to stimulate a strong immune response. BAPs evoke broad&#8208;spectrum T&#8208;cell responses, culminating in the effective eradication of 71.4% of established tumors. Notably, BAPs vaccination triggers enduring T&#8208;cell responses that confer robust protection, with 100% of mice shielded against tumor rechallenge and a significant reduction in tumor incidence by 87.5%. Furthermore, BAPs synergize with checkpoint blockade therapy to inhibit tumor growth in the poorly immunogenic breast cancer model. The biomimetic approach presents a powerful nanovaccine formula with high versatility&#160;for personalized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Simultaneous Color&#8208; and Dose&#8208;Controlled Thiol&#8211;Ene Resins for Multimodulus 3D Printing with Programmable Interfacial Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exposing a novel multifunctional resin to different colors and intensities of light enables 3D printing of high&#8208;resolution objects with programmable stiffness gradients that are mimetic of structures found in nature.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration from nature's own intricate designs, synthetic multimaterial structures have the potential to offer properties and functionality that exceed those of the individual components. However, several contemporary hurdles, from a lack of efficient chemistries to processing constraints, preclude the rapid and precise manufacturing of such materials. Herein, the development of a photocurable resin comprising color&#8208;selective initiators is reported, triggering disparate polymerization mechanisms between acrylate and thiol functionality. Exposure of the resin to UV light (365&#160;nm) leads to the formation of a rigid, highly crosslinked network via a radical chain&#8208;growth mechanism, while violet light (405&#160;nm) forms a soft, lightly crosslinked network via an anionic step&#8208;growth mechanism. The efficient photocurable resin is employed in multicolor digital light processing 3D printing to provide structures with moduli spanning over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, local intensity (i.e., grayscale) control enables the formation of programmable stiffness gradients with &#8776;150&#215; change in modulus occurring across sharp (&#8776;200&#160;&#181;m) and shallow (&#8776;9&#160;mm) interfaces, mimetic of the human knee entheses and squid beaks, respectively. This study provides composition&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationships to inform advanced manufacturing of next&#8208;generation multimaterial objects having a myriad of applications from healthcare to education.

         <title>Implantable Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Eradication of Postoperative Tumor Foci Mitigates Glioblastoma Relapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable and immunomodulatory microneedle (GMAN@CMN) is reported in this work. As an adjunctive strategy for the treatment of GBM, GMAN@CMN initiates anti&#8208;tumor immunity and effectively prevents GBM postoperative relapse. The implantable microneedle even holds potential when the tumor invades vital regions that cannot be surgically resected.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains incurable despite multimodal treatments after surgical debulking. Almost all patients with GBM relapse within a narrow margin (2&#8211;3&#160;cm) of the initial resected lesion due to the unreachable residual cancerous cells. Here, a completely biodegradable microneedle for surgical cavity delivery glioblastoma&#8208;associated macrophages (GAMs)&#8208;activating immune nano&#8208;stimulator that mitigates glioblastoma relapse is reported. The residual tumor lesion&#8208;directed biocompatible microneedle releases the nano&#8208;stimulator and toll&#8208;like receptor 9 agonist in a controlled manner until the microneedles completely degrade over 1 week, efferently induce in situ phonotypic shifting of GAMs from anti&#8208; to pro&#8208;inflammatory and the tumor recurrence is obviously inhibited. The implantable microneedles offer a significant improvement over conventional transdermal ones, as they are 100% degradable, ensuring safe application within surgical cavities. It is also revealed that the T cells are recruited to the tumor niche as the GAMs initiate anti&#8208;tumor response and eradicate residual GBM cells. Taken together, this work provides a potential strategy for immunomodulating the postoperative tumor niche to mitigate tumor relapse in GBM patients, which may have broad applications in other malignancies with surgical intervention.

Here, a completely biodegradable microneedle for surgical cavity delivery glioblastoma-associated macrophages (GAMs)-activating immune nano-stimulator that mitigates glioblastoma relapse is reported. The residual tumor lesion-directed biocompatible microneedle releases the nano-stimulator and toll-like receptor 9 agonist in a controlled manner until the microneedles completely degrade over 1 week, efferently induce in situ phonotypic shifting of GAMs from anti- to pro-inflammatory and the tumor recurrence is obviously inhibited. The implantable microneedles offer a significant improvement over conventional transdermal ones, as they are 100% degradable, ensuring safe application within surgical cavities. It is also revealed that the T cells are recruited to the tumor niche as the GAMs initiate anti-tumor response and eradicate residual GBM cells. Taken together, this work provides a potential strategy for immunomodulating the postoperative tumor niche to mitigate tumor relapse in GBM patients, which may have broad applications in other malignancies with surgical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence Supramolecular Hydrogel Based on Amphiphilic Bromonaphthalimide Pyridinium Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence supramolecular hydrogel is constructed based on amphiphilic bromonaphthalimide pyridinium hierarchical assembly in aqueous medium, which exhibits long&#8208;lived photoluminescence at 823&#160;nm with ultralarge Stokes shift and is successfully applied for cell labeling.








Abstract
Phosphorescent supramolecular hydrogels are currently a prevalent topic for their great promise in various photonic applications. Herein, an efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence supramolecular hydrogel is reported via the hierarchical assembly strategy in aqueous solution, which is fabricated from amphiphilic bromonaphthalimide pyridinium derivative (G), exfoliated Laponite (LP) nanosheets, and polymeric polyacrylamide (PAAm). Initially, G spontaneously self&#8208;aggregates into spherical nanoparticles covered with positively charged pyridinium units and emits single fluorescence at 410&#160;nm. Driven by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nanosheets, the nanoparticles subsequently function as the cross&#8208;linked binders and coassemble with LP into supramolecular hydrogels with an engendered red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) up to 620&#160;nm. Benefiting from hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions&#8208;mediated physical cross&#8208;linkage, the further introduction of PAAm not only significantly elevates the mechanical strength of the hydrogels showing fast self&#8208;healing capability, but also increases phosphorescence lifetime from 2.49&#160;to 4.20&#160;ms, especially generating phosphorescence at even higher temperature (&#964;
363 K = 2.46&#160;ms). Additionally, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs after doping a small amount of organic dye heptamethine cyanine (IR780) as an acceptor into hydrogels, resulting in a long&#8208;lived NIR emission at 823&#160;nm with a high donor/acceptor ratio, which is successfully applied for cell labeling in the NIR window.

         <title>In&#8208;Materia Annealing and Combinatorial Optimization Based on Vertical Memristive Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the inter&#8208;layer interference of a vertically stacked memristive crossbar array as an annealing method for combinatorial optimization problems. When these problems are mapped into the CBA's configuration layer, decaying annealing profiles are generated in the adjacent noise layers. The annealing profiles can be controlled electrically, offering material&#8208;based noise to solve the problems efficiently. 








Abstract
Due to its area and energy efficiency, a memristive crossbar array (CBA) has been extensively studied for various combinatorial optimization applications, from network problems to circuit design. However, conventional approaches include heavily burdening software fine&#8208;tuning for the annealing process. Instead, this study introduces the &#8220;in&#8208;materia annealing&#8221; method, where the inter&#8208;layer interference of vertically stacked memristive CBA is utilized as an annealing method. When mapping combinatorial optimization problems into the configuration layer of the CBA, exponentially decaying annealing profiles are generated in nearby noise layers. Moreover, in&#8208;materia annealing profiles can be controlled by changing compliance current, read voltage, and read pulse width. Therefore, the annealing profiles can be arbitrarily controlled and generated individually for each cell, providing rich noise sources to solve the problem efficiently. Consequently, the experimental and simulation of Max&#8208;Cut and weighted Max&#8208;Cut problems achieve notable results with the minimum software burden.

         <title>Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites with Sulfur Defects toward Superior Ethanol Electrosynthesis from CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and catalyst stability, electro&#8208;driven intercalation is employed to form Cu&#8208;In dual&#8208;active sites with sulfur vacancies for the simultaneous adsorption of *H and *CO intermediates. This catalyst facilitates the rate&#8208;limiting step of *CHO formation for the key *OCHCHO* intermediate of ethanol production, delivering a stable and high rate of ethanol formation from CO2 electrolysis.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from excess carbon dioxide (CO2) is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here it is proposed to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro&#8208;driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu&#8208;C and In&#8208;H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C&#8208;C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual&#8208;site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 for over 120 h. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up flow cell is assembled with an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 5.7 A for over 36 h, in which the carbon loss is less than 2.5% and single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency is &#8776;19%.

         <title>Toward Thin&#8208;Film Laser Diodes with Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Perspective discusses fundamental material limitations and device integration challenges that need to be addressed to bring metal halide perovskite thin&#8208;film devices from lasing under optical pumping to electrical pumping. These aspects include optical gain mechanisms, carrier recombination dynamics, electroluminescence efficiency roll&#8208;off, thermal runaway, and low&#8208;optical&#8208;loss layouts with compatible resonant cavity integration methods.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors hold a strong promise for enabling thin&#8208;film laser diodes. Perovskites distinguish themselves from other non&#8208;epitaxial media primarily through their ability to maintain performance at high current densities, which is a critical requirement for achieving injection lasing. Coming in a wide range of varieties, numerous perovskites delivered low&#8208;threshold optical amplified spontaneous emission and optically pumped lasing when combined with a suitable optical cavity. A progression toward electrically pumped lasing requires the development of efficient light&#8208;emitting structures with reduced optical losses and high radiative efficiency at lasing&#8208;level current densities. This involves a set of important trade&#8208;offs in terms of material choice, stack and waveguide design, as well as resonator integration. In this Perspective, the key milestones are highlighted that have been achieved in the study of passive optical waveguides and light&#8208;emitting diodes, and these learnings are translated toward more complex laser diode architectures. Finally, a novel resonator integration route is proposed that is capable of relaxing optical and electrical design constraints.

         <title>Atto&#8208;Scale Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors Enabled by Controlling Interfacial Energetic Offset through Enhanced Anchoring Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the JD and noise equiv. power (NEP) in NIR OPDs with varying electron blocking layers (EBLs). A newly synthesized EBL (named 3PAFBr) is introduced via a JD generation mechanism, significantly impacting NEP. The 3PAFBr&#8208;based OPD demonstrates a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1 V) and achieves several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensor technology is crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving and biometric tracking. Silicon photodetectors (SiPDs) are widely used in NIR applications; however, their scalability is limited by their crystalline properties. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have attracted attention for NIR applications owing to their scalability, low&#8208;temperature processing, and notably low dark current density (JD), which is similar to that of SiPDs. However, the still high JD (at NIR band) and few measurements of noise equivalent powers (NEPs) pose challenges for accurate performance comparisons. This study addresses these issues by quantitatively characterizing the performance matrix and JD generation mechanism using electron&#8208;blocking layers (EBLs) in OPDs. The energy offset at an EBL/photosensitive layer interface determines the thermal activation energy and directly affects JD. A newly synthesized EBL (3PAFBr) substantially enhances the interfacial energy barrier by forming a homogeneous contact owing to the improved anchoring ability of 3PAFBr. As a result, the OPD with 3PAFBr yields a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1&#160;V) and several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs. As far as it is known, this is an ultralow of&#160;JD in NIR OPDs. This emphasizes the necessity for quantitative performance characterization.

         <title>Activated Co in Thiospinel Boosting Li2CO3 Decomposition in Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By Ni substitution in the tetrahedral sites of Co&#8208;based thiospinel, Co atoms are activated to construct catalytic domain with multiple active sites. Resultant adsorption configuration leads to enhanced interaction between Li2CO3 and NiCo2S4, which result in reduced energy barrier for Li2CO3 decomposition and excellent catalytic activity to CO2 evolution reaction. As a result, the charge voltage is significantly reduced.








Abstract
Catalytic reactions mainly depend on the adsorption properties of reactants on the catalyst, which provides a perspective for the design of reversible lithium&#8722;carbon dioxide (Li&#8722;CO2) batteries including CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and CO2 evolution (CO2ER) reactions. However, due to the complex reaction process, the relationship between the adsorption configuration and CO2RR/CO2ER catalytic activity is still unclear in Li&#9472;CO2 batteries. Herein, taking Co3S4 as a model system, nickel (Ni&#160;substitution in the tetrahedral site to activate cobalt (Co) atom for forming multiatom catalytic domains in NiCo2S4 is utilized. Benefiting from the special geometric and electronic structures, NiCo2S4 exhibits an optimized adsorption configuration of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), promoting its effective activation and decomposition. As a result, the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries with NiCo2S4 cathode exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of low potential gap of 0.42&#160;V and high energy efficiency of 88.7%. This work provides a unique perspective for the development of highly efficient catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Inhibited Passivation by Bioinspired Cell Membrane Zn Interface for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Extended Temperature Adaptability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired cell membrane Zn|electrolyte interface inhibits the growth rate of the passivation layer on the Zn surface of Zn&#8211;air batteries, thereby increasing the charge transfer dynamics at the Zn interface. The robust cycling stability of corresponding bioinspired Zn&#8211;air batteries from 25 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is achieved, which is almost three times that of unmodified Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Due to the slow dynamics of mass and charge transfer at Zn|electrolyte interface, the stable operation of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is challenging, especially at low temperature. Herein, inspired by cell membrane, a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic dual modulated Zn|electrolyte interface is constructed. This amphiphilic design enables the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state (QSS) ZABs to display a long&#8208;term cyclability of 180 h@50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, a record&#8208;long time of 173 h@4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is also achieved, which is almost threefolds of untreated QSS ZABs. Control experiments and (in situ) characterization reveal that the growth of insulating ZnO passivation layers is largely inhibited by tuned hydrophilic&#8211;hydrophobic behavior. Thus, the enhanced transfer dynamic of Zn2+ at Zn|electrolyte interface from 25 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is attained. As an extension, the QSS Al&#8208;air batteries (AABs) with bioinspired interface also show unprecedented discharge stability of 420 h@1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C, which is about two times of untreated QSS AABs. This bioinspired&#8208;hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic dual modulation strategy may provide a reference for energy transform and storage devices with broad temperature adaptability.

Surface Amorphization
In article number 2404103, WooChul Jung, Bong&#8208;Joong Kim, Jongsu Seo, Scott A. Barnett, and their research team successfully induced simultaneous surface amorphization and nanocatalyst ex&#8208;solution on perovskite oxides through a simple hydrogen heat treatment. This surface reconstruction leads to a highly reactive and stable solid oxide fuel cell cathode, demonstrating its potential applicability to a full cell system. The cover image illustrates this surface reconstruction process, showing how hydrogen gas creates an amorphous surface and facilitates nanocatalyst ex&#8208;solution.

Hemostatic Peptide Hydrogel
The immemorial Chinese fairy tale &#8220;Nuwa fixing the sky&#8221; is used to metaphor the hemostatic process of hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) in article number 2405290 by Chaoqiang Fan, Malcolm Xing, Shiming Yang, and co&#8208;workers. The hole in the sky and the pouring flood from Tianhe River are metaphors for the wound and severe hemorrhage. The goddess Nuwa is using colorful stones which represent HPH, triggered by the blue laser to halt bleeding and saving lives.

Spontaneous Separation for Air&#8208;Floating Graphene Macrofilms
By means of ethanol&#8208;based binary solution, the self&#8208;assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8208;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8208;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance. More details can be found in article number 2408550 by Guomin Ding, Bowen Yang, Qilin Mei, and co&#8208;workers.

Porous Carbon Scaffolds
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2, realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility. More details can be found in article number 2406152 by Lixian Sun, Lixin Chen, Xuezhang Xiao, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Delivery Systems Developed for Treatment Combinations to Improve Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of various delivery strategies for combination cell therapy and their application in the clinic. Furthermore, the remaining challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are disscussed in detial, with the hope of accelerating the clinical translation of adoptive cell therapy for solid tumour.








Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has shown great success in the clinic for treating hematologic malignancies. However, solid tumor treatment with ACT monotherapy is still challenging, owing to insufficient expansion and rapid exhaustion of adoptive cells, tumor antigen downregulation/loss, and dense tumor extracellular matrix. Delivery strategies for combination cell therapy have great potential to overcome these hurdles. The delivery of vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, chemotherapeutics, and photothermal reagents in combination with adoptive cells, have been shown to improve the expansion/activation, decrease exhaustion, and promote the penetration of adoptive cells in solid tumors. Moreover, the delivery of nucleic acids to engineer immune cells directly in vivo holds promise to overcome many of the hurdles associated with the complex ex vivo cell engineering strategies. Here, these research advance, as well as the opportunities and challenges for integrating delivery technologies into cell therapy s are discussed, and the outlook for these emerging areas are criticlly analyzed.

         <title>Enabling Sustainable Ammonia Synthesis: From Nitrogen Activation Strategies to Emerging Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>

This review offers a comprehensive overview of the development of new materials and strategies aimed at enhancing N2 activation and NH3 formation in thermal catalysis. It highlights recent mechanisms, including self&#8208;electron donation, hydride fixation, promotion of anionic vacancies, and hydridic hydrogen reduction. Furthermore, the review discusses future challenges and opportunities for achieving sustainable ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important precursors of various chemicals and fertilizers. Given that ammonia synthesis via the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch process requires high temperatures and pressures, it is critical to explore effective strategies and catalysts for ammonia synthesis under mild reaction conditions. Although electrocatalysis and photocatalysis can convert N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, their efficiencies and production scales are still far from the requirements for industrialization. Thermal catalysis has been proven to be the most direct and effective approach for ammonia synthesis. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to develop novel catalysts capable of nitrogen fixation and ammonia generation via thermal catalytic processes. In parallel with catalyst exploration, new strategies such as self&#8208;electron donation, hydride fixation, hydridic hydrogen reduction, and anionic vacancy promotion have also been explored to moderate the operating conditions and improve the catalytic efficiency of ammonia synthesis. In this review, the emergence of new materials and strategies for promoting N2 activation and NH3 formation during thermal catalysis is briefly summarized. Moreover, challenges and prospects are proposed for the future development of thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
