         <title>Gold Nanocluster: A Photoelectric Converter for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanocluster triggers platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrugs activation through direct electron transfer from the excited state of the gold nanocluster to the Pt(IV) center under X&#8208;ray radiation, circulating the limitation of indirect reactive species that easily quenched in living tumor cells. This spatiotemporally synchronous radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy offers excellent antitumor performance, and leads to superior outcomes for combined treatment.








Abstract
Despite the promise of activatable chemotherapy, the development of a spatiotemporally controllable strategy for prodrug activation in deep tissues remains challenging. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is proposed for a gold nanocluster&#8208;based strategy that utilizes X&#8208;ray irradiation to trigger the liberation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrug conjugates, thus enabling radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the irradiated activation of prodrugs is achieved through direct photoelectron transfer from the excited&#8208;state gold nanoclusters to the Pt(IV) center, resulting in the release of cytotoxic Pt(II) agents. Compared to the traditional combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy strategy offers superior antitumor efficacy and safety benefits through spatiotemporal synergy at the tumor site. Additionally, this strategy elicits robust immunogenic cell death and yields profound outcomes for combined immunotherapy of breast cancer. This versatile strategy is ushering in a new era of radiation&#8208;mediated chemistry for controlled drug delivery and the precise regulation of biological processes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Multidirectional Bending in Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast light&#8208;triggered multidirectional bending is demonstrated in soft twist&#8208;coiled artificial muscles. The bending direction is dictated by the direction of the light leading to localized untwisting of the muscle. These artificial muscles can autonomously turn toward a light source, and they can be programmed for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in textiles.








Abstract
Using light to drive polymer actuators can enable spatially selective complex motions, offering a wealth of opportunities for wireless control of soft robotics and active textiles. Here, the integration of photothermal components is reported into shape memory polymer actuators. The fabricated twist&#8208;coiled artificial muscles show on&#8208;command multidirectional bending, which can be controlled by both the illumination intensity, as well as the chirality, of the prepared artificial muscles. Importantly, the direction in which these artificial muscles bend does not depend on intrinsic material characteristics. Instead, this directionality is achieved by localized untwisting of the actuator, driven by selective irradiation. The reaction times of this bending system are significantly &#8211; at least two orders of magnitude &#8211; faster than heliotropic biological systems, with a response time up to one second. The programmability of the artificial muscles is further demonstrated for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in butterfly&#8208;shaped textiles, along with the capacity to autonomously orient toward a light source. This functionality is maintained even on a rotating platform, with angular velocities of 6&#176;/s, independent of the rotation direction. These attributes collectively represent a breakthrough in the field of artificial muscles, intended to adaptive shape&#8208;changing soft systems and biomimetic technologies.

         <title>Enhanced SWIR Light Detection in Organic Semiconductor Photodetectors through Up&#8208;Conversion of Mid&#8208;Gap Trap States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for creating shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photo&#8208;response in organic photodiodes by utilizing mid&#8208;gap states through &#8216;trap&#8208;doping&#8217; is presented. This involves incorporating small amounts of a guest organic molecule into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;SWIR broadband organic photodiode is demonstrated.








Abstract
Shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photodetectors are vital for many scientific and industrial applications including surveillance, quality control and inspection. In recent decades, photodetectors based on organic semiconductors have emerged, demonstrating potential to add real value to broadband and narrowband imaging and sensing scenarios, where factors such as thermal budget sensitivity, large area aperture necessity, cost considerations, and lightweight and conformal flexibility demands are prioritized. It is now recognized that the performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs), notably their specific detectivity, is ultimately limited by trap states, universally present in disordered semiconductors. This work adopts an approach of utilizing these mid&#8208;gap states to specifically create a SWIR photo&#8208;response. To this end, this work introduces a somewhat counter&#8208;intuitive approach of &#8220;trap&#8208;doping&#8221; in bulk heterojunction (BHJs) photodiodes, where small quantities of a guest organic molecule are intentionally incorporated into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. Following this approach, this work demonstrates a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;SWIR broadband OPD, approaching (and, to some extent, even exceeding) state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance across critical photodetector metrics. The trap&#8208;doping approach is, even though only a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept currently, broadly applicable to various spectral windows. It represents a new modality for engineering photodetection using the unconventional strategy of turning a limitation into a feature.

         <title>Enhancing Ultrasound Power Transfer: Efficiency, Acoustics, and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implantable devices significantly enhance healthcare but are limited by battery life. Ultrasound power transfer technology offers a promising solution for sustainable operation. This review addresses gaps in current research, particularly in sound field analysis and energy efficiency optimization. It proposes an energy flow diagram, discusses development stages, and explores the potential advancements in ultrasound&#8208;based healthcare solutions.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices (IMDs), like pacemakers regulating heart rhythm or deep brain stimulators treating neurological disorders, revolutionize healthcare. However, limited battery life necessitates frequent surgeries for replacements. Ultrasound power transfer (UPT) emerges as a promising solution for sustainable IMD operation. Current research prioritizes implantable materials, with less emphasis on sound field analysis and maximizing energy transfer during wireless power delivery. This review addresses this gap. A comprehensive analysis of UPT technology, examining cutting&#8208;edge system designs, particularly in power supply and efficiency is provided. The review critically examines existing efficiency models, summarizing the key parameters influencing energy transmission in UPT systems. For the first time, an energy flow diagram of a general UPT system is proposed to offer insights into the overall functioning. Additionally, the review explores the development stages of UPT technology, showcasing representative designs and applications. The remaining challenges, future directions, and exciting opportunities associated with UPT are discussed. By highlighting the importance of sustainable IMDs with advanced functions like biosensing and closed&#8208;loop drug delivery, as well as UPT's potential, this review aims to inspire further research and advancements in this promising field.

         <title>Vertically Phase Separated Photomultiplication Organic Photodetectors with p&#8208;n Heterojunction Type Ultrafast Dynamic Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical donor&#8211;acceptor phase separation in photomultiplication organic photodetectors induces a partial p&#8208;n heterojunction character with remarkably improved dynamic properties while maintaining high external quantum efficiency and detectivity. The strategy marks a pioneering achievement by showcasing the simultaneous presence of p&#8208;n heterojunction and photomultiplication modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time.








Abstract
Photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;type organic photodetectors (OPDs), which typically form a homogeneous distribution (HD) of n&#8208;type dopants in a p&#8208;type polymer host (HD PM&#8208;type OPDs), have achieved a breakthrough in device responsivity by surpassing a theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, they face limitations in higher dark current and slower dynamic characteristics compared to p&#8208;n heterojunction (p&#8208;n HJ) OPDs due to inherent long lifetime of trapped electrons. To overcome this, a new PM&#8208;type OPD is developed that demonstrates ultrafast dynamic properties through a vertical phase separation (VPS) strategy between the p&#8208;type polymer and n&#8208;type acceptor, referred to as VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs. Notably, VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs show three orders of magnitude&#160;increase in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut&#8208;off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200&#8208;fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM&#8208;type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 1013 Jones at &#8722;10&#160;V. The VPS PM&#8208;type OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of p&#8208;n HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photomultiplication (PM)-type organic photodetectors (OPDs), which typically form a homogeneous distribution (HD) of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type dopants in a &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-type polymer host (HD PM-type OPDs), have achieved a breakthrough in device responsivity by surpassing a theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, they face limitations in higher dark current and slower dynamic characteristics compared to &lt;i&gt;p-n&lt;/i&gt; heterojunction (&lt;i&gt;p-n&lt;/i&gt; HJ) OPDs due to inherent long lifetime of trapped electrons. To overcome this, a new PM-type OPD is developed that demonstrates ultrafast dynamic properties through a vertical phase separation (VPS) strategy between the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-type polymer and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type acceptor, referred to as VPS PM-type OPDs. Notably, VPS PM-type OPDs show three orders of magnitude&#160;increase in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut-off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200-fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM-type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at &#8722;10&#160;V. The VPS PM-type OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of &lt;i&gt;p-n&lt;/i&gt; HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Atomic Dual&#8208;Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property relationship between the asymmetric atomic dual sites and the CO2RR is reviewed. A timely reference for researchers engages in the design and development of photocatalyst to explore a promising approach for complex photocatalytic conversion pathways. Some perspectives are provided for achieving efficient and sustainable photocatalysis based on tailoring strategies, design of active sites, and future challenges.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed active sites in a photocatalyst offer unique advantages such as locally tuned electronic structures, quantum size effects, and maximum utilization of atomic species. Among these, asymmetric atomic dual&#8208;sites are of particular interest because their asymmetric charge distribution generates a local built&#8208;in electric potential to enhance charge separation and transfer. Moreover, the dual sites provide flexibility for tuning complex multielectron and multireaction pathways, such as CO2 reduction reactions. The coordination of dual sites opens new possibilities for engineering the structure&#8211;activity&#8211;selectivity relationship. This comprehensive overview discusses efficient and sustainable photocatalysis processes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, focusing on strategic active&#8208;site design and future challenges. It serves as a timely reference for the design and development of photocatalytic conversion processes, specifically exploring the utilization of asymmetric atomic dual&#8208;sites for complex photocatalytic conversion pathways, here exemplified by the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Negative Photoconductivity Transistors for Visuomorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant progress has been made in visuomorphic computing, but challenges remain in perceiving complex interactive environments. This review is the first to discuss the development and application of NPTs in the field of visuomorphic computing and provides a good reference for others to design lower power consumption, multivisual task coordinated, and multisensory fused artificial vision systems.








Abstract
Visuomorphic computing aims to simulate and potentially surpass the human retina by mimicking biological visual perception with an artificial retina. Despite significant progress, challenges persist in perceiving complex interactive environments. Negative photoconductivity transistors (NPTs) mimic synaptic behavior by achieving adjustable positive photoconductivity (PPC) and negative photoconductivity (NPC), simulating &#8220;excitation&#8221; and &#8220;inhibition&#8221; akin to sensory cell signals. In complex interactive environments, NPTs are desired for visuomorphic computing that can achieve a better sense of information, lower power consumption, and reduce hardware complexity. In this review, it is started by introducing the development process of NPTs, while placing a strong emphasis on the device structures, working mechanisms, and key performance parameters. The common material systems employed in NPTs based on their functions are then summarized. Moreover, it is proceeded to summarize the noteworthy applications of NPTs in optoelectronic devices, including advanced multibit nonvolatile memory, optoelectronic logic gates, optical encryption, and visual perception. Finally, the challenges and prospects that lie ahead in the ongoing development of NPTs are addressed, offering valuable insights into their applications in optoelectronics and a comprehensive understanding of their significance.

         <title>Ionic Photovoltaics&#8208;in&#8208;Memory in van der Waals Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic photovoltaics&#8208;in&#8208;memory has been found&#160;in centrosymmetric CdSb2Se3Br2. The migration of Br ions induces a reversible modulation of the built&#8208;in electric field, resulting in significant anisotropy and electrically&#8208;induced nonvolatile photovoltaic currents. Consequently, a highly secure circuit with electrical and optical keys is implemented. It&#160;opens up new possibilities for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The photovoltaic effect is gaining growing attention in the optoelectronics field due to its low power consumption, sustainable nature, and high efficiency. However, the photovoltaic effects hitherto reported are hindered by the stringent band&#8208;alignment requirement or inversion symmetry&#8208;breaking, and are challenging for achieving multifunctional photovoltaic properties (such as reconfiguration, nonvolatility, and so on). Here, a novel ionic photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric CdSb2Se3Br2 that can overcome these limitations is demonstrated. The photovoltaic effect displays significant anisotropy, with the photocurrent being most apparent along the CdBr2 chains while absent perpendicular to them. Additionally, the device shows electrically&#8208;induced nonvolatile photocurrent switching characteristics. The photovoltaic effect is attributed to the modulation of the built&#8208;in electric field through the migration of Br ions. Using these unique photovoltaic properties, a highly secure circuit with electrical and optical keys is successfully implemented. The findings not only broaden the understanding of the photovoltaic mechanism, but also provide a new material platform for the development of in&#8208;memory sensing and computing devices.

         <title>In Situ Triggered Self&#8208;Contraction Bioactive Microgel Assembly Accelerates Diabetic Skin Wound Healing by Activating Mechanotransduction and Biochemical Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SMART&#8208;EXO, a self&#8208;contraction bioactive core&#8211;shell microgel dressing with robust tissue&#8208;adhesion, enhances diabetic wound healing by enabling tunable contraction, activating mechanotransduction, and releasing bioactive exosomes. This dressing promotes fibroblast&#8208;to&#8208;myofibroblast conversion, collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and re&#8208;epithelialization. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal activation of critical signaling pathways associated with mechanosensing and exosome regulation, highlighting the mechanisms of combining biomechanical and biochemical cues.








Abstract
Chronic nonhealing skin wounds, characterized by reduced tissue contractility and inhibited wound cell survival under hyperglycemia and hypoxia, present a significant challenge in diabetic care. Here, an advanced self&#8208;contraction bioactive core&#8208;shell microgel assembly with robust tissue&#8208;adhesion (SMART&#8208;EXO) is introduced to expedite diabetic wound healing. The SMART&#8208;EXO dressing exhibits strong, reversible adhesion to damaged tissue due to abundant hydrogen and dynamic coordination bonds. Additionally, the core&#8208;shell microgel components and dynamic coordination bonds provide moderate rigidity, customizable self&#8208;contraction, and an interlinked porous architecture. The triggered in situ self&#8208;contraction of the SMART&#8208;EXO dressing enables active, tunable wound contraction, activating mechanotransduction in the skin and promoting the optimal fibroblast&#8208;to&#8208;myofibroblast conversion, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis. Concurrently, the triggered contraction of SMART&#8208;EXO facilitates efficient loading and on&#8208;demand release of bioactive exosomes, contributing to re&#8208;epithelialization and wound microenvironment regulation in diabetic mice. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal the activation of critical signaling pathways associated with mechanosensing and exosome regulation, highlighting the combined biomechanical and biochemical mechanisms. These findings underscore SMART&#8208;EXO as a versatile, adaptable solution to the complex challenges of diabetic wound care.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain high&#8208;performance microwave absorption materials, designing structures has proved as a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide aerogel absorbers containing multi&#8208;structures ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscopic are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. The monolayer bidirectional aerogel and its multilayer non&#8208;gradient structure exhibit wide effective absorption bandwidths of 8.58 and 9.41&#160;GHz, respectively.








Abstract
To obtain high&#8208;performance electromagnetic microwave (EM) absorption materials with broad effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) and reduced thickness, designing structures has proved to be a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide EM absorption aerogels containing multi&#8208;structures on scales ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscale are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. On the microscale, under the action of electric force and temperature gradient, the ordered structures made of aligned Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and the microscale layered aerogel walls enable the bidirectional aerogel to achieve a wide EAB of 8.58&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.1&#160;mm. This is ascribed to the numerous aligned nanosheets and layered aerogel walls perpendicular to the incident EMs, facilitating the conversion of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the multilayer bidirectional aerogel with non&#8208;gradient structures effectively resolves the conflict between impedance matching and energy loss, resulting in an ultrawide EAB of 9.41&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3&#160;mm. This innovative design of electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted multilayer bidirectional aerogels with multiscale structural coupling may provide feasible and effective pathways for the development of advanced EM absorption materials.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanostructures Grown from Reacting Droplet&#8208;In&#8208;Microwell Array on Flexible Films for Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy in Plant Wearable In Situ Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micro&#8208;well structured plasmonic film with in situ grown dendritic Ag nanostructures is developed for plant wearable surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. The film capitalizes on the concentration enrichment of analytes through droplet evaporation within the microwell, facilitating ultrasensitive detection. Additionally, this film offers dual&#8208;sided detection and allows for multiplexed identification of target analytes, expanding its utility in precision agriculture, bio&#8208;sensing, and environmental surveillance.








Abstract
Plant wearable detection has garnered significant interest in advancing agricultural intelligence and promoting sustainable food production amidst the challenges of climate change. Accurately monitoring plant health and agrochemical residue levels necessitates qualities such as precision, affordability, simplicity, and noninvasiveness. Here, a novel attachable plasmonic film is introduced and designed for on&#8208;site detection of agrochemical residues utilizing surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). By functionalizing a thin polydimethylsiloxane film with silver nanoparticles via controlled droplet reactions in micro&#8208;well arrays, a plasmonic film is achieved that not only maintains optical transparency for precise analyte localization but also conforms closely to the plant surface, facilitating highly sensitive SERS measurements. The reliability of this film enables accurate identification and quantification of individual compounds and their mixtures, boasting an ultra&#8208;low detection limit ranging from 10&#8722;16 to 10&#8722;13 m, with mini mal relative standard deviation. To showcase its potential, on&#8208;field detection of pesticide residues on fruit surfaces is conducted using a handheld Raman spectrometer. This advancement in fabricating plasmonic nanostructures on flexible films holds promise for expanding SERS applications beyond plant monitoring, including personalized health monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis, wearable devices for human&#8211;machine interface, and on&#8208;site monitoring of environmental&#160;pollutants.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Large&#8208;Scale, 3D, and Stretchable Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;LSC enables the fabrication of large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits. Soft copper&#8208;clad laminates and multiple types of VIAs are employed to create large&#8208;scale planar interconnects and vertical interconnects. A temporary bonding strategy is proposed to mitigate misalignment with residual and thermal strains. 3D&#8208;LSC facilitates batch production of miniaturized multifunctional devices and the fabrication of large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have demonstrated excellent potential in wearable healthcare and conformal integration. Achieving the scalable fabrication of stretchable devices with high functional density is the cornerstone to enable the practical applications of stretchable electronics. Here, a comprehensive methodology for realizing large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits (3D&#8208;LSC) is reported. The soft copper&#8208;clad laminate (S&#8208;CCL) based on the &#8220;cast and cure&#8221; process facilitates patterning the planar interconnects with the scale beyond 1 m. With the ability to form through, buried and blind VIAs in the multilayer stack of S&#8208;CCLs, high functional density can be achieved by further creating vertical interconnects in stacked S&#8208;CCLs. The application of temporary bonding substrate effectively minimizes the misalignments caused by residual strain and thermal strain. 3D&#8208;LSC enables the batch production of stretchable skin patches based on five&#8208;layer stretchable&#160;circuits, which can serve as a miniaturized system for physiological signals monitoring with wireless power delivery. The fabrications of conformal antenna and stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode display further illustrate the potential of 3D&#8208;LSC in realizing large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels Facilitates Strong and Large Contractile Actuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) hydrogels are fabricated through solvent engineering. A particular solvent interacts affinitively with the NIPAAm monomer, solubilizes the monomer with extremely high concentration, stabilizes chain propagation during polymerization, and significantly increases chain lengths and entanglements of the resulting hydrogel. The synthesized hydrogels are highly elastic, strong, and tough, displaying remarkable thermo&#8208;responsive contractile actuation.








Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels can generate the actuation force through volumetric transitions in response to temperature changes. However, their weak mechanical properties and fragile actuation performance limit robust applications. Existing approaches to enhance these properties have typically depended on additional components, leading to an unavoidable interference to the actuation performance. In this work, robust thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels are fabricated through solvent engineering. A particular solvent, N&#8208;methylformamide, interacts affinitively with the carbonyl group of N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide monomer, solubilizes the monomer with extremely high concentration, stabilizes chain propagation during polymerization, and greatly increases chain lengths and entanglements of the resulting polymer. The synthesized hydrogels are highly elastic, strong, and tough, displaying remarkable thermo&#8208;responsive contractile actuation. The simple synthetic process can broaden its applicability in designing robust functional hydrogel applications.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active metasurfaces are emerging as a new avenue for creating compact, high&#8208;performance reconfigurable optical devices. This study demonstrates a non&#8208;volatile transmissive metafilter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs deposited on a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 microheater. The metafilter can be electrically switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using no mechanical movements with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB.








Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free&#8208;space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non&#8208;mechanical, non&#8208;volatile transmissive filter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs with a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free&#8208;space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.

The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low- and high-transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free-space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Elastic Protein Nanosheets Enable the Culture and Differentiation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells on Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid microcarriers are attractive solutions to enable cell culture in a scalable format, for stem cell manufacturing and applications in regenerative medicine. Here, iPSCs are cultured at the surface of microdroplets for the first time. This process is enabled by the self&#8208;assembly of strong elastic protein nanosheets that stabilize microdroplets, reinforce interfacial mechanics and engage cell adhesion receptors.








Abstract
Advances in stem cell technologies, revolutionizing regenerative therapies and advanced in vitro testing, require novel cell manufacturing pipelines able to cope with scale up and parallelization. Microdroplet technologies, which have transformed single cell sequencing and other cell&#8208;based assays, are attractive in this context, but the inherent soft mechanics of liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces is typically thought to be incompatible with the expansion of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and their differentiation. In this work, the design of protein nanosheets stabilizing liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces and enabling the adhesion, expansion and retention of stemness by iPSCs is reported. Microdroplet microfluidic chips are used to control the formulation of droplets with defined dimensions and size distributions. The resulting emulsions sustain high expansion rates, with excellent retention of stem cell marker expression. iPSCs cultured in such conditions retain the capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. This work provides clear evidence that local nanoscale mechanics, associated with interfacial viscoelasticity, provides strong cues able to regulate and maintain pluripotency, as well as to support commitment in defined differentiation conditions. Microdroplet technologies appear as attractive candidates to transform cell manufacturing pipelines, bypassing significant hurdles paused by solid substrates and microcarriers.

         <title>A Generalized Coordination Engineering Strategy for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the generalized coordination engineering strategy, the representative samples Co&#8208;N3O and Ni&#8208;N3S are precisely synthesized, and both of them present excellent activity and H2O2 selectivity (&#8776;90%) compared with conventional Metal&#8208;N4 configurations. Moreover, they enable a high H2O2 production of 14.2 and 17.5 moL&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the three&#8208;phrase flow cell and maintain a satisfying stability over 12&#160;h.








Abstract
Designing non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs) for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR) is attractive for the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis, in which the coordination configuration of the M&#8208;SACs essentially affects the reaction activity and product selectivity. Though extensively investigated, a generalized coordination engineering strategy has not yet been proposed, which fundamentally hinders the rational design of M&#8208;SACs with optimized catalytic capabilities. Herein, a generalized coordination engineering strategy is proposed for M&#8208;SACs toward H2O2 electrosynthesis via introducing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or sulfur atoms) with higher or lower electronegativity than nitrogen atoms into the first sphere of metal&#8208;N4 system to tailor their electronic structure and adjust the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates, respectively, thus optimizing their electrocatalytic capability for 2e&#8208;ORR. Specifically, the (O, N)&#8208;coordinated Co SAC (Co&#8208;N3O) and (S, N)&#8208;coordinated Ni SAC (Ni&#8208;N3S) are precisely synthesized, and both present superior 2e&#8208;ORR activity (Eonset: &#8776;0.80&#160;V versus RHE) and selectivity (&#8776;90%) in alkaline conditions compared with conventional Co&#8208;N4 and Ni&#8208;N4 sites. The high H2O2 yield rates of 14.2 and 17.5&#160;moL&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability over 12&#160;h are respectively achieved for Co&#8208;N3O and Ni&#8208;N3S. Such favorable 2e&#8208;ORR pathway of the catalysts is also theoretically confirmed by the kinetics simulations.

         <title>Reactive Processing of Furan&#8208;Based Monomers via Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization for High Performance Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New monomers capable of frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization are identified through computational screening of thermostability and ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization exotherms. Subsequent experimental validation of physical properties of monomers, kinetics, and material properties reveal frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization viability and promise in enabling energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing of 3D printed structures and gradient materials.








Abstract
Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) presents an energy&#8208;efficient approach to produce high&#8208;performance polymers, typically utilizing norbornene derivatives from Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. This study broadens the monomer repertoire for FROMP, incorporating the cycloaddition product of biosourced furan compounds and benzyne, namely 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene (HEN) derivatives. A computational screening of Diels&#8211;Alder products is conducted, selecting products with resistance to retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder but also sufficient ring strain to facilitate FROMP. The experiments reveal that varying substituents both modulate the FROMP kinetics and enable the creation of thermoplastic materials characterized by different thermomechanical properties. Moreover, HEN&#8208;based crosslinkers are designed to enhance the resulting thermomechanical properties at high temperatures (&gt;200&#160;&#176;C). The versatility of such materials is demonstrated through direct ink writing (DIW) to rapidly produce 3D structures without the need for printed supports. This research significantly extends the range of monomers suitable for FROMP, furthering efficient production of high&#8208;performance polymeric materials.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Glass States Generated in a van der Waals Magnet by Alkali&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na atoms are intercalated into the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of Cr2Ge2Te6 where magnetic frustration is discovered and leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order, confirmed by characteristic signature in ac magnetic susceptibility. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.








Abstract
Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured significant attention due to the efficient control of ground states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer, and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin&#8208;orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature (TC) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, an uncharted role of intercalation is discovered to generate magnetic frustration. As a model study, Na atoms are intercalated into the vdW gaps of pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters including the significant enhancement of TC from 66 to 240&#160;K and the switching of magnetic easy&#8208;hard axis direction. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.

         <title>Tissue/Organ Adaptable Bioelectronic Silk&#8208;Based Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue/organ adaptable bioelectronic silk&#8208;based implants are devices fabricated on geometrically reconfigurable silk membranes for biomedical applications. Leveraging the unique properties of silk, these devices exhibit high biocompatibility and can deform into designed shapes to natively fit the target tissue/organ surfaces. Functions are integrated through processed silk and Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) technologies.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronic devices, designed for both monitoring and modulating living organisms, require functional and biological adaptability. Pure silk is innovatively employed, which is known for its excellent biocompatibility, to engineer water&#8208;triggered, geometrically reconfigurable membranes, on which functions can be integrated by Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) techniques and specially functionalized silk. These devices can undergo programmed shape deformations within 10&#160;min once triggered by water, and thus establishing stable bioelectronic interfaces with natively fitted geometries. As a testament to the applicability of this approach, a twining peripheral nerve electrode is designed, fabricated, and rigorously tested, demonstrating its efficacy in nerve modulation while ensuring biocompatibility for successful implantation.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Lanthanide Metallopolymer: Self&#8208;Healing and Photo&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dual&#8208;Emitting Luminescence for Diverse Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible/UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photosensitive photoluminescent metallopolymers with good mechanical properties and fast self&#8208;healing behaviors are successfully developed by incorporating spiropyran and terpyridine components into a unified lanthanide polymer structure. By adjusting the proportions of raw material, precise control over the stimulus response and luminescent color can be achieved. The obtained polymers have been applied for dynamic information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing, and Light&#8208;writing fields.








Abstract
Photoluminescent metallopolymers displaying photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are emerging as promising materials with versatile applications in photo&#8208;rewritable patterns, wearable UV sensors, and optical encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, integrating these materials into practical applications that require fast response times, lightweight qualities, fatigue resistance, and multiple encryption capabilities poses challenges. In this study, luminescent photochromic lanthanide (Ln) metallopolymers with rapid self&#8208;healing properties are developed by cross&#8208;linking terpyridine (Tpy)&#8208; and spiropyran (SP)&#8208; functionalized polyurethane chains through Ln&#8208;Tpy coordination bonds and H&#8208;bonds among polymer chains. The resulting products exhibit a range of intriguing features: i) photo&#8208;stimuli responsiveness using spiropyran monomers without additional dopants; ii) dual&#8208;emitting performance under UV&#8208;light due to Ln&#8208;Tpy and open&#8208;ring spiropyran moieties; iii) satisfactory mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing abilities from polymer chains; iv) multiple control switches for luminescence colors through photostimulation or feed ratio adjustments. Leveraging these attributes, the developed material introduces novel opportunities for light&#8208;writing applications, advanced information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing wearable devices, and insights into designing multifunctional intelligent materials for the future.

         <title>Homogeneous Fluorine Doping toward Highly Conductive and Stable Li10GeP2S12 Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;doped Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 possesses enhanced stability against moist air and lithium metal due to decreased H2O adsorption energy and formation energy of lithium vacancy, showing nearly one order of magnitude higher ionic conductivity than that of Li10GeP2S12 after air&#8208;exposure. The Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 monolayer solid electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
The unique structure and exceptionally high lithium ion conductivity over 10&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 of Li10GeP2S12 have gained extensive attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, its poor resistivity to moisture and chemical/electrochemical incompatibility with lithium metal severely impede its practical application. Herein, a fluorine functionalized Li10GeP2S12 is synthesized by stannous fluoride doping and employed as a monolayer solid electrolyte to realize stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The atomic&#8208;scale mechanism underlying the impact of fluorine doping on both moisture and electrochemical stability of Li10GeP2S12 is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Fluorine surface doping significantly reduces surface hydrophilicity by electronic regulation, thereby retarding the hydrolysis reaction of Li10GeP2S12. After exposed to a relative humidity of 35%&#8211;40% for 20&#160;min, the ionic conductivity of Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 maintains as high as 2.21&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of Li10GeP2S12 with 0.31&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1. Meanwhile, bulk doping of highly electronegative fluorine promotes the formation of lithium vacancies in the Li10GeP2S12 system, thus allowing stable lithium plating/stripping in Li | Li symmetric batteries, boosting a critical current density reaching 2.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The LiCoO2 | lithium all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability, showing 80.1% retention after 600 cycles at 1C.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Carbon Potassium&#8208;Ion Capacitor Enabled by Hollow Carbon Fibrous Electrodes with Reduced Graphitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2 ceramic nanofibers are employed as the catalytic template to fabricate hollow tubular N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanofibers, which has high tensile strength, robust structural flexibility, and excellent electronic conductivity. High K+&#8208;storage capacity at low plateau potential and fast K+&#8208;intercalation kinetics are achieved to build a flexible K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor.








Abstract
The large size of K+ ions (1.38 &#197;) sets a challenge in achieving high kinetics and long lifespan of potassium storage devices. Here, a fibrous ZrO2 membrane is utilized as a reactive template to construct a dual&#8208;carbon K&#8208;ion capacitor. Unlike graphite, ZrO2&#8208;catalyzed graphitic carbon presents a relatively disordered layer arrangement with an expanded interlayer spacing of 0.378&#160;nm to accommodate K+ insertion/extraction. Pyridine&#8208;derived nitrogen sites can locally store K&#8208;ions without disrupting the formation of stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). Consequently, N&#8208;doped hollow graphitic carbon fiber achieves a K+&#8208;storage capacity (primarily below 1&#160;V), which is 1.5 time that of commercial graphite. Potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors are assembled using the hollow carbon fiber electrodes and the ZrO2 nanofiber membrane as the separator. The capacitor exhibits a high power of 40 000 W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, full charge in 8.5&#8201;s, 93% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2&#8201;A g&#8722;1, and a low self&#8208;discharge rate of 8.6&#160;mV h&#8722;1. The scalability and high performance of the lattice&#8208;expanded tubular carbon electrodes underscores may advance the practical potassium&#8208;ion capacitors.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;distorted TiOxFy catalyst is developed with a strengthened pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, which can regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst, the microenvironment at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and consequently the absorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, leading to significant pH&#8208;resistant properties for two&#8208;electrode oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of small molecules (like O2 and CO2) often exhibits strong activity dependence on pHs because of discrepant proton donor environments. However, some catalysts can show seldom dependence on two&#8208;electron oxygen electroreduction, a sustainable route of O2 hydrogenation to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this work, a pH&#8208;resistant oxygen electroreduction system arising from the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is demonstrated. Thorough operando Raman spectra, local environment analyses and density function theory simulations, the lattice distortion of TiOxFy that introduces the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect contributing to regulating local pHs at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces and the absorption/desorption of key *OOH intermediate is revealed. Consequently, as comparison to 78.6% activity attenuation for common catalyst, the TiOxFy displays minor activity decay (3.2%) in the pH range of 1&#8211;13 with remarkable Faradaic efficiencies (93.4&#8211;96.4%) and H2O2 yield rates (595&#8211;614&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) in the current densities of 100&#8211;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further techno&#8208;economics analyses display the H2O2 production cost dependent on pHs, giving the lowest H2O2 price of $0.37&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present finding is expected to provide an additional dimension to pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that leverages systems beyond traditional conception.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Presodiation Agent Via Triggering Anionic Oxidation Activity in Sodium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Ni into specific Li sites within the Na2O framework tunes band structures, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion and accelerating the decomposition kinetics of Na2O. It can serve as a cathode presodiation agent to compensate for the irreversible sodium loss during the initial cycling; thus, enhancing the energy density of practical Na&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.








Abstract
Compensating for the irreversible loss of limited active sodium (Na) is crucial for enhancing the energy density of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) full&#8208;cell, especially when employing hard carbon anode with initially lower coulombic efficiency. Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05&#9633;0.06)2O (Ni&#8211;Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni&#8211;O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8&#160;V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g&#8776;Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate &gt;80%). Incorporating currently&#8208;modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na&#8208;ion full&#8208;cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively. Further, not limited to Ni&#8211;Na2O, the structure&#8211;function relationship between the anionic oxidation mechanism and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface fabrication is revealed as a paradigm for the development of sacrificial cathode presodiation agent.

         <title>Retinomorphic Color Perception Based on Opponent Process Enabled by Perovskite Bipolar Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual perovskite absorber device in an antagonistic configuration is capable of generate bipolar responses with colors from the opponent pairs. Two variants (red&#8208;green and yellow&#8208;blue opponents) are fabricated, and filter&#8208;free machine color vision with high contrasts is demonstrated. The adaptation capabilities of the perovskite photodetector also ensure accurate color perception in different lighting conditions.








Abstract
The ability to perceive color by the retina can be attributed to both its trichromatic photoreceptors and the antagonistic neural wiring known as the opponent process. While neuromorphic sensors have been shown to demonstrate memory and adaptation capabilities, color perception is still challenging due to the intrinsic lack of spectral selectivity in narrow bandgap semiconductors. Furthermore, research on emulating neural wiring is severely lacking. The combination of halide perovskite materials with a tunable bandgap and a novel bipolar photodetector design emulates the efficiency of the retina in processing color information. The stimuli&#8208;responsive material is also responsible for maintaining partial color constancy&#8212;an adaptation feature. Leveraging the unique enhancement of color contrasts, an in&#8208;sensor data compression and edge detection can also be demonstrated. The color perception, chromatic adaptation, and color contrast enhancement make perovskite bipolar photodetectors a unique example where the sensor and neural wiring can be co&#8208;developed in conjunction.

         <title>Suppressed Defects by Functional Thermally Cross&#8208;Linked Fullerene for High&#8208;Efficiency Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed tin&#8208;lead&#8208;based perovskite solar cells with ideal bandgap (1.2 eV) develop rapidly, while the top interface defects and Sn oxidation cannot be solved simultaneously. It is found cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) can coordinate with perovskite and optimize the interface and bulk of perovskite. This work demonstrates the optimization effect of C&#8208;PCBSD on perovskite interface and bulk.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites have attracted the attention of the community due to their narrow bandgap, ideal for photovoltaic applications, especially tandem solar cells. However, the oxidation and rapid crystallization of Sn2+ and the interfacial traps hinder their development. Here, cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) is introduced during the quenching step of perovskite thin film processing to suppress the generation of surface defects at the electron transport layer interface and improve the bulk crystallinity. The C&#8208;PCBSD has strong coordination ability with Sn2+ and Pb2+ perovskite precursors, which retards the crystallization process, suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+, and improves the perovskite bulk and surface crystallinity, yielding films with reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced interface charge extraction. Besides, the C&#8208;PCBSD network deposited on the perovskite surface displays superior hydrophobicity and oxygen resistance. Consequently, the devices with C&#8208;PCBSD obtain PCEs of up to 23.4% and retained 97% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of storage in a N2 atmosphere.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of energy and signal transmission for electricity, light, and heat at wetting interfaces, elucidating their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. Harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim of providing strategies.








Abstract
Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&amp;S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&amp;S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other. Over the past decade, their distinctive transport phenomena during wetting processes have made significant contributions to various domains. However, few studies have analyzed the intricate relationship between wetting behavior and E&amp;S transport. This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of electrical, light, and heat transmission at wetting interfaces to elucidate their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. The materials, structures, and devices involved in E&amp;S transportation are also analyzed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&amp;amp;S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&amp;amp;S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other. Over the past decade, their distinctive transport phenomena during wetting processes have made significant contributions to various domains. However, few studies have analyzed the intricate relationship between wetting behavior and E&amp;amp;S transport. This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of electrical, light, and heat transmission at wetting interfaces to elucidate their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. The materials, structures, and devices involved in E&amp;amp;S transportation are also analyzed. Particularly, harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim to provide strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Reprogrammable 2D Array of Multistate Molecular Switching Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual triazatruxene (TAT) molecules forming a honeycomb lattice on Ag(111) can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.








Abstract
Integration of molecular switching units into complex electronic circuits is considered to be the next step toward the realization of novel logic and memory devices. This paper reports on an ordered 2D network of neighboring ternary switching units represented by triazatruxene (TAT) molecules organized in a honeycomb lattice on a Ag(111) surface. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual TAT molecules can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. The switching between those states shows a strong bias dependence ranging from tens of millivolts to volts. The low&#8208;bias switching behavior is explored in active units consisting of two and more interacting TAT molecules that are purposefully defined (programmed) by high&#8208;bias switching within the honeycomb lattice. Within such a unit the low&#8208;bias switching can be triggered and accessed by single&#8208;point measurements on a single TAT molecule, demonstrating up to 9 and 19 distinguishable states in a dyad and a tetrad of coupled molecules, respectively. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to bias&#8208;dependent hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.

         <title>Memristive Crossbar Array&#8208;Based Probabilistic Graph Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) using Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors. C&#8208;PGM expresses uncertainties in graph data through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations, enabling fast processing and large&#8208;scale implementation of probabilistic units. This model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy in applications like steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm compared to conventional methods.








Abstract
Modern graph datasets with structural complexity and uncertainties due to incomplete information or data variability require advanced modeling techniques beyond conventional graph models. This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) utilizing Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors, which exhibit probabilistic switching, self&#8208;rectifying, and memory characteristics. C&#8208;PGM addresses the complexities and uncertainties inherent in structural graph data across various domains, leveraging the probabilistic nature of memristors. C&#8208;PGM relies on the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation across multiple memristive CBAs, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that rely on sequential operations, which are slower and have a reliability concern due to repeated switching. This new approach enables the fast processing and massive implementation of probabilistic units at the expense of chip area. In this study, the hardware&#8208;based C&#8208;PGM feasibly expresses small&#8208;scale probabilistic graphs and shows minimal error in aggregate probability calculations. The probability calculation capabilities of C&#8208;PGM are applied to steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm, which is implemented on a simulated large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PGM. The C&#8208;PGM&#8208;based steady&#8208;state estimation and PageRank algorithm demonstrate comparable accuracy to conventional methods while significantly reducing computational costs.

         <title>Liquid Gallium&#8208;Assisted Pyrolysis of MOF Affording CNT Non&#8208;Hollow Frameworks in High Yields for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis and subsequent acid treatment are cleverly used to obtain a high yield of O&#8208;rich carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow framework (NOCNTF&#8208;15) at relatively low temperatures. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental results mutually confirm that the NOCNTF&#8208;15 is a high capacity and ultralong life anode for SIBs.








Abstract
Carbon materials have great potential for applications in energy, biology, and environment due to their excellent chemical and physical properties. Their preparation by carbonization methods encounters limitations and the carbon loss during pyrolysis in the form of gaseous molecules results in low yield of carbon materials. Herein a low&#8208;energy (600&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;yield (82&#160;wt.%) carbonization strategy is developed using liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) affording the N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow frameworks encapsulating Co nanoparticles. The liquid gallium layer offers protection against air, promotes heat transfer, and limits the escape of small carbonaceous gaseous molecules, which greatly improve the yields of the pyrolysis reaction. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic interaction between CNTs and N/O&#8208;containing groups gives a non&#8208;hollow framework composed of N/O&#8208;enriched and open CNTs (NOCNTF&#8208;15, 15 denotes the 15&#160;mm thickness of the liquid gallium layer during the pyrolysis) with high specific capacity (185&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability (stable operation at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and 50&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;000 cycles). This study provides a unique approach to carbonization that facilitates the practical application of low&#8208;cost CNTs and other MOFs&#8208;derived carbon materials in high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs).

Abstract
Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions are common in chemical processes presented in diverse applications, such as synthesis, catalysis, batteries, semiconductors, and solar cells. The Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions allow precise tuning of material properties from the molecular level to more aggregated and organized structures. This review will focus on the origin, development, and prospects of applying Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for the materials design and mechanism understanding in the advancement of battery materials and chemistries. The covered topics relate to aqueous batteries, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state batteries, alkali metal&#8208;sulfur batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;oxygen batteries. In this review, the Lewis acid&#8208;base theories will be first introduced. Thereafter the application strategies for Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions in solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;based batteries will be introduced from the aspects of liquid electrolyte, solid polymer electrolyte, metal anodes, and high&#8208;capacity cathodes. The underlying mechanism is highlighted in regard to ion transport, electrochemical stability, mechanical property, reaction kinetics, dendrite growth, corrosion, and so on. Last but not least, perspectives on the future directions related to Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions for next&#8208;generation batteries are like to be shared.

         <title>Minimizing Interfacial Energy Loss and Volatilization of Formamidinium via Polymer&#8208;Assisted D&#8211;A supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Interface for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.78% Efficiency</title>

A polymer&#8208;assisted 5FTPP/PCBM supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interface self&#8208;assembly strategy can minimize interfacial energy losses by addressing thermalization, conduction band offset, and nonradiative recombination, while inhibiting the adverse effect of FA+ volatilization under thermal stress by multidentate anchoring.








Abstract
2D perovskite passivation strategies effectively reduce defect&#8208;assisted carrier nonradiative recombination losses on the perovskite surface. Nonetheless, severe energy losses are causing by carrier thermalization, interfacial nonradiative recombination, and conduction band offset still persist at heterojunction perovskite/PCBM interfaces, which limits further performance enhancement of inverted heterojunction PSCs. Here, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (5FTPP) is introduced between 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction and PCBM. Compared to tetraphenylporphyrin without electron&#8208;withdrawing fluoro&#8208;substituents, 5FTPP can self&#8208;assemble with PCBM at interface into donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) complex with stronger supramolecular interaction and lower energy transfer losses. This rapid energy transfer from donor (5FTPP) to acceptor (PCBM) within femtosecond scale is demonstrated to enlarge hot carrier extraction rates and ranges, reducing thermalization losses. Furthermore, the incorporation of polystyrene derivative (PD) reinforces D&#8211;A interaction by inhibiting self&#8208;&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of 5FTPP, while fine&#8208;tuning conduction band offset and suppressing interfacial nonradiative recombination via Schottky barrier, dipole, and n&#8208;doping. Notably, the multidentate anchoring of PD&#8208;5FTPP with FA+, Pb2+, and I&#8722; mitigates the adverse effects of FA+ volatilization during thermal stress. Ultimately, devices with PD&#8208;5FTPP achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.78% (certified: 25.36%), maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at the maximum power point (65&#160;&#176;C) under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Integrated Pristine van der Waals Homojunctions for Self&#8208;Powered Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pristine van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers with asymmetric thickness are constructed to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and obtain clean boundaries. The layer&#8208;engineered energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers induce a built&#8208;in electric field at the interface, enabling self&#8208;powered photodetection. Furthermore, a 10 &#215; 10 array based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunction devices realize zero&#8208;power consumption imaging functions.








Abstract
Van der Waals junctions hold significant potentials for various applications in multifunctional and low&#8208;power electronics and optoelectronics. The multistep device fabrication process usually introduces lattice mismatch and defects at the junction interfaces, which deteriorate device performance. Here the layer engineering synthesis of van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 with asymmetric thickness to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and thus obtain clean interfaces is reported. Experimental results confirm that the homostructure nature gives rise to the formation of pristine van der Waals junctions, avoiding chemical disorders and defects. The ability to tune the energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 continuously through layer engineering enables the creation of adjustable built&#8208;in electric field at the homojunction boundaries, which leads to the achievement of self&#8208;powered photodetection based on the obtained 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films. Furthermore, the successful integration of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunctions into an image sensor with 10 &#215; 10 pixels, brings about zero&#8208;power consumption and near&#8208;infrared imaging functions. The pristine van der Waals homojunctions and effective integration strategies shed new insights into the development of large&#8208;scale application for two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Defect Modification Through Oily&#8208;Allicin Modified Buried Interface Achieving Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oily Allicin is introduced into perovskite solar cells to achieve grain wrapping under different stressors, which promotes defect contact and prevents ionic migration. A power conversion efficiency of 25.07% with an FF (fill factor) of 84.03% is achieved, which reaches 93.16% of the FF S&#8211;Q limit.








Abstract
The buried interface properties of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a crucial role in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. The metal&#8208;oxide/perovskite heterogeneous interfaces are highly defective and cause serious ion migration. However, the buried and unexposed bottom interface and simultaneous stabilization of grain boundaries receive less attention and effective solutions. To tackle this problem, a solid&#8211;liquid strategy is employed by introducing oily&#8208;additive allicin at the buried interface to passivate the shallow (VI and Vo) and deep traps (VPb and PbI). Interestingly, oily status allicin fills the pinholes at the heterointerface and wraps the perovskite grains, suppressing the ion migration during the photoaging process. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 25.07% is achieved with a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 84.03%. The modified devices can maintain 94.51% of the original PCE after light soaking under 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1000&#160;h. This work demonstrates a buried interface modification method that employs an eco&#8208;friendly additive, which helps promote the development of PSCs with high performance and stability.

         <title>Realization of Two&#8208;dimensional Intrinsic Polar metal in a Buckled Honeycomb Binary Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Buckled AB honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry belongs to polar space group P3m1, is proposed to be a promising candidate hosting topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity. Here, the successful realization of a IV&#8208;V binary compound on Ag (111) surface via molecular beam epitaxy, is reported. Strikingly, polarity and metallicity are found to coexist in the 2D buckled SiP monolayer.








Abstract
Structural topology and symmetry of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network play pivotal roles in defining its electrical properties and functionalities. Here, a binary buckled honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry, which naturally hosts topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity, is proposed. It is successfully achieved in a group IV&#8208;V compound, namely monolayer SiP epitaxially grown on Ag(111) surface. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations with angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the degeneration of the Dirac nodal lines to points due to the broken horizonal mirror symmetry is elucidated. More interesting, the SiP monolayer manifests metallic nature, which is mutually exclusive with polarity in conventional materials. It is further found that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity is strongly suppressed by the metallic substrate. This study not only represents a breakthrough of realizing intrinsic polarity in 2D metallic material via ingenious design but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay of many exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phenomena.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Passivated Monolayer WSe2 Nanoribbon Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents edge passivation for p&#8208;type monolayer WSe2 nanoribbon transistors using nanolithography and a controlled remote O2 plasma process. The edge passivation material consists of amorphous WOxSey. Compared to microribbons, nanoribbons with passivated edges exhibit reduced defect density and increased p&#8208;doping, whereas nanoribbons with open edges exhibit higher defect densities and reduced p&#8208;doping.








Abstract
The ongoing reduction in transistor sizes drives advancements in information technology. However, as transistors shrink to the nanometer scale, surface and edge states begin to constrain their performance. 2D&#160;semiconductors&#160;like&#160;transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#160;have dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces, hence achieving minimal surface states. Nonetheless, edge state disorder still limits the performance of width&#8208;scaled 2D transistors. This work demonstrates a facile edge passivation method to enhance the electrical properties of monolayer WSe2 nanoribbons, by combining scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) transport measurements. Monolayer WSe2 nanoribbons are passivated with amorphous WOxSey at the edges, which is achieved&#160;using nanolithography and a controlled remote O2 plasma process. The same nanoribbons, with and without edge passivation are sequentially fabricated and measured. The passivated&#8208;edge nanoribbon FETs exhibit 10 &#177; 6 times higher field&#8208;effect mobility than the open&#8208;edge nanoribbon FETs, which are characterized with dangling bonds at the edges. WOxSey edge passivation minimizes edge disorder and enhances the material quality of WSe2 nanoribbons.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents edge passivation for p-type monolayer WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbon transistors using nanolithography and a controlled remote O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plasma process. The edge passivation material consists of amorphous WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. Compared to microribbons, nanoribbons with passivated edges exhibit reduced defect density and increased p-doping, whereas nanoribbons with open edges exhibit higher defect densities and reduced p-doping.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing reduction in transistor sizes drives advancements in information technology. However, as transistors shrink to the nanometer scale, surface and edge states begin to constrain their performance. 2D&#160;semiconductors&#160;like&#160;transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#160;have dangling-bond-free surfaces, hence achieving minimal surface states. Nonetheless, edge state disorder still limits the performance of width-scaled 2D transistors. This work demonstrates a facile edge passivation method to enhance the electrical properties of monolayer WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbons, by combining scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and field-effect transistor (FET) transport measurements. Monolayer WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbons are passivated with amorphous WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; at the edges, which is achieved&#160;using nanolithography and a controlled remote O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plasma process. The same nanoribbons, with and without edge passivation are sequentially fabricated and measured. The passivated-edge nanoribbon FETs exhibit 10 &#177; 6 times higher field-effect mobility than the open-edge nanoribbon FETs, which are characterized with dangling bonds at the edges. WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; edge passivation minimizes edge disorder and enhances the material quality of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbons. Owing to its simplicity and effectiveness, oxidation-based edge passivation could become a turnkey manufacturing solution for TMD nanoribbons in beyond-silicon electronics and optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Engineered Macrophage&#8208;Microbe Encapsulation for Metastasis Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) is developed for safe lung metastatic delivery of antitumor bacteria. After administration, strain&#8208;loaded engineered macrophages can be actively enriched toward tumors. This strategy enhances the biocompatibility of microbial therapies while achieving efficient enrichment of the strains in the tumor. The proliferated intratumoral engineered strains activate the tumor microenvironment, achieving potent anticancer effects.








Abstract
Lung metastases are the leading cause of death among cancer patients. The challenges of inefficient drug delivery, compounded by a robust immunosuppressive microenvironment, make effective treatment difficult. Here, an innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) therapy is developed that integrates modified macrophages and engineered antitumor bacteria. These engineered macrophages, termed R&#8208;GEM cells, are designed to express RGD peptides on extracellular membranes, enhancing their tumor cell binding and intratumor enrichment. R&#8208;GEM cells are cocultured with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009, producing macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells). The intracellular bacteria maintain bioactivity for more than 24&#160;h, and the bacteria released from R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells within the tumor continue to exert bacteria&#8208;mediated antitumor effects. This is further supported by macrophage&#8208;based chemotaxis and camouflage, which enhance the intratumoral enrichment and biocompatibility of the bacteria. Additionally, R&#8208;GEM cells loaded with IFN&#947;&#8208;secreting strains (VNP&#8208;IFN&#947;) form R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells. Treatment with these cells effectively halts lung metastatic tumor progression in three mouse models (breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer). R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells vigorously activate the tumor microenvironment, suppressing tumor&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;type macrophages, MDSCs, and Tregs, and enhancing tumor&#8208;antagonizing M1&#8208;type macrophages, mature DCs, and Teffs. Du&#8208;EMME therapy offers a promising strategy for targeted and enhanced antitumor immunity in treating cancer metastases.

         <dc:description>
To advance high&#8208;quality imaging units in optoelectronic systems, a phototransistor that shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics is reported. Thanks to the programmable two&#8208;dimensional electron gas which can be modulated by drain/gate voltage inputs under different light exposure, a triplex photo&#8208;imaging functionality with capable of self&#8208;powering, photoconduction, and photo&#8208;synaptic operation is achieved, providing guidance toward system&#8208;on&#8208;chip photoelectric systems.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality imaging units are indispensable in modern optoelectronic systems for accurate recognition and processing of optical information. To fulfill massive and complex imaging tasks in the digital age, devices with remarkable photoresponsive characteristics and versatile reconfigurable functions on a single&#8208;device platform are in demand but remain challenging to fabricate. Herein, an AlGaN/GaN&#8208;based double&#8208;heterostructure is reported, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization&#8208;induced two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEGs). Owing to the programmable feature of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs, with a particular capability of electron separation, collection and storage under different light illumination, the phototransistor shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics. A self&#8208;powered mode with a responsivity over 100&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8776;108&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 are achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage ability. The demonstration of three&#8208;in&#8208;one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Carrier&#8208;Dominant Transport in 2D Single&#8208;Crystal Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic nature of transport is presented by hole carriers in 2D copper without grain boundaries. Twin boundaries almost do not scatter electrons. The hidden hole&#8208;like properties of 2D copper can only be unmasked by thorough removal of grain boundaries. The existence of hole carriers is revealed in 2D copper through angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and nonlinear Hall effect measurements.








Abstract
In 2D noble metals like copper, the carrier scattering at grain boundaries has obscured the intrinsic nature of electronic transport. However, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic nature of transport by hole carriers in 2D copper can be revealed by growing thin films without grain boundaries. As even a slight deviation from the twin boundary is perceived as grain boundaries by electrons, it is only through the thorough elimination of grain boundaries that the hidden hole&#8208;like attribute of 2D single&#8208;crystal copper can be unmasked. Two types of Fermi surfaces, a large hexagonal Fermi surface centered at the zone center and the triangular Fermi surface around the zone corner, tightly matching to the calculated Fermi surface topology, confirmed by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and vivid nonlinear Hall effects of the 2D single&#8208;crystal copper account for the presence of hole carriers experimentally. This breakthrough suggests the potential to manipulate the majority carrier polarity in metals by means of grain boundary engineering in a 2D geometry.

         <title>Designed Spin&#8208;Texture&#8208;Lattice to Control Anisotropic Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through control of thin&#8208;film boundary conditions, the magnetic texture present in antiferromagnetic BiFeO3 can be stabilized as a quasi&#8208;1D periodic lattice. This has important implications on spin&#8208;wave transport in the system, which is observed in this work through nitrogen&#8208;vacancy magnetometry imaging, nonlocal transport measurements, and a combination of finite&#8208;element and analytical calculations of the magnon dispersion.








Abstract
Spin waves in magnetic materials are promising information carriers for future computing technologies due to their ultra&#8208;low energy dissipation and long coherence length. Antiferromagnets are strong candidate materials due, in part, to their stability to external fields and larger group velocities. Multiferroic antiferromagnets, such as BiFeO3 (BFO), have an additional degree of freedom stemming from magnetoelectric coupling, allowing for control of the magnetic structure, and thus spin waves, with the electric field. Unfortunately, spin&#8208;wave propagation in BFO is not well understood due to the complexity of the magnetic structure. In this work, long&#8208;range spin transport is explored within an epitaxially engineered, electrically tunable, 1D magnonic crystal. A striking anisotropy is discovered in the spin transport parallel and perpendicular to the 1D crystal axis. Multiscale theory and simulation suggest that this preferential magnon conduction emerges from a combination of a population imbalance in its dispersion, as well as anisotropic structural scattering. This work provides a pathway to electrically reconfigurable magnonic crystals in&#160;antiferromagnets.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Polymyxin Mitigates Cytotoxicity and Reverses Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) is presented in the aqueous solution of antibiotics and adjuvants via dynamic covalent bonding. The resulting assemblies via RISA effectively mask the positive charge of polymyxins, preventing their interaction with negatively charged mammalian cells and reducing potential cytotoxicity, enhancing the bactericidal efficacy of polymyxins and preventing the emergence of further resistance.








Abstract
Polymyxins have been regarded as an efficient therapeutic against many life&#8208;threatening, multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;negative bacterial infections; however, the cytotoxicity and emergence of drug resistance associated with polymyxins have greatly hindered their clinical potential. Herein, the reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) of polymyxins and natural aldehydes in aqueous solution is presented. The resulting assemblies effectively mask the positively charged nature of polymyxins, reducing their cytotoxicity. Moreover, the representative PMBA4 (composed of polymyxin B (PMB) and (E)&#8208;2&#8208;heptenal (A4)) assemblies demonstrate enhanced binding to Gram&#8208;negative bacterial outer membranes and exhibit multiple antimicrobial mechanisms, including increased membrane permeability, elevated bacterial metabolism, suppression of quorum sensing, reduced ATP synthesis, and potential reduction of bacterial drug resistance. Remarkably, PMBA4 assemblies reverse drug resistance in clinically isolated drug&#8208;resistant strains of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, demonstrating exceptional efficacy in preventing and eradicating bacterial biofilms. PMBA4 assemblies efficiently eradicate Gram&#8208;negative bacterial biofilm infections in vivo and alleviate inflammatory response. This RISA strategy offers a practical and clinically applicable approach to minimize side effects, reverse drug resistance, and prevent the emergence of resistance associated with free polymyxins.

         <title>Interference of ATP&#8208;Adenosine Axis by Engineered Biohybrid for Amplifying Immunogenic Cell Death&#8208;Mediated Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF) is rationally designed to activate immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#160;therapy and impede the production of immunosuppressive adenosine, which can establish a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity and activate the enduring immunological memory to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, thereby amplifying ICD&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) often results in the production and accumulation of adenosine (ADO), a byproduct that negatively impacts the therapeutic effect as well as facilitates tumor development and metastasis. Here, an innovative strategy is elaborately developed to effectively activate ICD while avoiding the generation of immunosuppressive adenosine. Specifically, ZIF&#8208;90, an ATP&#8208;responsive consumer, is synthesized as the core carrier to encapsulate AB680 (CD73 inhibitor) and then coated with an iron&#8208;polyphenol layer to prepare the ICD inducer (AZTF), which is further grafted onto prebiotic bacteria via the esterification reaction to obtain the engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF). Particularly, the designed Bc@AZTF can actively enrich in tumor sites and respond to the acidic tumor microenvironment to offload AZTF nanoparticles, which can consume intracellular ATP (iATP) content and simultaneously inhibit the ATP&#8208;adenosine axis to reduce the accumulation of adenosine, thereby alleviating adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and strikingly amplifying ICD effect. Importantly, the synergy of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (&#945;PD&#8208;1) with Bc@AZTF not only establishes a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity but also activates long&#8208;lasting immune memory effects to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, presenting a new paradigm for ICD treatment combined with adenosine metabolism.

         <title>In situ Blending For Co&#8208;Deposition of Electron Transport and Perovskite Layers Enables Over 24% Efficiency Stable Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transport layer (ETL) materials have been rationally designed for in situ blending to co&#8208;deposit ETL and light&#8208;absorbing layers simultaneously in inverted perovskite solar cells. Such a strategy significantly improves the qualities of perovskite growth and buried interface to improve charge transport/collection. A record high power conversion efficiency over 24% is achieved for organic ETLs based devices.








Abstract
Simplifying the manufacturing processes of multilayered high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is yet of vital importance for their cost&#8208;effective production. Herein, an in situ blending strategy is presented for co&#8208;deposition of electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite absorber by incorporating (3&#8208;(7&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraoxo&#8208;3,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo&#8208; [lmn][3,8]phenanthrolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;yl)propyl)phosphonic acid (NDP) into the perovskite precursor solutions. The phosphonic acid&#8208;like anchoring group coupled with its large molecular size drives the migration of NDP toward indium tin oxide (ITO) surface to form a distinct ETL during perovskite film forming. This strategy circumvents the critical wetting issue and simultaneously improves the interfacial charge collection efficiencies. Consequently, n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs based on in situ blended NDP achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.01%, which is one of the highest values for PSCs using organic ETLs. This performance is notably higher than that of ETL&#8208;free (21.19%) and independently spin&#8208;coated (21.42%) counterparts. More encouragingly, the in situ blending strategy dramatically enhances the device stability under harsh conditions by retaining over 90% of initial efficiencies after 250&#160;h in 100&#160;&#176;C or 65% humidity storage. Moreover, this strategy is universally adaptable to various perovskite compositions, device architectures, and electron transport materials (ETMs), showing great potential for applications in diverse optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Harnessing Low&#8208;Frequency Vibration Induced Piezoelectric Polarization Coupled with Static Dipole Field to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces vacancy&#8208;engineered ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with improved photocatalytic H2 production efficiency under low&#8208;frequency vibrations. By creating indium (In) and sulfur (S) vacancies, the voltage gradient within the sheet is increased due to a higher dipole moment and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This results in better charge separation post&#8208;light absorption, significantly boosting H2 production.








Abstract
This study investigates the impact of In&#8208; and S&#8208;vacancy concentrations on the photocatalytic activity of non&#8208;centrosymmetric zinc indium sulfide (ZIS) nanosheets for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A positive correlation between the concentrations of dual In and S vacancies and the photocatalytic HER rate over ZIS nanosheets is observed. The piezoelectric polarization, stimulated by low&#8208;frequency vortex vibration to ensure the well&#8208;dispersion of ZIS nanosheets in solution, plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic HER over the dual&#8208;vacancy engineered ZIS nanosheets. The piezoelectric characteristic of the defective ZIS nanosheets is confirmed through the piezopotential response measured using piezoelectric force microscopy. Piezophotocatalytic H2 evolution over the ZIS nanosheets is boosted under accelerated vortex vibrations. The research explores how vacancies alter ZIS's dipole moment and piezoelectric properties, thereby increasing electric potential gradient and improving charge&#8208;separation efficiency, through multi&#8208;scale simulations, including Density Functional Theory and Finite Element Analysis, and a machine&#8208;learning interatomic potential for defect identification. Increased In and S vacancies lead to higher electric potential gradients in ZIS along [100] and [010] directions, attributing to dipole moment and the piezoelectric effect.

     alt="Dual-Vacancy-Engineered ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Harnessing Low-Frequency Vibration Induced Piezoelectric Polarization Coupled with Static Dipole Field to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces vacancy-engineered ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with improved photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency under low-frequency vibrations. By creating indium (In) and sulfur (S) vacancies, the voltage gradient within the sheet is increased due to a higher dipole moment and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This results in better charge separation post-light absorption, significantly boosting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the impact of In- and S-vacancy concentrations on the photocatalytic activity of non-centrosymmetric zinc indium sulfide (ZIS) nanosheets for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A positive correlation between the concentrations of dual In and S vacancies and the photocatalytic HER rate over ZIS nanosheets is observed. The piezoelectric polarization, stimulated by low-frequency vortex vibration to ensure the well-dispersion of ZIS nanosheets in solution, plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic HER over the dual-vacancy engineered ZIS nanosheets. The piezoelectric characteristic of the defective ZIS nanosheets is confirmed through the piezopotential response measured using piezoelectric force microscopy. Piezophotocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution over the ZIS nanosheets is boosted under accelerated vortex vibrations. The research explores how vacancies alter ZIS's dipole moment and piezoelectric properties, thereby increasing electric potential gradient and improving charge-separation efficiency, through multi-scale simulations, including Density Functional Theory and Finite Element Analysis, and a machine-learning interatomic potential for defect identification. Increased In and S vacancies lead to higher electric potential gradients in ZIS along [100] and [010] directions, attributing to dipole moment and the piezoelectric effect. This research provides a comprehensive exploration of vacancy engineering in ZIS nanosheets, leveraging the piezopotential and dipole field to enhance photocatalytic performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Positively Charged Hollow Co Nanoshells by Kirkendall Effect Stabilized by Electron Sink for Alkaline Water Dissociation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow cobalt&#160;(Co) nanoshells are formed via the Kirkendall effect and stabilized by conductive MoO2 pillars and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. The Co particles are positively charged on the surface which accelerates&#160;the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process.








Abstract
While cobalt (Co) exhibits a comparable energy barrier for H* adsorption/desorption to platinum in theory, it is generally not suitable for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of unfavorable water dissociation. Here, the Kirkendall effect is adopted to fabricate positive&#8208;charged hollow metal Co (PHCo) nanoshells that are stabilized by MoO2 and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. Compared to the zero&#8208;valent Co, the PHCo accelerates the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process. Alkaline HER occurs with a low overpotential of 59.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando Raman and first principles calculations reveal that the interfacial water to the PHCo sites and the accelerated proton transfer are conducive to the adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules. Meanwhile, the upshifted d&#8208;band center of PHCo optimizes the adsorption/desorption of H*. This work provides a unique synthesis of hollow Co nanoshells via the Kirkendall effect and insights to water dissociation on catalyst surfaces with tailored charge states.

The development of Alzheimer's disease therapeutics necessitates a precision medicine approach due to its complex pathology. Limited success with antibody treatments underscores the need for broader options such as gene therapy, leveraging discoveries in AD genetic risk. This perspective addresses challenges for precision target and precision delivery and summarizes the essential advanced materials tools, aiming to improve personalized therapy outcomes.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most burdensome aging&#8208;associated neurodegenerative disorder, and its treatment encounters numerous failures during drug development. Although there are newly approved in&#8208;market &#946;&#8208;amyloid targeting antibody solutions, pathological heterogeneity among patient populations still challenges the treatment outcome. Emerging advances in gene therapies offer opportunities for more precise personalized medicine; while, major obstacles including the pathological heterogeneity among patient populations, the puzzled mechanism for druggable target development, and the precision delivery of functional therapeutic elements across the blood&#8211;brain barrier remain and limit the use of gene therapy for central neuronal diseases. Aiming for &#8220;precision delivery&#8221; challenges, nanomedicine provides versatile platforms that may overcome the targeted delivery challenges for AD gene therapy. In this perspective, to picture a toolbox for AD gene therapy strategy development, the most recent advances from benchtop to clinics are highlighted, possibly available gene therapy targets, tools, and delivery platforms are outlined, their challenges as well as rational design elements are addressed, and perspectives in this promising research field are discussed.

         <title>Enthalpy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing in Thin Metallic Films on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable thin Mo1&#8208;xAgx films exhibit self&#8208;healing properties. The system can be stabilized by a segregation barrier. Upon cracking, the barrier directs Ag segregations into the cracks instead of to the surface. The effect is autonomously intrinsic, occurs at room temperature, and it is enhanced with increasing temperature. Cracking of thin metal films causes damage to the flexible polymer substrate.









Abstract
Self&#8208;healing microelectronics are needed for costly applications with limited or without access. They are needed in fields such as space exploration to increase lifetime and decrease both costs and the environmental impact. While advanced self&#8208;healing mechanisms for polymers are numerous, practical ways for self&#8208;healing in metal films have yet to be found. A concept for an autonomous intrinsic self&#8208;healing metallic film system is developed, allowing the healing of cracks in metallic films on flexible substrates. The concept relies on stabilizing metastable thin films with high mixing enthalpy via segregation barriers. This allows the films to possess autonomous intrinsic self&#8208;healing capabilities triggered by cracking at temperatures not detrimental to flexible microelectronics. The effect will be shown on metastable Mo1&#8208;xAgx thin films, stabilized via a Mo segregation barrier. Without a segregation barrier, the system is known to exhibit spontaneous Ag particle formation on the surface. This property is controlled and directed to heal cracks and partially restore the electro&#8208;mechanical properties of the multilayer system. This mechanism opens up the field of self&#8208;healing thin metallic films that could profoundly impact the design of future microelectronics.

         <title>Thickness of Nanoscale Poly(Dimethylsiloxane) Layers Determines the Motion of Sliding Water Drops</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydimethylsiloxane brushes are extensively utilized in material applications as a hydrophobic coating due to the low liquid drop friction and high stability. However, the drop movements still vary depending on how it is prepared. In this work, the film thickness is proved to be a determinant for the water drop dynamic friction on such kind of a surface.








Abstract
Layers of nanometer thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are applied as hydrophobic coatings because of their environmentally friendly and chemically inert properties. In applications such as heat exchangers or fog harvesting, low water drop friction on surfaces is required. While the onset of motion (static friction) has been studied, the knowledge of dynamic friction needs to be improved. To minimize drop friction, it is essential to understand which processes lead to energy dissipation and cause dynamic friction? Here, the dynamic friction of drops on PDMS brushes of different thicknesses is measured, covering the whole available velocity regime. The brush thickness L turns out to be a predictor for drop friction. 4&#8211;5&#160;nm thick PDMS brush shows the lowest dynamic friction. A certain minimal thickness is necessary to form homogeneous surfaces and reduce the attractive van der Waals interaction between water and the substrate. The increase in dynamic friction above L = 5&#160;nm is also attributed to the increasing viscoelastic dissipation of the capillary ridge formed at the contact line. The height of the ridge is related to the brush thickness. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and atomic force measurements support this interpretation. Sum&#8208;frequency generation further indicates a maximum order at the PDMS&#8211;water interface at intermediate thickness.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Tracking Topological Phase Transition Dynamics of Polar Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological phase transition dynamics of polar vortex&#8208;antivortex (V&#8208;AV) pairs under thermal and electric fields are revealed at the atomic scale using in situ transmission electron microscopy. Upon heating, no dissociation&#8208;like behavior of polar V&#8208;AV pairs is observed, and the antivortex disappears prior to the vortex. Electric fields can facilitate the approach of adjacent vortex and antivortex cores, leading to their annihilation.








Abstract
Non&#8208;trivial topological structures, such as vortex&#8208;antivortex (V&#8208;AV) pairs, have garnered significant attention in the field of condensed matter physics. However, the detailed topological phase transition dynamics of V&#8208;AV pairs, encompassing behaviors like self&#8208;annihilation, motion, and dissociation, have remained elusive in real space. Here, polar V&#8208;AV pairs are employed as a model system, and their transition pathways are tracked with atomic&#8208;scale resolution, facilitated by in situ (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and phase field simulations. This investigation reveals that polar vortices and antivortices can stably coexist as bound pairs at room temperature, and their polarization decreases with heating. No dissociation behavior is observed between the V&#8208;AV phase at room temperature and the paraelectric phase at high temperature. However, the application of electric fields can promote the approach of vortex and antivortex cores, ultimately leading to their annihilation near the interface. Revealing the transition process mediated by polar V&#8208;AV pairs at the atomic scale, particularly the role of polar antivortex, provides new insights into understanding the topological phases of matter and their topological phase transitions. Moreover, the detailed exploration of the dynamics of polar V&#8208;AV pairs under thermal and electrical fields lays a solid foundation for their potential applications in electronic devices.

         <title>Mott&#8211;Schottky Construction Boosted Plasmon Thermal and Electronic Effects on the Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH Nanohybrids for Highly&#8208;Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction can lower the Fermi level/d&#8208;band center of Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G, and strengthen its plasmon effect. The plasmon thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), promote the deprotonation of *OOH, whereas the electronic effect increases the density of charge carriers, and lowers the activation energy of OER, thereby contributing to remarkable OER and overall&#8208;water&#8208;splitting performances.








Abstract
Mott&#8211;Schottky construction and plasmon excitation represent two highly&#8208;efficient and closely&#8208;linked coping strategies to the high energy loss of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the combined effect has rarely been investigated. Herein, with Ag nanoparticles as electronic structure regulator and plasmon exciter, Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G nanohybrids (NHs) with Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction and notable plasmon effect are well&#8208;designed. Combining theoretical calculations with experiments, it is found that the Mott&#8211;Schottky construction modulates the Fermi level/energy band structure of CoV&#8208;LDH, which in turn leads to lowered d&#8208;band center (from &#8722;0.89 to &#8722;0.93), OER energy barrier (from 6.78 to 1.31&#160;eV), and preeminent plasmon thermal/electronic effects. The thermal effect can offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, promote the deprotonation of *OOH, and accelerate electron transfer kinetics. Whereas the electronic effect can increase the density of charge carriers (from 0.70&#160;&#215;&#160;1020 to 1.64&#160;&#215;&#160;1020 cm&#8722;3), lower the activation energy of OER (from 30.3 to 17.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Benefiting from these favorable factors, the Ag/CoV&#8208;LDH@G NHs show remarkable electrocatalytic performances, with an overpotential of 178 and 263&#160;mV to afford 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER, respectively, and a low cell voltage of 1.42&#160;V to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for overall water splitting under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation.

         <title>Correlating Aggregation Ability of Polymer Donors with Film Formation Kinetics for Organic Solar Cells with Improved Efficiency and Processability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyridine units are introduced into D18 to synthesize two terpolymers with modulated aggregation abilities. Earlier phase separation and longer film formation times are achieved and lead to superior blend film morphology, resulting in efficiencies of 19.45%, 13.07%, and 12.43% in small area organic solar cell device, 1 cm2 flexible device, and 43 cm2 module fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating.








Abstract
Film formation kinetics significantly impact molecular processability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells. Here, two ternary random copolymerization polymers are reported, D18&#9472;N&#8208;p and D18&#9472;N&#8208;m, to modulate the aggregation ability of D18 by introducing trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted pyridine unit at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;positions, respectively. The introduction of pyridine unit significantly reduces material aggregation ability and adjusts the interactions with acceptor L8&#8208;BO, thereby leading to largely changed film formation kinetics with earlier phase separation and longer film formation times, which enlarge fiber sizes in blend films and improve carrier generation and transport. As a result, D18&#9472;N&#8208;p with moderate aggregation ability delivers a high PCE of 18.82% with L8&#8208;BO, which is further improved to 19.45% via interface engineering. Despite the slightly inferior small area device performances, D18&#9472;N&#8208;m shows improved solubility, which inspires to adjust the ratio of meta&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridine carefully and obtain a polymer donor D18&#9472;N&#8208;m&#8208;10 with good solubility in nonhalogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene. High PCEs of 13.07% and 12.43% in 1 cm2 device and 43 cm2 module fabricated with slot&#8208;die coating method are achieved based on D18&#9472;N&#8208;m&#8208;10:L8&#8208;BO blends. This work emphasizes film formation kinetics optimization in device fabrication via aggregation ability modulation of polymer donors for efficient devices.

         <title>Giant Tunability of Rashba Splitting at Cation&#8208;Exchanged Polar Oxide Interfaces by Selective Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unambiguous cation exchange is discovered across the interfaces of (001), (110), and (111) KTaO3 2D electron gases fabricated at room temperature. Remarkably, the (111) interfaces with the highest superconducting transition temperature also turn out to show the strongest electron&#8208;phonon interaction and the largest Rashba spin splitting.








Abstract
The 2D electron gas (2DEG) at oxide interfaces exhibits extraordinary properties, such as 2D superconductivity and ferromagnetism, coupled to strongly correlated electrons in narrow d&#8208;bands. In particular, 2DEGs in KTaO3 (KTO) with 5d t2g orbitals exhibit larger atomic spin&#8208;orbit coupling and crystal&#8208;facet&#8208;dependent superconductivity absent for 3d 2DEGs in SrTiO3 (STO). Herein, by tracing the interfacial chemistry, weak anti&#8208;localization magneto&#8208;transport behavior, and electronic structures of (001), (110), and (111) KTO 2DEGs, unambiguously cation exchange across KTO interfaces is discovered. Therefore, the origin of the 2DEGs at KTO&#8208;based interfaces is dramatically different from the electronic&#160;reconstruction observed at STO interfaces. More importantly, as the interface polarization grows with the higher order planes in the KTO case, the Rashba spin splitting becomes maximal for the superconducting (111) interfaces approximately twice that of the (001) interface. The larger Rashba spin splitting couples strongly to the asymmetric chiral texture of the orbital angular moment, and results mainly from the enhanced inter&#8208;orbital hopping of the t2g bands and more localized wave functions. This finding has profound implications for the search for topological superconductors, as well as the realization of efficient spin&#8208;charge interconversion for low&#8208;power spin&#8208;orbitronics based on (110) and (111) KTO interfaces.

Therefore, the origin of the 2DEGs at KTO-based interfaces is dramatically different from the electronic&#160;reconstruction observed at STO interfaces. More importantly, as the interface polarization grows with the higher order planes in the KTO case, the Rashba spin splitting becomes maximal for the superconducting (111) interfaces approximately twice that of the (001) interface. The larger Rashba spin splitting couples strongly to the asymmetric chiral texture of the orbital angular moment, and results mainly from the enhanced inter-orbital hopping of the &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; bands and more localized wave functions. This finding has profound implications for the search for topological superconductors, as well as the realization of efficient spin-charge interconversion for low-power spin-orbitronics based on (110) and (111) KTO interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Hindered Oleogel&#8208;Based Underwater Adhesive Enabled by Mesh&#8208;Tailoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the mesh&#8208;tailoring strategy, bio&#8208;based epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) molecules are precisely entrapped in highly crosslinked polyurethane network, creating a sterically hindered oleogel&#8208;based underwater adhesive (OUA). The well&#8208;designed OUA exhibits facile fabrication, exceptional substrate universality, ultrahigh adhesive strength, remarkable environmental adaptability, excellent stability, and broad application potential.








Abstract
Underwater adhesives hold significant relevance in daily life and numerous industrial applications. Despite considerable efforts, developing scalable, high&#8208;performance underwater adhesives through a simple and effective method remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a novel mesh&#8208;tailoring strategy for in situ, rapid, and ultrastrong oleogel&#8208;based underwater adhesives (OUA), which comprises a highly crosslinked polyurethane network with a matching mesh size (&#8776;2.22&#160;nm) that precisely entraps bio&#8208;based epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) molecules (&#8776;2.31&#160;nm) by steric hindrance effect. This oleogel exhibits unprecedented robust mechanical properties (&#8776;35&#160;MPa) and maintains stability under extreme conditions, including high temperatures (100&#160;&#176;C), high pressures (30&#160;MPa), and immersion in various solvents (water, ethanol, or ESO). In particular, this oleogel displays high hydrophobicity, rapid curing, and strong interface affinity, resulting in ultrahigh underwater adhesion strength (up to 2.13&#160;MPa) and exceptional substrate universality. Moreover, the remarkable environmental adaptability and stability of OUA enable its use in harsh aqueous environments, including acidic/alkaline, saline, and extreme temperature solutions. The comprehensive capabilities of the OUA underscore its potential for building underwater structures, repairing leaky containers, and sealing broken submarine pipelines. This research establishes the foundation for the designing of next&#8208;generation underwater adhesives and offers fresh perspectives for exploring oleogel&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Efficient Large&#8208;Area (81 cm2) Ternary Copper Halides Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 13% via Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
A host&#8208;guest design strategy is adopted to simultaneously improve the exciton radiative recombination and charge injection efficiency in lead&#8208;free [dppb]2Cu2I2 emitters. Consequently, efficient green&#8208;emitting LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 13.39% and a large&#8208;area emitting area up to 81 cm2 with uniform emission are realized, substantially surpassing those of recently reported Cu halide&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Ternary copper (Cu) halides are promising candidates for replacing toxic lead halides in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) toward practical applications. However, the electroluminescent performance of Cu halide&#8208;based LEDs remains a great challenge due to the presence of serious nonradiative recombination and inefficient charge transport in Cu halide emitters. Here, the rational design of host&#8208;guest [dppb]2Cu2I2 (dppb denotes 1,2&#8208;bis[diphenylphosphino]benzene) emitters and its utility in fabricating efficient Cu halide&#8208;based green LEDs that show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.39% are reported. The host&#8208;guest [dppb]2Cu2I2 emitters with mCP (1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene) host demonstrate a significant improvement of carrier radiative recombination efficiency, with the photoluminescence quantum yield increased by nearly ten times, which is rooted in the efficient energy transfer and type&#8208;I energy level alignment between [dppb]2Cu2I2 and mCP. Moreover, the charge&#8208;transporting mCP host can raise the carrier mobility of [dppb]2Cu2I2 films, thereby enhancing the charge transport and recombination. More importantly, this strategy enables a large&#8208;area prototype LED with a record&#8208;breaking area up to 81 cm2, along with a decent EQE of 10.02% and uniform luminance. It is believed these results represent an encouraging stepping stone to bring Cu halide&#8208;based LEDs from the laboratory toward commercial lighting and display panels.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Chiral&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity: The Effect of Magnetic Field Direction and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropy magnetoresistance (AMR) and its temperature dependent are measured, in a crossbar geometry, for chiral oligopeptide monolayers. Periodicity of 360&#176; is observed in the AMR. Quantum simulations reveal that the angular distribution can be simulated only if the monolayer has significant effective spin orbit coupling, which includes contribution from vibrations.








Abstract
Chiral oligopeptide monolayers are adsorbed on a ferromagnetic surface and their magnetoresistance is measured as a function of the angle between the magnetization of the ferromagnet and the surface normal. These measurements are conducted as a function of temperature for both enantiomers. The angle dependence is found to follow a changing trend with a period of&#8197;360&#176;. Quantum simulations reveal that the angular distribution can be obtained only if the monolayer has significant effective spin orbit coupling (SOC), that includes contribution from the vibrations. The model shows that SOC only in the leads cannot reproduce the observed angular dependence. The simulation can reproduce the experiments if it included electron&#8211;phonon interactions and dissipation.

         <title>Completely Inorganic Deep Eutectic Solvents for Efficient and Recyclable Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A completely inorganic deep eutectic solvent (IDES) is synthesized by ZnCl2 and phosphoric acid through hydrogen bonding (Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#9472;O) and coordination (Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P). Due to the presence of composite catalytic active site (Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P), the IDES could convert the oxidant into a triple reactive oxygen species with stronger oxidation ability, leading to rapid and efficient oxidation removal of thiophenes from fuel.








Abstract
Organic acid&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as catalysts always suffer from weak stability and low recyclability due to the accumulation of organic oxidative products in the DES phase. Herein, a completely inorganic deep eutectic solvent (IDES) ZnCl2/PA with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and phosphoric acid (PA) as precursors is constructed to realize liquid&#8211;liquid interface catalysis for desulfurization of fuel and product self&#8208;separation for the first time. Owing to the inorganic nature, the organic oxidative products are accumulated at the interface between the IDES and fuel rather than the IDES phase. With this unique feature, the IDES can be reused for at least 15 times without any further treatment in oxidative desulfurization process, showing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle&#8208;regeneration stability. Moreover, compared with the reported organic DESs, the IDES also reveals more attractive catalytic oxidative desulfurization performance. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the strong coordination Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#9552;P and the strong adsorption energy between IDES and sulfides enhance the activation of H2O2 to reactive oxygen species, leading to the superior catalytic performance in oxidative desulfurization of fuel.

         <title>Combination of Counterion Size and Doping Concentration Determines the Electronic and Thermoelectric Properties of Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically doped organic semiconductors display higher electrical conductivities with larger counterions at low doping concentrations due to decreased Coulomb interactions between counterions and charge carriers. In the high doping regime, the higher dielectric constant allows all charge carriers to be &#8220;free&#8221; regardless of counterion size and morphological disorder dominates the observed electrical conductivity.








Abstract
In both chemical and electrochemical doping of organic semiconductors (OSCs), a counterion, either from the electrolyte or ionized dopant, balances the charge introduced to the OSC. Despite the large influence of this counterion on OSC optical and electronic response, there remains substantial debate on how a fundamental parameter, ion size, impacts these properties. This work resolves much of this debate&#160;by accounting for two doping regimes. In the low&#8208;doping regime, the Coulomb binding energies between charge carriers&#160;on the OSC and the counterions are significant, and larger counterions lead to decreased Coulomb interactions, more delocalized charge carriers, and higher electrical conductivities. In the high&#8208;doping regime, the Coulomb binding energies become negligible due to the increased dielectric constant of the films and a smoothing of the energy landscape; thereby, the electrical conductivities depend primarily on the extent of morphological disorder in the OSC. Moreover, in regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), rr&#8208;P3HT, smaller counterions lead to greater bipolaron concentrations in the low&#8208;doping regime due to the increased Coulomb interactions. Emphasizing the impact of the counterion size, it is shown that larger counterions can lead to increased thermoelectric power factors for rr&#8208;P3HT.

         <title>Manipulating Radiation&#8208;Sensitive Z&#8208;DNA Conformation for Enhanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherent radiosensitivity of tumor DNA represents a breakthrough in sensitization, yet enhancing it remains a challenge. Based on the positive impact of Z&#8208;DNA conformation on its inherent radiosensitivity, a novel radiosensitization strategy is proposed, aiming to enhance radiation&#8208;induced DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs) by facilitating the B&#8208;Z DNA conformation transition mediated by CBL@HfO2 nanocapsules.









Abstract
DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs) yield highly determines radiotherapy efficacy. However, improving the inherent radiosensitivity of tumor DNA to promote radiation&#8208;induced DSBs remains a challenge. Using theoretical and experimental models, the underexplored impact of Z&#8208;DNA conformations on radiosensitivity, yielding higher DSBs than other DNA conformations, is discovered. Thereout, a radiosensitization strategy focused on inducing Z&#8208;DNA conformation, utilizing CBL@HfO2 nanocapsules loaded with a Z&#8208;DNA inducer CBL0137, is proposed. A hollow mesoporous HfO2 (HM&#8208;HfO2) acts as a delivery and an energy depositor to promote Z&#8208;DNA breakage. The nanocapsule permits the smart DSBs accelerator that triggers its radiosensitization with irradiation stimulation. Impressively, the CBL@HfO2 facilitates the B&#8208;Z DNA conformational transition, augmenting DSBs about threefold stronger than irradiation alone, generating significant tumor suppression with a 30% cure rate. The approach enables DSBs augmentation by improving the inherent radiosensitivity of DNA. As such, it opens up an era of Z&#8208;DNA conformation manipulation in radiotherapy.

         <title>Tunable and Reversible Adhesive of Liquid Metal Ferrofluid Pillars for Magnetically Actuated Noncontact Transfer Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel tunable liquid metal ferrofluid pillars enable efficient magnetically actuated noncontact transfer printing, with gentle contact force and shape adaptability. Rapid stiffness increase and shape change generate an ejection force for receiver&#8208;independent printing, ensuring reliable, damage&#8208;free pickup.








Abstract
Transfer printing techniques based on tunable and reversible adhesives enable the heterogeneous integration of materials in desired layouts and are essential for developing both existing and envisioned electronic systems. Here, a novel tunable and reversible adhesive of liquid metal ferrofluid pillars for developing an efficient magnetically actuated noncontact transfer printing is reported. The liquid metal ferrofluid pillars offer the appealing advantages of gentle contact force by minimizing the preload effect and exceptional shape adaptability by maximizing the interfacial contact area due to their inherent fluidity, thus enabling a reliable damage&#8208;free pickup. Moreover, the liquid metal ferrofluid pillars harness the rapid stiffness increase and shape change with the magnetic field, generating an instantaneous ejection force to achieve a receiver&#8208;independent noncontact printing. Demonstrations of the adhesive of liquid metal ferrofluid pillars in transfer printing of diverse objects with different shapes, materials and dimensions onto various substrates illustrate its great potential in deterministic assembly.

         <title>In Vivo Microrheology Reveals Local Elastic and Plastic Responses Inside 3D Bacterial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial biofilms are highly abundant 3D living materials capable of performing complex biomechanical and biochemical functions. A general method is developed to measure internal mechanical properties of biofilms in vivo with spatial resolution on the cellular scale, leading to the discovery that the elastic modulus inside biofilms correlates with the spatial distribution the polysaccharide component of the biofilm matrix.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilms are highly abundant 3D living materials capable of performing complex biomechanical and biochemical functions, including programmable growth, self&#8208;repair, filtration, and bioproduction. Methods to measure internal mechanical properties of biofilms in vivo with spatial resolution on the cellular scale have been lacking. Here, thousands of cells are tracked inside living 3D biofilms of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae during and after the application of shear stress, for a wide range of stress amplitudes, periods, and biofilm sizes, which revealed anisotropic elastic and plastic responses of both cell displacements and cell reorientations. Using cellular tracking to infer parameters of a general mechanical model, spatially&#8208;resolved measurements of the elastic modulus inside the biofilm are obtained, which correlate with the spatial distribution of the polysaccharides within the biofilm matrix. The noninvasive microrheology and force&#8208;inference approach introduced here provides a general framework for studying mechanical properties with high spatial resolution in living materials.

         <title>Constructing Lysozyme Protective Layer via Conformational Transition for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lysozyme protective layer (LPL) with high adhesion and compact morphology is engineered on Zn surface after conformational transition. The conformational transition of lysozyme can expose more functional groups for strong adhesion, high water repel property, and fast ion diffusion kinetics, thus enabling the symmetrical and full Zn batteries with excellent performance under high Zn utilization.








Abstract
The practical applications for aqueous Zn ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising yet still impeded by the severe side reactions on Zn metal. Here, a lysozyme protective layer (LPL) is prepared on Zn metal surface by a simple and facile self&#8208;adsorption strategy. The LPL exhibits extremely strong adhesion on Zn metal to provide stable interface during long&#8208;term cycling. In addition, the self&#8208;adsorption strategy triggered by the hydrophobicity&#8208;induced aggregation effect endows the protective layer with a gap&#8208;free and compacted morphology which can reject free water for effective side reaction inhibition performance. More importantly, the lysozyme conformation is transformed from &#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet structure before layer formation, thus abundant functional groups are exposed to interact with Zn2+ for electrical double layer (EDL) modification, desolvation energy decrease, and ion diffusion kinetics acceleration. Consequently, the LPL renders the symmetrical Zn battery with ultra&#8208;long cycling performance for more than 1200 h under high Zn depth of discharge (DOD) for 77.7%, and the Zn/Zn0.25V2O5 pouch cell with low N/P ratio of 2.1 at high Zn utilization of 48% for over 300 cycles. This study proposes a facile and low&#8208;cost method for constructing a stable protective layer of Zn metal for high Zn utilization aqueous devices.

More importantly, the lysozyme conformation is transformed from &#945;-helix to &#946;-sheet structure before layer formation, thus abundant functional groups are exposed to interact with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for electrical double layer (EDL) modification, desolvation energy decrease, and ion diffusion kinetics acceleration. Consequently, the LPL renders the symmetrical Zn battery with ultra-long cycling performance for more than 1200 h under high Zn depth of discharge (DOD) for 77.7%, and the Zn/Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell with low N/P ratio of 2.1 at high Zn utilization of 48% for over 300 cycles. This study proposes a facile and low-cost method for constructing a stable protective layer of Zn metal for high Zn utilization aqueous devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boltzmann Switching MoS2 Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Enabled by Monolithic&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Gapped Metal Gates at the Schottky&#8211;Mott Limit</title>

Herein, van der Waals Schottky&#8208;gated MoS2 metal&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors are developed, mitigating two primary sources of Fermi&#8208;level pinning&#8212;metal&#8208;induced gap states and disorder&#8208;induced gap states. Consequently, the devices exhibit ideal hysteresis&#8208;free transistor characteristics with a subthreshold swing of 60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, approaching to&#160;the fundamental Boltzmann switching limit.








Abstract
A gate stack that facilitates a high&#8208;quality interface and tight electrostatic control is crucial for realizing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, when constructing conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor structures with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide channels, achieving these requirements becomes challenging due to inherent difficulties in obtaining high&#8208;quality gate dielectrics through native oxidation or film deposition. Here, a gate&#8208;dielectric&#8208;less device architecture of van der Waals Schottky gated metal&#8211;semiconductor FETs (vdW&#8208;SG MESFETs) using a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channel and surface&#8208;oxidized metal gates such as nickel and copper is reported. Benefiting from the strong SG coupling, these MESFETs operate at remarkably low gate voltages, &lt;0.5&#160;V. Notably, they also exhibit Boltzmann&#8208;limited switching behavior featured by a subthreshold swing of &#8776;60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and negligible hysteresis. These ideal FET characteristics are attributed to the formation of a Fermi&#8208;level (EF) pinning&#8208;free gate stack at the Schottky&#8211;Mott limit. Furthermore, authors experimentally and theoretically confirm that EF depinning can be achieved by suppressing both metal&#8208;induced and disorder&#8208;induced gap states at the interface between the monolithic&#8208;oxide&#8208;gapped metal gate and the MoS2 channel. This work paves a new route for designing high&#8208;performance and energy&#8208;efficient 2D electronics.

         <title>A Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Tin Iodide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New lead&#8208;free 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson tin perovskites containing the 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP) spacer cation are studied: (4AMP)SnI4, (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7, and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 (MA = methylammonium, FA = formamidinium). Structural analysis reveals that only (4AMP)SnI4 is noncentrosymmetric, confirmed by second harmonic generation. Ferroelectric hysteresis measurements provide clear evidence of ferroelectricity of (4AMP)SnI4 at room temperature with spontaneous polarization of 10.0 &#181;C cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites emerge as a new class of 2D semiconductors with the potential to combine excellent optoelectronic properties with symmetry&#8208;enabled properties such as ferroelectricity. Although many lead&#8208;based ferroelectric 2D halide perovskites are reported, there is yet to be a conclusive report of ferroelectricity in tin&#8208;based 2D perovskites. Here, the structures and properties of a new series of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) Sn perovskites: (4AMP)SnI4, (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7, and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 (4AMP = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, MA = methylammonium, and FA = formamidinium), are reported. Structural characterization reveals that (4AMP)SnI4 is polar with in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization whereas (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7 and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 are centrosymmetric. Further, (4AMP)SnI4 displays second harmonic generation (SHG) and polarization&#8208;electric field hysteresis measurements confirm it is ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 10.0 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. (4AMP)SnI4 transitions into a centrosymmetric structure above 367 K. As the first direct experimental observation of the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of a Sn&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, this work opens up environmentally friendly 2D tin halide perovskites for ferroelectricity and other physical property studies.

         <title>A Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Flexible, Ultrathin, and Robust Solid Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A feasible and scalable approach to construct 3D supporting skeleton using an electro&#8208;blown spinning technique for the preparation of thin solid electrolytes is proposed. This skeleton not only enhances the mechanical strength but also hinders the migration of Li&#8208;salt anions, providing a homogeneous distribution of Li&#8208;ion flux and local current density, which contributes to a uniform Li deposition.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are considered as the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety batteries. To achieve high energy density in ASSLMBs, it is essential that the solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are lightweight, thin, and possess superior electrochemical stability. In this study, a feasible and scalable fabrication approach to construct 3D supporting skeleton using an electro&#8208;blown spinning technique is proposed. This skeleton not only enhances the mechanical strength but also hinders the migration of Li&#8208;salt anions, improving the lithium&#8208;ion transference number of the SSE. This provides a homogeneous distribution of Li&#8208;ion flux and local current density, promoting uniform Li deposition. As a result, based on the mechanically robust and thin SSEs, the Li symmetric cells show outstanding Li plating/stripping reversibility. Besides, a stable&#160;interface&#160;contact between SSE and Li anode has been established with the formation of an F&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interface layer. The solid&#8208;state Li|sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (Li|SPAN) cell achieves a capacity retention ratio of 94.0% after 350 cycles at 0.5 C. Also, the high&#8208;voltage Li|LCO cell shows a capacity retention of 92.4% at 0.5 C after 500 cycles. This fabrication approach for SSEs is applicable for commercially large&#8208;scale production and application in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety ASSLMBs.

         <title>Observation of Ultrahigh Photoconductivity in DNA&#8208;MoS2 Nano&#8208;Biocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the observation of ultrahigh photoconductivity in DNA&#8208;MoS2 nano&#8208;biocomposite film. This is achieved by utilizing DNA&#8208;MoS2 hydrogel formation by incorporating a MoS2 network in the ss&#8208;DNA matrix. Ultra&#8208;high photocurrent (5.5 mA at 1 V) with a record&#8208;high on/off ratio (1.3 &#215; 106) is observed, five orders of magnitude higher than conventional biomaterials (&#8776;101) reported so far.








Abstract
A nano&#8208;biocomposite film with ultrahigh photoconductivity remains elusive and critical for bio&#8208;optoelectronic applications. A uniform, well&#8208;connected, high&#8208;concentration nanomaterial network in the biological matrix remains challenging to achieve high photoconductivity. Wafer&#8208;scale continuous nano&#8208;biocomposite film without surface deformations and cracks plays another major obstacle.

Ultra&#8208;high photocurrent (5.5&#160;mA at 1&#160;V) with a record&#8208;high on/off ratio (1.3 &#215; 106) is observed, five orders of magnitude higher than conventional biomaterials (&#8776;101) reported so far.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates the observation of ultrahigh photoconductivity in DNA-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nano-biocomposite film. This is achieved by utilizing DNA-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogel formation by incorporating a MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; network in the ss-DNA matrix. Ultra-high photocurrent (5.5 mA at 1 V) with a record-high on/off ratio (1.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) is observed, five orders of magnitude higher than conventional biomaterials (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) reported so far.

&lt;p&gt;A nano-biocomposite film with ultrahigh photoconductivity remains elusive and critical for bio-optoelectronic applications. A uniform, well-connected, high-concentration nanomaterial network in the biological matrix remains challenging to achieve high photoconductivity. Wafer-scale continuous nano-biocomposite film without surface deformations and cracks plays another major obstacle.

         <title>Activating Iterative Revolutions of the Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle in Hypoxic Tumors with a Smart Nano&#8208;Regulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a smart nano&#8208;regulator (PNBJQ) with hypoxic tolerance and tumor&#8208;selectivity. PNBJQ focuses on targeting two nonredundant immune nodes encompassing the induction of immunogenic cancer cell death and the abrogation of immune resistance. This precise modulation activates the iterative revolution of cancer&#8208;immune cycle, resulting in a remarkable suppression of bilateral tumors under low light dose irradiation without side effects.








Abstract
The activation of sequential events in the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle (CIC) is crucial for achieving effective antitumor immunity. However, formidable challenges, such as innate and adaptive immune resistance, along with the off&#8208;target adverse effects of nonselective immunomodulators, persist. In this study, a tumor&#8208;selective nano&#8208;regulator named PNBJQ has been presented, focusing on targeting two nonredundant immune nodes: inducing immunogenic cancer cell death and abrogating immune resistance to fully activate endogenous tumor immunity. PNBJQ is obtained by encapsulating the immunomodulating agent JQ1 within a self&#8208;assembling system formed by linking a Type&#8208;I photosensitizer to polyethylene glycol through a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive azo bond. Benefiting from the Type&#8208;I photosensitive mechanism, PNBJQ triggers the immunogenic cell death of hypoxic tumors under near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#160;light irradiation. This process resolves innate immune resistance by stimulating sufficient cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes. Simultaneously, PNBJQ smartly responds to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment for precise drug delivery, adeptly addressing adaptive immune resistance by using JQ1 to downregulate programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and sustaining the response of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The activatable synergic photoimmunotherapy promotes an immune&#8208;promoting tumor microenvironment by activating an iterative revolution of the CIC, which remarkably eradicates established hypoxic tumors and suppresses distal lesions under low light dose irradiation.

         <title>Prestrain Guided Yield of Large Single&#8208;Crystal Nickel Foils with High&#8208;Index Facets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with high&#8208;index facets, the largest one of which exceeds 5&#215;8 cm2 in size, are successfully produced through prestrain energy engineering technique, in which the strain energy drives the single crystal conversion. High&#8208;quality graphite films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foils, and the graphite/Ni(012) foil composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity compared to polycrystalline nickel foil.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal metal foils with high&#8208;index facets are currently being investigated owing to their potential application in the epitaxial growth of high&#8208;quality van der Waals film materials, electrochemical catalysis, gas sensing, and other fields. However, the controllable synthesis of large single&#8208;crystal metal foils with high&#8208;index facets remains a great challenge because high&#8208;index facets with high surface energy are not preferentially formed thermodynamically and kinetically. Herein, single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with a series of high&#8208;index facets are efficiently prepared by applying prestrain energy engineering technique, with the largest single&#8208;crystal foil exceeding 5&#215;8 cm2 in size. In terms of thermodynamics, the internal mechanism of prestrain regulation on the formation of high&#8208;index facets is proposed. Molecular dynamics simulation is utilized to replicate and explain the phenomenon of multiple crystallographic orientations resulting from prestrain regulation. Additionally, large&#8208;sized and high&#8208;quality graphite films are successfully fabricated on single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foils. Compared to the polycrystalline nickel, the graphite/single&#8208;crystal Ni(012) foil composites show more than five&#8208;fold increase in thermal conductivity, thereby showing great potential applications in thermal management. This study hence presents a novel approach for the preparation of single&#8208;crystal nickel foils with high&#8208;index facets, which is beneficial for the epitaxial growth of certain two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials.

         <title>&#8220;Cloth&#8208;to&#8208;Clothes&#8208;Like&#8221; Fabrication of Soft Actuators</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;cloth&#8208;to&#8208;clothes&#8208;like&#8221; method is proposed to prepare soft actuators (&#8220;clothes&#8221;) by combining the hysteretic behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) (&#8220;cloth&#8221;) with exchange reactions of dynamic covalent bonds. &#8220;Cloth&#8221; retains targeted shapes after deformation and naturally becomes &#8220;clothes&#8221; at ambient temperatures. This strategy significantly lowers the threshold of customizing soft actuators, promising to realize mass production and universal applications.








Abstract
Inspired by adaptive natural organisms and living matter, soft actuators appeal to a variety of innovative applications such as soft grippers, artificial muscles, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices. However, their fabrication is typically limited in laboratories or a few enterprises since specific instruments, strong stimuli, or specialized operation skills are inevitably involved. Here a straightforward &#8220;cloth&#8208;to&#8208;clothes&#8208;like&#8221; method to prepare soft actuators with a low threshold by combining the hysteretic behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with the exchange reaction of dynamic covalent bonds, is proposed. Due to the hysteretic behavior, the LCEs (resemble &#8220;cloth&#8221;) effectively retain predefined shapes after stretching and releasing for extended periods. Subsequently, the samples naturally become soft actuators (resemble &#8220;clothes&#8221;) via the exchange reaction at ambient temperatures. As a post&#8208;synthesis method, this strategy effectively separates the production of LCEs and soft actuators. LCEs can be mass&#8208;produced in bulk by factories or producers and stored as prepared, much like rolls of cloth. When required, these LCEs can be customized into soft actuators as needed. This strategy provides a robust, flexible, and scalable solution to engineer soft actuators, holding great promise for mass production and universal applications.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Tailored Ionizable Lipid Nanoparticles Facilitate IL&#8208;12 Circular RNA Delivery for Enhanced Lung Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a new lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that efficiently delivers circular RNA to lung tumors. The LNP shows better circRNA delivery efficiency than the benchmark. A single dose of this interleukin&#8208;12 circRNA&#8208;LNP induces robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity and tumor regression in two lung cancer models. This tailored LNP platform holds promise for advancing RNA immunotherapies against lung cancer.








Abstract
The advancement of message RNA (mRNA) &#8208;based immunotherapies for cancer is highly dependent on the effective delivery of RNA (Ribonucleic) payloads using ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, the clinical application of these therapies is hindered by variable mRNA expression among different cancer types and the risk of systemic toxicity. The transient expression profile of mRNA further complicates this issue, necessitating frequent dosing and thus increasing the potential for adverse effects. Addressing these challenges, a high&#8208;throughput combinatorial method is utilized to synthesize and screen LNPs that efficiently deliver circular RNA (circRNA) to lung tumors. The lead LNP, H1L1A1B3, demonstrates a fourfold increase in circRNA transfection efficiency in lung cancer cells over ALC&#8208;0315, the industry&#8208;standard LNPs, while providing potent immune activation. A single intratumoral injection of H1L1A1B3 LNPs, loaded with circRNA encoding interleukin&#8208;12 (IL&#8208;12), induces a robust immune response in a Lewis lung carcinoma model, leading to marked tumor regression. Immunological profiling of treated tumors reveals substantial increments in CD45+ leukocytes and enhances infiltration of CD8+ T cells, underscoring the ability of H1L1A1B3 LNPs to modulate the tumor microenvironment favorably. These results highlight the potential of tailored LNP platforms to advance RNA drug delivery for cancer therapy, broadening the prospects for RNA immunotherapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;This study develops a new lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that efficiently delivers circular RNA to lung tumors. The LNP shows better circRNA delivery efficiency than the benchmark. A single dose of this interleukin-12 circRNA-LNP induces robust anti-tumor immunity and tumor regression in two lung cancer models. This tailored LNP platform holds promise for advancing RNA immunotherapies against lung cancer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advancement of message RNA (mRNA) -based immunotherapies for cancer is highly dependent on the effective delivery of RNA (Ribonucleic) payloads using ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, the clinical application of these therapies is hindered by variable mRNA expression among different cancer types and the risk of systemic toxicity. The transient expression profile of mRNA further complicates this issue, necessitating frequent dosing and thus increasing the potential for adverse effects. Addressing these challenges, a high-throughput combinatorial method is utilized to synthesize and screen LNPs that efficiently deliver circular RNA (circRNA) to lung tumors. The lead LNP, H1L1A1B3, demonstrates a fourfold increase in circRNA transfection efficiency in lung cancer cells over ALC-0315, the industry-standard LNPs, while providing potent immune activation. A single intratumoral injection of H1L1A1B3 LNPs, loaded with circRNA encoding interleukin-12 (IL-12), induces a robust immune response in a Lewis lung carcinoma model, leading to marked tumor regression. Immunological profiling of treated tumors reveals substantial increments in CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; leukocytes and enhances infiltration of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, underscoring the ability of H1L1A1B3 LNPs to modulate the tumor microenvironment favorably. These results highlight the potential of tailored LNP platforms to advance RNA drug delivery for cancer therapy, broadening the prospects for RNA immunotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deterministic Fabrication and Quantum&#8208;Well Modulation of Phase&#8208;Pure 2D Perovskite Heterostructures for Encrypted Light Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deterministic integration of phase&#8208;pure 2D perovskite nanosheets leads to novel dual&#8208;peak emission phenomenon and dual&#8208;band photoresponse characteristic modulated by comprising quantum wells. By combining the modulated dual&#8208;band photoresponse with the double&#8208;beam irradiation mode and the encryption algorithm, secure light communication system is constructed to explore the potential of heterostructure&#8208;based PDs in advanced functional optoelectronic fields.








Abstract
Deterministic integration of phase&#8208;pure Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites has great significance for realizing functional optoelectronic devices. However, precise fabrications of artificial perovskite heterostructures with pristine interfaces and rational design over electronic structure configurations remain a challenge. Here, the controllable synthesis of large&#8208;area ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline RP perovskite nanosheets and the deterministic fabrication of arbitrary 2D vertical perovskite heterostructures are reported. The 2D heterostructures exhibit intriguing dual&#8208;peak emission phenomenon and dual&#8208;band photoresponse characteristic. Importantly, the interlayer energy transfer behaviors from wide&#8208;bandgap component to narrow&#8208;bandgap component modulated by comprising quantum wells are thoroughly revealed. Functional nanoscale photodetectors are further constructed based on the 2D heterostructures. Moreover, by combining the modulated dual&#8208;band photoresponse characteristic with double&#8208;beam irradiation modes, and introducing an encryption algorithm mechanism, a light communication system with high security and reliability is achieved. This work can greatly promote the development of heterogeneous integration technologies of 2D perovskites, and could provide a competitive candidate for advanced integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>A Temperature Self&#8208;Adaptive Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the failure mechanisms of zinc anodes in aqueous electrolytes under high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature conditions. By manipulating the competitive relationship between solvents and anions in the electrolyte, a temperature self&#8208;adaptive electrolyte is devised and fabricated to enable the superior operation of zinc anodes within the temperature range of &#8722;35 to 75&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The advancement of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is often hampered by the dendritic zinc growth and the parasitic side reactions between the zinc anode and the aqueous electrolyte, especially under extreme temperature conditions. This study unveils the performance decay mechanism of zinc anodes in harsh environments, characterized by &#8220;dead zinc&#8221; at low temperatures and aggravated hydrogen evolution and adverse by&#8208;products at elevated temperatures. To address these issues, a temperature self&#8208;adaptive electrolyte (TSAE), founded on the competitive coordination principle of co&#8208;solvent and anions, is introduced. This electrolyte exhibits a dynamic solvation capability, engendering an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at low temperatures while an organic alkyl ether&#8208; and alkyl carbonate&#8208;containing SEI at elevated temperatures. The self&#8208;adaptability of the electrolyte significantly enhances the performance of the zinc anode across a broad temperature range. A Zn//Zn symmetrical cell, based on the TSAE, showcases reversible plating/stripping exceeding 16&#160;800 h (&gt;700 d) at room temperature under 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, setting a record of lifespan. Furthermore, the TSAE enables stable operation of the zinc full batteries across an ultrawide temperature range of &#8722;35 to 75&#160;&#176;C. This work illuminates a pathway for optimizing AZIBs under extreme temperatures by fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial chemistry.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Dependent Superconductivity in Topological Dirac Semimetal SrCuBi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconductivity of topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) SrCuBi with planar honeycomb layer structure is reported. The surface superconductivity at the edge of SrCuBi TDS is induced by the symmetry breaking of the honeycomb layered structure. High pressure enhances the superconducting transition temperature up to 4.8 K under 6.2&#160;GPa, where the non&#8208;s&#8208;wave unconventional superconductivity emerges.








Abstract
The discovery of superconducting states in diverse topological materials generates a burgeoning interest to explore a topological superconductor and to realize a fault&#8208;tolerant topological quantum computation. A variety of routes to realize topological superconductors are proposed, and many types of topological materials are developed. However, a pristine topological material with a natural superconducting state is relatively rare as compared to topological materials with artificially induced superconductivity. Here, it is reported that the planar honeycomb structured 3D topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) SrCuBi, which is the Zintl phase, shows a natural surface superconductivity at 2.1 K under ambient pressure. It is clearly identified from theoretical calculations that a topologically nontrivial state exists on the (100) surface. Further, its superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases by applying pressure, exhibiting a maximal Tc of 4.8 K under 6.2&#160;GPa. It is believed that this discovery opens up a new possibility of exploring exotic Majorana fermions at the surface of 3D TDS superconductors.

         <title>Uniaxial&#8208;Oriented Chiral Perovskite for Flexible Full&#8208;Stokes Polarimeter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering flexible full&#8208;Stokes polarimeter is developed and fabricated using a uniaxial&#8208;oriented chiral perovskite film. This achievement is a result of regulating fluid dynamics, specifically involving the control of the Marangoni effect during the blade coating process. The fabricated polarimeter demonstrates precise full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection, high&#8208;performance photoresponse, matrix polarization imaging capability, and superior mechanical durability.








Abstract
Full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection, with high integration and portability, offers an efficient path toward next&#8208;gen multi&#8208;information optoelectronic systems. Nevertheless, current techniques relying on optical filters create rigid and bulky configurations, limiting practicality. Here, a flexible, filter&#8208;less full&#8208;Stokes polarimeter featuring a uniaxial&#8208;oriented chiral perovskite film is first reported. It is found that, the strategic manipulation of the surfactant&#8208;mediated Marangoni effect during blade coating, is crucial for guiding an equilibrious mass transport to achieve oriented crystallization. Through this approach, the obtained uniaxial&#8208;oriented chiral perovskite films inherently possess anisotropy and chirality, and thereby with desired sensitivity to both linearly polarized light and circularly polarized light vectors. The uniaxial&#8208;oriented crystalline structure also improves photodetection, achieving a specific detectivity of 5.23&#160;&#215;&#160;1013&#160;Jones, surpassing non&#8208;oriented devices by 10&#215;. The as&#8208;fabricated flexible polarimeters enable accurate capture of full&#8208;Stokes polarization without optical filters, exhibiting slight detection errors for the Stokes parameters: &#916;S1&#160;=&#160;9.2%, &#916;S2&#160;=&#160;8.6%, and &#916;S3&#160;=&#160;6.5%, approaching the detection accuracy of optics&#8208;filter polarimeters. This proof of concept also demonstrates applications in matrix polarization imaging.

&lt;sub&gt;1&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;=&#160;9.2%, &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;=&#160;8.6%, and &#916;&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;=&#160;6.5%, approaching the detection accuracy of optics-filter polarimeters. This proof of concept also demonstrates applications in matrix polarization imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Novel Temozolomide Nanocapsules Encapsulating siPKM2 Inhibit Aerobic Glycolysis to Sensitize Glioblastoma to Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a TMZ nanocapsule delivery system (ApoE&#8208;MT/siPKM2 NC) with dual&#8208;targeting of blood&#8211;brain barrier and glioblastoma, codelivering TMZ and siPKM2, is successfully designed and synthesized. This nanocapsule can cleavage and release in high glutathione environment and enhance the chemosensitivity of glioblastoma to TMZ by inhibiting the aerobic glycolytic energy metabolism pathway, and achieve a starvation&#8208;chemotherapy strategy for glioblastoma.








Abstract
Chemotherapy of glioblastoma (GBM) has not yielded success due to inefficient blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration and poor glioma tissue accumulation. Aerobic glycolysis, as the main mode of energy supply for GBM, safeguards the rapid growth of GBM while affecting the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, to effectively inhibit aerobic glycolysis, increase drug delivery efficiency and sensitivity, a novel temozolomide (TMZ) nanocapsule (ApoE&#8208;MT/siPKM2 NC) is successfully designed and prepared for the combined delivery of pyruvate kinase M2 siRNA (siPKM2) and TMZ. This drug delivery platform uses siPKM2 as the inner core and methacrylate&#8208;TMZ (MT) as the shell component to achieve inhibition of glioma energy metabolism while enhancing the killing effect of TMZ. By modifying apolipoprotein E (ApoE), dual targeting of the BBB and GBM is achieved in a &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; style. The glutathione (GSH) responsive crosslinker containing disulfide bonds ensures &#8220;directional blasting&#8221; cleavage of the nanocapsules to release MT and siPKM2 in the high GSH environment of glioma cells. In addition, in vivo experiments verify that ApoE&#8208;MT/siPKM2 NC has good targeting ability and prolongs the survival of tumor&#8208;bearing nude mice. In summary, this drug delivery system provides a new strategy for metabolic therapy sensitization chemotherapy.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;AIE Nanofibers Functionalized Sutures with Antimicrobial Activity and Subcutaneous Traceability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent&#8208;traceable antimicrobial suture is developed involving peptide&#8208;AIE nanofibers. The suture demonstrates robust fluorescence and antimicrobial activity, along with excellent hemocompatibility and biocompatibility. In skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, it effectively prevents MRSA infection and enhances healing, surpassing the performance of the commercial Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture. Furthermore, it displays subcutaneous traceability, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of degradation.








Abstract
As one of the most widely used medical devices, sutures face challenges related to surgical site infections (SSIs) and lack of subcutaneous traceability. In the present study, a facile and effective approach using peptide&#8208;AIE nanofibers (NFs&#8208;K18) to create fluorescent&#8208;traceable antimicrobial sutures, which have been applied to four commercially available sutures is developed. The functionalized sutures of PGAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 and PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 exhibit fluorescence with excellent penetration from 4&#160;mm chicken breasts. They also demonstrate remarkable stability after 24&#160;h of white light illumination and threading through chicken breasts 10 times. These sutures efficiently generate ROS, resulting in significant suppression of four clinical bacteria, with the highest antimicrobial rate of &#8776;100%. Moreover, the sutures exhibit favorable hemocompatibility and biocompatibility. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the optimized PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 suture displays potent antimicrobial activity against MRSA, effectively inhibiting inflammation and promoting tissue healing in both skin wound and abdominal wall wound models, outperforming the commercially available Coated VICRYL Plus Antibacterial suture. Importantly, PGLAS&#8208;NFs&#8208;K18 exhibits sensitive subcutaneous traceability, allowing for accurate in situ monitoring of its degradation. It is believed that this straightforward strategy offers a new pathway for inhibiting SSIs and monitoring the status of sutures.

         <title>Terahertz and Infrared Plasmon Polaritons in PtTe2 Type&#8208;II Dirac Topological Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the optical response of platinum ditelluride (PtTe2), a type II Dirac topological semimetals grown on Si&#8208;based substrates, is investigated in the terahertz&#160;&#8208; infrared spectral range. Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) generated on microscale ribbon arrays of PtTe2 are detected in the far&#8208;field limit, finding an excellent agreement among experimental measurements, theoretical models, and electromagnetic simulation.








Abstract
Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic excitations existing at the interface between a metal and a dielectric. SPPs provide a promising path in nanophotonic devices&#160;for&#160;light manipulation at the micro and nanoscale with applications in optoelectronics, biomedicine, and energy harvesting. Recently, SPPs are extended to unconventional materials like graphene, transparent oxides, superconductors, and topological systems characterized by linearly dispersive electronic bands. In this respect, 3D Dirac and Weyl semimetals offer a promising frontier for infrared (IR) and terahertz (THz) radiation tuning by topologically&#8208;protected SPPs.&#160;In this work, the THz&#8208;IR optical response of platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) type&#8208;II Dirac topological semimetal films grown on Si substrates is investigated. SPPs generated on microscale ribbon arrays of PtTe2&#160;are detected in the far&#8208;field limit,&#160;finding an excellent agreement among measurements, theoretical models, and electromagnetic simulation data.&#160;The far&#8208;field measurements are further supported by near&#8208;field IR data which indicate a strong electric field enhancement due to the SPP excitation near the ribbon edges. The present findings indicate that the PtTe2&#160;ribbon array appears an ideal&#160;active layout for geometrically tunable SPPs thus inspiring a new fashion of optically tunable materials in the technologically demanding THz and IR spectrum.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite Nanograin Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes in Green&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Gamut with Co&#8208;Additive Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient perovskite nanograin light&#8208;emitting diodes, presenting champion external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 28.4%, 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% at 521, 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17.5&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color, are reported. The performances compare favorably with or exceed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices ever reported.








Abstract
Perovskite nanograins exceeding the Bohr exciton diameter show great potential for high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their bandgap homogeneity, spatial charge confinement, and nonlocal interaction. However, it is challenging to directly synthesize proper nanograins along with reduced crystal defects on functional substrate, and the corresponding high&#8208;efficiency perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) have rarely been reported. In this study, crystallization modulation for perovskites with an effective co&#8208;additive system, including lithium bromide, p&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bromide, and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, is performed. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed co&#8208;additive system can synergistically retard perovskite crystallization and reduce crystal defects. Consequently, high&#8208;quality perovskite nanograin solids (&#8776;22.8&#160;nm) are obtained with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#8776;88%). These superior optical properties contribute to developing efficient green PeLEDs with a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.4% and an average EQE of 27.1%. The co&#8208;additive system can be universally applied to mixed&#8208;halide perovskite nanograin LED, presenting a maximum EQE of 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% for the blue device at 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color. These results supplement the research on high&#8208;efficiency perovskite nanograin LEDs for multicolor displays and lighting.

These superior optical properties contribute to developing efficient green PeLEDs with a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.4% and an average EQE of 27.1%. The co-additive system can be universally applied to mixed-halide perovskite nanograin LED, presenting a maximum EQE of 24.4%, 21.6%, 17.5%, and 11.1% for the blue device at 496, 488, 478, and 472&#160;nm, respectively, along with a narrow spectral linewidth (17&#8211;14&#160;nm) and stable color. These results supplement the research on high-efficiency perovskite nanograin LEDs for multicolor displays and lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Autonomous Artificial Olfactory Sensor Systems with Homeostasis Recovery via a Seamless Neuromorphic Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial olfactory sensor system capable of detecting gas accumulation via memory characteristics is investigated, all in a seamless architecture. The neuromorphic olfactory system exhibits excitatory action in response to NO2 gas, triggering an alarm at dangerous levels of gas adsorption. Furthermore, inhibitory properties from pulsed UV light are analyzed, demonstrating autonomous recovery that mimic the biological homeostasis function.








Abstract
Neuromorphic olfactory systems have been actively studied in recent years owing to their considerable potential in electronic noses, robotics, and neuromorphic data processing systems. However, conventional gas sensors typically have the ability to detect hazardous gas levels but lack synaptic functions such as memory and recognition of gas accumulation, which are essential for realizing human&#8208;like neuromorphic sensory system. In this study, a seamless architecture for a neuromorphic olfactory system capable of detecting and memorizing the present level and accumulation status of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during continuous gas exposure, regulating a self&#8208;alarm implementation triggered after 147 and 85 s at a continuous gas exposure of 20 and 40&#160;ppm, respectively. Thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor type gas sensors utilizing carbon nanotube semiconductors detect NO2 gas molecules through carrier trapping and exhibit long&#8208;term retention properties, which are compatible with neuromorphic excitatory applications. Additionally, the neuromorphic inhibitory performance is also characterized via gas desorption with programmable ultraviolet light exposure, demonstrating homeostasis recovery. These results provide a promising strategy for developing a facile artificial olfactory system that demonstrates complicated biological synaptic functions with a seamless and simplified system architecture.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anode Based on Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying an isotropic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass layer to unlock dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal anode is proposed. Simulation and experimental analyses corroborate the internal monolithic and interfacial merits of MOF glass, facilitating uniform lithium diffusion. The obtained lithium metal anode delivers superior battery performances. This work unveils the promising glassy MOF layer for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The performance of lithium metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume change within the anode. This work addresses these obstacles by introducing a novel strategy: applying an isotropic and internal grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free layer, specifically, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass layer with nano&#8208;porosity onto the electrochemically plated lithium metal anode. Both ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the MOF glass layer makes the lithium transport smooth and uniform via its internal monolithic and interfacial advantages. This MOF glass layer with the fast and more uniform lithium diffusion in the monolithic interior and its interface enables dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating and stripping through surface confinement effect and interfacial effect. When employed in symmetric batteries, the achieved Li metal anode can operate over 300&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full batteries matched with LiFePO4 exhibit high capacity (148&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (61&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C), and outstanding cycling stability (with capacity retention of &#8776;90% after 1000 cycles). The full batteries matched with high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 also show superior performances. Therefore, the strategy of utilizing a MOF glass layer enables the development of high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.

         <title>A Homochiral Porous Organic Cage&#8208;Polymer Membrane for Enantioselective Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, an enantioselective porous organic cage (Covalent cage 3 (CC3)&#8208;R)&#8208;based composite membrane using polyamide (PA) as a matrix is prepared via interfacial polymerization. The resultant CC3&#8208;R/PA composite membranes achieve chiral separation toward limonene racemates with enantiomeric excess values of 95.2% (R&#8208;enantiomers in excess) and a high flux of enantiomers of 99.9&#160;mg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based enantioselective separation is a promising method for chiral resolution due to its low cost and high efficiency. However, scalable fabrication of chiral separation membranes displaying both high enantioselectivity and high flux of enantiomers is still a challenge. Here, the authors report the preparation of homochiral porous organic cage (Covalent cage 3 (CC3)&#8208;R)&#8208;based enantioselective thin&#8208;film&#8208;composite membranes using polyamide (PA) as the matrix, where fully organic and solvent&#8208;processable cage crystals have good compatibility with the polymer scaffold. The hierarchical CC3&#8208;R channels consist of chiral selective windows and inner cavities, leading to favorable chiral resolution and permeation of enantiomers; the CC3&#8208;R/PA composite membranes display an enantiomeric excess of 95.2% for R&#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene over S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;limonene and a high flux of 99.9&#160;mg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the use of homochiral porous organic cages for preparing enantioselective membranes and demonstrates a new route for the development of next&#8208;generation chiral separation membranes.

         <title>Electric Double Layer Oriented Eutectic Additive Design toward Stable Zn Anodes with a High Depth of Discharge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly polarized eutectic additive, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), is investigated to regulate the electric double layer for long&#8208;lived and highly (002) textured Zn anodes with a high depth of discharge. The hydrogen bond network in EDL can be interrupted to suppress HER effectively. The enrichment of GPC in charge&#8208;rich sites leads to a robust ZnxPyOz&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase and dendrite termination.








Abstract
ZnSO4&#8208;based electrolytes for aqueous zinc ion batteries fail to meet practical application metrics due to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth. In this work, a highly polarized eutectic additive, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC) is rationally designed, to regulate the electric double layer (EDL) structure for stable Zn anodes with a high depth of discharge (DOD). On one hand, GPC molecules with abundant hydroxyl groups can precisely regulate the hydrogen bond network in EDL to suppress HER. On the other hand, the enrichment of GPC at the interface is positively responsible for the negative charge density on the Zn surface, which leads to the formation of a robust ZnxPyOz&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase and terminates dendrite growth in the charge&#8208;rich sites. This EDL&#8208;oriented eutectic additive engineering enables highly reversible and selectively (002)&#8208;textured Zn anodes to operate for over 1450&#160;h at a high DOD of 45.3%. Meanwhile, a high&#8208;capacity (185.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) aqueous Zn||VS2 full cell shows remarkable cycling stability over 220 cycles with an excellent capacity retention of 90.4% even at a low current density of 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (0.5&#160;C). This work sheds light on electrolyte design and interface engineering for high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Approaching the Ideal Linearity in Epitaxial Crystalline&#8208;Type Memristor by Controlling Filament Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline Hf0.5Zr0.5O2&#8208;based memristor with the linearity and symmetry approaching ideal case is demonstrated. The growth of filament is controlled by the confined grain boundaries and enhanced local electric field by inserting a layer of Cu nanoparticles within epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film. Furthermore, the decimal operation and high&#8208;accuracy neural network are successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing has attracted widespread attention owing to its ability to perform parallel and energy&#8208;efficient computation. However, the synaptic weight of amorphous/polycrystalline oxide based memristor usually exhibits large nonlinear behavior with high asymmetry, which aggravates the complexity of peripheral circuit system. Controllable growth of conductive filaments is highly demanded for achieving the highly linear conductance modulation. However, the stochastic behavior of the filament growth in commonly used amorphous/polycrystalline oxide memristor makes it very challenging. Here, the epitaxially grown Hf0.5Zr0.5O2&#8208;based memristor with the linearity and symmetry approaching ideal case is reported. A layer of Cu nanoparticles is inserted into epitaxially grown Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film to form the grain boundaries due to the breaking of the epitaxial growth. By combining with the local electric field enhancement, the growth of filament is confined in the grain boundaries due to the fact that the diffusion of oxygen vacancy in crystalline lattice is more difficult than that in the grain boundaries. Furthermore, the decimal operation and high&#8208;accuracy neural network are demonstrated by utilizing the highly linear and multi&#8208;level conductance modulation capacity. This method opens an avenue to control the filament growth for the application of resistance random access memory (RRAM) and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Binary&#8208;Phase on Structural Stability of Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces the relationship between different phase ratios in cathode materials and their electrochemical properties for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, showing that an inappropriate composite structure is more destructive than a single&#8208;phase design. Combines with different characterizations, optional Na0.76Cu0.1Co0.1Ni0.25Mn0.4Ti0.15O2 cathode material with reasonable phase ratios can effectively alleviate the degree of phase transformation under voltage, resulting in improved electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The emergence of layered sodium transition metal oxides featuring a multiphase structure presents a promising approach for cathode materials in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, showcasing notably improved energy storage capacity. However, the advancement of cathodes with multiphase structures faces obstacles due to the limited understanding of the integrated structural effects. Herein, the integrated structural effects by an in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;chemistry analysis in the developed layered cathode system NaxCu0.1Co0.1Ni0.25Mn0.4Ti0.15O2 with purposely designed P2/O3 phase integration, are comprehended. The results affirm that integrated phase ratio plays a pivotal role in electrochemical/structural stability, particularly at high voltage and with the incorporation of anionic redox. In contrast to previous reports advocating solely for the enhanced electrochemical performance in biphasic structures, it is demonstrated that an inappropriate composite structure is more destructive than a single&#8208;phase design. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction results, coupled with density functional theory computations further confirm that the biphasic structure with P2:O3 = 4:6 shows suppressed irreversible phase transition at high desodiated states and thus exhibits optimized electrochemical performance. These fundamental discoveries provide clues to the design of high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes for next&#8208;generation SIBs.

         <title>Porous Aromatic Frameworks Enabling Polyiodide Confinement toward High Capacity and Long Lifespan Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous aromatic framework (PAF) with abundant benzene motifs and well&#8208;organized pore structures is adopted as iodine host. Due to the charge&#8208;transfer interaction with iodine, high specific surface area and interconnected 3D channels for ion transportation, PAF&#8208;1 shows a high capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling life of more than 20&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are attracting increasing attention because of their high safety and abundance of resources. However, the performance of AZIBs is compromised by inadequate confinement of soluble polyiodides, the undesired shuttle effect, and slow reaction kinetics. In this study, a porous aromatic framework (PAF) with abundant benzene motifs and a well&#8208;organized pore structure is adopted as the iodine host, which exhibits high iodine adsorption capacity and robust polyiodide confinement. Both experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that the interactions between iodine species and the PAF&#8208;1 facilitate the redox reaction by coupling the electronic structures of the active species in the framework. A comparison of PAF&#8208;1, PAF&#8208;5, and PAF&#8208;11 also emphasizes the structural advantages of the high surface area and interconnected three&#8208;dimensional channels of PAF&#8208;1. Consequently, the I2@PAF&#8208;1 cathode can deliver a high capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C, outstanding rate performance, and a stable cycling life of 20&#160;000 cycles (86 % retention at 10 C). The robust polyiodide confinement and superb electrochemical performance of Zn&#8211;I2@PAF&#8208;1 provide insights into the practical application of PAFs as excellent electrode materials for AZIBs.

         <title>A General Molecular Structural Design for Highly Efficient Photopyroptosis that can be Activated within 10 s Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and rational principle is developed to design the molecular structure of photosensitizers for highly efficient photopyroptosis. Under the guidance of this principle, the pyroptotic trigger can be achieved in a minimum of 10 s of irradiation with a substantially low light dosage (0.4 J&#160;cm&#8315;2). In photodynamic therapy, immunotherapy with high tumor inhibition rates is achieved by applying the synthetic molecule alone.








Abstract
Photopyroptosis is an emerging research branch of photodynamic therapy (PDT), whereas there remains a lack of molecular structural principles to fabricate photosensitizers for triggering a highly efficient pyroptosis. Herein, a general and rational structural design principle to implement this hypothesis, is proposed. The principle relies on the clamping of cationic moieties (e.g., pyridinium, imidazolium) onto one photosensitive core to facilitate a considerable mitochondrial targeting (both of the inner and the outer membranes) of the molecules, thus maximizing the photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the specific site to trigger the gasdermin E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Through this design, the pyroptotic trigger can be achieved in a minimum of 10 s of irradiation with a substantially low light dosage (0.4 J&#160;cm&#8315;2), compared to relevant work reported (up to 60 J&#160;cm&#8315;2). Moreover, immunotherapy with high tumor inhibition efficiency is realized by applying the synthetic molecules alone. This structural paradigm is valuable for deepening the understanding of PDT (especially the mitochondrial&#8208;targeted PDT) from the perspective of pyroptosis, toward the future development of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art form of PDT.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Centered Organic Radicals&#8208;Involved Unified Heterogeneous Self&#8208;Fenton Process for Stable Mineralization of Micropollutants in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel active species, oxygen&#8208;centered organic radicals, as a substitute for traditional transient active species in the photocatalytic degradation of organic micropollutants. Through integration with heterogeneous Fenton process, an impressive mineralization rate of up to 94% is attained, accompanied by exceptionally high photon utilization efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Removing organic micropollutants from water through photocatalysis is hindered by catalyst instability and substantial residuals from incomplete mineralization. Here, a novel water treatment paradigm, the unified heterogeneous self&#8208;Fenton process (UHSFP), which achieved an impressive 32% photon utilization efficiency at 470&#160;nm, and a significant 94% mineralization of organic micropollutants&#8212;all without the continual addition of oxidants and iron ions is presented. In UHSFP, the active species differs fundamentally from traditional photocatalytic processes. One electron acceptor unit of photocatalyst acquires only one photogenerated electron to convert into oxygen&#8208;centered organic radical (OCOR), then spontaneously completing subsequent processes, including pollutant degradation, hydrogen peroxide generation, activation, and mineralization of organic micropollutants. By bolstering electron&#8208;transfer capabilities and diminishing catalyst affinity for oxygen in the photocatalytic process, the generation of superoxide radicals is effectively suppressed, preventing detrimental attacks on the catalyst. This study introduces an innovative and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the efficient and stable mineralization of organic micropollutants, eliminating the necessity for continuous chemical inputs, providing a new perspective on water treatment technologies.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Channel Ca2+ Nanomodulator Induces Intracellular Ca2+ Disorders via Endogenous Ca2+ Redistribution for Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A capsaicin&#8208;conjugated and nitric oxide&#8208;grafted self&#8208;assembling peptide based nanofiber is presented, serving as a tumor&#8208;specific dual&#8208;channel Ca2+ nanomodulator with synchronous stimulation of the extracellular Ca2+ influx and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release performances for inducing intracellular Ca2+ disorders and thus achieving tumor radiosensitization.








Abstract
Tumor cells harness Ca2+ to maintain cellular homeostasis and withstand external stresses from various treatments. Here, a dual&#8208;channel Ca2+ nanomodulator (CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO) is constructed that can induce irreversible intracellular Ca2+ disorders via the redistribution of tumor&#8208;inherent Ca2+ for disrupting cellular homeostasis and thus improving tumor radiosensitivity. Stimulated by tumor&#8208;overexpressed acid and glutathione, capsaicin and nitric oxide are successively escaped from CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO to activate the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 and the ryanodine receptor for the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and the release of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The overwhelming level of Ca2+ in tumor cells not only impairs the function of organelles but also induces widespread changes in the gene transcriptome, including the downregulation of a set of radioresistance&#8208;associated genes. Combining CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO treatment with radiotherapy achieves a significant suppression against both pancreatic and patient&#8208;derived hepatic tumors with negligible side effects. Together, the study provides a feasible approach for inducing tumor&#8208;specific intracellular Ca2+ overload via endogenous Ca2+ redistribution and demonstrates the great potential of Ca2+ disorder therapy in enhancing the sensitivity for tumor radiotherapy.

         <title>Spatially Precise Genetic Engineering at the Electrode&#8208;Tissue Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a versatile AAV&#8208;shRNA&#8208;delivery probe that seamlessly integrates abiotic and biotic engineering principles into the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. This system facilitates the highly effective downregulation of target gene within specific cell types at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface, and capability of recording neuronal activities continuously for several months, which is promising for clinical research of gene therapy to neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
The interface between electrodes and neural tissues plays a pivotal role in determining the efficacy and fidelity of neural activity recording and modulation. While considerable efforts have been made to improve the electrode&#8208;tissue interface, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on the development of biocompatible neural electrodes through abiotic materials and structural engineering. In this study, an approach is presented that seamlessly integrates abiotic and biotic engineering principles into the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Specifically, ultraflexible neural electrodes with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) designed to silence the expression of endogenous genes within neural tissues are combined. The system facilitates shRNA&#8208;mediated knockdown of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and polypyrimidine tract&#8208;binding protein 1 (PTBP1), two essential genes associated in neural survival/growth and neurogenesis, within specific cell populations located at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the downregulation of PTEN in neurons can result in an enlargement of neuronal cell bodies at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Furthermore, the system enables long&#8208;term monitoring of neuronal activities following PTEN knockdown in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury. The system provides a versatile approach for genetically engineering the electrode&#8208;tissue interface with unparalleled precision, paving the way for the development of regenerative electronics and next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces.

A novel 3D printed in&#8208;plane asymmetric electrochemical capacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode) based on the selective ion&#8208;sieving effect depending on the ion size is presented. Two printing techniques together with suitable and fine&#8208;tuned inks are explored to fabricate different interdigital electrode structures: one ultramicroporous and mesoporous carbon. The devices are successfully utilized in logic gates (AND, OR) and for the first time tested as variable capacitor in a high&#8208;pass filter.








Abstract
A liquid precursor for 3D printing ultramicroporous carbons (pore width &lt;0.7&#160;nm) to create a novel in&#8208;plane capacitive&#8208;analog of semiconductor&#8208;based diodes (CAPodes) is presented. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept integrates functional EDLCs into microstructured iontronic devices. The working principle is based on selective ion&#8208;sieving, controlling the size of the electrolyte ions, and the nanoporous sieving carbon's pore size. By blocking bulky electrolyte ions from entering the sub&#8208;nanometer pores, a unidirectional charging characteristic with controllable ion flux is achieved, leading to diodic U&#8208;I characteristics with a high rectification ratio. The liquid precursor approach enables successful printing of miniaturized in&#8208;plane CAPodes. A combination of inkjet and extrusion printing techniques with suitable inks is explored to fabricate electrode materials with engineered porosity. Deliberate fine&#8208;tuning of the ultramicroporous carbon's porosity and surface area is achieved using a customized carbon precursor and CO2 etching techniques. Electrochemical evaluation of the printed CAPodes demonstrates successful miniaturization compared with macroscopic film assembly. 3D manufacturing and miniaturization allow for the integration of CAPodes into logic gate circuits (OR, AND). For the first time, these switchable devices are used as variable capacitors in a high&#8208;pass filter application, adjusting the cut&#8208;off frequency of applied alternating voltage analogous to an I&#8208;MOS varactor.

         <title>In Situ Preparation of Superconducting Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelate Thin Films with Atomically Flat Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superconducting infinite&#8208;layer nickelate films can be synthesized fully in vacuo${\mathrm{\text{in vacuo}}}$ using atomic hydrogen, while the atomically flat surface has been confirmed by atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction method paves the way for surface&#8208;sensitive electronic structural characterizations, such as angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy.








Abstract
Since their discovery, the infinite&#8208;layer nickelates have been regarded as an appealing system for gaining deeper insights into high&#8208;temperature superconductivity (HTSC). However, the synthesis of superconducting samples has been proven to be challenging. Here, an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction method is developed using atomic hydrogen as a reducing agent and is applied in the lanthanum nickelate system. The reduction parameters, including the reduction temperature (TR) and hydrogen pressure (PH), are systematically explored. It is found that the reduction window for achieving superconducting transition is quite wide, reaching nearly 80&#176;C in TR and three orders of magnitude in PH when the reduction time is set to 30 min. And there exists an optimal PH for achieving the highest Tc if both TR and reduction time are fixed. More prominently, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the atomically flat surface can be preserved during the in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction process, providing advantages over the ex situ${\mathrm{\text{ex situ}}}$ CaH2 method for surface&#8208;sensitive&#160;experiments.

     alt="In Situ Preparation of Superconducting Infinite-Layer Nickelate Thin Films with Atomically Flat Surface"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superconducting infinite-layer nickelate films can be synthesized fully in vacuo${\mathrm{\text{in vacuo}}}$ using atomic hydrogen, while the atomically flat surface has been confirmed by atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction method paves the way for surface-sensitive electronic structural characterizations, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their discovery, the infinite-layer nickelates have been regarded as an appealing system for gaining deeper insights into high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). However, the synthesis of superconducting samples has been proven to be challenging. Here, an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction method is developed using atomic hydrogen as a reducing agent and is applied in the lanthanum nickelate system. The reduction parameters, including the reduction temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen pressure (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;), are systematically explored. It is found that the reduction window for achieving superconducting transition is quite wide, reaching nearly 80&#176;C in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and three orders of magnitude in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; when the reduction time is set to 30 min. And there exists an optimal &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; for achieving the highest &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; if both &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and reduction time are fixed. More prominently, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the atomically flat surface can be preserved during the in situ${\mathrm{\text{in situ}}}$ reduction process, providing advantages over the ex situ${\mathrm{\text{ex situ}}}$ CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; method for surface-sensitive&#160;experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combating Atherosclerosis with Chirality/Phase Dual&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme Featuring Microenvironment&#8208;Programmed Senolytic and Senomorphic Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) based nanozyme is employed for atherosclerosis management by integrating dual strategies involving chirality and phase engineering. This approach harnesses the tailored nanozyme's potential to function as both senolytic and senomorphic agents, thereby exerting a comprehensive anti&#8208;senescence effect. The functional switching mechanism depends on the degree of senescence and the dosage of the nanozyme, allowing for self&#8208;programmed action.








Abstract
Senescence plays a critical role in the development and progression of various diseases. This study introduces an amorphous, high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA)&#8208;based nanozyme designed to combat senescence. By adjusting the nanozyme's composition and surface properties, this work analyzes its catalytic performance under both normal and aging conditions, confirming that peroxide and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity are crucial for its anti&#8208;aging therapeutic function. Subsequently, the chiral&#8208;dependent therapeutic effect is validated and the senolytic performance of D&#8208;handed PtPd2CuFe across several aging models is confirmed. Through multi&#8208;Omics&#160;analyses, this work explores the mechanism underlying the senolytic action exerted by nanozyme in depth. It is&#160;confirm that exposure to senescent conditions leads to the enrichment of copper and iron atoms in their lower oxidation states, disrupting the iron&#8208;thiol cluster in mitochondria and lipoic acid transferase, as well as oxidizing unsaturated fatty acids, triggering a cascade of cuproptosis and ferroptosis. Additionally, the concentration&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;aging effects of nanozyme is validated. Even an ultralow dose, the therapeutic can still act as a senomorphic, reducing the effects of senescence. Given its broad&#8208;spectrum action and concentration&#8208;adjustable anti&#8208;aging potential, this work confirms the remarkable therapeutic capability of D&#8208;handed PtPd2CuFe in managing atherosclerosis, a disease involving various types of senescent cells.

         <title>Confined Space Dual&#8208;Type Quantum Dots for High&#8208;Rate Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>

Ultra&#8208;thin layered double hydroxides (LDH) provide a stable and conductive confined space and dual&#8208;type semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) (Co9S8 and CdS) are skillfully constructed within the microenvironment. The flexible Co9S8&#8208;CdS/LDH exhibits high redox activity and stability. These findings provide unique insights for developing stable, ordered, and highly active QDs.








Abstract
Owing to the quantum size effect and high redox activity, quantum dots (QDs) play very essential roles toward electrochemical energy storage. However, it is very difficult to obtain different types and uniformly dispersed high&#8208;active QDs in a stable conductive microenvironment, because QDs prepared by traditional methods are mostly dissolved in solution or loaded on the surface of other semiconductors. Herein, dual&#8208;type semiconductor QDs (Co9S8 and CdS) are skillfully constructed within the interlayer of ultrathin&#8208;layered double hydroxides. In&#160;particular, the expandable interlayer provides a very suitable confined space for the growth and uniform dispersion of QDs, where Co9S8 originates from in situ transformation of cobalt atoms in laminate and CdS is generated from interlayer pre&#8208;embedding Cd2+. Meanwhile, XAFS and GGA+U calculations are employed to explore and prove the mechanism of QDs formation and energy storage characteristics as compared to surface loading QDs. Significantly, the hybrid supercapacitors achieve a high energy density of 329.2&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2, capacitance retention of 99.1%, and coulomb efficiency of 96.9% after 22&#160;000 cycles, which is superior to the reported QDs&#8208;based supercapacitors. These findings provide unique insights for designing and developing stable, ordered, and highly active QDs.

The kinetically sluggish and unstable oxygen evolution reaction&#160;(OER) electrocatalysts are elusive for large&#8208;scale industrial Hydrogen (H2) production. This work manifests that the phosphorization of Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays renders exceptionally low overpotential compared to benchmark IrO2. Moreover, the electrode permits robust water splitting at an extremely large current density of 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The amelioration of brilliantly effective electrocatalysts working at high current density for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical hydrogen production. Yet, the kinetically sluggish and unstable catalysts remain elusive to large&#8208;scale hydrogen (H2) generation for industrial applications. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated to significantly enhance the intrinsic activity of Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays through a trace proportion of heteroatom phosphorus doping that permits robust water splitting at an extremely large current density of 1000 and 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 760&#160;h. The in situ formation of Ni2P and Ni5P4 on Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays surface and hierarchical geometry of the electrode significantly promote the reaction kinetics and OER activity. The OER electrode provides exceptionally low overpotentials of 222 and 327&#160;mV at current densities of 10 and 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, dramatically lower than benchmark IrO2 and is among the most active catalysts yet reported. Remarkably, the alkaline electrolyzer renders a low voltage of 1.75&#160;V at a large current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating outperformed overall water splitting. The electrochemical fingerprints demonstrate vital progress toward large&#8208;scale H2 production for industrial water electrolysis.

         <title>Bi&#8208;Interlayer Strategy for Modulating NiCoP&#8208;Based Heterostructure toward High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel bismuth&#8208;nickel cobalt phosphide (CC/Bi&#8208;NCP) heterostructures with built&#8208;in electric fields are fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high&#8208;load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The developed dual&#8208;role interlayer strategy considers both the effects of the interlayer on the outer layer preparation process and the electrochemical performance of the heterostructure.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;cobalt (NiCo) phosphides (NCPs) possess high electrochemical activity, which makes them promising candidates for electrode materials in aqueous energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and zinc (Zn) batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Novel bismuth-nickel cobalt phosphide (CC/Bi-NCP) heterostructures with built-in electric fields are fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high-load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The developed dual-role interlayer strategy considers both the effects of the interlayer on the outer layer preparation process and the electrochemical performance of the heterostructure.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel-cobalt (NiCo) phosphides (NCPs) possess high electrochemical activity, which makes them promising candidates for electrode materials in aqueous energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and zinc (Zn) batteries. However, the actual specific capacitance and rate capability of NCPs require further improvement, which can be achieved through reasonable heterostructural design and loading conditions of active materials on substrates. Herein, novel hierarchical Bi-NCP heterogeneous structures with built-in electric fields consisting of bismuth (Bi) interlayers (electrodeposited on carbon cloth (CC)) are designed and fabricated to ensure the formation of uniform high-load layered active materials for efficient charge and ion transport. The resulting CC/Bi-NCP electrodes show a uniform, continuous, and high mass loading (&amp;gt;3.5&#160;mg) with a superior capacitance reaching 1200 F&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4129 mF&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; combined with high-rate capability and durable cyclic stability. Moreover, assembled hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), supercapatteries, and alkaline Zn-ion (AZBs) batteries constructed using these electrodes deliver high energy densities of 64.4, 81.8, and 319.1 Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries by Modulating Li+ Desolvation Barrier with Liquid Crystal Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonate anion&#8208;rich interface is constructed by tape&#8208;casting a liquid crystal polymer&#8208;containing layer on the separator to facilitate Li+ desolvation and improve Li2S precipitation kinetics. With this well&#8208;thought&#8208;out design, the battery performance exhibits excellent rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability. More importantly, under a low E/S ratio and high sulfur loading condition, the pouch cell delivers a remarkable areal capacity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries offer high theoretical capacity but are hindered by poor rate capability and cycling stability due to sluggish Li2S precipitation kinetics. Here a sulfonate&#8208;group&#8208;rich liquid crystal polymer (poly&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide, PBDT) is designed and fabricated to accelerate Li2S precipitation by promoting the desolvation of Li+ from electrolyte. PBDT&#8208;modified separators are employed to assemble Li&#8211;S batteries, which deliver a remarkable rate capacity (761 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 C) and cycling stability (500 cycles with an average decay rate of 0.088% per cycle at 0.5 C). A PBDT&#8208;based pouch cell even delivers an exceptional capacity of &#8776;1400 mAh g&#8722;1 and an areal capacity of &#8776;11 mAh cm&#8722;2 under lean&#8208;electrolyte and high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading condition, demonstrating promise for practical applications. Results of Raman spectra, molecular dynamic (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the abundant anionic sulfonate groups of PBDT aid in Li+ desolvation by attenuating Li+&#8208;solvent interactions and lowering the desolvation energy barrier. Plus, the polysulfide adsorption/catalysis is also excluded via electrostatic repulsion. This work elucidates the critical impact of Li+ desolvation on Li&#8211;S batteries and provides a new design direction for advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Acoustically Enhanced Triboelectric Stethoscope for Ultrasensitive Cardiac Sounds Sensing and Disease Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically analyzes the electromechanical output characteristics between a contact&#8208;separation triboelectric nanogenerator and a piezoelectric generator and proposes that triboelectric sensor features superior advantages over piezoelectric one for microquantity sensing originates from the fast saturated constitutive characteristic. By designing a trumpet&#8208;shaped auscultatory cavity, triboelectric stethoscope delivers 36&#160;dB signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for human test.








Abstract
Electronic stethoscope used to detect cardiac sounds that contain essential clinical information is a primary tool for diagnosis of various cardiac disorders. However, the linear electromechanical constitutive relation makes conventional piezoelectric sensors rather ineffective to detect low&#8208;intensity, low&#8208;frequency heart acoustic signal without the assistance of complex filtering and amplification circuits. Herein, it is found that triboelectric sensor features superior advantages over piezoelectric one for microquantity sensing originated from the fast saturated constitutive characteristic. As a result, the triboelectric sensor shows ultrahigh sensitivity (1215&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) than the piezoelectric counterpart (21&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) in the sound pressure range of 50&#8211;80&#160;dB under the same testing condition. By designing a trumpet&#8208;shaped auscultatory cavity with a power function cross&#8208;section to achieve acoustic energy converging and impedance matching, triboelectric stethoscope delivers 36&#160;dB signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio for human test (2.3 times of that for piezoelectric one). Further combining with machine learning, five cardiac states can be diagnosed at 97% accuracy. In general, the triboelectric sensor is distinctly unique in basic mechanism, provides a novel design concept for sensing micromechanical quantities, and presents significant potential for application in cardiac sounds sensing and disease diagnosis.

         <title>Structural Defect&#8208;Enabled Magnetic Neutrality Nanoprobes for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Isolated Tumor Cells in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural defect&#8208;enabled magnetic neutrality nanoprobe (MNN) featuring exceptionally low magnetic susceptibility is constructed through an ingenious structural defect&#8208;enhanced strategy. Remarkably, under 9 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the MNN records an unprecedentedly low r2/r1 value (&#8776;1.06), enabling high&#8208;performance ultra&#8208;high&#8208;field MR imaging of previously MRI&#8208;undetectable isolated tumor cells with an extraordinary detection threshold of &#8776;0.16&#160;mm.








Abstract
The identification of metastasis &#8220;seeds,&#8221; isolated tumor cells (ITCs), is of paramount importance for the prognosis and tailored treatment of metastatic diseases. The conventional approach to clinical ITCs diagnosis through invasive biopsies is encumbered by the inherent risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. This underscores the pressing need for noninvasive ITCs detection methods that provide histopathological&#8208;level insights. Recent advancements in ultra&#8208;high&#8208;field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have ignited hope for the revelation of minute lesions, including the elusive ITCs. Nevertheless, currently available MRI contrast agents are susceptible to magnetization&#8208;induced strong T2&#8208;decaying effects under UHF conditions, which compromises T1 MRI capability and further impedes the precise imaging of small lesions. Herein, this study reports a structural defect&#8208;enabled magnetic neutrality nanoprobe (MNN) distinguished by its paramagnetic properties featuring an exceptionally low magnetic susceptibility through atomic modulation, rendering it almost nonmagnetic. This unique characteristic effectively mitigates T2&#8208;decaying effect while concurrently enhancing UHF T1 contrast. Under 9 T MRI, the MNN demonstrates an unprecedentedly low r2/r1 value (&#8776;1.06), enabling noninvasive visualization of ITCs with an exceptional detection threshold of &#8776;0.16&#160;mm. These high&#8208;performance MNNs unveil the domain of hitherto undetectable minute lesions, representing a significant advancement in UHF&#8208;MRI for diagnostic purposes and fostering comprehensive metastasis research.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the negative and positive photoconductance effects conversion and the dark current suppression are realized by applying various laser power densities on a graphene/InSe/h&#8208;BN heterojunction&#8208;based FET. In addition, a modified photocurrent model as a function of laser power density is proposed to describe both negative and positive photoconductance effects. Finally, the van der Waals heterostructure is successfully applied to the image preprocessing.








Abstract
The processing of visual information occurs mainly in the retina, and the retinal preprocessing function greatly improves the transmission quality and efficiency of visual information. The artificial retina system provides a promising path to efficient image processing. Here, graphene/InSe/h&#8208;BN heterogeneous structure is proposed, which exhibits negative and positive photoconductance (NPC and PPC) effects by altering the strength of a single wavelength laser. Moreover, a modified theoretical model is presented based on the power&#8208;dependent photoconductivity effect of laser: Iph=&#8722;mP&#945;1+nP&#945;2${\rm I}_{\rm ph}\,=\,-{\rm mP}^{\alpha _{1}} + {\rm nP}^{\alpha _{2}}$, which can reveal the internal physical mechanism of negative/positive photoconductance effects. The present 2D structure design allows the field effect transistor (FET) to exhibit excellent photoelectric performance (RNPC&#160;=&#160;1.1&#215; 104&#160;AW&#8722;1, RPPC&#160;=&#160;13&#160;AW&#8722;1) and performance stability. Especially, the retinal pretreatment process is successfully simulated based on the negative and positive photoconductive effects. Moreover, the pulse signal input improves the device responsivity by 167%, and the transmission quality and efficiency of the visual signal can also be enhanced. This work provides a new design idea and direction for the construction of artificial vision, and lay a foundation for the integration of the next generation of optoelectronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Regulation of Protein Conformation Enables Cell&#8208;Selective Targeting of Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for siRNA Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a strategy is proposed to regulate protein conformation through lipid nanoenvironment to build virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (VMNs) for the efficient delivery of small interfering RNA, which have excellent cell&#8208;selective targeting ability and retain the lysosomal escape properties of the virus, thus enabling the precise enrichment of VMNs in glioblastoma brain tumor region for efficient therapeutic purposes.








Abstract
Orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) has an aggressive growth pattern and complex pathogenesis, becoming one of the most common and deadly tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). The emergence of RNA therapies offers promise for the treatment of GBM. However, the efficient and precise delivery of RNA drugs to specific tumor cells in the brain with high cellular heterogeneity remains ongoing. Here, a strategy is proposed to regulate protein conformation through lipid nanoenvironments to custom&#8208;design virus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (VMNs) with excellent selective cell targeting capabilities, leading to efficient and precise delivery of small interfering RNA for effective treatment of GBM. The optimized VMNs not only retain the ability to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and release the RNA by lysosomal escape like natural viruses but also ensure precise enrichment in the GBM area. This study lays the conceptual foundation for the custom design of VMNs with superior cell&#8208;selective targeting capabilities and opens up the possibility of RNA therapies for the efficient treatment of GBM and CNS tumors.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Magnetic&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular&#8208;Covalent Semi&#8208;Convertible Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;convertible hydrogel constructed through a universal supramolecular&#8208;covalent strategy exhibits reversible responsive lubricating capability. The application of magnetic field induces disassembly of the magnetic responsive gelatin/Fe3O4&#8208;NH2 network in the hydrogel, while the covalent PVA network retains the hydrogel structural integrity. A sol layer appears/disappears on the hydrogel surface following the magnetic field On/Off.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired magnetic&#8208;responsive hydrogel is confined in exceedingly narrow spaces for soft robots and biomedicine in either gel state or magnetofluidic sol state. However, the motion of the gel state magnetic hydrogel will be inhibited in various irregular spaces due to the fixed shape and size and the sol&#8208;state magnetofluid gel may bring unpredictable residues in the confined narrow space. Inspired by the dynamic liquid lubricating mechanism of biological systems, novel magnetic&#8208;responsive semi&#8208;convertible hydrogel (MSCH) is developed through imbedding magnetic&#8208;responsive gelatin and amino&#8208;modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles network into the covalent network of polyvinyl alcohol, which can be switched between gel state and gel&#8211;sol state in response to magnetic stimuli. It can be attributed the disassembly of triple&#8208;helix structures of the gelatin under the action of the magnetic field, driven by force from the magnetic particles conjugated on the gelatin chain through electrostatic interactions, while the covalent network retains the hydrogel structural integrity. This leads to a sol layer on the MSCH surface enabling the MSCH to pass effectively through the confined channel or obstacle under magnetic field. The present MSCH will provide an alternative mode for magnetic field&#8208;related soft robots or actuators.

         <title>Bioinspired Flexible Hydrogelation with Programmable Properties for Tactile Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating Fmoc&#8208;FF self&#8208;assembled architectures and improving their conductivity and adhesion, bioinspired supramolecular hydrogels of flexible mechanical rigidity, high conductivity, or high adhesion are achieved, respectively, which can be employed as an encapsulation layer, sensing unit, and adhesive layer for engineering tactile sensors. The findings establish the feasibility of developing peptide programmable hydrogelation of modulatable features for tactile sensing applications.








Abstract
Tactile sensing requires integrated detection platforms with distributed and highly sensitive haptic sensing capabilities along with biocompatibility, aiming to replicate the physiological functions of the human skin and empower industrial robotic and prosthetic wearers to detect tactile information. In this regard, short peptide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled hydrogels show promising potential to act as bioinspired supramolecular substrates for developing tactile sensors showing biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, the intrinsic difficulty to modulate the mechanical properties severely restricts their extensive employment. Herein, by controlling the self&#8208;assembly of 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modifid diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) through introduction of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), wider nanoribbons are achieved by untwisting from well&#8208;established thinner nanofibers, and the mechanical properties of the supramolecular hydrogels can be enhanced 10&#8208;fold, supplying bioinspired supramolecular encapsulating substrate for tactile sensing. Furthermore, by doping with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modifid 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;DOPA), the Fmoc&#8208;FF self&#8208;assembled hydrogels can be engineered to be conductive and adhesive, providing bioinspired sensing units and adhesive layer for tactile sensing applications. Therefore, the integration of these modules results in peptide hydrogelation&#8208;based tactile sensors, showing high sensitivity and sustainable responses with intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability. The findings establish the feasibility of developing programmable peptide self&#8208;assembly with adjustable features for tactile sensing applications.

         <title>Topology Reconfiguration of Anion&#8208;Pillared Metal&#8211;Organic Framework from Flexibility to Rigidity for Enhanced Acetylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a solvent&#8208;mediated approach to regulate the flexibility of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting its topology, resulting in the transformation from flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql MOFs to rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds MOFs. This topology transformation strategy effectively enhances the adsorption capacity and kinetics for C2H2. Computational simulations and breakthrough experiments validate the effectiveness of this topology transformation strategy for gas separations.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents commonly encounter limitations in removing trace impurities below gate&#8208;opening threshold pressures. Topology reconfiguration can fundamentally eliminate intrinsic structural flexibility, yet remains a formidable challenge and is rarely achieved in practical applications. Herein, a solvent&#8208;mediated approach is presented to regulate the flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (dpds = 4,4&#8242;'&#8208;dipyridyldisulfide) with sql topology into rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds with cds topology. Notably, the cds topology is unprecedented and first obtained in anion&#8208;pillared MOF materials. As a result, rigid CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;cds exhibits enhanced C2H2 adsorption capacity of 48.61 cm3 g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#160;bar compared to flexible CuSnF6&#8208;dpds&#8208;sql (21.06 cm3 g&#8722;1).

&lt;p&gt;The work presents a solvent-mediated approach to regulate the flexibility of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting its topology, resulting in the transformation from flexible CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; MOFs to rigid CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; MOFs. This topology transformation strategy effectively enhances the adsorption capacity and kinetics for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Computational simulations and breakthrough experiments validate the effectiveness of this topology transformation strategy for gas separations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents commonly encounter limitations in removing trace impurities below gate-opening threshold pressures. Topology reconfiguration can fundamentally eliminate intrinsic structural flexibility, yet remains a formidable challenge and is rarely achieved in practical applications. Herein, a solvent-mediated approach is presented to regulate the flexible CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (dpds = 4,4&#8242;'-dipyridyldisulfide) with &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; topology into rigid CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; topology. Notably, the &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; topology is unprecedented and first obtained in anion-pillared MOF materials. As a result, rigid CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds-&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits enhanced C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity of 48.61 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.01&#160;bar compared to flexible CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;-sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (21.06 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The topology transformation also facilitates the adsorption kinetics for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibiting a 6.5-fold enhanced diffusion time constant (D/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of 1.71 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; on CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;-cds&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; than that of CuSnF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-dpds&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;-sql&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (2.64 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Anomalous&#8208;Chern Steering of Topological Nonreciprocal Guided Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel method for one&#8208;way, reconfigurable guiding of microwave photons along predefined paths on a 2D metamaterial platform, with unprecedented flexibility and reconfiguration speed. The new approach is based on topological effects inherent to unitary systems, and relies on doping a circulator scattering network with a tunable scatterers. This breakthrough paves way toward practical realization of reconfigurable topological meta&#8208;devices for robust communication technologies.








Abstract
Nonreciprocal topological edge states based on external magnetic bias have been regarded as the last resort for genuine unidirectional wave transport, showing superior robustness over topological states with preserved time&#8208;reversal symmetry. However, fast and efficient reconfigurability of their trajectory has remained a formidable challenge due to the difficulty in controlling the spatial distribution of magnetic fields over large areas and short times. Here, this&#160;persistent issue is solved by leveraging the rich topology of unitary scattering networks, and achieve fast steering of nonreciprocal topological transport at an interface between a Chern and an anomalous topological insulator, without having to control a magnetic field. Such interface can be drawn by doping the network with scatterers located at the center of each link, whose level of reflection is electrically tuned. With experiments in the GHz range, the possibility to actively steer the way of unidirectional edge states is demonstrated, switching the transmission path thousands of times per second in a fully&#8208;robust topological heterostructure. The approach represents a significant step towards the realization of practical reconfigurable topological meta&#8208;devices with broken time&#8208;reversal symmetry, and their application to future robust communication&#160;technologies.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Helicoidal Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Compartment Assemblies with Tunable Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly and grazing incidence spraying is used to fabricate organized nanocellulose&#8208;based structures with nanoscale controlled helicoidal arrangement of cellulose nanofibrils. Experimental results demonstrate that this additive manufacturing approach allows for high tunability in layer composition and structure, resulting in nanocomposite films with complex controlled internal structures and tailored chiroptical properties.








Abstract
Cellulose&#8208;based nanocomposites are highly appealing for the development of next&#8208;generation sustainable functional materials. Although many advances have been made in this direction, the true potential of fibrillar nanocomposites has yet to be realized because available fabrication approaches are inadequate for achieving precise structural control at the sub&#8208;micrometer scale. Here a spray&#8208;assisted alignment methodology of cellulose nanofibrils is combined with the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly into an additive manufacturing process in which the alignment direction of each cellulose layer is rationally selected to achieve thin films with a helicoidal arrangement of the nanofibrils. The helicoidal structure of the films is verified by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) of the samples. The sign and position of the structural CD peak show that the handedness and the pitch of the chiral structures can be easily tuned by deliberately selecting simple parameters, such as the number of consecutive cellulose layers sprayed in the same direction, and the angle of rotation between successive stacks of layers. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, this approach is unique as it offers the possibility to prepare complex nanocomposite architectures with various nanoscale&#8208;controlled sub&#8208;structures from different anisometric objects, which is enabling novel designs of composite films with damage&#8208;resistant and/or optical filtering functionalities.

         <title>Linear Electro&#8208;Optic Effect in 2D Ferroelectric for Electrically Tunable Metalens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroelectric metalens, composed of CuInP2S6, is demonstrated with electrically tunability. The linear electric&#8208;field modulation of light is verified in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6, yielding an effective electro&#8208;optic coefficient rc of 20.28 pm V&#8211;1. The 2D ferroelectric Fresnel metalens shows efficacious focusing ability with an electrical modulation efficiency of the focusing exceeding 34%.








Abstract
The advent of 2D ferroelectrics, characterized by their spontaneous polarization states in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer domains without the limitation of a finite size effect, brings enormous promise for applications in integrated optoelectronic devices. Comparing with semiconductor/insulator devices, ferroelectric devices show natural advantages such as non&#8208;volatility, low energy consumption and high response speed. Several 2D ferroelectric materials have been reported, however, the device implementation particularly for optoelectronic application remains largely hypothetical. Here, the linear electro&#8208;optic effect in 2D ferroelectrics is discovered and electrically tunable 2D ferroelectric metalens is demonstrated. The linear electric&#8208;field modulation of light is verified in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6. The in&#8208;plane phase retardation can be continuously tuned by a transverse DC electric field, yielding an effective electro&#8208;optic coefficient rc of 20.28 pm V&#8211;1. The CuInP2S6 crystal exhibits birefringence with the fast axis oriented along its (010) plane. The 2D ferroelectric Fresnel metalens shows efficacious focusing ability with an electrical modulation efficiency of the focusing exceeding 34%. The theoretical analysis uncovers the origin of the birefringence and unveil its ultralow light absorption across a wide wavelength range in this non&#8208;excitonic system. The van der Waals ferroelectrics enable room&#8208;temperature electrical modulation of light and offer the freedom of heterogeneous integration with silicon and another material system for highly compact and tunable photonics and&#160;metaoptics.

Biomass solid&#8208;state electrolytes with abundant ion and water channels are constructed by knitting the OH&#8722;&#8208;conductive cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and water&#8208;retentive CNFs together via an energy&#8208;efficient tape casting for Zn&#8211;air batteries, which reveal impressive OH&#8722; conductivity of 175&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 with high water uptake, thus affording the exceptional cycle lifespan of 310&#160;h and power density of 126&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries are the leading candidates as the next&#8208;generation power source for flexible/wearable electronics. However, constructing safe and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with intrinsic hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) conduction remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, by adopting the natural and robust cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) as building blocks, the biomass SSEs with penetrating ion and water channels are constructed by knitting the OH&#8722;&#8208;conductive CNFs and water&#8208;retentive CNFs together via an energy&#8208;efficient tape casting. Benefiting from the abundant ion and water channels with interconnected hydrated OH&#8722; wires for fast OH&#8722; conduction under a nanoconfined environment, the biomass SSEs reveal the high water&#8208;uptake, impressive OH&#8722; conductivity of 175&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 and mechanical robustness simultaneously, which overcomes the commonly existed dilemma between ion conductivity and mechanical property. Remarkably, the flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries assemble with biomass SSEs deliver an exceptional cycle lifespan of 310&#160;h and power density of 126&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2. The design methodology for water and ion channels opens a new avenue to design high&#8208;performance SSEs for batteries.

         <title>A Strong, Tough, and Stable Composite with Nacre&#8208;Inspired Sandwich Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The composite inspired by nacre is prepared by incorporating dual&#8208;phase alumina nanowires as reinforcement and bridging components to form a 1D sandwich structure through vacuum&#8208;assisted suction filtration. The mechanical behaviors of hierarchical fracture resistance contributes to their excellent high strength, toughness, and stability, providing new design for solving conflicts between strength and toughness in engineering materials.








Abstract
Improving the fracture resistance of nacre&#8208;inspired composites is crucial in addressing the strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off. However, most previously proposed strategies for enhancing fracture resistance in these composites have been limited to interfacial modification by polymer, which restricts mechanical enhancement. Here, a composite material consisting of graphene oxide (GO) lamellae and nanocrystalline reinforced amorphous alumina nanowires (NAANs) has been developed. The structure of the composite is inspired by nacre and is composed of stacked GO nanosheets with NAANs in between, forming a sandwich&#8208;like structure. This design enhances the fracture resistance of the composite through the pull&#8208;out of GO nanosheets at the nanoscale and GO/NAANs sandwich&#8208;like coupling at the micro&#8208;scale, while also providing stiff ceramic support. This composite simultaneously possesses high strength (887.8&#160;MPa), toughness (31.6&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), superior cyclic stability (1600 cycles), and long&#8208;term (2 years) immersion stability, which outperform previously reported GO&#8208;based lamellar composites. The hierarchical fracture design provides a new path to design next&#8208;generation strong, tough, and stable materials for advanced engineering applications.

         <title>Fusion Bonding Technique for Solvent&#8208;Free Fabrication of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery with Ultrathin Sulfide Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free manufacturing has huge potential for sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). This work demonstrates a new solvent&#8208;free paradigm of fusion bonding technique to fabricate sulfide ASSBs with optimized interface and ability to dissipate excessive stress. This strategy not only prolongs the cycle life to over 10,000 h, and is suitable for preparing practical batteries of bipolar and pouch cells.








Abstract
For preparing next&#8208;generation sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), the solvent&#8208;free manufacturing process has huge potential for the advantages of economic, thick electrode, and avoidance of organic solvents. However, the dominating solvent&#8208;free process is based on the fibrillation of polytetrafluoroethylene, suffering from poor mechanical property and electrochemical instability. Herein, a continuously solvent&#8208;free paradigm of fusion bonding technique is developed. A percolation network of thermoplastic polyamide (TPA) binder with low viscosity in viscous state is constructed with Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) by thermocompression (&#8804;5&#160;MPa), facilitating the formation of ultrathin LPSC film (&#8804;25&#160;&#181;m). This composite sulfide film (CSF) exhibits excellent mechanical properties, ionic conductivity (2.1 mS cm&#8722;1), and unique stress&#8208;dissipation to promote interface stabilization. Thick LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode can be prepared by this solvent&#8208;free method and tightly adhered to CSF by interfacial fusion of TPA for integrated battery. This integrated ASSB shows high&#8208;energy&#8208;density feasibility (&gt;2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 1400 cycles of 9200 h and run for more than 10&#8239;000 h), and energy density of 390 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1020 Wh L&#8722;1. More specially, high&#8208;voltage bipolar cell (&#8805;8.5&#160;V) and bulk&#8208;type pouch cell (326 Wh kg&#8722;1) are facilely assembled with good cycling performance. This work inspires commercialization of ASSBs by a solvent&#8208;free method and provides beneficial guiding for stable batteries.

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile as an Efficient Transfer Medium for Wafer&#8208;Scale Transfer of Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, by using polyacrylonitrile as the transfer medium and encapsulating layer, wafer&#8208;scale graphene transfer, devices fabrication, and efficient encapsulation against the airborne contaminations are successfully achieved, and the transferred graphene delivers improved electronic performances and long&#8208;term stability, offering a reliable method for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale devices of 2D materials with outstanding electronic quality.








Abstract
The disparity between growth substrates and application&#8208;specific substrates can be mediated by reliable graphene transfer, the lack of which currently strongly hinders the graphene applications. Conventionally, the removal of soft polymers, that support the graphene during the transfer, would contaminate graphene surface, produce cracks, and leave unprotected graphene surface sensitive to airborne contaminations. In this work, it is found that polyacrylonitrile (PAN) can function as polymer medium for transferring wafer&#8208;size graphene, and encapsulating layer to deliver high&#8208;performance graphene devices. Therefore, PAN, that is compatible with device fabrication, does not need to be removed for subsequent applications. The crack&#8208;free transfer of 4 in. graphene onto SiO2/Si wafers, and the wafer&#8208;scale fabrication of graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor arrays with no observed clear doping, uniformly high carrier mobility (&#8776;11&#160;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability at room temperature, are achieved. This work presents new concept for designing the transfer process of 2D materials, in which multifunctional polymer can be retained, and offers a reliable method for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale devices of 2D materials with outstanding performance.

         <dc:description>
This paper presents a single component hydrophilic polymer evaporator with a record evaporation rate of 4.32&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun and excellent resistance to mechanical and chemical damage. This flexible polymer evaporator has a new evaporation model and it is easy to synthesis and mold for better practical application in conjunction with automation equipment.








Abstract
One of the greenest and promising ways to solve the problem of freshwater crisis is surface solar steam generation from seawater. A great number of photothermal materials with multi&#8208;component and multi&#8208;layered delicate yet complex structures often suffer from either low evaporation rate or high energy loss. Here, this work presents a single component foam evaporator with steam generation rate of up to 4.32&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation. The evaporator is constructed from an aniline oligomer as a single light&#8208;absorbing component, covalent linked with polyethylene glycol to form a monolithic polymer foam. Floating on the seawater, the foam has absorbance of 99.5% over the entire solar spectral range and low thermal conductivity (0.0077&#160;W K&#8722;1m&#8722;1) that effectively retains heat in the material and at the interface. After 3 months of continuous outdoor natural sunlight irradiation, the evaporator maintains a stable and durable evaporation rate. Moreover, the materials have good mechanical properties (7.48&#160;MPa young's modulus and 57.38% elongation at break) and excellent chemical resistance in 10 common organic solvents and aqueous solutions of pH = 1 to 14. This study provides a new system and strategy for desalination, steam power generation, treatment of polluted water and sewage, etc.

         <title>Hidden Real Topology and Unusual Magnetoelectric Responses in Two&#8208;Dimensional Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monolayer Cr2Se2O is reported as the first material example of a 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) real Chern insulator with topologically protected corner states. A hidden real topology in 2D AFM materials with mirror symmetry is unveiled. Due to antiferromagnetism, the corner modes in Cr2Se2O exhibit strong corner&#8208;contrasted spin polarization, leading to spin&#8211;corner coupling (SCC). SCC enables the direct control of the net magnetization of the system by both local and global electric methods.








Abstract
Recently, the real topology has been attracting widespread interest in two dimensions (2D). Here, based on first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical analysis, the monolayer Cr2Se2O (ML&#8208;CrSeO) is revealed as the first material example of a 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) real Chern insulator (RCI) with topologically protected corner states. Unlike previous RCIs, it is found that the real topology of the ML&#8208;CrSeO is rooted in one certain mirror subsystem of the two spin channels, and cannot be directly obtained from all the valence bands in each spin channel as commonly believed. In particular, due to antiferromagnetism, the corner modes in ML&#8208;CrSeO exhibit strong corner&#8208;contrasted spin polarization, leading to spin&#8211;corner coupling (SCC). This SCC enables a direct connection between spin space and real space. Consequently, large and switchable net magnetization can be induced in the ML&#8208;CrSeO nanodisk by electrostatic means, such as potential step and in&#8208;plane electric field, and the corresponding magnetoelectric responses behave like a sign function, distinguished from that of the conventional multiferroic materials. This work considerably broadens the candidate range of RCI materials, and opens up a new direction for topo&#8208;spintronics and 2D AFM materials&#160;research.

         <title>Scalable Optical Nose Realized with a Chemiresistively Modulated Light&#8208;Emitter Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optical nose that integrates a large array of chemiresistive sensors with light&#8208;emitting diodes (ChemLEDs) is introduced. Each metal&#8208;oxide sensor, grown combinatorially,&#160;modulates the intensity of an LED in response to the gas mixture. The array of ChemLEDs displays a unique light pattern for various gas mixtures and permits the quantitative analysis of composition and analyte concentration using image analysis tools.








Abstract
Biological olfaction relies on a large number of receptors that function as sensors to detect gaseous molecules. It is challenging to realize artificial olfactory systems that contain similarly large numbers of sensory materials. It is shown that combinatorial materials processing with vapor deposition can be used to fabricate large arrays of distinct chemiresistive sensing materials. By combining these with light&#8208;emitting diodes, an array of chemiresistively&#8208;modulated light&#8208;emitting diodes, or ChemLEDs, that permit a simultaneous optical read&#8208;out in response to an analyte is obtained. The optical nose uses a common voltage source and ground for all sensing elements and thus eliminates the need for complex wiring of individual sensors. This optical nose contains one hundred ChemLEDs and generates unique light patterns in response to gases and their mixtures. Optical pattern recognition methods enable the quantitative prediction of the corresponding concentrations and compositions, thereby paving the way for massively parallel artificial olfactory systems. ChemLEDs open the possibility to explore demanding gas sensing applications, including in environmental, food quality monitoring, and potentially diagnostic settings.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of Reservoir Computing with Self&#8208;Assembled Percolating Networks of Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
Brain&#8208;like computing with percolating networks of nanoparticles. Successful spoken digit recognition is achieved by converting audio waveforms to electrical signals which are classified using a reservoir computing scheme. The use of parallel reservoirs results in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy. Similar techniques allow prediction of complex time series as well as nonlinear transformations.








Abstract
The complex self&#8208;assembled network of neurons and synapses that comprises the biological brain enables natural information processing with remarkable efficiency. Percolating networks of nanoparticles (PNNs) are complex self&#8208;assembled nanoscale systems that have been shown to possess many promising brain&#8208;like attributes and which are therefore appealing systems for neuromorphic computation. Here experiments are performed that show that PNNs can be utilized as physical reservoirs within a nanoelectronic reservoir computing framework and demonstrate successful computation for several benchmark tasks (chaotic time series prediction, nonlinear transformation, and memory capacity). For each task, relevant literature results are compiled and it is shown that the performance of the PNNs compares favorably to that previously reported from nanoelectronic reservoirs. It is then demonstrated experimentally that PNNs can be used for spoken digit recognition with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy. Finally, a parallel reservoir architecture is emulated, which increases the dimensionality and richness of the reservoir outputs and results in further improvements in performance across all tasks.

         <title>Catheter&#8208;Directed Ionic Liquid Embolic Agent for Rapid Portal Vein Embolization, Segmentectomy, and Bile Duct Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials currently used for PVE do not treat the tumor, risking tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgery. Here, an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based embolic material (LEAD) is developed that can embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics. With its ease of use and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.









Abstract
Embolic materials currently in use for portal vein embolization (PVE) do not treat the tumor, which poses a risk for tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgical resection. Here, is developed an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based embolic material (LEAD) for portal vein embolization, liver ablation, and drug delivery. LEAD is optimized and characterized for diffusivity, X&#8208;ray visibility, and cytotoxicity. In the porcine renal embolization model, LEAD delivered from the main renal artery reached vasculature down to 10 microns with uniform tissue ablation and delivery of small and large therapeutics. In non&#8208;survival and survival porcine experiments, successful PVE is achieved in minutes, leading to the expected chemical segmentectomy, and delivery of a large protein drug (i.e., Nivolumab) with LEAD. In cholangiocarcinoma mouse tumor models and in ex vivo human tumors, LEAD consistently achieved an effective ablation and wide drug distribution. Furthermore, various strains of drug&#8208;resistant patient&#8208;derived bacteria showed significant susceptibility to LEAD, suggesting that LEAD may also prevent infectious complications resulting from tissue ablation. With its capabilities to embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics, ease of use, and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.

Here, is developed an ionic-liquid-based embolic material (LEAD) for portal vein embolization, liver ablation, and drug delivery. LEAD is optimized and characterized for diffusivity, X-ray visibility, and cytotoxicity. In the porcine renal embolization model, LEAD delivered from the main renal artery reached vasculature down to 10 microns with uniform tissue ablation and delivery of small and large therapeutics. In non-survival and survival porcine experiments, successful PVE is achieved in minutes, leading to the expected chemical segmentectomy, and delivery of a large protein drug (i.e., Nivolumab) with LEAD. In cholangiocarcinoma mouse tumor models and in ex vivo human tumors, LEAD consistently achieved an effective ablation and wide drug distribution. Furthermore, various strains of drug-resistant patient-derived bacteria showed significant susceptibility to LEAD, suggesting that LEAD may also prevent infectious complications resulting from tissue ablation. With its capabilities to embolize, ablate, and deliver therapeutics, ease of use, and a high safety profile demonstrated in animal studies, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE for FLR growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Suspended, 3D Morphing Sensory System for Robots to Feel and Protect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suspended electronic skins that enable structural integration of high&#8208;sensitive touch and dynamic pain perception are rationally designed through 3D deformation&#8208;mechanical contact mechanism, which show potentials in friendly human&#8211;robot interaction for active feel and protect.








Abstract
Artificial sensory systems with synergistic touch and pain perception hold substantial promise for environment interaction and human&#8211;robot communication. However, the realization of biological skin&#8208;like functional integration of sensors with sensitive touch and pain perception still remains a challenge. Here, a concept is proposed of suspended electronic skins enabling 3D deformation&#8208;mechanical contact interactions for achieving synergetic ultrasensitive touch and adjustable pain perception. The suspended sensory system can sensitively capture tiny touch stimuli as low as 0.02&#160;Pa and actively perceive pain response with reliable 5200 cycles via 3D deformation and mechanical contact mechanism, respectively. Based on the touch&#8208;pain effect, a visualized feedback demo with miniaturized sensor arrays on artificial fingers is rationally designed to give a pain perception mapping on sharp surfaces. Furthermore, the capability is shown of the suspended electronic skin serving as a safe human&#8211;robot communication interface from active and passive view through a feedback control system, demonstrating potential in bionic electronics and intelligent robotics.

         <title>Electrical Doping of Metal Halide Perovskites by Co&#8208;Evaporation and Application in PN Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled electrical n&#8208; and p&#8208;doping of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is demonstrated by co&#8208;evaporating molecular dopants alongside the perovskite precursors. The doped layers are integrated into PN and NP diodes that show opposing trends in rectification. Doping of perovskites opens the path for their integration into novel applications beyond photovoltaics such as thermoelectrics and complementary logic.








Abstract
Electrical doping of semiconductors is a revolutionary development that enabled many electronic and optoelectronic technologies. While doping of many inorganic and organic semiconductors is well&#8208;established, controlled electrical doping of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is yet to be demonstrated. In this work, efficient n&#8208; and p&#8208;type electrical doping of MHPs by co&#8208;evaporating the perovskite precursors alongside organic dopant molecules is achieved. It is demonstrated that the Fermi level can be shifted by up to 500 meV toward the conduction band and by up to 400 meV toward the valence band by n&#8208; and p&#8208;doping, respectively, which increases the conductivity of the films. The doped layers are employed in PN and NP diodes, showing opposing trends in rectification. Demonstrating controlled electrical doping by a scalable, industrially relevant deposition method opens the route to developing perovskite devices beyond solar cells, such as thermoelectrics or complementary logic.

         <title>Ion and Molecular Sieving With Ultrathin Polydopamine Nanomembranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first free&#8208;standing, ultrathin (10&#8211;17&#160;nm) nanomembranes composed entirely of polydopamine for efficient ion and molecular sieving via an easily scalable electropolymerization strategy are reported. These nanomembranes feature well&#8208;defined nanochannels and abundant amine and catechol groups, which provide a favorable chemical environment for ion&#8208;channel electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions, emulating the analogous function of biological ion channels.









Abstract
In contrast to biological cell membranes, it is still a major challenge for synthetic membranes to efficiently separate ions and small molecules due to their similar sizes in the sub&#8208;nanometer range. Inspired by biological ion channels with their unique channel wall chemistry that facilitates ion sieving by ion&#8208;channel interactions, the first free&#8208;standing, ultrathin (10&#8211;17&#160;nm) nanomembranes composed entirely of polydopamine (PDA) are reported here as ion and molecular sieves. These nanomembranes are obtained via an easily scalable electropolymerization strategy and provide nanochannels with various amine and phenolic hydroxyl groups that offer a favorable chemical environment for ion&#8208;channel electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions. They exhibit remarkable selectivity for monovalent ions over multivalent ions and larger species with K+/Mg2+ of &#8776;4.2, K+/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; of &#8776;10.3, and K+/Rhodamine B of &#8776;273.0 in a pressure&#8208;driven process, as well as cyclic reversible pH&#8208;responsive gating properties. Infrared spectra reveal hydrogen bond formation between hydrated multivalent ions and PDA, which prevents the transport of multivalent ions and facilitates high selectivity. Chemically rich, free&#8208;standing, and pH&#8208;responsive PDA nanomembranes with specific interaction sites are proposed as customizable high&#8208;performance sieves for a wide range of challenging separation requirements.

         <title>Stabilizing Ni2+ in Hollow Nano MOF/Polymetallic Phosphides Composites for Enhanced Electrochemical Performance in 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni, which has stronger coordination ability with N, is introduced into the nano Co&#8208;MOF composite material to partially replace Co, and the hollow nanostructure is stabilized through low&#8208;temperature controllable formation rate of multi metal phosphides. The generation of Ni, Co, and P atoms during the reduction process effectively enhances the electron transfer rate within the framework.








Abstract
Polymetallic phosphides exhibit favorable conductivities. A reasonable design of nano&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frame (MOF) composite morphologies and in situ introduction of polymetallic phosphides into the framework can effectively improve electrolyte penetration and rapid electron transfer. To address existing challenges, Ni, with a strong coordination ability with N, is introduced to partially replace Co in nano&#8208;Co&#8211;MOF composite. The hollow nanostructure is stabilized through CoNi bimetallic coordination and low&#8208;temperature controllable polymetallic phosphide generation rate. The Ni, Co, and P atoms, generated during reduction, effectively enhance electron transfer rate within the framework. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) characterization results further confirm the existence of Ni&#8211;N, Ni&#8211;Ni, and Co&#8211;Co structures in the nanocomposite. The changes in each component during the charge&#8211;discharge process of the electrochemical reactions are investigated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Theoretical calculations further confirm that P can effectively improve conductivity. VZNPGC//MXene MSCs, constructed with active materials derived from the hollow nano MOF composites synthesized through the Ni2+ stabilization strategy, demonstrate a specific capacitance of 1184 mF cm&#8722;2, along with an energy density of 236.75 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2 (power density of 0.14 mW cm&#8722;2). This approach introduces a new direction for the synthesis of highly conductive nano&#8208;MOF composites.

Tissue Ablation
Portal vein embolization (PVE) does not treat the tumor, risking tumor progression during the interval between PVE and surgery. In article number 2402570, Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers developed an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based embolic material (LEAD) that can embolize, achieve ablative segmentectomy, and deliver therapeutics. With its ease of use and high safety profile, LEAD offers a potential alternative to tumor ablation with or without PVE.

Inhalable RNA Immunotherapy
In article number 2400307, Bowen Li and co&#8208;workers develop a tumor&#8208;tailored lipid nanoparticle system to deliver IL&#8208;12 circular RNA for enhanced lung cancer immunotherapy. Inhalation of these engineered nanoparticles can effectively induce immune activation, increase CD8+ T cell infiltration into tumor tissues, and lead to lung tumor regression, offering a promising strategy to improve treatment outcomes of lung cancer.

Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Feld&#8208;Effect Transistors
Utilizing a monolithic&#8208;oxide&#8208;gapped metal gate at the Schottky&#8208;Mott limit, the MoS2 metal&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistor (MESFET) is demonstrated as distinct from the conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) FET architecture. Due to strong gate coupling and excellent interface quality, the 2D MESFETs exhibit low voltage (&lt;1V) operation and Boltzmann&#8208;limited switching (&#8776;60 mV dec&#8722;1). More details can be found in article number 2314274 by Chul&#8208;Ho Lee and co&#8208;workers.

Overall Water Splitting
In article number 2401448, Usman Khan, Junkuo Gao, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the impact of nanoscale surface morphologies on the release behavior of H2 and O2 bubbles for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance by introducing surface&#8208;controlled Ni&#8208;based catalysts. The catalysts render exceptionally low overpotential compared to benchmark Pt/C and IrO2. Moreover, the electrode permits robust water splitting at an extremely large current density of 2000 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Investigation of the Single&#8208;Particle Scale Structure&#8211;Activity Relationship Providing New Insights for the Development of High&#8208;Performance Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly unified 3D evaluation of the physical characterization, electrochemical measurement, and theoretical simulation of active material single particle is a powerful means to deeply understand the structure&#8211;activity relationship of active materials and promote the rational design of the high&#8208;performance battery material and structure.








Abstract
As electric vehicles, portable electronic devices, and tools have increasingly high requirements for battery energy density and power density, constantly improving battery performance is a research focus. Accurate measurement of the structure&#8211;activity relationship of active materials is key to advancing the research of high&#8208;performance batteries. However, conventional performance tests of active materials are based on the electrochemical measurement of porous composite electrodes containing active materials, polymer binders, and conductive carbon additives, which cannot establish an accurate structure&#8211;activity relationship with the physical characterization of microregions. In this review, in order to promote the accurate measurement and understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship of materials, the electrochemical measurement and physical characterization of energy storage materials at single&#8208;particle scale are reviewed. The potential problems and possible improvement schemes of the single particle electrochemical measurement and physical characterization are proposed. Their potential applications in single particle electrochemical simulation and machine learning are prospected. This review aims to promote the further application of single particle electrochemical measurement and physical characterization in energy storage materials, hoping to achieve 3D unified evaluation of physical characterization, electrochemical measurement, and theoretical simulation at the single particle scale to provide new inspiration for the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Development of Electrolytes under Lean Condition in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementing lean electrolyte is a required condition to achieve high specific energy of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries at the cell level. This review analyzes the challenges induced by lean electrolyte condition focusing on the connection between polysulfide evolution pathways and fundamental solvation properties of the electrolytes. The working mechanisms and design principle of redox mediators and catalysts are also discussed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stand out as one of the promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage technologies. A key requirement to realize high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy Li&#8211;S batteries is to implement low amount of electrolyte, often characterized by the electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio. Low E/S ratio aggravates the known challenges for Li&#8211;S batteries and introduces new ones originated from the high concentration of polysulfides in limited electrolyte reservoir. In this review, the connections between the fundamental properties of electrolytes and the electrochemical/chemical reactions in Li&#8211;S batteries under lean electrolyte condition are elucidated. The emphasis is on how the solvating properties of the electrolyte affect the fate of polysulfides. Built upon the mechanistic analysis, different strategies to design lean electrolytes to improve the overall process of Li&#8211;S reactions and Li anode protection are discussed.

         <title>Side Reactions/Changes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanisms and Strategies for Creating Safer and Better Batteries</title>

Lithium&#8208;ion batteries are considered the most competitive energy storage devices. A deep understanding of the reactions that cause changes in the battery's internal components is needed to build safer and better batteries. This review focuses on the processes of battery failures, with voltage and temperature as the underlying factors.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), in which lithium ions function as charge carriers, are considered the most competitive energy storage devices due to their high energy and power density. However, battery materials, especially with high capacity undergo side reactions and changes that result in capacity decay and safety issues. A deep understanding of the reactions that cause changes in the battery's internal components and the mechanisms of those reactions is needed to build safer and better batteries. This review focuses on the processes of battery failures, with voltage and temperature as the underlying factors. Voltage&#8208;induced failures result from anode interfacial reactions, current collector corrosion, cathode interfacial reactions, overcharge, and over&#8208;discharge, while temperature&#8208;induced failure mechanisms include SEI decomposition, separator damage, and interfacial reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. The review also presents protective strategies for controlling these reactions. As a result, the reader is offered a comprehensive overview of the safety features and failure mechanisms of various LIB components.

         <title>Perovskite Colloidal Nanocrystal Solar Cells: Current Advances, Challenges, and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 29, July 18, 2024. </description>

The colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (c&#8208;PeNCs) present great potential in the field of solar cells (SCs) owing to its excellent optoelectronic properties. The power conversion efficiency of c&#8208;PeNC SCs (NC&#8208;PeSCs) has surpassed all other colloidal nanocrystal SCs. This article systematically reviews the strategies to make high&#8208;efficiency NC&#8208;PeSCs, discusses the persisting challenges, and provides an outlook for the future of NC&#8208;PeSCs.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of polycrystalline perovskite (PVK) solar cells (SCs) (PC&#8208;PeSCs) have rapidly increased. However, PC&#8208;PeSCs are intrinsically unstable without encapsulation, and their efficiency drops during large&#8208;scale production; these problems hinder the commercial viability of PeSCs. Stability can be increased by using colloidal PVK nanocrystals (c&#8208;PeNCs), which have high surface strains, low defect density, and exceptional crystal quality. The use of c&#8208;PeNCs separates the crystallization process from the film formation process, which is preponderant in large&#8208;scale fabrication. Consequently, the use of c&#8208;PeNCs has substantial potential to overcome challenges encountered when fabricating PC&#8208;PeSCs. Research on colloidal nanocrystal&#8208;based PVK SCs (NC&#8208;PeSCs) has increased their PCEs to a level greater than those of other quantum&#8208;dot SCs, but has not reached the PCEs of PC&#8208;PeSCs; this inferiority significantly impedes widespread application of NC&#8208;PeSCs. This review first introduces the distinctive properties of c&#8208;PeNCs, then the strategies that have been used to achieve high&#8208;efficiency NC&#8208;PeSCs. Then it discusses in detail the persisting challenges in this domain. Specifically, the major challenges and solutions for NC&#8208;PeSCs related to low short&#8208;circuit current density Jsc are covered. Last, the article presents a perspective on future research directions and potential applications in the realm of NC&#8208;PeSCs.

Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions is crucial for advancing global energy sustainability. The design of catalysts based on their electronic properties (e.g., work function) has gained significant attention recently. Although numerous reviews on electrocatalysis have been provided, no such reports on work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design are available. Herein, a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design for diverse electrochemical energy applications is provided. This includes the development of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors, and the design of both monolithic and heterostructural catalysts. The measurement of work function is first discussed and the applications of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors for various reactions are fully analyzed. Subsequently, the work function&#8208;regulated material&#8208;electrolyte interfacial electron transfer (IET) is employed for monolithic catalyst design, and methods for regulating the work function and optimizing the catalytic performance of catalysts are discussed. In addition, key strategies for tuning the work function&#8208;governed material&#8208;material IET in heterostructural catalyst design are examined. Finally, perspectives on work function determination, work function&#8208;based activity descriptors, and catalyst design are put forward to guide future research. This work paves the way to the work function&#8208;guided rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.

         <dc:description>
This review presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the efficiency of 2D PSCs, focusing on component&#160;engineering, crystal&#160;structure and photovoltaic properties. The strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique and interface optimization, are systematically discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites are outlined to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
In the quest for durable photovoltaic devices, 2D halide perovskites have emerged as a focus of extensive research.

As a result, the efficiency of 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lags significantly behind their 3D counterparts. To overcome these constraints, extensive investigations into materials and processing techniques are pursued rigorously to augment the efficiency of 2D PSCs. Herein, The cutting&#8208;edge delve into developments in 2D PSCs, with a focus on chemical and material engineering, as well as their structure and photovoltaic properties. The review starts with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the key evaluation criteria of 2D PSCs. Then, the strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique, and interface optimization, to simultaneously boost efficiency and stability are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance will be outlined.

         <title>Rational Design of Fluorinated 2D Polymer Film Based on Donor&#8211;Accepter Architecture toward Multilevel Memory Device for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded it into an F&#8208;2DP system by simple air&#8211;liquid interface method to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces between the interlayer and regulate the charge transfer along the intralayer to induce multilevel memory behavior for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing 2D polymer (F&#8208;2DP) film is a desired system to regulate the charge transport in organic electronics but rather rarely reports due to the limited fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks and difficulties in synthesis. Herein, a novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded into an F&#8208;2DP system to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces. The donor&#8211;accepter&#8211;accepter&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8242; (D&#8211;A&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8242;) structure regulates the charge transportation efficiently, inducing multilevel memory behavior through stepwise charge capture and transfer processes. Thus, the device exhibits ternary memory behavior with low threshold voltage (Vth1 of 1.1&#160;V, Vth2 of 2.0&#160;V), clearly distinguishable resistance states (1:102:104) and ternary yield (83%). Furthermore, the stepwise formation of the charge complex endows the device with a wider range to regulate the conductive state, which allows its application in brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing. Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology recognition can reach an accuracy of 86%, showing great potential in neuromorphic computing applications in the post&#8208;Moore era.

         <title>A Universal Biocompatible and Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte in p&#8208;Type and n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Complementary Circuits and Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and biocompatible, highly stretchable, flexible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte for bioelectronic applications is introduced. This nonvolatile electrolyte demonstrates compatibility with a wide range of both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels for organic electrochemical transistors while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. They are further used in circuits and for sensing physiological signals.








Abstract
The development of soft and flexible devices for collection of bioelectrical signals is gaining momentum for wearable and implantable applications. Among these devices, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) stand out due to their low operating voltage and large signal amplification capable of transducing weak biological signals. While liquid electrolytes have demonstrated efficacy in OECTs, they limit its operating temperature and pose challenges for electronic packaging due to potential leakage. Conversely, solid electrolytes offer advantages such as mechanical flexibility, robustness against environmental factors, and ability to bridge the interface between rigid dry electronics systems and soft wet biological tissues. However, few systems have demonstrated generality and compatibility with a wide range of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). This paper introduces a highly stretchable, flexible, biocompatible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte, compatible with both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OMIEC channels while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. Furthermore, this nonvolatile electrolyte is stable up to 120&#160;&#176;C and exhibits high ionic conductivity even in dry environment. Additionally, an OECT&#8208;based complementary inverter with a record&#8208;high normalized&#8208;gain of 228 V&#8722;1 and a corresponding ultralow static power consumption of 1 nW is demonstrated. These advancements pave the way for versatile applications ranging from bioelectronics to power&#8208;efficient implants.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of soft and flexible devices for collection of bioelectrical signals is gaining momentum for wearable and implantable applications. Among these devices, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) stand out due to their low operating voltage and large signal amplification capable of transducing weak biological signals. While liquid electrolytes have demonstrated efficacy in OECTs, they limit its operating temperature and pose challenges for electronic packaging due to potential leakage. Conversely, solid electrolytes offer advantages such as mechanical flexibility, robustness against environmental factors, and ability to bridge the interface between rigid dry electronics systems and soft wet biological tissues. However, few systems have demonstrated generality and compatibility with a wide range of state-of-the-art organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs). This paper introduces a highly stretchable, flexible, biocompatible, self-healable gelatin-based solid-state electrolyte, compatible with both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type OMIEC channels while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. Furthermore, this nonvolatile electrolyte is stable up to 120&#160;&#176;C and exhibits high ionic conductivity even in dry environment. Additionally, an OECT-based complementary inverter with a record-high normalized-gain of 228 V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a corresponding ultralow static power consumption of 1 nW is demonstrated. These advancements pave the way for versatile applications ranging from bioelectronics to power-efficient implants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complementary Multisite Turnover Catalysis toward Superefficient Bifunctional Seawater Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst is in situ constructed on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative interfaces and abundant multifunctional trimetal sites for seawater electrolysis, in which interfacial Mo sites are responsible for hydrogen evolution, while Co/Fe species facilitate oxygen evolution kinetics, thus cooperatively expediting bifunctional freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69 V, outperforming most of the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The utilization of seawater for hydrogen production via water splitting is increasingly recognized as a promising avenue for the future. The key dilemma for seawater electrolysis is the incompatibility of superior hydrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;evolving activities at ampere&#8208;scale current densities for both cathodic and anodic catalysts, thus leading to large electric power consumption of overall seawater splitting. Here, in situ construction of Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 heterostructure arrays anchoring on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative catalytic interfaces and abundant multifunctional metal sites is reported, which serves as a robust bifunctional catalyst for alkaline freshwater/seawater splitting at ampere&#8208;level current density. Operando Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies combined with density functional theory calculations corroborate that Mo and Co/Fe sites situated on the Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 multilevel interfaces optimize the reaction pathway and coordination environment to enhance water adsorption/dissociation, hydrogen adsorption, and oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate adsorption, thus cooperatively expediting hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions in base. Inspiringly, this electrocatalyst can substantially ameliorate overall freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69&#160;V, along with superb long&#8208;term stability at 500&#8211;1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 200 h, outperforming nearly all the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for freshwater/seawater electrolysis. This work offers a viable approach to design high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater splitting.

         <title>Trace Small Molecular/Nano&#8208;Colloidal Multiscale Electrolyte Additives Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan of Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace small molecular/nano&#8208;colloidal multiscale electrolyte additives, zinc acetylacetonate, enable ultra&#8208;long lifespan of zinc metal anodes (e.g., a superb cumulative plating capacity of 15 Ah cm&#8722;2). The slightly water&#8208;soluble additives exist not only as soluble small molecules, which efficiently regulate Zn2+ ion solvation structure, but also as insoluble nano&#8208;colloids, which in situ form a robust solid electrolyte interface film on zinc anodes.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives are efficient to improve the performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet the current electrolyte additives are limited to fully water&#8208;soluble additives (FWAs) and water&#8208;insoluble additives (WIAs). Herein, trace slightly water&#8208;soluble additives (SWAs) of zinc acetylacetonate (ZAA) were introduced to aqueous ZnSO4 electrolytes. The SWA system of ZAA is composed of a FWA part and a WIA part in a dynamic manner of dissolution equilibrium. The FWA part exists as soluble small molecules, which efficiently regulate Zn2+ ion solvation structure, while the WIA part exists as insoluble nano&#8208;colloids, which in&#8208;situ form a thick and robust solid electrolyte interface film on zinc metal anodes (ZMAs). Such small molecular/nano&#8208;colloidal multiscale electrolyte additives of ZAA are capable to not only improve ionic conductivity and transference number but also inhibit corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and Zn dendrite on ZMAs. The SWA&#8208;based Zn&#8741;Zn half battery delivers a superb cumulative plating capacity of 15 Ah cm&#8722;2 under 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 20 mA cm&#8722;2, and the SWA&#8208;based NH4V4O10&#8741;Zn pouch cell obtains a capacity retention of 67.8% within 4000 cycles under 4 A g&#8722;1. The study provides innovative insights for rational design of electrolyte additives, which may pave the way for the practicality of AZIBs.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Shell&#8208;Less Indium Phosphide Quantum Dots Enabled by Atomistically Tailored Surface States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InP quantum dots demonstrate enhanced luminescence through atomic&#8208;level surface manipulation without shell structures. Concerns persist over core instability due to oxidation propensity and inevitable trap presence. However, utilizing Zn&#8208;oleate removes some traps, and with the addition of GaCl3, most traps are eliminated, achieving over 90% luminescence efficiency with the core alone.








Abstract
Contrary to the prevailing notion that shell structures arise from the intricate chemistry and surface defects of InP quantum dots (QDs), an innovative strategy that remarkably enhances the luminescence efficiency of core&#8208;only InP QDs to over 90% is introduced. This paradigm shift is achieved through the concurrent utilization of group 2 and 3 metal&#8208;derived ligands, providing an effective remedy for surface defects and facilitating charge recombination. Specifically, a combination of Zn carboxylate and Ga chloride is employed to address the undercoordination issues associated with In and P atoms, leading to the alleviation of in&#8208;gap trap states. The intricate interplay and proportional ratio between Ga&#8208; and Zn&#8208;containing ligands play pivotal roles in attaining record&#8208;high luminescence efficiency in core&#8208;only InP QDs, as successfully demonstrated across various sizes and color emissions. Moreover, the fabrication of electroluminescent devices relying solely on InP core emission opens a new direction in optoelectronics, demonstrating the potential of the approach not only in optoelectronic applications but also in catalysis or energy conversion by charge transfer.

         <title>An Electrolyte Engineered Homonuclear Copper Complex as Homogeneous Catalyst for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) with a Cu atom proximal distance of 4.7 &#197; is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the lithium&#8211;sulfur redox reactions. The optimized content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaches the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T in electrolyte, further boosting its homogeneous optimization activity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries suffer from severe polysulfide shuttle, retarded sulfur conversion kinetics and notorious lithium dendrites, which has curtailed the discharge capacity, cycling lifespan and safety. Engineered catalysts act as a feasible strategy to synchronously manipulate the evolution behaviors of sulfur and lithium species. Herein, a chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the Li&#8211;S redox reactions. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T provides completely active sites and sufficient contact for homogeneously guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions, and stabilizing the lithium working interface according to the synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography, small angle neutron scattering and COMSOL results. Moreover, Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T with the content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaching saturated concentration in electrolyte further boosts the homogeneous optimization function in really operated Li&#8211;S batteries. Accordingly, the capacity retention of the Li&#8211;S battery is elevated from 51.4% to 86.3% at 0.2 C, and reaches 77.0% at 1.0 C over 400 cycles. Furthermore, the sulfur cathode with the assistance of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T realizes the stable cycling under the practical scenarios of soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell and high sulfur loading (6.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with the electrolyte usage of 4.5&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1).

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Culture of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Xeno&#8208;Free Condition Using Functional Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylicacrylate) (pGC2), engineered for human pluripotent stem cells cultivation. pGC2 supports robust growth of human pluripotent stem cells, maintaining stemness and pluripotency for up to ten passages, while offering cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. Comprehensive evaluations confirm its wide adaptability and potential for clinical translation in stem cell&#8208;based therapies.








Abstract
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), encompassing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold immense potential in regenerative medicine, offering new opportunities for personalized cell therapies. However, their clinical translation is hindered by the inevitable reliance on xenogeneic components in culture environments. This study addresses this challenge by engineering a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, whose surface composition is tailored systematically for xeno&#8208;free culture of hPSCs. A functional polymer surface, pGC2 (poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylic acrylate)), offers excellent cell&#8208;adhesive properties as well as non&#8208;cytotoxicity, enabling robust hESCs and hiPSCs growth while presenting cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. This investigation includes comprehensive evaluations of pGC2 across diverse experimental conditions, demonstrating its wide adaptability with various pluripotent stem cell lines, culture media, and substrates. Crucially, pGC2 supports long&#8208;term hESCs and hiPSCs expansion, up to ten passages without compromising their stemness and pluripotency. Notably, this study is the first to confirm an identical proteomic profile after ten passages of xeno&#8208;free cultivation of hiPSCs on a polymeric substrate compared to Matrigel. The innovative substrate bridges the gap between laboratory research and clinical translation, offering a new promising avenue for advancing stem cell&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Interstitials in Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial strategy has attracted increasing attentions due to its remarkable impact on synergistically optimizing carrier and phonon transport properties. This review overviews and defines five typical interstitials, including rattling, decoupling, interlayer, dynamic, and liquid interstitials. Their transport mechanisms in thermoelectric materials are thoroughly illustrated, and future development directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Defect structure is pivotal in advancing thermoelectric performance with interstitials being widely recognized for their remarkable roles in optimizing both phonon and electron transport properties. Diverse interstitial atoms are identified in previous works according to their distinct roles and can be classified into rattling interstitial, decoupling interstitial, interlayer interstitial, dynamic interstitial, and liquid interstitial. Specifically, rattling interstitial can cause phonon resonance in cage compound to scatter phonon transport; decoupling interstitial can contribute to phonon blocking and electron transport due to their significantly different mean free paths; interlayer interstitial can facilitate out&#8208;of&#8208;layer electron transport in layered compounds; dynamic interstitial can tune temperature&#8208;dependent carrier density and optimize electrical transport properties at wide temperatures; liquid interstitial could improve the carrier mobility at homogeneous dispersion state. All of these interstitials have positive impact on thermoelectric performance by adjusting transport parameters. This perspective therefore intends to provide a thorough overview of advances in interstitial strategy and highlight their significance for optimizing thermoelectric parameters. Finally, the profound potential for extending interstitial strategy to various other thermoelectric systems is discussed and some future directions in thermoelectric material are also outlined.

         <title>Efficient Orbitronic Terahertz Emission Based on CoPt Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates for the first time the efficient generation of orbital current from CoPt alloy. This work quantifies the transport properties of the orbital currents from CoPt alloy and show that the performance of orbitronic terahertz emitters exceeds the spintronic counterpart. This work provides a new route for the developing orbitronic information devices.








Abstract
Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, this work reports a more efficient light&#8208;induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the composition of the CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, this work confirms that THz emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within CoPt, propagating through Cu, followed by subsequent orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion due to the inverse orbital Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO interface. This study provides strong evidence for the efficient orbital current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way for efficient orbital terahertz emitters.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine (III)&#8208;Based Complexation for Chiroptical Supramolecular Glass, Deep Eutectic Solvent and Luminescent Switch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents are achieved by the biaxial type halogen bonded complexation, which also appends light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.








Abstract
Hypervalent iodine(III) have widely been utilized for organic synthetic reagents. They are also recognized as positive charge&#8208;assisted, exceptionally robust biaxial halogen bond donors, while their potential in supramolecular materials is barely explored. This work reports a cyclic diaryliodonium ion as biaxial halogen bonding donor that displays remarkable binding affinity toward phenanthroline or acridine acceptors with chiral pendants. Biaxial halogen bonding enables chiroptical evolution in solution, allowing for rational control over supramolecular chirality. Leveraging their strong binding affinity, the halogen bonding complexes manifested amorphous properties and deep eutectic behavior in the solid state. Capitalizing on these attributes, this work achieves the successful preparation of supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents. Additionally, halogen bonding appended light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.

         <title>Compliant DNA Origami Nanoactuators as Size&#8208;Selective Nanopores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconfigurable MechanoPore, built from DNA origami, is a nanopore with tunable lumen sizes that can be controllably activated by different molecular triggers. The MechanoPores can switch between 3 distinct states (open, intermediate, closed), after incorporation into a lipid membrane, enabling the controlled influx or exclusion of differently&#8208;sized cargo.








Abstract
Biological nanopores crucially control the import and export of biomolecules across lipid membranes in cells. They have found widespread use in biophysics and biotechnology, where their typically narrow, fixed diameters enable selective transport of ions and small molecules, as well as DNA and peptides for sequencing applications. Yet, due to their small channel sizes, they preclude the passage of large macromolecules, e.g., therapeutics. Here, the unique combined properties of DNA origami nanotechnology, machine&#8208;inspired design, and synthetic biology are harnessed, to present a structurally reconfigurable DNA origami MechanoPore (MP) that features a lumen that is tuneable in size through molecular triggers. Controllable switching of MPs between 3 stable states is confirmed by 3D&#8208;DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution imaging and through dye&#8208;influx assays, after reconstitution of the large MPs in the membrane of liposomes via an inverted&#8208;emulsion cDICE technique. Confocal imaging of transmembrane transport shows size&#8208;selective behavior with adjustable thresholds. Importantly, the conformational changes are fully reversible, attesting to the robust mechanical switching that overcomes pressure from the surrounding lipid molecules. These MPs advance nanopore technology, offering functional nanostructures that can be tuned on&#8208;demand &#8211; thereby impacting fields as diverse as drug delivery, biomolecule sorting, and sensing, as well as bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.

         <title>Electron Spectroscopy and Microscopy: A Window into the Surface Electronic Properties of Polycrystalline Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perspective presents an overview of the array of information that can be gleaned from the characterization of single crystals of metal halide perovskites using electron spectroscopic techniques. Building on this information, the perspective then discusses the challenges that need to be addressed in order to extend these versatile techniques to include the highly heterogeneous polycrystalline perovskite thin films.








Abstract
In the past years, an increasing number of experimental techniques have emerged to address the need to unveil the chemical, structural, and electronic properties of perovskite thin films with high vertical and lateral spatial resolutions. One of these is angle&#8208;resolved photoemission electron spectroscopy which can provide direct access to the electronic band structure of perovskites, with the aim of overcoming elusive and controversial information due to the complex data interpretation of purely optical spectroscopic techniques. This perspective looks at the information that can be gleaned from the direct measurement of the electronic band structure of single crystal perovskites and the challenges that remain to be&#160;overcame to extend this technique to heterogeneous polycrystalline metal halide perovskites.

         <title>Stable Photo&#8208;Rechargeable Al Battery for Enhancing Energy Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable photo&#8208;rechargeable Al battery for integrated solar energy conversion storage is demonstrated to substantially enhance energy utilization. Illumination will generate photo&#8208;holes and electrons to improve the reaction pathway, along with boosting the electrochemical reaction. A novel strategy is designed to meet the practical operation condition within 24&#160;h, exhibiting energy saving because of decreased overpotential upon charging/discharging.









Abstract
Photovoltaic cells (PVs) are able to convert solar energy to electric energy, while energy storage devices are required to be equipped due to the fluctuations of sunlight. However, the electrical connection of PVs and energy storage devices leads to increased energy consumption, and thus energy storage ability and utilization efficiency are decreased. One of the solutions is to explore an integrated photoelectrochemical energy conversion&#8208;storage device. Up to date, the integrated photo&#8208;rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries often suffer from unstable photo&#8208;active materials and flammable electrolytes under illumination, with concerns in safety risks and limited lifetime. To address the critical issues, here a novel photo&#8208;rechargeable aluminum battery (PRAB) is designed with safe ionic liquid electrolytes and stable polyaniline photo&#8208;electrodes. The integrated PRAB presents stable operation with an enhanced reversible specific capacity &#8776;191% under illumination. Meanwhile, a simplified continuum model is established to provide rational guidance for designing electrode structures along with a charging/discharging strategy to meet the practical operation conditions. The as&#8208;designed PRAB presents an energy&#8208;saving efficiency &#8776;61.92% upon charging and an energy output increment &#8776;31.25% during discharging under illumination. The strategy of designing and fabricating stable and safe photo&#8208;rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous Al batteries highlights the pathway for substantially promoting the utilization efficiency of solar energy.

         <title>50&#8208;nm Gas&#8208;Filled Protein Nanostructures to Enable the Access of Lymphatic Cells by Ultrasound Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large size of microbubbles and nanobubbles greatly limits the cell populations that ultrasound imaging and delivery can access. This article introduces genetically engineered virus&#8208;size gaseous nanostructures, representing the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles ever made to the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge. They have demonstrated the ability to penetrate deep tissues in lymph nodes.








Abstract
Ultrasound imaging and ultrasound&#8208;mediated gene and drug delivery are rapidly advancing diagnostic and therapeutic methods; however, their use is often limited by the need for microbubbles, which cannot transverse many biological barriers due to their large size. Here, the authors introduce 50&#8208;nm gas&#8208;filled protein nanostructures derived from genetically engineered gas vesicles(GVs)&#160;that are referred to as 50 nmGVs. These diamond&#8208;shaped nanostructures have hydrodynamic diameters smaller than commercially available 50&#8208;nm gold nanoparticles and are, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles made to date. 50 nmGVs can be produced in bacteria, purified through centrifugation, and remain stable for months. Interstitially injected 50 nmGVs can extravasate into lymphatic tissues and gain access to critical immune cell populations, and electron microscopy images of lymph node tissues reveal their subcellular location in antigen&#8208;presenting cells adjacent to lymphocytes. The authors anticipate that 50 nmGVs can substantially broaden the range of cells accessible to current ultrasound technologies and may generate applications beyond biomedicine as ultrasmall stable gas&#8208;filled nanomaterials.

         <title>Composition Dictates Octahedral Tilt and Photostability in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term instability of halide perovskite semiconductors hinders their commercial adoption. In this paper, it is found that the magnitude of octahedral tilting in the crystal structures of alloyed formamidinium&#8208;rich halide perovskites can be controlled by their composition, and that greater tilting leads to more photo&#8208;stable films with fewer performance&#8208;limiting hexagonal phase impurities.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are excellent candidate materials for use in solar cell, LED, and detector devices, in part because their composition can be tuned to achieve ideal optoelectronic properties. Empirical efficiency optimization has led the field toward compositions rich in FA (formamidinium) on the A&#8208;site and I on the X&#8208;site, with additional small amounts of MA (methylammonium) or Cs A&#8208;site cations and Br X&#8208;site anions. However, it is not clear how and why the specific compositions of alloyed, that is, mixed component, halide perovskites relate to photo&#8208;stability of the materials. Here, this work combines synchrotron grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, photoluminescence, high&#8208;resolution scanning electron diffraction measurements and theoretical modelling to reveal the links between material structure and photostability. Namely, this work finds that increased octahedral titling leads to improved photo&#8208;stability that is correlated with lower densities of performance&#8208;harming hexagonal polytype impurities. These results uncover the structural signatures underpinning photo&#8208;stability and can therefore be used to make targeted changes to halide perovskites, bettering the commercial prospects of technologies based on these materials.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aligned Piezoelectric Nanofibers Derived Hydrogel Conduits for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel nerve guidance conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration are proposed. The aligned piezoelectric nanofibers inner layer possesses aligned orientation and US&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation, while poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel outer layer provides controllable drug release to promote nerve regeneration. Such conduits can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve regeneration of rats with long sciatic nerve defects.








Abstract
Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) are considered as promising treatment strategy and frontier trend for peripheral nerve regeneration, while their therapeutic outcomes are limited by the lack of controllable drug delivery and available physicochemical cues. Herein, novel aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs with ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation (ES) and controllable drug release for repairing peripheral nerve injury are proposed. The inner layer of the NGCs is the barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles (BTNPs)&#8208;doped polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene [BTNPs/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)] electrospinning nanofibers with improved piezoelectricity and aligned orientation. The outer side of the NGCs is the thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel with bioactive drug encapsulation. Such NGCs can not only induce neuronal&#8208;oriented extension and promote neurite outgrowth with US&#8208;triggered wireless ES, but also realize the controllable nerve growth factor release with the hydrogel shrinkage under US&#8208;triggered heating. Thus, the NGC can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve axonal regeneration of rat models with long sciatic nerve defects. It is believed that the proposed US&#8208;responsive aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs will find important applications in clinic neural tissue engineering.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Crystalline Core&#8208;Shell Guanine Spherulites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique architecture of core&#8208;shell spherulites, composed of highly birefringent and ordered crystalline organic subunits, formed in the eyes of aquatic organisms, exhibits extraordinary light scattering properties with no synthetic equivalent. A ternary emulsification process is developed to produce bioinspired core&#8208;shell spherulites of self&#8208;assembled guanine platelets, with an estimated birefringence of &#8776;25%.








Abstract
Spherical particles with diameters within the wavelength of visible light, known as spherulites, manipulate light uniquely due to their spatial organization and their structural birefringence. Most of the known crystalline spherulites are branched, and composed of metals, alloys, and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers. Recently, a different spherulite architecture is discovered in the vision systems of decapod crustaceans &#8208; core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of highly birefringent (&#916;n&#8776;30%$\Delta n \approx \ 30\%$) organic single&#8208;crystal platelets, with exceptional optical properties. These metastructures, which efficiently scatter light even in dense aqueous environments, have no synthetic equivalence and serve as a natural proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as well as synthetic inspiration for thin scattering media. Here, the synthesis of core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of guanine crystal platelets ((&#916;n&#8776;25%$\Delta n \approx 25\%$) is presented in a two&#8208;step emulsification process in which a water/oil/water emulsion and induced pH changes are used to promote interfacial crystallization. Carboxylic acids neutralize the dissolved guanine salts to form spherulites composed of single, radially stacked, &#946;&#8208;guanine platelets, which are oriented tangentially to the spherulite surface. Using Mie theory calculations and forward scattering measurements from single spherulites, it is found that due to the single&#8208;crystal properties and orientation, the synthetic spherulites possess a high tangential refractive index, similarly to biogenic&#160;particles.

         <title>Photoannealing of Microtissues Creates High&#8208;Density Capillary Network Containing Living Matter in a Volumetric&#8208;Independent Manner</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clinical translation of engineered tissues is currently hindered by the lack of solutions to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks in clinically sized tissues. Photoannealing of living microtissues combines the clinically translatable microtissue production throughput of in&#8208;air microfluidics with cytocompatible photoannealing to on&#8208;demand generate living microporous tissues containing high&#8208;density capillary networks in a scalable manner.








Abstract
The vascular tree is crucial for the survival and function of large living tissues. Despite breakthroughs in 3D bioprinting to endow engineered tissues with large blood vessels, there is currently no approach to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks into living tissues in a scalable manner. Here, photoannealing of living microtissue (PALM) is presented as a scalable strategy to engineer capillary&#8208;rich tissues. Specifically, in&#8208;air microfluidics is used to produce living microtissues composed of cell&#8208;laden microgels in ultrahigh throughput, which can be photoannealed into a monolithic living matter. Annealed microtissues inherently give rise to an open and interconnected pore network within the resulting living matter. Interestingly, utilizing soft microgels enables microgel deformation, which leads to the uniform formation of capillary&#8208;sized pores. Importantly, the ultrahigh throughput nature underlying the microtissue formation uniquely facilitates scalable production of living tissues of clinically relevant sizes (&gt;1 cm3) with an integrated high&#8208;density capillary network. In short, PALM generates monolithic, microporous, modular tissues that meet the previously unsolved need for large engineered tissues containing high&#8208;density vascular networks, which is anticipated to advance the fields of engineered organs, regenerative medicine, and drug screening.

         <title>Accumulation of Long&#8208;Lived Photogenerated Holes at Indium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Two Coordinate Nitrogen Vacancy Defect Engineering for Enhanced Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel method employing defect&#8208;engineered indium (In) single&#8208;atom photocatalysts with nitrogen vacancy (Nv) defects, dispersed in carbon nitride foam (In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF), is reported to make further advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis. The engineered two coordinated nitrogen (N2C) vacancies induce a defect state serving as an effective electron trap, thus extending the lifetime of photogenerated holes and concentrating holes at In atom sites.








Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic oxidation by photogenerated holes has immense potential for environmental remediation applications. While the electron&#8208;mediated photoreduction reactions are often at the spotlight, active holes possess a remarkable oxidation capacity that can degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants, resulting in nontoxic byproducts. However, the random charge transfer and rapid recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs hinder the accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes at the reaction center. Herein, a novel method employing defect&#8208;engineered indium (In) single&#8208;atom photocatalysts with nitrogen vacancy (Nv) defects, dispersed in carbon nitride foam (In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF), is reported to overcome these challenges and make further advances in photocatalysis. This Nv defect&#8208;engineered strategy produces a remarkable extension in the lifetime and an increase in the concentration of photogenerated holes in In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF. Consequently, the optimized In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF demonstrates a remarkable 50&#8208;fold increase in photo&#8208;oxidative degradation rate compared to pristine CN, effectively breaking down two widely used antibiotics (tetracycline and ciprofloxacin) under visible light. The contaminated water treated by In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF is completely nontoxic based on the growth of Escherichia coli. Structural&#8211;performance correlations between defect engineering and long&#8208;lived hole accumulation in In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF are established and validated through experimental and theoretical agreement. This work has the potential to elevate the efficiency of overall photocatalytic reactions from a hole&#8208;centric standpoint.

         <title>Enhancing the Conductivity and Thermoelectric Performance of Semicrystalline Conducting Polymers through Controlled Tie Chain Incorporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new model system of ion&#8208;exchange doped, aligned ribbon&#8208;phase poly[2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene] (PBTTT) is reported to study the effect of controlled incorporation of tie chains between crystalline domains. The tie chains provide efficient transport pathways between crystalline domains, resulting in&#160;enhanced electrical conductivity of 4810.1 S cm&#8722;1 without a reduction in Seebeck coefficient nor a large increase in thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are promising materials for thermoelectric applications, however, at present few effective and well&#8208;understood strategies exist to further advance their thermoelectric performance. Here a new model system is reported for a better understanding of the key factors governing their thermoelectric properties: aligned, ribbon&#8208;phase poly[2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene] (PBTTT) doped by ion&#8208;exchange doping. Using a range of microstructural and spectroscopic methods, the effect of controlled incorporation of tie&#8208;chains between the crystalline domains is studied through blending of high and low molecular weight chains. The tie chains provide efficient transport pathways between crystalline domains and lead to significantly enhanced electrical conductivity of 4810 S cm&#8722;1, which is not accompanied by a reduction in Seebeck coefficient or a large increase in thermal conductivity. Respectable power factors of 173 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 are demonstrated in this model system. The approach is generally applicable to a wide range of semicrystalline conjugated polymers and could provide an effective pathway for further enhancing their thermoelectric properties and overcome traditional trade&#8208;offs in optimization of thermoelectric performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Timed and Spatially Targeted Delivery of Chemical Cargo by Motile Liquid Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed hydrodynamic and colloidal forces permit motile liquid crystal (LC) droplets to transport and then release microcargo at specific times and locations. Release is triggered by an internal flow that is weak enough to permit the formation of large microcargo clusters, yet strong enough to exert hydrodynamic forces on these clusters that overcome colloidal forces and trigger escape of the LC droplets.








Abstract
A key challenge underlying the design of miniature machines is encoding materials with time&#8208; and space&#8208;specific functional behaviors that require little human intervention. Dissipative processes that drive materials beyond equilibrium and evolve continuously with time and location represent one promising strategy to achieve such complex functions. This work reports how internal nonequilibrium states of liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets undergoing chemotaxis can be used to time the delivery of a chemical agent to a targeted location. During ballistic motion, hydrodynamic shear forces dominate LC elastic interactions, dispersing microdroplet inclusions (microcargo) within double emulsion droplets. Scale&#8208;dependent colloidal forces then hinder the escape of dispersed microcargo from the propelling droplet. Upon arrival at the targeted location, a circulatory flow of diminished strength allows the microcargo to cluster within the LC elastic environment such that hydrodynamic forces grow to exceed colloidal forces and thus trigger the escape of the microcargo. This work illustrates the utility of the approach by using microcargo that initiate polymerization upon release through the outer interface of the carrier droplet. These findings provide a platform that utilizes nonequilibrium strategies to design autonomous spatial and temporal functions into active materials.

         <title>AMPLON: Amplifying DNA with Multiarm Priming and Looping Optimization of Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article introduces a groundbreaking method called amplifying DNA with multiarm priming and looping optimization of nucleic acid (AMPLON) for efficient DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. By utilizing unique multiarm polyethylene glycol&#8211;DNA primers, AMPLON demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in nucleic acid detection. With its potential to enhance nucleic acid amplification, AMPLON holds promise for significant advancements in biotechnology, medicine and healthcare.








Abstract
Nucleic acid amplification, the bedrock of biotechnology and molecular diagnostics, surges in applications&#8212;especially isothermal approaches&#8212;heightening the demand for advanced and precisely engineered methods. Here, a novel approach for amplifying DNA with multiarm priming and looping optimization of nucleic acid (AMPLON) is presented. AMPLON relies on a novel polymeric material with unique set of multiarm polyethylene glycol&#8211;DNA primers for efficient DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. Each arm carries single&#8208;stranded DNA complementing the sense or antisense sequence of the target DNA. The amplification reaction begins with antisense arms binding to the target DNA, forming a template for sense&#8208;carrying arms to direct multiarm large DNA amplicon synthesis through successive DNA looping and unlooping steps. Using human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) as a model clinical target, AMPLON exhibits high sensitivity, detecting target concentrations as low as 100 copies mL&#8722;1. Compared to a quantitative real&#8208;time polymerase chain reaction assay using sensitive primers, AMPLON reliably identifies HIV&#8208;1 RNA in plasma samples (n = 20) with a significant agreement rate of 95%. With its ability to achieve highly specific and sensitive target amplification within 30 min, AMPLON holds immense potential to transform the field of nucleic acid research and unleashing new possibilities in medicine and biotechnology.

         <title>Extraordinary Thermoelectric Properties of Topological Surface States in Quantum&#8208;Confined Cd3As2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric properties of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films with varying thicknesses are systematically studied. Significant enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient in quantum&#8208;confined thin films at cryogenic temperatures is observed, which is attributed to the contribution of topological surface states. The findings suggest promising applications of topological thermoelectric materials in cryogenic solid&#8208;state cooling.








Abstract
Topological insulators and semimetals have been shown to possess intriguing thermoelectric properties promising for energy harvesting and cooling applications. However, thermoelectric transport associated with the Fermi arc topological surface states on topological Dirac semimetals remains less explored. This work systematically examines thermoelectric transport in a series of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Surprisingly, significantly enhanced Seebeck effect and anomalous Nernst effect are found at cryogenic temperatures when the Cd3As2 layer is thin. In particular, a peak Seebeck coefficient of nearly 500&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 and a corresponding thermoelectric power factor over 30&#160;mW&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;m&#8722;1 are observed at 5&#160;K in a 25&#8208;nm&#8208;thick sample. Combining angle&#8208;dependent quantum oscillation analysis, magnetothermoelectric measurement, transport modeling, and first&#8208;principles simulation, the contributions from bulk and surface conducting channels are isolated and the unusual thermoelectric properties are attributed to the topological surface states. The analysis showcases the rich thermoelectric transport physics in quantum&#8208;confined topological Dirac semimetal thin films and suggests new routes to achieving high thermoelectric performance at cryogenic&#160;temperatures.

         <title>Mismatched Supramolecular Interactions Facilitate the Reprocessing of Super&#8208;Strong and Ultratough Thermoset Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired strategy for improving the recyclability of mechanically strong and tough thermoset elastomers is developed using mismatched supramolecular interactions to molecularly engineer the covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network. This work produces a robust elastomer with an extraordinary multirecyclability comparable to thermoplastic materials. This work presents a novel pathway for enabling the sustainable recycling of extremely durable thermosets.








Abstract
Thermoset elastomers have been extensively applied in many fields because of their excellent mechanical strengths and durable characteristics, such as an excellent chemical resistance. However, in the context of environmental issues, the nonrecyclability of thermosets has become a major barrier to the further development of these materials. Here, a well&#8208;tailored strategy is reported to solve this problem by introducing mismatched supramolecular interactions (MMSIs) into a covalently cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network with dynamic acylsemicarbazide moieties. The MMSIs significantly strengthen and toughen the thermoset elastomer by effectively dissipating energy and resisting external stress. In addition, the elastomer recycling efficiency is improved 2.7&#8208;fold due to the superior reversibility of the MMSIs. The optimized thermoset elastomer&#160;features outstanding characteristics, including an ultrahigh tensile strength (110.8&#160;MPa), an unprecedented tensile toughness (1245.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), as well as remarkable resistance to chemical media, creep, and damage. Most importantly, it exhibits an extraordinary multirecyclability, and the 4th recycling efficiency remains close to 100%. This scalable method promotes the development of thermosets with both high performance and excellent recyclability, thereby providing valuable guidance for addressing the issue of nonrecyclability from a molecular design standpoint.

With acid/base controls, tunable loosened/tightened nano&#8208;loops of corresponding [1]rotaxanes (i.e., [1]RA/[1]RB) can be achieved via the shuttling of macrocycles reversibly, and thus to adjust their respective white&#8208;light/cyan emissions, where the cyan emission of [1]RB is obtained due to the largest conformational constraint of DPAC moiety in its bending form of [1]RB with a tightened lasso structure. Additionally, the non&#8208;interlocked analog M&#8208;Boc only shows the orange emission, revealing the twisted form of DPAC fluorophore in M&#8208;Boc without any conformational constraint. Moreover, the utilization of solvents (with different viscosities and polarities), temperatures, and water fractions could serve as effective tools to adjust the bi&#8208;stable vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) colors of [1]rotaxanes. Finally, tuning ratiometric emission colors of adaptive conformations of DPAC moieties by altering nano&#8208;bending structures in [1]rotaxanes and external stimuli can be further developed as intelligent temperature and viscosity sensor materials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Assembly of Atomically&#8208;Precise Copper Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically&#8208;precise copper nanoclusters are designed for intricate non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies to create life&#8208;like systems. Cu(I)&#8211;ligand ratio change and dynamic Cu(I)&#8211;Cu(I) metallophilic/coordination interactions enable the reorganization into equilibrium complexes. Upon adding fuels, the system goes further cycles. Metallosupramolecules offer a new toolbox for crafting nuanced non&#8208;equilibrium materials with tailored structures and functionalities.








Abstract
Accurate structure control in dissipative assemblies (DSAs) is vital for precise biological functions. However, accuracy and functionality of artificial DSAs are far from this objective. Herein, a novel approach is introduced by harnessing complex chemical reaction networks rooted in coordination chemistry to create atomically&#8208;precise copper nanoclusters (CuNCs), specifically Cu11(&#181;9&#8208;Cl)(&#181;3&#8208;Cl)3L6Cl (L = 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;piperazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbodithioate). Cu(I)&#8211;ligand ratio change and dynamic Cu(I)&#8211;Cu(I) metallophilic/coordination interactions enable the reorganization of CuNCs into metastable CuL2, finally converting into equilibrium [CuL&#183;Y]Cl (Y = MeCN/H2O) via Cu(I) oxidation/reorganization and ligand exchange process. Upon adding ascorbic acid (AA), the system goes further dissipative cycles. It is observed that the encapsulated/bridging halide ions exert subtle influence on the optical properties of CuNCs and topological changes of polymeric networks when integrating CuNCs as crosslink sites. CuNCs duration/switch period could be controlled by varying the ions, AA concentration, O2 pressure and pH. Cu(I)&#8208;Cu(I) metallophilic and coordination interactions provide a versatile toolbox for designing delicate life&#8208;like materials, paving the way for DSAs with precise structures and functionalities. Furthermore, CuNCs can be employed as modular units within polymers for materials mechanics or functionalization studies.

         <title>Customized Proteinaceous Nanoformulation for In Vivo Chemical Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has developed the functional proteinaceous nanoformulation for on&#8208;demand co&#8208;delivery of multiple pharmacological reprogramming factors, which selectively reprogram keratinocytes into myoepithelial cells and achieve de novo regeneration of functional sweat glands in vivo and in situ. This work shows the highest in vivo chemical reprogramming efficiency and offers a transgene&#8208;free and clinically adaptable approach for burn treatment with improved rehabilitation.









Abstract
Sweat gland (SwG) regeneration is crucial for the functional rehabilitation of burn patients. In vivo chemical reprogramming that harnessing the patient's own cells in damaged tissue is of substantial interest to regenerate organs endogenously by pharmacological manipulation, which could compensate for tissue loss in devastating diseases and injuries, for example, burns. However, achieving in vivo chemical reprogramming is challenging due to the low reprogramming efficiency and an unfavorable tissue environment. Herein, this work has developed a functionalized proteinaceous nanoformulation delivery system containing prefabricated epidermal growth factor structure for on&#8208;demand delivery of a cocktail of seven SwG reprogramming components to the dermal site. Such a chemical reprogramming system can efficiently induce the conversion of epidermal keratinocytes&#160;into SwG myoepithelial cells, resulting in successful in situ regeneration of functional SwGs. Notably, in vivo chemical reprogramming of SwGs is achieved for the first time with an impressive efficiency of 30.6%, surpassing previously reported efficiencies. Overall, this proteinaceous nanoformulation provides a platform for coordinating the target delivery of multiple pharmacological agents and facilitating in vivo SwG reprogramming by chemicals. This advancement greatly improves the clinical accessibility of in vivo reprogramming and offers a non&#8208;surgical, non&#8208;viral, and cell&#8208;free strategy for in situ SwG regeneration.

         <title>Phase Evolution of Multi&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides With Conversion&#8208;Alloying Hybrid Mechanism for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;metal dichalcogenide anode, with a conversion&#8208;alloying hybrid mechanism, is introduced in lithium&#8208;ion batteries for the first time. It undergoes a comprehensive phase evolution upon cycling, leading to the formation of abundant heterojunctions and highly conductive metal/alloy phases. This significantly increases lithium storage sites and promotes charge transport, contributing to excellent low&#8208;temperature capability and overall electrochemical performance.









Abstract
Traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anodes, whether intercalation&#8208;type like graphite or alloying&#8208;type like silicon, employing a single lithium storage mechanism, are often limited by modest capacity or substantial volume changes. Here, the kesterite multi&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (CZTSSe) is introduced as an anode material that harnesses a conversion&#8208;alloying hybrid lithium storage mechanism. Results unveil that during the charge&#8211;discharge processes, the CZTSSe undergoes a comprehensive phase evolution, transitioning from kesterite structure to multiple dominant phases of sulfides, selenides, metals, and alloys. The involvement of multi&#8208;components facilitates electron transport and mitigates swelling stress; meanwhile, it results in formation of abundant defects and heterojunctions, allowing for increased lithium storage active sites and reduced lithium diffusion barrier. The CZTSSe delivers a high specific capacity of up to 2266&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1; while, maintaining a stable output of 116&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1. It also demonstrates remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance, retaining 987&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even after 600 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. When employed in full cells, a high specific energy of 562&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved, rivalling many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art LIBs. This research offers valuable insights into the design of LIB electrodes leveraging multiple lithium storage mechanisms.

         <title>Accelerated Engineering of ELP&#8208;Based Materials through Hybrid Biomimetic&#8208;De Novo Predictive Molecular Design</title>

         <dc:description>
Through a novel hybrid biomimetic design using elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs), this study accelerates de novo protein material engineering. This work combines computational modeling, deep learning, and genetic engineering to create ELP variants that maintain structural integrity and demonstrate controllable self&#8208;assembly. This method offers a versatile template for the design of novel structural proteins and broadening their applications.








Abstract
Efforts to engineer high&#8208;performance protein&#8208;based materials inspired by nature have mostly focused on altering naturally occurring sequences to confer the desired functionalities, whereas de novo design lags significantly behind and calls for unconventional innovative approaches. Here, using partially disordered elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) as initial building blocks this work shows that de novo engineering of protein materials can be accelerated through hybrid biomimetic design, which this work achieves by integrating computational modeling, deep neural network, and recombinant DNA technology. This generalizable approach involves incorporating a series of de novo&#8208;designed sequences with &#945;&#8208;helical conformation and genetically encoding them into biologically inspired intrinsically disordered repeating motifs. The new ELP variants maintain structural conformation and showed tunable supramolecular self&#8208;assembly out of thermal equilibrium with phase behavior in vitro. This work illustrates the effective translation of the predicted molecular designs in structural and functional materials. The proposed methodology can be applied to a broad range of partially disordered biomacromolecules and potentially pave the way toward the discovery of novel structural proteins.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Control of Liquid&#8211;Liquid Crystalline Phase Separation by Depletion Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different sizes of nanoparticles with concentration gradients control the liquid&#8211;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) speed and induce different morphologies of tactoids with positional order. Nanoparticles can be templated by LLCPS via size selectivity effects inside and on the surface of tactoids, enabling unprecedented spatial characterization of the structure of the tactoids.








Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning nucleation and growth of colloidal liquid crystalline (LC) droplets, also known as tactoids, is highly desirable in both fundamental science and technological applications. However, the tactoid structure results from the trade&#8208;off between thermodynamics and nonequilibrium kinetics effects, and controlling liquid&#8211;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) in these systems is still a work in progress. Here, a single&#8208;step strategy is introduced to obtain a rich palette of morphologies for tactoids formed via nucleation and growth within an initially isotropic phase exposed to a gradient of depletants. The simultaneous appearance is shown of rich LC structures along the depleting potential gradient, where the position of each LC structure is correlated with the magnitude of the depleting potential. Changing the size (nanoparticles) or the nature (polymers) of the depleting agent provides additional, precise control over the resulting LC structures through a size&#8208;selective mechanism, where the depletant may be found both within and outside the LC droplets. The use of depletion gradients from depletants of varying sizes and nature offers a powerful toolbox for manipulation, templating, imaging, and understanding heterogeneous colloidal LC structures.

         <title>Seeding Atomic Silver into Internal Lattice Sites of Transition Metal Oxide for Advanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates how the internal lattice sites of transition metal oxide, more specifically, MnO2, can be utilized for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) by accommodating atomic Ag catalysts within its sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel space. A dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst featuring faceted Ag nanoparticles on MnO2 surface and atomic Ag strings within MnO2 tunnels is thus designed with high eCO2RR performance.








Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are widely studied for loading of various catalysts due to their low cost and high structure flexibility. However, the prevailing close&#8208;packed nature of most TMOs crystals has restricted the available loading sites to surface only, while their internal bulk lattice remains unactuated due to the inaccessible narrow space that blocks out most key reactants and/or particulate catalysts. Herein, using tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2, this study demonstrates how TMO's internal lattice space can be activated as extra loading sites for atomic Ag in addition to the conventional surface&#8208;only loading, via which a dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst within MnO2 skeleton is established. In this design, not only faceted Ag nanoparticles are confined onto MnO2 surface by coherent lattice&#8208;sharing, Ag atomic strings are also seeded deep into the sub&#8208;nanoscale MnO2 tunnel lattice, enriching the catalytically active sites. Tested for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), such dual&#8208;form catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (94%), yield (67.3&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and durability (&#8776;48&#160;h) for CO production, exceeding commercial Ag nanoparticles and most Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal the concurrent effect of such dual&#8208;form catalyst featuring facet&#8208;dependent eCO2RR for Ag nanoparticles and lattice&#8208;confined eCO2RR for Ag atomic strings, inspiring the future design of catalyst&#8211;substrate configuration.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Driven High&#8208;Performance Metabolic Assay for Diagnosis and Therapeutic Evaluation of Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance platform based on vacancy&#8208;engineered Co3O4 for rapid diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression is developed. The vacancy&#8208;engineered nanoparticles enable up to 20&#8208;fold signal amplification compared to commercial products, featured by superior photoelectric response and photothermal properties. This platform achieves superior diagnostic performance for depression (AUC: 0.941&#8211;0.980; Accuracy: 92%&#8722;94%), driving progress in advanced matrices toward precision medicine.








Abstract
Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and is a well&#8208;known risk factor for suicide, characterized by low overall efficacy (&lt;50%) and high relapse rate (40%). A rapid and objective approach for screening and prognosis of depression is highly desirable but still awaits further development. Herein, a high&#8208;performance metabolite&#8208;based assay to aid the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression by developing a vacancy&#8208;engineered cobalt oxide (Vo&#8208;Co3O4) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer platform is presented. The easy&#8208;prepared nanoparticles with optimal vacancy achieve a considerable signal enhancement, characterized by favorable charge transfer and increased photothermal conversion. The optimized Vo&#8208;Co3O4 allows for a direct and robust record of plasma metabolic fingerprints (PMFs). Through machine learning of PMFs, high&#8208;performance depression diagnosis is achieved, with the areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.941&#8211;0.980 and an accuracy of over 92%. Furthermore, a simplified diagnostic panel for depression is established, with a desirable AUC value of 0.933. Finally, proline levels are quantified in a follow&#8208;up cohort of depressive patients, highlighting the potential of metabolite quantification in the therapeutic evaluation of depression. This work promotes the progression of advanced matrixes and brings insights into the management of depression.

         <title>Deep Learning Prediction of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Parameters in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) decay model is implemented and deep learning (DL) model for the prediction of kinetic coefficients is developed using the new TTA model, which DL model presented superior predictability by obtaining determination coefficient value of 0.992 and 0.999 of the TTA rate coefficient and TTA ratio.








Abstract
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) ratio and the rate coefficient (kTT) of TTA are key factors in estimating the contribution of triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons in fluorescent TTA organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. In this study, deep learning models are implemented to predict key factors from transient electroluminescence (trEL) data using new numerical equations. A new TTA model is developed that considers both polaron and exciton dynamics, enabling the distinction between prompt and delayed singlet decays with a fundamental understanding of the mechanism. In addition, deep learning models for predicting the kinetic coefficients and TTA ratio are established. After comprehensive optimization inspired by photophysics, determination coefficient values of 0.992 and 0.999 are achieved in the prediction of kTT and TTA ratio, respectively, indicating a nearly perfect prediction. The contribution of each kinetic parameter of polaron and exciton dynamics to the trEL curve is discussed using various deep&#8208;learning models.

     alt="Deep Learning Prediction of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Parameters in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light-Emitting Diodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advanced triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) decay model is implemented and deep learning (DL) model for the prediction of kinetic coefficients is developed using the new TTA model, which DL model presented superior predictability by obtaining determination coefficient value of 0.992 and 0.999 of the TTA rate coefficient and TTA ratio.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) ratio and the rate coefficient (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;TT&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) of TTA are key factors in estimating the contribution of triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons in fluorescent TTA organic light-emitting diodes. In this study, deep learning models are implemented to predict key factors from transient electroluminescence (trEL) data using new numerical equations. A new TTA model is developed that considers both polaron and exciton dynamics, enabling the distinction between prompt and delayed singlet decays with a fundamental understanding of the mechanism. In addition, deep learning models for predicting the kinetic coefficients and TTA ratio are established. After comprehensive optimization inspired by photophysics, determination coefficient values of 0.992 and 0.999 are achieved in the prediction of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;TT&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and TTA ratio, respectively, indicating a nearly perfect prediction. The contribution of each kinetic parameter of polaron and exciton dynamics to the trEL curve is discussed using various deep-learning models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Venus Flytrap&#8208;Inspired Data&#8208;Center&#8208;Free Fast&#8208;Responsive Soft Robots Enabled by 2D Ni3(HITP)2 MOF and Graphite</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by Venus flytraps, soft robots without data centers, capable of active stimuli sensing, computing, and reacting, are presented, based on a power modulation strategy. This robot achieves mechanoelectrical transduction through Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an ultralow time delay (256&#160;ns) and Joule&#8208;heating&#8208;effect&#8208;based graphite electromechanical actuation. Soft robots with symmetrical reacting and asymmetrical reacting are also created.








Abstract
The rapid and responsive capabilities of soft robots in perceiving, assessing, and reacting to environmental stimuli are highly valuable. However, many existing soft robots, designed to mimic humans and other higher animals, often rely on data centers for the modulation of mechanoelectrical transduction and electromechanical actuation. This reliance significantly increases system complexity and time delays. Herein, drawing inspiration from Venus flytraps, a soft robot employing a power modulation strategy is presented for active stimulus reaction, eliminating the need for a data center. This robot achieves mechanoelectrical transduction through Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an ultralow time delay (256&#160;ns) and electromechanical actuation via graphite. The Joule heating effect in graphite is effectively modulated by Ni3(HITP)2 before and after the presence of pressure, thus enabling the stimulus reaction of soft robots. As demonstrated, three soft robots are created: low&#8208;level edge tongue robots, Venus flytrap robots, and high&#8208;level nerve&#8208;center&#8208;controlled dragonfly robots. This power modulation strategy inspires designs of edge soft robots and high&#8208;level robots with a human&#8208;like effective fusion of conditioned and unconditioned reflexes.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layered Hollow Mesoporous Cuprous Oxide Nanoparticles for Double Drug Sequential Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the resistance of traditional tumor therapies resulting from cancer stem cells (CSCs), a strategy of double drug sequential therapy, i.e., one drug for differentiation therapy of CSCs and another drug for subsequent traditional therapy of non&#8208;CSCs, was proposed&#160;and then realized based on double&#8208;layered hollow mesoporous cuprous oxide nanoparticles in this study.








Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are one of the determinants of tumor heterogeneity and are characterized by self&#8208;renewal, high tumorigenicity, invasiveness, and resistance to various therapies. To overcome the resistance of traditional tumor therapies resulting from CSCs, a strategy of double drug sequential therapy (DDST) for CSC&#8208;enriched tumors is proposed in this study and is realized utilizing the developed double&#8208;layered hollow mesoporous cuprous oxide nanoparticles (DL&#8208;HMCONs). The high drug&#8208;loading contents of camptothecin (CPT) and all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) demonstrate that the DL&#8208;HMCON can be used as a generic drug delivery system. ATRA and CPT can be sequentially loaded in and released from CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA. The DDST mechanisms of CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA for CSC&#8208;containing tumors are demonstrated as follows: 1) the first release of ATRA from the outer layer induces differentiation from CSCs with high drug resistance to non&#8208;CSCs with low drug resistance; 2) the second release of CPT from the inner layer causes apoptosis of non&#8208;CSCs; and 3) the third release of Cu+ from DL&#8208;HMCON itself triggers the Fenton&#8208;like reaction and glutathione depletion, resulting in ferroptosis of non&#8208;CSCs. This CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA is verified to possess high DDST efficacy for CSC&#8208;enriched tumors with high biosafety.

         <title>2D Free&#8208;Standing GeS1&#8722;xSex with Composition&#8208;Tunable Bandgap for Tailored Polarimetric Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex nanoplates are grown by low&#8208;pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD). Tailored polarimetric optoelectronic properties of GeS1&#8722;xSex&#8208;based devices are achieved under the modulation of composition&#8208;dependent electronic band structure. These results verify that free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex nanoplates possess promising potential in tailored polarimetric optoelectronics and type&#8208;III heterostructure phototransistors with tunable electrical properties.








Abstract
Germanium&#8208;based monochalcogenides (i.e., GeS and GeSe) with desirable properties are promising candidates for the development of next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. However, they are still stuck with challenges, such as relatively fixed electronic band structure, unconfigurable optoelectronic characteristics, and difficulty in achieving free&#8208;standing growth. Herein, it is demonstrated that two&#8208;dimensional (2D) free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex (0 &#8804; x &#8804;&#8201;1) nanoplates can be grown by low&#8208;pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD), fulfilling a continuously composition&#8208;tunable optical bandgap and electronic band structure. By leveraging the synergistic effect of composition&#8208;dependent modulation and free&#8208;standing growth, GeS1&#8722;xSex&#8208;based optoelectronic devices exhibit significantly configurable hole mobility from 6.22 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 1.24 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8315;1 and tunable responsivity from 8.6 to 311 A&#160;W&#8722;1 (635&#160;nm), as x varies from 0 to 1. Furthermore, the polarimetric sensitivity can be tailored from 4.3 (GeS0.29Se0.71) to 1.8 (GeSe) benefiting from alloy engineering. Finally, the tailored imaging capability is also demonstrated to show the application potential of GeS1&#8722;xSex alloy nanoplates. This work broadens the functionality of conventional binary materials and motivates the development of tailored polarimetric optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Tailoring the Coordination Micro&#8208;Environment in Nanotraps for Efficient Platinum/Palladium Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise tailoring of the coordination micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of nanotraps specifically targeting platinum, facilitating the separation of binary platinum group metals (platinum/palladium). This advancement allows for the sequential and convenient acquisition of pure palladium outflow from a binary mixture of platinum and palladium via breakthrough experiments.








Abstract
Recovering platinum group metals from secondary resources is crucial to meet the growing demand for high&#8208;tech applications. Various techniques are explored, and adsorption using porous materials has emerged as a promising technology due to its efficient performance and environmental beingness. However, the challenge lies in effectively recovering and separating individual platinum group metals (PGMs) given their similar chemical properties. Herein, a breakthrough approach is presented by sophisticatedly tailoring the coordination micro&#8208;environment in a series of aminopyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymers, which enables the creation of platinum&#8208;specific nanotraps for efficient separation of binary PGMs (platinum/palladium).

     alt="Tailoring the Coordination Micro-Environment in Nanotraps for Efficient Platinum/Palladium Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise tailoring of the coordination micro-environment enables the creation of nanotraps specifically targeting platinum, facilitating the separation of binary platinum group metals (platinum/palladium). This advancement allows for the sequential and convenient acquisition of pure palladium outflow from a binary mixture of platinum and palladium via breakthrough experiments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovering platinum group metals from secondary resources is crucial to meet the growing demand for high-tech applications. Various techniques are explored, and adsorption using porous materials has emerged as a promising technology due to its efficient performance and environmental beingness. However, the challenge lies in effectively recovering and separating individual platinum group metals (PGMs) given their similar chemical properties. Herein, a breakthrough approach is presented by sophisticatedly tailoring the coordination micro-environment in a series of aminopyridine-based porous organic polymers, which enables the creation of platinum-specific nanotraps for efficient separation of binary PGMs (platinum/palladium). The newly synthesized POP-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;2NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Py demonstrates record uptakes and selectivity toward platinum over palladium, with the amino groups adjacent to the pyridine moieties being vital in improving platinum binding performance. Further breakthrough experiments underline its remarkable ability to separate platinum and palladium. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that POP-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;2NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Py offers a more favorable coordination fashion to platinum ions compared to palladium ions owing to the greater interaction between N and Pt&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and stronger intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amino groups and four coordinating chlorines at platinum. These findings underscore the importance of fine-tuning the coordination micro-environment of nanotraps through subtle modifications that can greatly enhance the selectivity toward the desired metal ions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Closed Twisted Hydrogel Ribbons with Self&#8208;Sustained Motions under Static Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of M&#246;bius strip and Seifert ribbon robots are devised by using identical slender muscle&#8208;like anisotropic hydrogel. These closed twisted ribbon hydrogels exhibit continuous flipping and rotation under static light irradiation. The self&#8208;sustainability of hydrogel robots arises from the synergy of fast response of the gel, self&#8208;shadowing effect, and geometry&#8208;facilitated refresh of the light&#8208;exposed regions.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sustained motions are widespread in biological systems by harvesting energy from surrounding environments, which inspire scientists to develop autonomous soft robots. However, most&#8208;existing soft robots require dynamic heterogeneous stimuli or complex fabrication with different components. Recently, control of topological geometry has been promising to afford soft robots with physical intelligence and thus life&#8208;like motions. Reported here are a series of closed twisted ribbon robots, which exhibit self&#8208;sustained flipping and rotation under constant light irradiation. Both M&#246;bius strip and Seifert ribbon robots are devised for the first time by using an identical hydrogel, which responds to light irradiation on either side. Experiment and simulation results indicate that the self&#8208;regulated motions of the hydrogel robots are related to fast and reversible response of muscle&#8208;like gel, self&#8208;shadowing effect, and topology&#8208;facilitated refresh of light&#8208;exposed regions. The motion speeds and directions of the hydrogel robots can be tuned over a wide range. These closed twisted ribbon hydrogels are further applied to execute specific tasks in aqueous environments, such as collecting plastic balls, climbing a vertical rod, and transporting objects. This work presents new design principle for autonomous hydrogel robots by benefiting from material response and topology geometry, which may be inspirative for the robotics community.

         <title>Sensitized Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in Nanostructured Polymeric Scintillators Allows for Pulse Shape Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured polymer scintillators embedding liquid nanodomains where triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation dye capable and a triplet sensitizer are dissolved allow discriminating &#945;&#160;particles, neutrons, and &#947;&#8208;rays with a better time response than commercial scintillators.








Abstract
Scintillating materials emit light when exposed to ionizing radiation or particles and are used for the detection of nuclear threats, medical imaging, high&#8208;energy physics, and other usages. For some of these applications, it is vital to distinguish neutrons and charged particles from &#947;&#8208;rays. This is achievable by pulse shape discrimination (PSD), a time&#8208;gated technique, which exploits that the scintillation kinetics can depend on the nature of the incident radiation. However, it proves difficult to realize efficient PSD with plastic scintillators, which have several advantages over liquid or crystalline scintillating materials, including mechanical robustness and shapeability. It is shown here that sensitive and rapid PSD is possible with nanostructured polymer scintillators that consist of a solid polymer matrix and liquid nanodomains in which an organic dye capable of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is dissolved. The liquid nature of the nanodomains renders TTA highly efficient so that delayed fluorescence can occur at low energy density. The nanostructured polymer scintillators allow discriminating &#945; particles, neutrons, and &#947;&#8208;rays with a time response that is better than that of commercial scintillators. Exploiting that the liquid nanodomains can facilitate energy transfer processes otherwise difficult to realize in solid polymers, an auxiliary triplet sensitizer is incorporated. This approach further increases the scintillator's sensitivity toward &#945; particles and neutrons and other high&#8208;energy processes where localized interactions are involved.

         <title>Formation of 2D Amorphous Lithium Sulfide Enabled by Mo2C Clusters Loaded Carbon Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of trending a shift in the configuration of lithium sulfide toward an amorphous structure is first proposed by using a leaf&#8208;like carbon scaffold (LCS) with the modification of Mo2C cluster (Mo2C@LCS) as a sulfur host. It is revealed that the formation of amorphous lithium sulfides shows significantly improved kinetics for lithium sulfides deposition and decomposition.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, operated through the interconversion between sulfur and solid&#8208;state lithium sulfide, are regarded as next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the sluggish kinetics of lithium sulfide deposition/dissolution, caused by its insoluble and insulated nature, hampers the practical use of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, leaf&#8208;like carbon scaffold (LCS) with the modification of Mo2C clusters (Mo2C@LCS) is reported as host material of sulfur powder. During cycles, the dissociative Mo ions at the Mo2C@LCS/electrolyte interface are detected to exhibit competitive binding energy with Li ions for lithium sulfide anions, which disrupts the deposition behavior of crystalline lithium sulfide and trends a shift in the configuration of lithium sulfide toward an amorphous structure. Combining the related electrochemical study and first&#8208;principle calculation, it is revealed that the formation of amorphous lithium sulfides shows significantly improved kinetics for lithium sulfide deposition and decomposition. As a result, the obtained Mo2C@LCS/S cathode shows an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.015% per cycle at a high mass loading of 9.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 after 700 cycles. More strikingly, an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 61.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can also be achieved. This work defines an efficacious strategy to advance the commercialization of Mo2C@LCS host for Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Polarization Saturation in Multilayered Interfacial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that rhombohedral layers of binary compounds exhibit polarization saturation beyond a critical stack thickness. The underlying saturation mechanism points to a purely electronic redistribution involving bandgap closure that allows for cross&#8208;stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge. The findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals polytypes of broken inversion and mirror symmetries &#160;have been recently shown to exhibit switchable electric polarization even at the ultimate two&#8208;layer thin limit. Their out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization has been found to accumulate in a ladder&#8208;like fashion with each successive layer, offering 2D building blocks for the bottom&#8208;up construction of 3D ferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated experimentally that beyond a critical stack thickness, the accumulated polarization in rhombohedral polytypes of molybdenum disulfide saturates. The underlying saturation mechanism, deciphered via density functional theory and self&#8208;consistent Poisson&#8211;Schr&#246;dinger calculations, point to a purely electronic redistribution involving: 1.&#160;Polarization&#8208;induced bandgap closure that allows for cross&#8208;stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge; 2. Reduction of the polarization saturation value, as well as the critical thickness at which it is obtained, by the presence of free carriers. The resilience of polar layered structures to atomic surface reconstruction, which is essentially unavoidable in polar 3D crystals, potentially allows for the design of new devices with mobile surface charges. The findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Centric MOCVD Enabled Synthetic Approaches for Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Tin Selenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With phase&#8208;tailored synthetic strategies, wafer&#8208;scale production of tin selenides in the 2D limit is achieved via a low&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process. Directly grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 exhibits outstanding crystallinity and tunable thickness, and SnSe, which has intrinsic limitations for 2D film growth, can be prepared via a phase transition, thereby retaining all of the advantages in the MOCVD&#8208;grown product.








Abstract
Following an initial nucleation stage at the flake level, atomically thin film growth of a van der Waals material is promoted by ultrafast lateral growth and prohibited vertical growth. To produce these highly anisotropic films, synthetic or post&#8208;synthetic modifications are required, or even a combination of both, to ensure large&#8208;area, pure&#8208;phase, and low&#8208;temperature deposition. A set of synthetic strategies is hereby presented to selectively produce wafer&#8208;scale tin selenides, SnSex (both x&#160;=&#160;1 and 2), in the 2D forms. The 2D&#8208;SnSe2 films with tuneable thicknesses are directly grown via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at 200&#160;&#176;C, and they exhibit outstanding crystallinities and phase homogeneities and consistent film thickness across the entire wafer. This is enabled by excellent control of the volatile metal&#8211;organic precursors and decoupled dual&#8208;temperature regimes for high&#8208;temperature ligand cracking and low&#8208;temperature growth. In contrast, SnSe, which intrinsically inhibited from 2D growth, is indirectly prepared by a thermally driven phase transition of an as&#8208;grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 film with all the benefits of the MOCVD technique. It is accompanied by the electronic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type crossover at the wafer scale. These tailor&#8208;made synthetic routes will accelerate the low&#8208;thermal&#8208;budget production of multiphase 2D materials in a reliable and scalable fashion.

         <title>Strong Interaction between Titanium Carbonitride Embedded in Mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers and Pt Enables Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium carbonitride embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (m&#8208;TiCN NFs) are developed as alternative support materials for electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from internal interpenetrating conductive pathways within the one&#8208;dimensional m&#8208;TiCN NFs and the strong interaction between m&#8208;TiCN NFs and platinum (Pt), m&#8208;TiCN NFs&#8208;supported Pt catalysts show superior durability in both rotating disk electrode and fuel cell tests.








Abstract
Platinum (Pt) supported on high surface area carbon has been the most widely used electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). However, conventional carbon supports are susceptible to corrosion at high potentials, leading to severe degradation of electrochemical performance. In this work, titanium carbonitride embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (m&#8208;TiCN NFs) are reported as a promising alternative to address this issue. Benefiting from the interpenetrating conductive pathways inside the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures and the embedded TiCN nanoparticles (NPs), m&#8208;TiCN NFs exhibit excellent stability at high potentials and interact strongly with Pt NPs. Subsequently, m&#8208;TiCN NFs&#8208;supported Pt NPs deliver remarkably enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability, with negligible activity decay and less than 5% loss of electrochemical surface area&#65288;ECSA&#65289; after 50&#160;000 cycles. Moreover, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst delivers a maximum power density of 1.22&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and merely 3% loss after 30&#160;000 cycles of accelerated durability tests under U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) protocols. The improved ORR activity and durability are attributed to the superior corrosion resistance of the m&#8208;TiCN NF support and the strong interaction between Pt and m&#8208;TiCN NFs.

         <title>Triboelectric Basalt Textiles Efficiently Operating within an Ultrawide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a thermally stabilized triboelectric basalt textile capable of operating in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C to 520&#160;&#176;C. Applications of wearable extreme temperature alarms and self&#8208;powered temperature recognition are demonstrated under extreme cold and hot environments, showing their possible use in high and low latitudes, high altitudes, deserts, and even space settings.








Abstract
With the continuous upsurge in demand for wearable energy, nanogenerators are increasingly required to operate under extreme environmental conditions. Even though they are at the cutting edge of technology, nanogenerators have difficulty producing high&#8208;quality electrical output at very extreme temperatures. Here, a triboelectric basalt textile (TBT) with an ultrawide operational temperature range (from &#8722;196 to 520&#160;&#176;C) is created employing basalt material as the main body. The output power density of the TBT, in contrast to most conventional nanogenerators, would counterintuitively rise by 2.3 times to 740.6&#160;mW m&#8722;2 after heating to 100&#160;&#176;C because the high temperature will enhance the material's interface polarization and electronic kinetic energy. The TBT retains &#8776;55% of its initial electrical output even after heating in the flame of an alcohol lamp (520&#160;&#176;C). Surprisingly, the TBTs output voltage may retain over 85% of its initial value even after submerging in liquid nitrogen. The TBTs exceptional resistance to heat and cold indicates its possible use in high and low latitudes, high altitudes, deserts, and even space settings.

         <title>Bisphosphonate&#8208;Anchored Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Larger Dipole Moments for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Excellent Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to obtain self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) with good wettability, adsorbability, and compactness, three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs are designed and synthesized with different dipole moments, namely IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3. The inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibited a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for PSCs based on multipodal SAMs.








Abstract
In the fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the wettability, adsorbability, and compactness of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on conductive substrates have critical impacts on the quality of the perovskite films and the defects at the buried perovskite&#8208;substrate interface, which control the efficiency and stability of the devices. Herein, three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs, IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3, are designed and synthesized by modulating the position of the two nitrogen atoms of the IDCz unit to improve the molecular dipole moments and strengthen the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Regulating the work functions (WF) of FTO electrodes through molecular dipole moments and energy levels, the perovskite band bends upwards with a small offset for ITO/IDCz&#8208;3/perovskite, thereby promoting hole extraction and blocking electrons. As a result, the inverted PSC employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibits a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for the multipodal SAMs&#8208;based PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device with IDCz&#8208;3 can be stored for at least 1800 h with little degradation in performance.

         <title>Inhibiting Residual Solvent Induced Side Reactions in Vinylidene Fluoride&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolytes Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The side reactions by the residual solvents of VDF&#8208;based SPE with the lithium (Li) metal induce poor stability, which has been long neglected. In this study, a strategy is developed to suppress the side interfacial reactions between the residual solvent and electrodes using a fluorinated solvent, FDMA, for a PVHF&#8208;based SPE. This study offers valuable insights into developing advanced VDF&#8208;based SPEs for enhanced lithium metal battery performance and longevity.








Abstract
Residual solvents in vinylidene fluoride (VDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have been recognized as responsible for their high ionic conductivity. However, side reactions by the residual solvents with the lithium (Li) metal induce poor stability, which has been long neglected. This study proposes a strategy to achieve a delicate equilibrium between ion conduction and electrode stability for VDF&#8208;based SPEs. Specifically, 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (FDMA) is developed as the nonside reaction solvent for poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVHF)&#8208;based SPEs, achieving both high ionic conductivity and significantly improved electrochemical stability. The developed FDMA solvent fosters the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) through interface reactions with Li metal, effectively mitigating side reactions and dendrite growth on the Li metal electrode. Consequently, the Li||Li symmetric cells and Li||LiFePO4 cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, even under limited Li (20&#160;&#181;m thick) supply and high&#8208;loading cathodes (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, capacity &gt;1 mAh cm&#8722;2) conditions. The stable Li||LiCoO2 cells operation with a cutoff voltage of 4.48&#160;V indicates the high&#8208;voltage stability of the developed SPE. This study offers valuable insights into the development of advanced VDF&#8208;based SPEs for enhanced lithium metal battery performance and longevity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Hydrogels with Structural and Fluorescent Colors toward Multistage Secure Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rigid self&#8208;assembled lamellar structures provide restricted domains wherein flexible hydrogels are interspersed to form structural color. The introduction of fluorescent monomer as a complex site coordinates with lanthanide metal ions resulting multiple fluorescent colors. This resultant dual&#8208;mode hydrogel with both independently tunable structural and fluorescent colors has the potential to be used as multistage information encryption.








Abstract
Constructing an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with non&#8208;interference dual optical modes is an effective way to improve information security. However, it remains challenging to achieve multistage secure information encryption due to the limited stimulus responsiveness and color tunability of the current dual&#8208;mode materials. Herein, a dual&#8208;mode hydrogel with both independently tunable structural and fluorescent colors toward multistage information encryption, is reported. In this hydrogel system, the rigid lamellar structure of poly(dodecylglyceryl itaconate) (pDGI) formed by shear flow&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly provides the restricted domains wherein monomers undergo polymerization to form a hydrogel network, producing structural color. The introduction of fluorescent monomer 6&#8208;acrylamidopicolinate (6APA) as a complexation site provides the possibility of fluorescent color formation. The hydrogel's angle&#8208;dependent structural color can be controlled by adjusting the crosslinking density and water content. Additionally, the fluorescence color can be modulated by adjusting the ratio of lanthanide ions. Information of dual&#8208;mode can be displayed separately in different channels and synergistically overlayed to read the ultimate message. Thus, a multistage information encryption system based on this hydrogel is devised through the programed decryption process. This strategy holds tremendous potential as a platform for encrypting and safeguarding valuable and authentic information in the field of anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Acoustic Metagrating Holograms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D space is studied. Through this analysis, a series of holograms generated by dual&#8208;layer acoustic metagratings is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently.








Abstract
Metasurface holograms represent a common category of metasurface devices that utilize in&#8208;plane phase gradients to shape wavefronts, forming holographic images through the application of the generalized Snell's law (GSL). While conventional metasurfaces focus solely on phase gradients, metagratings, which incorporate higher&#8208;order wave diffraction, further expand the GSL's generality. Recent advances in certain acoustic metagratings demonstrate an updated GSL extension capable of reversing anomalous transmission and reflection, whose reversal is characterized by the parity of the number of wave propagation trips through the metagrating. However, the current extension of GSL remains limited to 1D metagratings, unable to access 2D holographic images in 3D spaces. Here, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D spaces is investigated. Through this analysis, a series of acoustic metagrating holograms is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently. This study introduces an additional dimension to modern holography design and metasurface wavefront manipulation.

W doping induces a spontaneous phase transition from stable phase cubic CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) to metastable phase orthorhombic CoSe2. The nanoflower&#8208;shaped W&#8208;doped cubic/orthorhombic phase&#8208;mixed CoSe2 catalyst benefits from Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W active species formed on the c&#8208;CoSe2 side of the phase interface and abundant phase interfaces, exhibiting Pt&#8208;like HER activity and outstanding stability in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective transition metal chalcogenides are highly promising electrocatalysts for both alkaline and acidic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). However, unsatisfactory HER kinetics and stability have severely hindered their applications in industrial water electrolysis. Herein, a nanoflowers&#8208;shaped W&#8208;doped cubic/orthorhombic phase&#8208;mixed CoSe2 catalyst ((c/o)&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;W) is reported. The W doping induces spontaneous phase transition from stable phase cubic CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) to metastable phase orthorhombic CoSe2, which not only enables precise regulation of the ratio of two phases but also realizes W doping at the interfaces of two phases. The (c/o)&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;W catalyst exhibits a Pt&#8208;like HER activity in both alkaline and acidic media, with record&#8208;low HER overpotentials of 29.8&#160;mV (alkaline) and 35.9&#160;mV (acidic) at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, surpassing the vast majority of previously reported non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for both alkaline and acidic HER. The Pt&#8208;like HER activities originate from the formation of Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W active species on the c&#8208;CoSe2 side at the phase interface, which effectively modulates electron structures of active sites, not only enhancing H2O adsorption and dissociation at Co sites but also optimizing H* adsorption to &#916;GH*&#160;&#8776;&#160;0 at W sites. Benefiting from the abundant phase interfaces, the catalyst also displays outstanding long&#8208;term durability in both acidic and alkaline media.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembled Nanoparticles toward Multi&#8208;Target Combinational Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Making Full Use of Molecular Recognition and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

Herein a novel supramolecular integration strategy based on molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly is proposed for the multi&#8208;target combinational therapy of Alzheimer's disease, and its feasibility and tunability are validated taking the combination of &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibrillization and oxidative stress as the representative in this work, which provides a convenient platform for constructing such multifunctional integrated system toward complex disease treatment.








Abstract
The complex pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely limit the effectiveness of single&#8208;target pharmic interventions, thus necessitating multi&#8208;pronged therapeutic strategies. While flexibility is essentially demanded in constructing such multi&#8208;target systems, for achieving optimal synergies and also accommodating the inherent heterogeneity within AD. Utilizing the dynamic reversibility of supramolecular strategy for conferring sufficient tunability in component substitution and proportion adjustment, amphiphilic calixarenes are poised to be a privileged molecular tool for facilely achieving function integration. Herein, taking &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrillation and oxidative stress as model combination pattern, a supramolecular multifunctional integration is proposed by co&#8208;assembling guanidinium&#8208;modified calixarene with ascorbyl palmitate and loading dipotassium phytate within calixarene cavity. Serial pivotal events can be simultaneously addressed by this versatile system, including 1) inhibition of A&#946; production and aggregation, 2) disintegration of A&#946; fibrils, 3) acceleration of A&#946; metabolic clearance, and 4) regulation of oxidative stress, which is verified to significantly ameliorate the cognitive impairment of 5&#215;FAD mice, with reduced A&#946; plaque content, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Confronted with the extremely intricate clinical realities of AD, the strategy presented here exhibits ample adaptability for necessary alterations on combinations, thereby may immensely expedite the advancement of AD combinational therapy through providing an exceptionally convenient platform.

         <title>Multilaminate Energy Storage Films from Entropy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly empowers the creation of highly ordered lamellar organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular nanocomposite films, which display remarkably enhanced performance compared to unstructured composites when employed for electrostatic energy storage. This work highlights the central role of oriented nanoparticle&#8208;rich lamella in manipulating dielectric properties and electrostatic energy storage performance, offering a design concept for exploiting high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer nanocomposite films.








Abstract
Composite materials comprising polymers and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) are promising for energy storage applications, though challenges in controlling NP dispersion often result in performance bottlenecks. Realizing nanocomposites with controlled NP locations and distributions within polymer microdomains is highly desirable for improving energy storage capabilities but is a persistent challenge, impeding the in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8211;performance relationship. In this study, a facile entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach is employed to fabricate block copolymer&#8208;based supramolecular nanocomposite films with highly ordered lamellar structures, which are then used in electrostatic film capacitors. The oriented interfacial barriers and well&#8208;distributed inorganic NPs within the self&#8208;assembled multilaminate nanocomposites effectively suppress leakage current and mitigate the risk of breakdown, showing superior dielectric strength compared to their disordered counterparts. Consequently, the lamellar nanocomposite films with optimized composition exhibit high energy efficiency (&gt;90% at 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1), along with remarkable energy density and power density. Moreover, finite element simulations and statistical modeling have provided theoretical insights into the impact of the lamellar structure on electrical conduction, electric field distribution, and electrical tree propagation. This work marks a significant advancement in the design of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids for energy storage, establishing a well&#8208;defined correlation between microstructure and performance.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Modulating of Ionic AIE Photosensitizers for Enhanced ROS Generation and NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation induced emission photosensitizer, DTP&#8208;In, is constructed with strong dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) donor and indolium (In) acceptor, achieving redshift in absorption and emission wavelength and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate simultaneously. DTP&#8208;In can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoaggregates in aqueous solutions and specifically target to the mitochondria, leading to enhanced photodynamic therapy effect under 660 nm laser irradiation.








Abstract
Photosensitizers (PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics are competitive candidates for bioimaging and therapeutic applications. However, their short emission wavelength and nonspecific organelle targeting hinder their therapeutic effectiveness. Herein, a donor&#8211;acceptor modulation approach is reported to construct a series of ionic AIE photosensitizers with enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes and fluorescent emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. By employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) and indolium (In) as the strong donor and acceptor, respectively, the compound DTP&#8208;In exhibits a substantial redshift in absorption and fluorescent emission reach to NIR&#8208;II region. The reduced energy gap between singlet and triplet states in DTP&#8208;In also increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate. Further, DTP&#8208;In can self&#8208;assemble in aqueous solutions, forming positively charged nanoaggregates, which are superior to conventional encapsulated nanoparticles in cellular uptake and mitochondrial targeting. Consequently, DTP&#8208;In aggregates show efficient photodynamic ablation of 4T1 cancer cells and outstanding tumor theranostic in vivo under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation. This work highlights the potential of molecular engineering of donor&#8211;acceptor AIE PSs with multiple functionalities, thereby facilitating the development of more effective strategies for cancer therapy.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Resistant and Tissue&#8208;Like Artificial Muscles with Low Temperature Activation and High Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial muscle combining crack&#8208;resistance (fracture energy of 33&#8239;720 J m&#8722;2 and fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&#8722;2), tissue&#8208;matched modulus (0.7&#160;MPa), low&#8208;temperature activation (40&#160;&#176;C), and high power density (450&#160;W kg&#8722;1) is created by introducing crystallizable segments and ethylene glycol flexible spacer into a liquid crystalline network, where the crystallization and covalent crosslinking density are finely controlled.








Abstract
Constructing soft robotics with safe human&#8211;machine interactions requires low&#8208;modulus, high&#8208;power&#8208;density artificial muscles that are sensitive to gentle stimuli. In addition, the ability to resist crack propagation during long&#8208;term actuation cycles is essential for a long service life. Herein, a material design is proposed to combine all these desirable attributes in a single artificial muscle platform. The design involves the molecular engineering of a liquid crystalline network with crystallizable segments and an ethylene glycol flexible spacer. A high degree of crystallinity can be afforded by utilizing aza&#8208;Michael chemistry to produce a low covalent crosslinking density, resulting in crack&#8208;insensitivity with a high fracture energy of 33&#160;720 J m&#8722;2 and a high fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&#8722;2. Such crack&#8208;resistant artificial muscle with tissue&#8208;matched modulus of 0.7&#160;MPa can generate a high power density of 450&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at a low temperature of 40&#160;&#176;C. Notably, because of the presence of crystalline domains in the actuated state, no crack propagation is observed after 500 heating&#8211;cooling actuation cycles under a static load of 220&#160;kPa. This study points to a pathway for the creation of artificial muscles merging seemingly disparate, but desirable properties, broadening their application potential in smart devices.

         <title>Less is More: Asymmetric D&#8211;A Type Agent to Achieve Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoaggregates for Long&#8208;Acting Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates that can undergo &#8220;sphere&#8208;to&#8208;rod&#8221; process are constructed here by an asymmetric D&#8211;A type TIBT. The nanoaggregates exhibit high tumor&#8208;targeting, prolonged retention, and favored metabolism by a single effort, finally contributing to long&#8208;acting photodynamic therapy treatment with low dose but high inhibition rate to tumors in vivo.








Abstract
To enhance the phototheranostic performance, agents with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good tumor&#8208;targeting ability, and prolonged retention are urgently needed. However, symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type agents usually produce spherical nanoaggregates, leading to good tumor targeting but inferior retention. Rod&#8208;like nanoaggregates are desired to extend their retention in tumors; however, this remains a challenge. In particular, agents with dynamically changeable shapes that integrate merits of different morphologies are seldomly reported. Therefore, self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates with smart shape tunability are designed here using an asymmetric D&#8211;A type TIBT. The photoluminescence quantum yield in solids is up to 52.24% for TIBT. TIBT also exhibits high ROS generation in corresponding nanoaggregates (TIBT&#8208;NCs). Moreover, dynamic self&#8208;assembly in shape changing from nanospheres to nanorods occurrs in TIBT&#8208;NCs, contributing to the enhancement of ROS quantum yield from 0.55 to 0.72. In addition, dynamic self&#8208;assembly can be observed for both in vitro and in vivo, conferring TIBT&#8208;NCs with strong tumor targeting and prolonged retention. Finally, efficient photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth is achieved in TIBT&#8208;NCs, with an inhibition rate of 90%. This work demonstrates that asymmetric D&#8211;A type agents can play significant roles in forming self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates, thus showing great potential in long&#8208;acting cancer therapy.

         <title>Distinguishing Elements at the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Scale on the Surface of a High Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology capable of distinguishing elements on the surface of a high entropy alloy at sub&#8208;nm scale is presented. This is achieved by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation in the X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurement. The elemental fingerprints are enabled with the XAS while the spatial resolution is achieved using the STM.








Abstract
Materials in crystalline form possess translational symmetry (TS) when the unit cell is repeated in real space with long&#8208; and short&#8208;range orders. The periodic potential in the crystal regulates the electron wave function and results in unique band structures, which further define the physical properties of the materials. Amorphous materials lack TS due to the randomization of distances and arrangements between atoms, causing the electron wave function to lack a well&#8208;defined momentum. High entropy materials provide another way to break the TS by randomizing the potential strength at periodic atomic sites. The local elemental distribution has a great impact on physical properties in high entropy materials. It is critical to distinguish elements at the sub&#8208;nanometer scale to uncover the correlations between the elemental distribution and the material properties. Here, the use of synchrotron X&#8208;ray scanning tunneling microscopy (SX&#8208;STM) with sub&#8208;nm scale resolution in identifying elements on a high entropy alloy (HEA) surface is demonstrated. By examining the elementally sensitive X&#8208;ray absorption spectra with an STM tip to enhance the spatial resolution, the elemental distribution on an HEA's surface at a sub&#8208;nm scale is extracted. These results open a pathway towards&#160;quantitatively&#160;understanding high entropy materials and their material properties.

         <title>All&#8208;Round Passivation Strategy Yield Flexible Perovskite/CuInGaSe2 Tandem Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 26.5%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceeding 26.5%&#8208;efficient all flexible Perovskite/CIGS Tandem solar cell is achieved by all&#8208;round passivation strategy termed Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces which improve film crystallinity and maximize the passivation of defects at various locations within the solar cell structure, effectively minimizing nonradiative recombination losses.








Abstract
The perovskite/Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) tandem solar cells (TSCs) presents a compelling technological combination poised for the next generation of flexible and lightweight photovoltaic (PV) tandem devices, featuring a tunable bandgap, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), lightweight flexibility, and enhanced stability and durability. Over the years, the imperative to enhance the performance of wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has grown significantly, particularly in the context of a flexible tandem device. In this study, an all&#8208;round passivation strategy known as Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces (DPGI) is introduced for WBG PSCs in perovskite/CIGS tandem structures. The implementation of DPGI is tailored to improve film crystallinity and passivate defects across the solar cell structure, leading to a substantial performance enhancement for WBG PSCs. Subsequently, both rigid and flexible tandem devices are assembled. Impressively, a fully flexible 4T perovskite/CIGS TSCs is successfully fabricated with a PCE of 26.57%, making it the highest value in this field and highlighting its potential applications in the next generation of flexible lightweight PV tandem devices.

         <dc:description>
A new design strategy that is structured around all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device is developed to circumvent the critical problem in conventional all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device, which offers personalized devices that exhibit vivid structural colors and dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting, accompanied by fast switching responses and excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
The fusion of electrochromic technology with optical resonant cavities presents an intriguing innovation in the electrochromic field. However, this fusion is mainly achieved in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based or sol&#8211;gel electrolyte&#8208;based electrochromic devices, but not in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, which have broader industrial applications. Here, a new all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device is demonstrated with a metal&#8211;dielectric&#8211;metal (MDM) resonant cavity, which can achieve strong thin&#8208;film interference effects through resonance, enabling the device to achieve unique structural colors that have rarely appeared in reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, such as yellow green, purple, and light red. The color gamut of the device can be further expanded due to the adjustable optical constants of the electrochromic layer. What is more, this device exhibits remarkable cycling stability (maintaining 84% modulation capability after 7200 cycles), rapid switching time (coloration in 2.6 s and bleaching in 2.8 s), and excellent optical memory effect (only increasing by 13.8% after almost 36&#8239;000 s). In addition, this exquisite structural design has dual&#8208;responsive anti&#8208;counterfeiting effects based on voltage and angle, further demonstrating the powerful color modulation capability of this device.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Order in 2D Layers of Transition Metal Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferromagnetic order at the single layer limit of two van der Waals materials based on transition metal dichlorides is probed. XMCD&#160;measurements demonstrate that the ferromagnetic order of FeCl2 and NiCl2 persist on top of a metallic substrate. LT&#8208;STS&#160;experiments, using functionalized tips with an organic magnetic sensor, confirm the magnetic order of the materials at the atomic scale even at zero applied magnetic fields.








Abstract
Magnetism in two dimensions is traditionally considered an exotic phase mediated by spin fluctuations, but far from collinearly ordered in the ground state. Recently, 2D magnetic states have been discovered in layered van der Waals compounds. Their robust and tunable magnetic state by material composition, combined with reduced dimensionality, foresee a strong potential as a key element in magnetic devices. Here, a class of 2D magnets based on metallic chlorides is presented. The magnetic order survives on top of a metallic substrate, even down to the monolayer limit, and can be switched from perpendicular to in&#8208;plane by substituting the metal ion from iron to nickel. Using functionalized STM tips as magnetic sensors, local exchange fields are identified, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Since the compounds are processable by molecular beam epitaxy techniques, they provide a platform with large potential for incorporation into current device&#160;technologies.

Recently, 2D magnetic states have been discovered in layered van der Waals compounds. Their robust and tunable magnetic state by material composition, combined with reduced dimensionality, foresee a strong potential as a key element in magnetic devices. Here, a class of 2D magnets based on metallic chlorides is presented. The magnetic order survives on top of a metallic substrate, even down to the monolayer limit, and can be switched from perpendicular to in-plane by substituting the metal ion from iron to nickel. Using functionalized STM tips as magnetic sensors, local exchange fields are identified, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Since the compounds are processable by molecular beam epitaxy techniques, they provide a platform with large potential for incorporation into current device&#160;technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonlinear Elastic Bottlebrush Polymer Hydrogels Modulate Actomyosin Mediated Protrusion Formation in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear elastic extracellular matrix properties are difficult to recapitulate without the use of fibrous architectures, which couple strain&#8208;stiffening and stress&#8208;relaxation. Herein, bottlebrush polymer hydrogels are used to isolate and tune the strain&#8208;stiffening biomechanical feedback sensed by human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) in non&#8208;fibrous engineered microenvironments. Nonlinear elastic mechanics induces a protrusion&#8208;rich hMSC phenotype regulated by focal adhesions and actomyosin dynamics.








Abstract
The nonlinear elasticity of many tissue&#8208;specific extracellular matrices is difficult to recapitulate without the use of fibrous architectures, which couple strain&#8208;stiffening with stress relaxation. Herein, bottlebrush polymers are synthesized and crosslinked to form poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based hydrogels and used to study how strain&#8208;stiffening behavior affects human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). By tailoring the bottlebrush polymer length, the critical stress associated with the onset of network stiffening is systematically varied, and a unique protrusion&#8208;rich hMSC morphology emerges only at critical stresses within a biologically accessible stress regime. Local cell&#8208;matrix interactions are quantified using 3D traction force microscopy and small molecule inhibitors are used to identify cellular machinery that plays a critical role in hMSC mechanosensing of the engineered, strain&#8208;stiffening microenvironment. Collectively, this study demonstrates how covalently crosslinked bottlebrush polymer hydrogels can recapitulate strain&#8208;stiffening biomechanical cues at biologically relevant stresses and be used to probe how nonlinear elastic matrix properties regulate cellular processes.

         <title>Scalable Approach to Molecular Motor&#8208;Polymer Conjugates for Light&#8208;Driven Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled polymerization allows scalable access to light&#8208;driven artificial muscles based on molecular motors. A combined experimental and computer simulation framework provides deep insights into how chain conformational aspects and density of active motors influence contraction kinetics and load&#8208;lifting capacity.








Abstract
The integration of molecular machines and motors into materials represents a promising avenue for creating dynamic and functional molecular systems, with potential applications in soft robotics or reconfigurable biomaterials. However, the development of truly scalable and controllable approaches for incorporating molecular motors into polymeric matrices has remained a challenge. Here, it is shown that light&#8208;driven molecular motors with sensitive photo&#8208;isomerizable double bonds can be converted into initiators for Cu&#8208;mediated controlled/living radical polymerization enabling the synthesis of star&#8208;shaped motor&#8208;polymer conjugates. This approach enables scalability, precise control over the molecular structure, block copolymer structures, and high&#8208;end group fidelity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that these materials can be crosslinked to form gels with quasi&#8208;ideal network topology, exhibiting light&#8208;triggered contraction. The influence of arm length and polymer structure is investigated, and the first molecular dynamics simulation framework to gain deeper insights into the contraction processes is developed. Leveraging this scalable methodology, the creation of bilayer soft robotic devices and cargo&#8208;lifting artificial muscles is showcased, highlighting the versatility and potential applications of this advanced polymer chemistry approach. It is anticipated that the integrated experimental and simulation framework will accelerate scalable approaches for active polymer materials based on molecular machines, opening up new horizons in materials science and bioscience.

         <title>Capillarity&#8208;Driven Enrichment and Hydrodynamic Trapping of Trace Nucleic Acids by Plasmonic Cavity Membrane for Rapid and Sensitive Detections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a plasmonic cavity membrane that is designed to not only enrich and capture trace nucleic acids in a clinically relevant large sample volume by taking advantage of capillarity and hydrodynamic trapping but also achieve rapid amplification and sensitive detection is reported.








Abstract
Small&#8208;reactor&#8208;based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has attracted considerable attention. A significant number of tiny reactors must be prepared in parallel to capture, amplify, and accurately quantify few target genes in clinically relevant large volume, which, however, requires sophisticated microfabrication and longer sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer time. Here, single plasmonic cavity membrane is reported that not only enriches and captures few nucleic acids by taking advantage of both capillarity and hydrodynamic trapping but also quickly amplifies them for sensitive plasmonic detection. The plasmonic cavity membrane with few nanoliters in a void volume is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling gold nanorods with SiO2 tips. Simulations reveal that hydrodynamic stagnation between the SiO2 tips is mainly responsible for the trapping of the nucleic acid in the membrane. Finally, it is shown that the plasmonic cavity membrane is capable of enriching&#160;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) genes up to 20&#160;000&#8208;fold within 1&#160;min, amplifying within 3&#160;min, and detecting the trace genes as low as a single copy &#181;L&#8722;1. It is anticipated that this work not only expands the utility of PCR but also provides an innovative way of the enrichment and detection of trace biomolecules in a variety of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing applications.

         <title>Primary Human Breast Cancer&#8208;Associated Endothelial Cells Favor Interactions with Nanomedicines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor blood vessels are barriers for nanomedicines en route to solid tumors. This study indicates that primary human breast tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit higher nanoparticle uptake efficiency than normal mammary microvascular endothelial cells, along with an increased number of intracellular vesicles and upregulated transport&#8208;related genes. These findings may advance the development of safer and more effective cancer nanomedicines.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicines predominately rely on transport processes controlled by tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells to deliver therapeutic and diagnostic payloads into solid tumors. While the dominant role of this class of endothelial cells for nanoparticle transport and tumor delivery is established in animal models, the translational potential in human cells needs exploration. Using primary human breast cancer as a model, the differential interactions of normal and tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells with clinically relevant nanomedicine formulations are explored and quantified. Primary human breast cancer&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit up to &#8776;2&#160;times higher nanoparticle uptake than normal human mammary microvascular endothelial cells. Super&#8208;resolution imaging studies reveal a significantly higher intracellular vesicle number for tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells, indicating a substantial increase in cellular transport activities. RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis indicate the upregulation of transport&#8208;related genes, especially motor protein genes, in tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells. Collectively, the results demonstrate that primary human breast cancer&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit enhanced interactions with nanomedicines, suggesting a potentially significant role for these cells&#160;in nanoparticle tumor delivery in human patients. Engineering nanoparticles that leverage the translational potential of tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cell&#8208;mediated transport into human solid tumors may lead to the development of safer and more effective clinical cancer nanomedicines.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article demonstrates a dual&#8208;function additive strategy aimed at addressing the capacity loss in alkaline aqueous zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (AZFBs) during long&#8208;duration operations in real&#8208;world applications. This dual&#8208;function additive promotes uniform zinc deposition, slows down corrosion in alkaline environments, and inhibits the formation of dead zinc, thereby enhancing the capacity retention of AZFBs and significantly extending their battery cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (AZFBs) have emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology owing to Zn abundance, high safety, and low cost. However, zinc dendrite growth and the formation of dead zinc greatly impede the development of AZFBs. Herein, a dual&#8208;function electrolyte additive strategy is proposed to regulate zinc nucleation and mitigate the hydroxide corrosion of zinc depositions for stable AZFBs. This strategy, as exemplified by urea, introduces an electrolyte additive to coordinate with Zn2+/Zn with proper strength, slowing zinc deposition kinetics to induce uniform nucleation and protecting the deposited zinc surface from attack by hydroxide ions through preferable adsorption. The zincate complexes with urea are identified to be Zn(OH)2(urea)(H2O)2 and Zn2(OH)4(H2O)4(urea), which exhibit slow zinc deposition kinetics, allowing instantaneous nucleation. Calculation results reveal an additional energy barrier of 1.29&#160;eV for the subsequent adsorption of an OH&#8722; group when a urea molecule absorbs on the zinc cluster, significantly mitigating the formation of dead zinc. Consequently, prolonged cell cycling of the prototype alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow battery demonstrates stable operation for over 130 h and an average coulombic efficiency of 98.5%. It is anticipated that this electrolyte additive strategy will pave the way for developing highly stable AZFBs.

         <title>Understanding and Weakening Photon Recycling in Solar Cells to Approach the Radiative Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photon recycling model is proposed by considering the relationship between photon recycling and radiation processes, as well as the corresponding open&#8208;circuit voltage losses of solar cells. This model reveals that weakening photon recycling is more effective to approach the radiative limit of solar cells than enhancing it, and helps to achieve higher device stability.








Abstract
Photon recycling plays an important role in the light outcoupling of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells and is considered a necessary condition to achieve the radiative limit of open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and efficiency. However, due to the impact of photon recycling on bulk and surface radiation of solar cells being overlooked, experimental demonstrations on the accuracy of existing photon recycling models are scarce and some contrary theoretical results also emerge. Here, the relationship between photon recycling and radiation processes, as well as the corresponding VOC losses of solar cells based on the principle of detailed balance is clarified. It is shown that weakening photon recycling is more effective to boost the device performance than enhancing it, promoting the theoretical efficiencies of solar cells, such as perovskite, Si, and GaAs, to 98.5%, 94.9%, and almost 100% of their radiative limit, respectively. Moreover, weakening photon recycling also helps to maintain higher efficiency when the internal radiative efficiency decreases, which benefits higher device stability. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the role of photon recycling in solar cells and helps to push efficiency to a new limit.

         <title>Defect Engineering for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reaction on Transition Metal Oxides: The Role of Metal Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a strategy for regulating metal defects, including theoretical predictions and experimental validation. The activation of octahedral sites facilitates the adsorption of reactants, deprotonation of OH*, and the desorption of reaction products, ultimately leading to the achievement of a highly efficient dual&#8208;function catalyst for ORR and OER.








Abstract
Metal defect engineering is a highly effective strategy for addressing the prevalent high overpotential issues associated with transition metal oxides functioning as dual&#8208;function commercial oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction catalysts for increasing their activity and stability. However, the high formation energy of metal defects poses a challenge to the development of strategies to precisely control the selectivity during metal defect formation. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to demonstrate that altering the pathway of metal defect formation releases metal atoms as metal chlorides, which effectively reduces the formation energy of defects. The metal defects on the monometallic metal oxide surface (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) are selectively produced using chlorine plasma. The characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that catalytic activity is enhanced owing to electronic delocalization induced by metal defects, which reduces the theoretical overpotential. Notably, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, ex situ XPS, and in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS suggest that metal defects effectively improve the adsorption of reactive species on active sites and enhance the efficiency of product desorption, thereby boosting catalytic performance.

         <title>Truly Tiny Acoustic Biomolecules for Ultrasound Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall &#8220;bicones&#8221; are engineered from gas vesicles (GVs), a type of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructure, and produced in bacterial culture. This work develops foundational techniques for their potential applications in ultrasound imaging and therapy, including methods for detection in vitro and in vivo, cavitation, molecular targeting, immune evasion, and protein conjugation.








Abstract
Nanotechnology offers significant advantages for medical imaging and therapy, including enhanced contrast and precision targeting. However, integrating these benefits into ultrasonography is challenging due to the size and stability constraints of conventional bubble&#8208;based agents. Here bicones, truly tiny acoustic contrast agents based on gas vesicles (GVs), a unique class of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructures naturally produced in buoyant microbes, are described. It is shown that these sub&#8208;80&#160;nm particles can be effectively detected both in vitro and in vivo, infiltrate tumors via leaky vasculature, deliver potent mechanical effects through ultrasound&#8208;induced inertial cavitation, and are easily engineered for molecular targeting, prolonged circulation time, and payload conjugation.

         <title>3D Conjugated Hole Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D hole transporting material termed FTPE&#8208;ST is reported, which has a large conjugated structure leading to high hole mobility, and sulfur atoms that can bind to coordinately unsaturated lead centers on the surface of perovskite films, enhancing interfacial interactions. Perovskite solar cells and modules incorporating FTPE&#8208;ST achieve power conversion efficiencies of 25.21 and 21.27%, respectively.








Abstract
The orthogonal structure of the widely used hole transporting material (HTM) 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N, N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamino)&#8722;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD)&#160;imparts isotropic conductivity and excellent film&#8208;forming capability. However, inherently weak intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions result in low intrinsic hole mobility. Herein, a novel HTM, termed FTPE&#8208;ST, with a twist conjugated dibenzo(g,p)chrysene core and coplanar 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as extended donor units, is designed to enhance &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, without compromising on solubility. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) configuration provides the material multi&#8208;direction charge transport as well as excellent solubility even in 2&#8208;methylanisole, and its large conjugated backbone endows the HTM with a high hole mobility. Moreover, the sulfur donors in EDOT units coordinate with lead ions on the perovskite surface, leading to stronger interfacial interactions and the suppression of defects at the perovskite/HTM interface. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing FTPE&#8208;ST achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.21% with excellent long&#8208;time stability, one of the highest PCEs for non&#8208;spiro HTMs in n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. In addition, the excellent film&#8208;forming capacity of the HTM enables the fabrication of FTPE&#8208;ST&#8208;based large&#8208;scale PSCs (1.0&#160;cm2) and modules (29.0&#160;cm2), which achieve PCEs of 24.21% (certificated 24.17%) and 21.27%, respectively.

In addition, the excellent film-forming capacity of the HTM enables the fabrication of FTPE-ST-based large-scale PSCs (1.0&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and modules (29.0&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which achieve PCEs of 24.21% (certificated 24.17%) and 21.27%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The metal halide octahedron is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of perovskites. However, the impact of octahedral connectivity in perovskites on device performance is not systematically explored. This manuscript provides direct experimental evidence that the existence of non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing regions is detrimental to device performance and provides key guidance on how to regulate octahedral connectivity.








Abstract
The metal halide (BX6)4&#8208; octahedron, where B represents a metal cation and X represents a halide anion, is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of metal halide perovskites. However, the influence of the way the (BX6)4&#8722; octahedra connect to each other has on the structural stability and optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite is still unclear. Here, the octahedral connectivity, including corner&#8208;, edge&#8208;, and face&#8208;sharing, of various CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.3) perovskite films is tuned and reliably characterized through compositional and additive engineering, and with ultralow&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy. It is found that the overall solar cell device performance, the charge carrier lifetime, the open&#8208;circuit voltage, and the current density&#8211;voltage hysteresis are all improved when the films consist of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, and non&#8208;corner sharing phases are suppressed, even in films with the same chemical composition. Additionally, it is found that the structural, optoelectronic, and device performance stabilities are similarly enhanced when non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing connectivities are suppressed. This approach, combining macroscopic device tests and microscopic material characterization, provides a powerful tool enabling a thorough understanding of the impact of octahedral connectivity on device performance, and opens a new parameter space for designing high&#8208;performance photovoltaic metal halide perovskite devices.

         <title>Single Layer Silk and Cotton Woven Fabrics for Acoustic Emission and Active Sound Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When coupled to a piezoelectric fiber, traditional fabrics can serve as emitters or suppressors of sound, emitting sound up to 70&#160;dB or actively reducing noise by up to 37 dB. A 130 &#181;m fabric can also serve as an active barrier to reduce vibrations on the surface of the fabric and thus attenuate transmitted sound by up to 75%.








Abstract
Whether intentionally generating acoustic waves or attempting to mitigate unwanted noise, sound control is an area of challenge and opportunity. This study investigates traditional fabrics as emitters and suppressors of sound. When attached to a single strand of a piezoelectric fiber actuator, a silk fabric emits up to 70&#160;dB of sound. Despite the complex fabric structure, vibrometer measurements reveal behavior reminiscent of a classical thin plate. Fabric pore size relative to the viscous boundary layer thickness is found&#8212;through comparative fabric analysis&#8212;to influence acoustic&#8208;emission efficiency. Sound suppression is demonstrated using two distinct mechanisms. In the first, direct acoustic interference is shown to reduce sound by up to 37 dB. The second relies on pacifying the fabric vibrations by the piezoelectric fiber, reducing the amplitude of vibration waves by 95% and attenuating the transmitted sound by up to 75%. Interestingly, this vibration&#8208;mediated suppression in principle reduces sound in an unlimited volume. It also allows the acoustic reflectivity of the fabric to be dynamically controlled, increasing by up to 68%. The sound emission and suppression efficiency of a 130 &#181;m silk fabric presents opportunities for sound control in a variety of applications ranging from apparel to transportation to architecture.

         <title>A Highly Deficient Medium&#8208;Entropy Perovskite Ceramic for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding under Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy perovskite ceramic has developed as an efficient electromagnetic interference&#160;shielding material in harsh environment. The high concentration of Ti&#8208;O vacancy clusters formed under the synergistic effect of aliovalent substitution and entropy effect enables the material to serve as an bifunctional shielding material for electromagnetic wave and heat.








Abstract
Materials that can provide reliable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in highly oxidative atmosphere at elevated temperature are indispensable in the fast&#8208;developing aerospace field. However, most of conductor&#8208;type EMI shielding materials such as metals can hardly withstand the high&#8208;temperature oxidation, while the conventional dielectric&#8208;type materials cannot offer sufficient shielding efficiency in gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. Here, a highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy (ME) perovskite ceramic as an efficient EMI shielding material in harsh environment, is demonstrated. The synergistic effect of entropy stabilization and aliovalent substitution on A&#8208;site generate abnormally high concentration of Ti and O vacancies that are stable under high&#8208;temperature oxidation. Due to the clustering of vacancies, the highly deficient perovskite ceramic exhibits giant complex permittivity and polarization loss in GHz, leading to the specific EMI shielding effectiveness above 30&#160;dB/mm in X&#8208;band even after 100 h of annealing at 1000&#160;&#176;C in air. Along with the low thermal conductivity, the aliovalent ME perovskite can serve as a bifunctional shielding material for applications in aircraft engines and reusable rockets.

         <title>Nonflammable Succinonitrile&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Intrinsically Safe High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion battery is realized by the new&#8208;type of nonflammable succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte. The deep eutectic electrolyte with a strong hydrogen bond between S&#9552;O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN effectively improves the compatibility of SN with Lewis bases.








Abstract
Intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries are considered as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the high flammability of conventional electrolytes may pose serious safety threats and even explosions. Herein, a strategy of constructing a deep eutectic electrolyte is proposed to boost the safety and electrochemical performance of succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based electrolyte. The strong hydrogen bond between S&#9552;O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide (DTD) and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN endows the enhanced safety and compatibility of SN with Lewis bases. Meanwhile, the DTD participates in the inner Na+ sheath and weakens the coordination number of SN. The unique solvation configuration promotes the formation of robust gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase, and merits stable cycling of half&#8208;cells in a wide temperature range, with a capacity retention of 82.8% after 800 cycles (25&#160;&#176;C) and 86.3% after 100 cycles (60&#160;&#176;C). Correspondingly, the full cells deliver tremendous improvement in cycling stability and rate performance.

         <title>Nonpersistent Nanoarchitectures Enhance Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in an Immunocompetent Orthotopic Model of HPV+ Head/Neck Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonpersistent nanoarchitectures comprising cluster&#8208;size gold demonstrate, in combination with radiotherapy, an outperforming therapeutic efficacy on orthotopic human papillomavirus&#8208;positive head/neck squamous cell carcinoma immunocompetent murine models. This approach overcomes the clinical limitations associated to metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;mediated radiotherapy while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to the gold standard, opening new horizons in oral cancer management.









Abstract
Cisplatin chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the established standard of care for managing locally advanced human papillomavirus&#8208;positive head/neck carcinoma. The typically young patients may suffer serious and long&#8208;time side effects caused by the treatment, such as dysphagia, and hearing loss. Thus, ensuring a satisfactory post&#8208;treatment quality of life is paramount. One potential replacing approach to the classical CRT involves the combination of standard&#8208;dose radiotherapy and radiosensitizers such as noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). However, several concerns about size, shape, and biocompatibility limit the translation of metal nanomaterials to the clinical practice. Here, it is demonstrated that a new model of nonpersistent gold nanoarchitectures containing cisplatin (NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt) generates, in combination with radiotherapy, a significant in vivo tumor&#8208;reducing effect compared to the standard CRT, achieving a complete tumor clearance in 25% of the immunocompetent models that persist for 60 days. These findings, together with the negligible amount of metals recognized in the excretory organs, highlight that the concurrent administration of NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt and radiotherapy has the potential to overcome some clinical limitations associated to NP&#8208;based approaches while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to standard CRT. Overall, despite further mechanistic investigations being essential, these data support the exploiting of nonpersistent metal&#8208;nanomaterial&#8208;mediated approaches for oral cancer management.

A 5.1&#160;&#181;m rigid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte layer&#160;constructed by tough Kevlar nanofibers bridge with metal&#8208;organic framework channels&#160;and in&#8208;situ polymerized deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent as the ion&#8208;transport carrier is designed on the cathode. This quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with nano&#8208;network&#8208;topology&#160;has considerable Li+ transport properties, low ionic diffusion activation energy, and high modulus, which guarantees the high cyclic stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
An ultra&#8208;thin quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (QSE) with dendrite&#8208;inhibiting properties is a requirement for achieving high energy density quasi&#8208;solid lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, a 5.1&#160;&#181;m rigid QSE layer is directly designed on the cathode, in which Kevlar (poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalate)) nanofibers (KANFs) with negatively charged groups bridging metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles are served as a rigid skeleton, and non&#8208;flammable deep eutectic solvent is selected to be encapsulated into the MOF channels, combined with in situ polymerization to complete safe electrolyte system with high rigidness and stability. The QSE with&#160;constructed topological network demonstrates high rigidity (5.4&#160;GPa), high ionic conductivity (0.73 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), good ion&#8208;regulated properties, and improved structural stability, contributing to homogenized Li&#8208;ion flux, excellent dendrite suppression, and prolonged cyclic performance for LMB. Additionally, ion regulation influences the Li deposition behavior, exhibiting a uniform morphology on the Li&#8208;metal surface after cycling. According to density&#8208;functional theory, KANFs bridging MOFs as hosts play a vital function in the free&#8208;state and fast diffusion dynamics of Li&#8208;ions. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing ultrathin robust electrolytes with a novel ionic conduction mode.

         <title>In Situ Ions Induced Formation of KxF&#8208;Rich SEI Layers toward Ultrastable Life of Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlCl3 is employed as a novel additive to induce the F&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). Due to the large charge&#8208;to&#8208;radius ratio of Al3+, the Al&#8208;containing groups in the electrolyte can easily capture F from PF6&#8722; and accelerate the formation of KxF in SEI layer. The &#8220;self&#8208;induced formation&#8221; of F&#8208;rich SEI layers guarantees the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability of KIBs.








Abstract
Engineering F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers is regarded as an effective strategy to enable the long&#8208;term cycling stability of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). However, in the conventional KPF6 carbonate electrolytes, it is challenging to form F&#8208;containing SEI layers due to the inability of KPF6 to decompose into KxF. Herein, AlCl3 is employed as a novel additive to change the chemical environment of the KPF6 carbonate electrolyte. First, due to the large charge&#8208;to&#8208;radius ratio of Al3+, the Al&#8208;containing groups in the electrolyte can easily capture F from PF6&#8722; and accelerate the formation of KxF in SEI layer. In addition, AlCl3 also reacts with trace H2O or solvents in the electrolytes to form Al2O3, which can further act as a HF scavenger. Upon incorporating AlCl3 into conventional KPF6 carbonate electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) anode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100%. When coupled with perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), the full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81% after 360 cycles&#8208;significantly outperforming cells using conventional electrolytes. This research paves new avenues for advancing electrolyte engineering towards developing durable batteries tailored for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Colloidal QD Photodetector with Nanosecond Response Times Enabled by Ultrathin Absorber Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The record 4 ns response time in colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) that operate at short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) wavelengths is reported, the first result reaching the requirement of SWIR light detection and ranging based on colloidal QDs. These ultrafast QDPDs combine a thin active layer to reduce the carrier transport time and a small area to inhibit slow capacitive discharging.








Abstract
Ultrafast short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) photodetection is of great interest for emerging automated vision and spatial mapping technologies. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) stand out for SWIR photodetection compared to epitaxial (In,Ga)As or (Hg,Cd)Te semiconductors by their combining a size&#8208;tunable bandgap and a suitability for cost&#8208;effective, solution&#8208;based processing. However, achieving ultrafast, nanosecond&#8208;level response time has remained an outstanding challenge for QD&#8208;based SWIR photodiodes (QDPDs). Here, record 4&#160;ns response time in PbS&#8208;based QDPDs that operate at SWIR wavelengths is reported, a result reaching the requirement of SWIR light detection and ranging based on colloidal QDs. These ultrafast QDPDs combine a thin active layer to reduce the carrier transport time and a small area to inhibit slow capacitive discharging. By implementing a concentration gradient ligand exchange method, high&#8208;quality p&#8211;n junctions are fabricated in these ultrathin QDPDs. Moreover, these ultrathin QDPDs attain an external quantum efficiency of 42% at 1330&#160;nm, due to a 2.5&#8208;fold enhanced light absorption through the formation of a Fabry&#8211;Perot cavity within the QDPD and the highly efficient extraction (98%) of photogenerated charge carriers. Based on these results, it is estimated that a further increase of the charge&#8208;carrier mobility can lead to PbS QDPDs with sub&#8208;nanosecond response time.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Matching Metal&#8208;Ion Organic Hybrid Interface to Enhance Energy Storage of Polymer&#8208;Based Composite Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the interfacial mismatch between nanosheets and polymers in nanocomposite dielectrics, a &#8220;Metal&#8208;Ion Organic Hybrid Interface&#8221; (MOHI) between nanosheets and polymers is designed. The outstanding energy storage density &#8776;4.75 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;90% is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C, which is more than ten times that of polyimide (PI).








Abstract
In this work, a distinctive &#8220;metal&#8208;ion organic hybrid interface&#8221; (MOHI) between polyimide (PI) and calcium niobate (CNO) nanosheets is designed. The metal ions in the MOHI can achieve atomic&#8208;level matching not only with the inorganic CNO, but also with the PI chains, forming uniform and strong chemical bonds. These results are demonstrated by experiment and theory calculations. Significantly, the MOHI reduces the free volume and introduces deep traps across the filler&#8208;matrix interfacial area, thus suppressing the electric field distortion in PI&#8208;based composite dielectrics. Consequently, PI&#8208;based dielectric containing the MOHI exhibits excellent energy storage performance. The energy storage densities (Ue) of the composite dielectric reach 9.42 J cm&#8722;3 and 4.75 J cm&#8722;3 with energy storage efficiency (&#951;) of 90% at 25&#160;&#176;C and 150&#160;&#176;C respectively, which are 2.6 and 11.6 times higher than those of pure PI. This study provides new ideas for polymer&#8208;based composite dielectrics in high energy storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Encapsulation of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles inside Carbonized Wood for Highly Durable Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a highly active and long&#8208;lasting electrocatalyst composed of quinary high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEAs) (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) through thermal shock. The surface defects of ACW exhibit thermodynamically stable adsorption on the melting HEAs, rendering HEAs to aggregate and nucleate at the defect sites of ACW.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEAs) show great potential in emerging electrocatalysis due to their combination and optimization of multiple elements. However, synthesized HEAs often exhibit a weak interface with the conductive substrate, hindering their applications in long&#8208;term catalysis and energy conversion. Herein, a highly active and durable electrocatalyst composed of quinary HEAs (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) is reported. The self&#8208;encapsulation of HEAs is achieved during Joule heating synthesis (2060 K, 2 s) where HEAs naturally nucleate at the defect sites. In the meantime, HEAs catalyze the deposition of mobile carbon atoms to form a protective few&#8208;layer carbon shell during the rapid quenching process, thus remarkably strengthening the interface stability between HEAs and ACW. As a result, the HEAs@ACW shows not only favorable activity with an overpotential of 7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution but also negligible attenuation during a 500 h stability test, which is superior to most reported electrocatalysts. The design of self&#8208;encapsulated HEAs inside ACW provides a critical strategy to enhance both activity and stability, which is also applicable to many other energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Conjugated Polymer Heteroatom Engineering Enables High Detectivity Symmetric Ambipolar Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambipolar organic semiconductors can offer balanced electron and hole transport, enabling light detection when implemented in thin film transistors. Here it is shown how a subtle change in a comonomer heteroatom results in a more electron&#8208;accepting polymer with preferential edge&#8208;on orientation. This results in higher electron mobility OTFTs with balanced charge transport that enable high&#8208;performing NIR ambipolar phototransistors and photo&#8208;inverters.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;performing ambipolar organic phototransistors (OPTs) can enable low&#8208;cost integrated circuits. Here, a heteroatom engineering approach to modify the electron affinity of a low band gap diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) co&#8208;polymer, resulting in well&#8208;balanced charge transport, a more preferential edge&#8208;on orientation and higher crystallinity, is demonstrated. Changing the comonomer heteroatom from sulfur (benzothiadiazole (BT)) to oxygen (benzooxadiazole (BO)) leads to an increased electron affinity and introduces higher ambipolarity. Organic thin film transistors fabricated from the novel PDPP&#8208;BO exhibit charge carrier mobility of 0.6 and 0.3 cm2&#160;Vs&#8315;1 for electrons and holes, respectively. Due to the high sensitivity of the PDPP&#8208;based material and the balanced transport in PDPP&#8208;BO, its application as an NIR detector in an OPT architecture is presented. By maintaining a high on/off ratio (9 &#215; 104), ambipolar OPTs are shown with photoresponsivity of 69 and 99 A&#160;W&#8315;1 and specific detectivity of 8 &#215; 107 for the p&#8208;type operation and 4 &#215; 109 Jones for the n&#8208;type regime. The high symmetric NIR&#8208;ambipolar OPTs are also evaluated as ambipolar photo&#8208;inverters, and show a 46% gain enhancement under illumination.

         <title>Reprocessability in Engineering Thermosets Achieved Through Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) is shown to be an effective technique to manufacture high&#8208;performance poly(dicyclopentadiene) (pDCPD) thermosets with regenerative capabilities. The rapid curing of FROMP preserves the metathesis used to make the material, allowing effective reclamation of pDCPD performance across multiple generations. The strategy is simple and holds real promise to tackle end&#8208;of&#8208;life management challenges in industrial materials.








Abstract
While valued for their durability and exceptional performance, crosslinked thermosets are challenging to recycle and reuse. Here, inherent reprocessability in industrially relevant polyolefin thermosets is unveiled. Unlike prior methods, this approach eliminates the need to introduce exchangeable functionality to regenerate the material, relying instead on preserving the activity of the metathesis catalyst employed in the curing reaction. Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) proves critical to preserving this activity. Conditions controlling catalytic viability are explored to successfully reclaim performance across multiple generations of material, thus demonstrating long&#8208;term reprocessability. This straightforward and scalable remolding strategy is poised for widespread adoption. Given the anticipated growth in polyolefin thermosets, these findings represent an important conceptual advance in the pursuit of a fully circular lifecycle for thermoset polymers.

         <title>Optimizing Ionomer Distribution in Anode Catalyst Layer for Stable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>

The anode catalyst layer (ACL) is the key to determining the lifetime of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. In this work, an efficient gradient ionomer distributed ACL structure is fabricated through optimizing the catalyst ink, which improves the durability by a factor of three compared to the normal ACL when operating at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The high cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) originates from the usage of precious materials, insufficient efficiency, and lifetime. In this work, an important degradation mechanism of PEMWE caused by dynamics of ionomers over time in anode catalyst layer (ACL), which is a purely mechanical degradation of microstructure, is identified. Contrary to conventional understanding that the microstructure of ACL is static, the micropores are inclined to be occupied by ionomers due to the localized swelling/creep/migration, especially near the ACL/PTL (porous transport layer) interface, where they form transport channels of reactant/product couples. Consequently, the ACL with increased ionomers at PTL/ACL interface exhibit rapid and continuous degradation. In addition, a close correlation between the microstructure of ACL and the catalyst ink is discovered. Specifically, if more ionomers migrate to the top layer of the ink, more ionomers accumulate at the ACL/PEM interface, leaving fewer ionomers at the ACL/PTL interface. Therefore, the ionomer distribution in ACL is successfully optimized, which exhibits reduced ionomers at the ACL/PTL interface and enriches ionomers at the ACL/PEM interface, reducing the decay rate by a factor of three when operated at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 80&#160;&#176;C. The findings provide a general way to achieve low&#8208;cost hydrogen production.

         <title>High Performance As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Refined Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology and Improved Dielectric Constant of Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;cast organic solar cell with a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is constructed via introducing a novel polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;TPT) into the D18:L8&#8208;BO blend to form a favorable double&#8208;fibril network morphology. Consequently, the as&#8208;cast device affords a champion PCE of 18.60% and excellent device stability, which bring new insights into the construction of efficient as&#8208;cast device.








Abstract
High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are usually realized by using post&#8208;treatment and/or additive, which can induce the formation of metastable morphology, leading to unfavorable device stability. In terms of the industrial production, the development of high efficiency as&#8208;cast OSCs is crucially important, but it remains a great challenge to obtain appropriate active layer morphology and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, efficient as&#8208;cast OSCs are constructed via introducing a new polymer acceptor PY&#8208;TPT with a high dielectric constant into the D18:L8&#8208;BO blend to form a double&#8208;fibril network morphology. Besides, the incorporation of PY&#8208;TPT enables an enhanced dielectric constant and lower exciton binding energy of active layer. Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport are realized in D18:L8&#8208;BO:PY&#8208;TPT&#8208;based device, affording a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.60% and excellent photostability in absence of post&#8208;treatment. Moreover, green solvent&#8208;processed devices, thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) devices, and module (16.60 cm2) are fabricated, which show PCEs of 17.45%, 17.54%, and 13.84%, respectively. This work brings new insight into the construction of efficient as&#8208;cast devices, pushing forward the practical application of OSCs.

         <title>The Role of Solution Aggregation Property toward High&#8208;Efficiency Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of the representative organic photovoltaic systems shows that the aggregation competition between polymer donor (PD) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) is a decisive factor in the phase separation of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance. Based on 64 PD/NFA combinations, the aggregation ability/photovoltaic parameter heatmaps are plotted, providing a new matching rule for developing high&#8208;efficiency PD/NFA systems.








Abstract
In organic photovoltaic cells, the solution&#8208;aggregation effect (SAE) is long considered a critical factor in achieving high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies for polymer donor (PD)/non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) blend systems. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully understood. Herein, based on an extensive study of blends consisting of the representative 2D&#8208;benzodithiophene&#8208;based PDs and acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type NFAs, it is demonstrated that SAE shows a strong correlation with the aggregation kinetics during solidification, and the aggregation competition between PD and NFA determines the phase separation of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance. PDs with strong SAEs enable earlier aggregation evolutions than NFAs, resulting in well&#8208;known polymer&#8208;templated fibrillar network structures and superior PCEs. With the weakening of PDs&#8217; aggregation effects, NFAs, showing stronger tendencies to aggregate, tend to form oversized domains, leading to significantly reduced external quantum efficiencies and fill factors. These trends reveal the importance of matching SAE between PD and NFA. The aggregation abilities of various materials are further evaluated and the aggregation ability/photovoltaic parameter diagrams of 64 PD/NFA combinations are provided. This work proposes a guiding criteria and facile approach to match efficient PD/NFA systems.

         <title>Electrically Conductive Collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS Hydrogel Prevents Post&#8208;Infarct Cardiac Arrhythmia and Supports hiPSC&#8208;Cardiomyocyte Function</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrically conductive hydrogel is developed to prevent arrhythmia after myocardial infarction (MI), allowing human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;cardiomyocyte function and maturation. Incorporation of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) in collagen results in a hydrogel with different microstructure, enhanced gelation kinetics, and increased conductivity. hiPSC&#8208;cardiomyocytes exhibit in this hydrogel mature sarcomeric structures and enhanced calcium handling. Transplanting collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels is sufficient to protect the infarcted heart against ventricular tachycardia.








Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) causes cell death, disrupts electrical activity, triggers arrhythmia, and results in heart failure, whereby 50&#8211;60% of MI&#8208;associated deaths manifest as sudden cardiac deaths (SCD). The most effective therapy for SCD prevention is implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). However, ICDs contribute to adverse remodeling and disease progression and do not prevent arrhythmia. This work develops an injectable collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) hydrogel that protects infarcted hearts against ventricular tachycardia (VT) and can be combined with human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;cardiomyocytes to promote partial cardiac remuscularization. PEDOT:PSS improves collagen gel formation, micromorphology, and conductivity. hiPSC&#8208;cardiomyocytes in collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels exhibit near&#8208;adult sarcomeric length, improved contractility, enhanced calcium handling, and conduction velocity. RNA&#8208;sequencing data indicate enhanced maturation and improved cell&#8208;matrix interactions. Injecting collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels in infarcted mouse hearts decreases VT to the levels of healthy hearts. Collectively, collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels offer a versatile platform for treating cardiac injuries.

         <title>Smart Nanoassembly Enabling Activatable NIR Fluorescence and ROS Generation with Enhanced Tumor Penetration for Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
LipoHPM, a smart tumor&#8208;targeting nanoplatform, integrates activatable fluorescence imaging and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within tumor cells. Both fluorescence and ROS exhibit an OFF&#8208;state in blood circulation, minimizing background interference and phototoxic side effects. Upon tumor internalization, LipoHPM switches to an ON&#8208;state, releasing hydralazine for enhanced tumor penetration, activating fluorescence for high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging, and boosting ROS generation for potent photodynamic therapy efficacy.








Abstract
Fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (FIG&#8208;PDT) holds promise for cancer treatment, yet challenges persist in poor imaging quality, phototoxicity, and insufficient anti&#8208;tumor effect. Herein, a novel nanoplatform, LipoHPM, designed to address these challenges, is reported. This approach employs an acid&#8208;sensitive amine linker to connect a biotin&#8208;modified hydrophilic polymer (BiotinPEG) with a new hydrophobic photosensitizer (MBA), forming OFF&#8208;state BiotinPEG&#8208;MBA (PM) micelles via an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect. These micelles are then co&#8208;loaded with the tumor penetration enhancer hydralazine (HDZ) into pH&#8208;sensitive liposomes (LipoHPM). Leveraging the ACQ effect, LipoHPM is silent in both fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during blood circulation but restores both properties upon disassembly. Following intravenous injection in tumor&#8208;bearing mice, LipoHPM actively targets tumor cells overexpressing biotin&#8208;receptors, contributing to enhanced tumor accumulation. Upon cellular internalization, LipoHPM disassembles within lysosomes, releasing HDZ to enhance tumor penetration and inhibit tumor metastasis. Concurrently, the micelles activate fluorescence for tumor imaging and boost the production of both type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II ROS for tumor eradication. Therefore, the smart LipoHPM synergistically integrates near&#8208;infrared emission, activatable tumor imaging, robust ROS generation, efficient anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis activity, successfully overcoming limitations of conventional photosensitizers and establishing itself as a promising nanoplatform for potent FIG&#8208;PDT applications.

     alt="Smart Nanoassembly Enabling Activatable NIR Fluorescence and ROS Generation with Enhanced Tumor Penetration for Imaging-Guided Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LipoHPM, a smart tumor-targeting nanoplatform, integrates activatable fluorescence imaging and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within tumor cells. Both fluorescence and ROS exhibit an OFF-state in blood circulation, minimizing background interference and phototoxic side effects. Upon tumor internalization, LipoHPM switches to an ON-state, releasing hydralazine for enhanced tumor penetration, activating fluorescence for high-contrast tumor imaging, and boosting ROS generation for potent photodynamic therapy efficacy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescence imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (FIG-PDT) holds promise for cancer treatment, yet challenges persist in poor imaging quality, phototoxicity, and insufficient anti-tumor effect. Herein, a novel nanoplatform, LipoHPM, designed to address these challenges, is reported. This approach employs an acid-sensitive amine linker to connect a biotin-modified hydrophilic polymer (&lt;sup&gt;Biotin&lt;/sup&gt;PEG) with a new hydrophobic photosensitizer (MBA), forming OFF-state &lt;sup&gt;Biotin&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;EG-&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;BA (PM) micelles via an aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. These micelles are then co-loaded with the tumor penetration enhancer hydralazine (&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;DZ) into pH-sensitive liposomes (Lipo&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;HPM&lt;/span&gt;). Leveraging the ACQ effect, LipoHPM is silent in both fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during blood circulation but restores both properties upon disassembly. Following intravenous injection in tumor-bearing mice, LipoHPM actively targets tumor cells overexpressing biotin-receptors, contributing to enhanced tumor accumulation. Upon cellular internalization, LipoHPM disassembles within lysosomes, releasing HDZ to enhance tumor penetration and inhibit tumor metastasis. Concurrently, the micelles activate fluorescence for tumor imaging and boost the production of both type-I and type-II ROS for tumor eradication. Therefore, the smart LipoHPM synergistically integrates near-infrared emission, activatable tumor imaging, robust ROS generation, efficient anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activity, successfully overcoming limitations of conventional photosensitizers and establishing itself as a promising nanoplatform for potent FIG-PDT applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tissue Engineering
In article number 2308949 by Maik Schot, Jeroen Leijten, and co&#8208;workers, engineered living tissues containing high density capillary networks are fabricated in a clinically scalable manner. This is achieved by photo&#8208;annealing living microtissues, which are mass produced using in&#8208;air microfluidics. The resulting microporous yet monolithic living tissues are directly perfusable and offer micrometer&#8208;scale diffusive length regardless of tissue size, enabling unprecedented exchange rates for nutrients, waste products, and stimulating molecules to allow for the upscaling of living matter.

Revealing Element Distributions on High Entropy Alloy Surface
By combining elemental sensitive synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques with high spatial resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, the authors are able to extract the element distributions at the sub&#8208;nm scale on the surfaces of high entropy alloys. In article number 2402442, Lauren Kim, TeYu Chien, and co&#8208;workers utilize X&#8208;ray assisted tunneling to enhance the elemental sensitivity with high spatial resolution to achieve this goal. This technique paves the path for correlating element local arrangements to the physical properties of the high entropy materials.

Blocking Sound with Silk
In article number 2313328 by Yoel Fink and co&#8208;workers, sound control using traditional fabrics is explored. A silk fabric with a piezoelectric fiber emits 70 dB of sound. Surprisingly, by dynamically suppressing vibrations in a 130&#8208;micron silk monolayer, transmitted sound decreases by 75% and acoustic reflectivity increases by 68%. These findings present opportunities in apparel, transportation, and architecture.

Highly Durable Electrocatalysis
In article number 2402391, Yonggang Yao, Wentao Gan, and co&#8208;workers report a highly active and long&#8208;lasting electrocatalyst composed of quinary HEAs (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) through Joule heating and rapid quenching treatment. The surface defects of ACW exhibit thermodynamically stable adsorption on the melting HEAs, which induces HEAs to aggregate and nucleate at the defect sites of ACW. This self&#8208;encapsulation design provides a critical strategy to enhance both electrocatalytic activity and stability, which is also applicable to many other energy conversion technologies.

Virus&#8208;Sized Protein Structures Filled with Gas
The large size of conventional contrast agents limits the tissues and targets ultrasound can image. In articles 2307123 and 2307106, George Lu, Mikhail Shapiro and their co&#8208;workers genetically designed two different types of tiny gas&#8208;filled protein nanostructures. These structures represent some of the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles ever made and demonstrate enhanced abilities to infiltrate tumors and lymph nodes, highlighting their potential for ultrasound imaging and delivery.

In article number 2400800, Sungkyu Kim, Feng Ding, Joonki Suh, and co&#8208;workers introduce so&#8208;called phase&#8208;centric approach for producing post&#8208;transition metal chalcogenides using low&#8208;temperature metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). High&#8208;crystalline 2D SnSe2 films can be directly prepared in wafer scale with excellent uniformity. With theoretical inputs, the authors indirectly produce SnSe film with all benefits of MOCVD. This set of techniques will provide a new route to the BEOL&#8208;compatible preparation of high&#8208;quality post&#8208;transition metal chalcogenides.

         <title>Evolution of Musculoskeletal Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The action motion and biosignals of the musculoskeletal system from in vitro to in vivo play critical role in both medical diagnosis and personal healthcare. In this review, the musculoskeletal electronics is proposed, and the history is briefly outlined, strategies and development trend of related materials and devices are progressed and designed.








Abstract
The musculoskeletal system, constituting the largest human physiological system, plays a critical role in providing structural support to the body, facilitating intricate movements, and safeguarding internal organs. By virtue of advancements in revolutionized materials and devices, particularly in the realms of motion capture, health monitoring, and postoperative rehabilitation, &#8220;musculoskeletal electronics&#8221; has actually emerged as an infancy area, but has not yet been explicitly proposed. In this review, the concept of musculoskeletal electronics is elucidated, and the evolution history, representative progress, and key strategies of the involved materials and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices are summarized. Therefore, the fundamentals of musculoskeletal electronics and key functionality categories are introduced. Subsequently, recent advances in musculoskeletal electronics are presented from the perspectives of &#8220;in vitro&#8221; to &#8220;in vivo&#8221; signal detection, interactive modulation, and therapeutic interventions for healing and recovery. Additionally, nine strategy avenues for the development of advanced musculoskeletal electronic materials and devices are proposed. Finally, concise summaries and perspectives are proposed to highlight the directions that deserve focused attention in this booming field.

Therefore, the fundamentals of musculoskeletal electronics and key functionality categories are introduced. Subsequently, recent advances in musculoskeletal electronics are presented from the perspectives of &#8220;in vitro&#8221; to &#8220;in vivo&#8221; signal detection, interactive modulation, and therapeutic interventions for healing and recovery. Additionally, nine strategy avenues for the development of advanced musculoskeletal electronic materials and devices are proposed. Finally, concise summaries and perspectives are proposed to highlight the directions that deserve focused attention in this booming field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Critical Analysis of Membranes toward Sustainable and Efficient Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are considered to be promising for large&#8208;scale storage of electrical energy with safety, flexibility, and durability. This review analyzes how key parameters of membranes that are critical components in VRFBs influence the device performance. Insights into design strategies for membranes for efficient VRFB are provided.








Abstract
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are a promising technology for large&#8208;scale storage of electrical energy, combining safety, high capacity, ease of scalability, and prolonged durability; features which have triggered their early commercial implementation. Furthering the deployment of VRFB technologies requires addressing challenges associated to a pivotal component: the membrane. Examples include vanadium crossover, insufficient conductivity, escalated costs, and sustainability concerns related to the widespread adoption of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;based membranes, e.g., perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA). Herein, recent advances in high&#8208;performance and sustainable membranes for VRFB, offering insights into prospective research directions to overcome these challenges, are reviewed. The analysis reveals the disparities and trade&#8208;offs between performance advances enabled by PFSA membranes and composites, and the lack of sustainability in their final applications. The potential of PFSA&#8208;free membranes and present strategies to enhance their performance are discussed. This study delves into vital membrane parameters to enhance battery performance, suggesting protocols and design strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance and sustainable VRFB membranes.

         <title>Immunoengineering Biomaterials for Musculoskeletal Tissue Repair across Lifespan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses the intersection of the immune system and aging in biomaterial&#8208;mediated musculoskeletal tissue repair. The authors provide an overview of how aging impacts tissue physiology, immunity, and biomaterial responses. Then, the authors discuss the roles of the immune system in biomaterial&#8208;mediated repair of cartilage, muscle, and bone; and the impact of aging on biomaterial responses in these tissues.








Abstract
Musculoskeletal diseases and injuries are among the leading causes of pain and morbidity worldwide. Broad efforts have focused on developing pro&#8208;regenerative biomaterials to treat musculoskeletal conditions; however, these approaches have yet to make a significant clinical impact. Recent studies have demonstrated that the immune system is central in orchestrating tissue repair and that targeting pro&#8208;regenerative immune responses can improve biomaterial therapeutic outcomes. However, aging is a critical factor negatively affecting musculoskeletal tissue repair and immune function. Hence, understanding how age affects the response to biomaterials is essential for improving musculoskeletal biomaterial therapies. This review focuses on the intersection of the immune system and aging in response to biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair. The article introduces the general impacts of aging on tissue physiology, the immune system, and the response to biomaterials. Then, it explains how the adaptive immune system guides the response to injury and biomaterial implants in cartilage, muscle, and bone and discusses how aging impacts these processes in each tissue type. The review concludes by highlighting future directions for the development and translation of personalized immunomodulatory biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair.

         <title>Ultrasmall Inorganic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Preparation, Functionalization, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles (&lt;50&#160;nm) are a unique type of porous nanomaterial with numerous advantages, involving abundant mesopores, low density, high specific surface area, multiple reaction sites, and small size effect, which have been widely used in multiple applications, such as catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery.








Abstract
Ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles (&lt;50&#160;nm), a unique porous nanomaterial, have been widely studied in many fields in the last decade owing to the abundant advantages, involving rich mesopores, low density, high surface area, numerous reaction sites, large cavity space, ultrasmall size, etc. This paper presents a review of recent advances in the preparation, functionalization, and applications of ultrasmall inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles for the first time. The soft monomicelles&#8208;directed method, in contrast to the hard&#8208;template and template&#8208;free methods, is more flexible in the synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles. This is because the amphiphilic micelle has tunable functional blocks, controlled molecule masses, configurations and mesostructures. Focus on the soft micelle directing method, monomicelles could be classified into four types, i.e., the Pluronic&#8208;type block copolymer monomicelles, laboratory&#8208;synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers monomicelles, the single&#8208;molecule star&#8208;shaped block copolymer monomicelles, and the small&#8208;molecule anionic/cationic surfactant monomicelles. This paper also reviews the functionalization of the inner mesopores and the outer surfaces, which includes constructing the yolkshell structures (encapsulated nanoparticles), anchoring the active components packed on the shell and building an asymmetric Janus architecture. Then, several representative applications, involving catalysis, energy storage, and biomedicines are presented. Finally, the prospects and challenges of controlled synthesis and large&#8208;scale applications of ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles in the future are foreseen.

         <dc:description>
This study summarizes the recent discovery on how to convert, in one pot, non&#8208;toxic earth&#8208;abundant precursors into nanostructures at the kilogram scale at temperatures &lt;100&#160;&#176;C and under ambient pressures. MnO2, 2D birnessite flakes, Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and titanate 1D nanofilaments are synthesized; the latter is a new form of TiO2 that exhibits quantum confinement and has a host of applications.








Abstract
Metal oxide nanostructures have received an increasing attention owing to their unique chemical and physical properties along with their widespread applications in various fields. This article provides an overview of the recent discovery &#8211; christened Hydroxides&#8208;Derived Nanostructures, or HDNs &#8211; in which hydroxide aqueous solutions (mostly tetramethylammonium hydroxide, TMAH) are reacted at temperatures &lt; 100&#160;&#176;C and under atmospheric pressure with various metal&#8208;containing precursors to scalably prepare novel metal oxide nanostructures. In one case, a dozen commercial and earth abundant Ti&#8208;containing powders such as binary carbides, nitrides, borides, among others, are converted into new, 1D TiO2&#8208;based lepidocrocite (1DL) nanofilaments (NFs). Application&#8208;wise, the 1DLs show outstanding performance in a number of energy, environmental, and biomedical fields such as photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis, water splitting, lithium&#8211;sulfur and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, water purification, dye degradation, cancer therapy, and polymer composites. In addition to 1DL, the HDNs family encompasses other metal oxides nanostructures including magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and MnO2 birnessite&#8208;based crystalline 2D flakes. The latter showed promise in electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications. The developed recipe provides a new vista in the molecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of nanomaterials that can advance the field with a library of novel nanostructures with substantial implications in a multitude of fields.

Lithium&#8208;based batteries (LBBs) have been highly researched and recognized as a mature electrochemical energy storage (EES) system in recent years. However, their stability and effectiveness are primarily confined to room temperature conditions. At temperatures significantly below 0&#160;&#176;C or above 60&#160;&#176;C, LBBs experience substantial performance degradation. Under such challenging extreme contexts, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a promising complementary technology, distinguished by their fast dynamics at low&#8208;temperature regions and superior safety under elevated temperatures. Notably, developing SIBs suitable for wide&#8208;temperature usage still presents significant challenges, particularly for specific applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and deep&#8208;space/polar explorations, which requires a thorough understanding of how SIBs perform under different temperature conditions. By reviewing the development of wide&#8208;temperature SIBs, the influence of temperature on the parameters related to battery performance, such as reaction constant, charge transfer resistance, etc., is systematically and comprehensively analyzed. The review emphasizes challenges encountered by SIBs in both low and high temperatures while exploring recent advancements in SIB materials, specifically focusing on strategies to enhance battery performance across diverse temperature ranges. Overall, insights gained from these studies will drive the development of SIBs that can handle the challenges posed by diverse and harsh climates.

A distinct connection between the physical properties of these catalysts, such as size, degree of unsaturation, electronic structure, and oxidation state, and their impacts on catalytic behavior and efficacy in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. In&#8208;depth comparative analysis of metal NPs and SACs is conducted focusing on how particle size variations and metal&#8208;support interactions affect oxidation species and pathways. The review highlights the cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, indispensable for deciphering the complex electronic and structural characteristics of active sites in downsized metal particles. Additionally, the review underscores innovative strategies for immobilizing these catalysts onto membrane surfaces, offering a solution to the inherent challenges of powdered catalysts. Recent advances in pilot&#8208;scale or engineering applications of Fenton&#8208;like&#8208;based devices are also summarized for the first time. The paper concludes by charting new research directions, emphasizing advanced catalyst design, precise identification of reactive oxygen species, and in&#8208;depth mechanistic studies. These efforts aim to enhance the application potential of nanotechnology&#8208;based AOPs in real&#8208;world wastewater treatment.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
The organic&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskite materials have emerged as highly promising contenders in the field of photovoltaic technology, offering exceptional efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics hinges on successfully transitioning from lab&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells to large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs). However, the efficiency of PSMs significantly diminishes with increasing device area, impeding commercial viability. Central to achieving high&#8208;efficiency PSMs is fabricating uniform functional films and optimizing interfaces to minimize energy loss. In this review, we shed light on the path towards large&#8208;scale PSMs, emphasizing the pivotal role of integrating cutting&#8208;edge scientific research with industrial technology. By exploring scalable deposition techniques and optimization strategies, we reveal the advancements and challenges in fabricating large&#8208;area perovskite films. Subsequently, we delve into the architecture and contact materials of PSMs while addressing pertinent interface issues. Crucially, we analyze efficiency loss during scale&#8208;up and stability risks encountered by PSMs. Furthermore, we highlight the advancements in industrial efforts towards perovskite commercialization, emphasizing the perspective of PSMs in revolutionizing renewable energy. By highlighting the scientific and technical challenges in developing PSMs, we stress the importance of combining science and industry to drive their industrialization and pave the way for future advancements.

         <title>Topological Quantum Switching Enabled Neuroelectronic Synaptic Modulators for Brain Computer Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrating a developed synaptic neuroelectronic device using Bi2Se2Te quantum topological insulator marks a significant advancement in neuromorphic technology for rehabilitating neurological disorders through brain&#8211;computer interfaced neuroprosthetics. It demonstrates controlled brain synchronization and enhanced memory functions, offering a novel approach to mitigating the effects of aging and neurological disorders.








Abstract
Aging and genetic&#8208;related disorders in the human brain lead to impairment of daily cognitive functions. Due to their neural synaptic complexity and the current limits of knowledge, reversing these disorders remains a substantial challenge for brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCI). In this work, a solution is provided to potentially override aging and neurological disorder&#8208;related cognitive function loss in the human brain through the application of the authors&#8217; quantum synaptic device. To illustrate this point, a quantum topological insulator (QTI) Bi2Se2Te&#8208;based synaptic neuroelectronic device, where the electric field&#8208;induced tunable topological surface edge states and quantum switching properties make them a premier option for establishing artificial synaptic neuromodulation approaches, is designed and developed. Leveraging these unique quantum synaptic properties, the developed synaptic device provides the capability to neuromodulate distorted neural signals, leading to the reversal of age&#8208;related disorders via BCI. With the synaptic neuroelectronic characteristics of this device, excellent efficacy in treating cognitive neural dysfunctions through modulated neuromorphic stimuli is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, real&#8208;time neuromodulation of electroencephalogram (EEG) deduced distorted event&#8208;related potentials (ERP) is demonstrated by modulation of the synaptic device array.

         <title>Photostrictive Actuators Based on Freestanding Ferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates the application of photostriction to wirelessly drive freestanding ferroelectric membranes as resonators/actuators. Photoexcited electrons screen the ferroelectric polarization generating an in&#8208;plane strain: the underlying mechanism behind photostriction. Consequently, ferroelectric membranes exhibit orders of magnitude larger responses than non&#8208;ferroelectric ones. The findings provide significant insight for future applications in optical micro&#8208;electromechanical systems and&#160;sensors using ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Complex oxides offer a wide range of functional properties, and recent advances in the fabrication of freestanding membranes of these oxides are adding new mechanical degrees of freedom to this already rich functional ecosystem. Here, photoactuation is demonstrated in freestanding thin film resonators of ferroelectric Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and paraelectric Strontium Titanate (SrTiO3). The free&#8208;standing films, transferred onto perforated supports, act as nano&#8208;drums, oscillating at their natural resonance frequency when illuminated by a frequency&#8208;modulated laser. The light&#8208;induced deflections in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 membranes are two orders of magnitude larger than in the paraelectric SrTiO3 ones. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;diffraction under illumination and temperature&#8208;dependent holographic interferometry provide combined evidence for the photostrictive strain in BaTiO3 originating from a partial screening of ferroelectric polarization by photo&#8208;excited carriers, which decreases the tetragonality of the unit cell. These findings showcase the potential of photostrictive freestanding ferroelectric films as wireless actuators operated by&#160;light.

         <title>Simple Sol&#8208;Gel Protein Stabilization toward Rainbow and White Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new synthetic method for the production of silica&#8208;encapsulated protein nanomaterials without the use of organic solvents or surfactants is reported. The new pathway simplifies the procedure, allowing for less stable proteins to be used. Single&#8208;layer coatings based on several fluorescent proteins for white/rainbow lighting applications are fabricated, with improved efficiencies and stabilities.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are heralded as a paradigm of sustainable materials for photonics/optoelectronics. However, their stabilization under non&#8208;physiological environments and/or harsh operation conditions is the major challenge. Among the FP&#8208;stabilization methods, classical sol&#8208;gel is the most effective, but less versatile, as most of the proteins/enzymes are easily degraded due to the need of multi&#8208;step processes, surfactants, and mixed water/organic solvents in extreme pH. Herein, sol&#8208;gel chemistry with archetypal FPs (mGreenLantern; mCherry) is revisited, simplifying the method by one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and aqueous media (phosphate buffer saline pH&#160;=&#160;7.4). The synthesis mechanism involves the direct reaction of the carboxylic groups at the FP surface with the silica precursor, generating a positively charged FP intermediate that acts as a seed for the formation of size&#8208;controlled mesoporous FP@SiO2 nanoparticles. Green&#8208;/red&#8208;emissive (single&#8208;FP component) and dual&#8208;emissive (multi&#8208;FPs component; kinetic studies not required) FP@SiO2 are prepared without affecting the FP photoluminescence and stabilities (&gt;6&#160;months) under dry storage and organic solvent suspensions. Finally, FP@SiO2 color filters are applied to rainbow and white bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes featuring up to 15&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities without reducing luminous efficacy compared to references with native FPs. Overall, an easy, versatile, and effective FP&#8208;stabilization method is demonstrated in FP@SiO2 toward sustainable protein lighting.

         <title>Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles with Differential Organ Selectivity for Drug Delivery and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) is constructed as a platform enabling identification of organ&#8208;targeting drug delivery by systematic in vivo screening. The identified GlyNP hits show preferential accumulation in the target organ as well as cellular tropism within the target organ. When liver&#8208;, kidney&#8208;, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits are equipped with therapeutics, the formulations effectively alleviate symptoms in organ&#8208;associated disease models.








Abstract
Organ&#8208;selective drug delivery is expected to maximize the efficacy of various therapeutic modalities while minimizing their systemic toxicity. Lipid nanoparticles and polymersomes can direct the organ&#8208;selective delivery of mRNAs or gene editing machineries, but their delivery is limited to mostly liver, spleen, and lung. A platform that enables delivery to these and other target organs is urgently needed. Here, a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) comprising five randomly combined sugar moieties is generated, and direct in vivo library screening is used to identify GlyNPs with preferential biodistribution in liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain. Each organ&#8208;targeting GlyNP hit show cellular tropism within the organ. Liver, kidney, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits equipped with therapeutics effectively can alleviate the symptoms of acetaminophen&#8208;induced liver injury, cisplatin&#8208;induced kidney injury, and immune thrombocytopenia in mice, respectively. Furthermore, the differential organ targeting of GlyNP hits is influenced not by the protein corona but by the sugar moieties displayed on their surface. It is envisioned that the GlyNP&#8208;based platform may enable the organ&#8208; and cell&#8208;targeted delivery of therapeutic cargoes.

         <title>In&#8208;Synthesis Se&#8208;Stabilization Enables Defect and Doping Engineering of HgTe Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy is developed for HgTe colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), enabling enhanced colloidal stability, doping tuning and improved passivation. This translated into greatly improved device performance and stability.








Abstract
Colloidal Quantum Dots (CQDs) of mercury telluride (HgTe) hold particular appeal for infrared photodetection due to their widely tunable infrared absorption and good compatibility with silicon electronics. While advances in surface chemistry have led to improved CQD solids, the chemical stability of HgTe material is not fully emphasized. In this study, it is aimed to address this issue and identifies a Se&#8208;stabilization strategy based on the surface coating of Se on HgTe CQDs via engineering in the precursor reactivity. The presence of Se&#8208;coating enables HgTe CQDs with improved colloidal stability, passivation, and enhanced degree of freedom in doping tuning. This enables the construction of optimized p&#8208;i&#8208;n HgTe CQD infrared photodetectors with an ultra&#8208;low dark current 3.26 &#215; 10&#8722;6 A&#160;cm&#8315;2 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V and room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity of 5.17 &#215; 1011 Jones at wavelength &#8776;2 um, approximately one order of magnitude improvement compared to that of the control device. The stabilizing effect of Se is well preserved in the thin film state, contributing to much improved device stability. The in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy highlights the importance of the chemical stability of materials for the construction of semiconductor&#8208;grade CQD solids and may have important implications for other high&#8208;performance CQD optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Room Temperature Polariton Condensation from Whispering Gallery Modes in CsPbBr3 Microplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room temperature polariton condensate presents unprecedented prospects for the development of novel photonics devices. Using perovskite materials offers distinct advantages including ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. Synthesizing CsPbBr3 microplatelets using low&#8208;cost capillary bridge methods enables not only the formation of whispering gallery modes, but also the onset of polariton condensation at low thresholds.








Abstract
Room temperature (RT) polariton condensate holds exceptional promise for revolutionizing various fields of science and technology, encompassing optoelectronics devices to quantum information processing. Using perovskite materials, like all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) single crystal, provides additional advantages, such as ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. In this work, the formation of whispering gallery modes (WGM) in CsPbBr3 single crystals with controlled geometry is shown, synthesized using a low&#8208;cost and efficient capillary bridge method. Through the implementation of microplatelets geometry, enhanced optical properties and performance are achieved due to the presence of sharp edges and a uniform surface, effectively avoiding non&#8208;radiative scattering losses caused by defects. This allows not only to observe strong light matter coupling and formation of whispering gallery polaritons, but also to demonstrate the onset of polariton condensation at RT. This investigation not only contributes to the advancement of the knowledge concerning the exceptional optical properties of perovskite&#8208;based polariton systems, but also unveils prospects for the exploration of WGM polariton condensation within the framework of a 3D perovskite&#8208;based platform, working at RT. The unique characteristics of polariton condensate, including low excitation thresholds and ultrafast dynamics, open up unique opportunities for advancements in photonics and optoelectronics&#160;devices.

         <title>Robust Chemiresistive Behavior in Conductive Polymer/MOF Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described in this study is a hybridization strategy combining conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymers for improved gas sensing. Significant enhancements in sensor recovery kinetics, cycling stability, and dynamic range at room temperature are demonstrated. Mechanistic insights into energy band alignments and sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions reported here are promising toward future high&#8208;performance chemiresistors as well as novel electronic devices based on polymer/MOF composites.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single&#8208;use detection. A hybridization strategy is demonstrated synergistically deploying conductive MOFs (cMOFs) and conductive polymers (cPs) as two complementary mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors in high&#8208;performing stand&#8208;alone chemiresistors. This work presents significant improvement in i) sensor recovery kinetics, ii) cycling stability, and iii) dynamic range at room temperature. The effect of hybridization across well&#8208;studied cMOFs is demonstrated based on 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) ligands with varied metal nodes (Co, Cu, Ni). A comprehensive mechanistic study is conducted to relate energy band alignments at the heterojunctions between the MOFs and the polymer with sensing thermodynamics and binding kinetics. The findings reveal that hole enrichment of the cMOF component upon hybridization leads to selective enhancement in desorption kinetics, enabling significantly improved sensor recovery at room temperature, and thus long&#8208;term response retention. This mechanism is further supported by density functional theory calculations on sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions. It is also found that alloying cPs and cMOFs enables facile thin film co&#8208;processing and device integration, potentially unlocking the use of these hybrid conductors in diverse electronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single-use detection.

         <title>Dismantlable Coronated Nanoparticles for Coupling the Induction and Perception of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dismantlable coronated nanoparticles are fabricated as spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction to immune perception. The covalently cross&#8208;linked antibody corona shell disassembles in the tumor microenvironment, enables dual ICD modulations within tumor cells and on dendritic cell surfaces, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in breast and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Therapy&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses for amplified anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. However, dying cell&#8208;released ICD signals are prone to being sequestered by the TIM&#8208;3 receptors on dendritic cell (DC) surfaces, preventing immune surveillance. Herein, dismantlable coronated nanoparticles (NPs) are fabricated as a type of spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling tumor cell&#8208;mediated ICD induction to DC&#8208;mediated immune sensing. These NPs are loaded with an ICD inducer, mitoxantrone (MTO), and wrapped by a redox&#8208;labile anti&#8208;TIM&#8208;3 (&#945;TIM&#8208;3) antibody corona, forming a separable core&#8211;shell structure. The antibody corona disintegrates under high levels of extracellular reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment, exposing the MTO&#8208;loaded NP core for ICD induction and releasing functional &#945;TIM&#8208;3 molecules for DC sensitization. Systemic administration of the coronated NPs augments DC maturation, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, enhances tumor susceptibility to immune checkpoint blockade, and prevents the side effects of MTO. This study develops a promising nanoplatform to unleash the potential of host immunity in cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Therapy-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses for amplified anti-tumor efficacy. However, dying cell-released ICD signals are prone to being sequestered by the TIM-3 receptors on dendritic cell (DC) surfaces, preventing immune surveillance.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Pressure&#8208;Dependent Programmable Mechanical Metamaterial with Self&#8208;Sealing Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sealing is a fascinating function in living systems, essential for immediate response to damage. The self&#8208;sealing principle found in the plant model of Delosperma cooperi has inspired the design of mechanical metamaterial that can react autonomously to induced damage. By harnessing the internal pressure, the presented metamaterial is capable of closing cracks, facilitating favorable conditions for a potential subsequent self&#8208;healing process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sealing is one of the fascinating functions in nature that enables living material systems to respond immediately to damage. A prime plant model is Delosperma cooperi, which can rapidly self&#8208;seal damaged succulent leaves by systematically deforming until the wound closes. Inspired by this self&#8208;sealing principle, a novel programmable mechanical metamaterial has been developed to mimic the underlying damage management concept. This material is able to react autonomously to changes in its physical condition caused by an induced damage. To design this ability into the programmable metamaterial, a permeable unit cell design has been developed that can change size depending on the internal pressure. The parameter space and associated mechanical functionality of the unit cell design is simulated and analyzed under periodic boundary conditions and various pressures. The principles of self&#8208;sealing behavior in designed metamaterials are investigated, crack closure efficiency is identified for different crack lengths, the limitations of the proposed approach are discussed, and successful crack closure is experimentally demonstrated in the fabricated metamaterial. Although this study facilitates the first step on the way of integrating new bio&#8208;inspired principles in the metamaterials, the results show how programmable mechanical metamaterials might extend materials design space from pure properties to life&#8208;like&#160;abilities.

Here, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic is proposed for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. By varying the alkane ligand length and density on the surface of inorganic nanoparticles, the ligand&#8208;directed spatial regulation tailored structures, properties, and functionalities, thus championing the progressive development of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) are an emerging category of multifunctional nanomaterials with vast potential applications. The spatial arrangement and positioning of AIEgens and inorganic compounds in AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs determine the structures, properties, and functionalities of the self&#8208;assembled nanomaterials. In this work, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs is proposed by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. As a proof of concept, the self&#8208;assembly and structural evolution of plasmonic&#8208;fluorescent hybrid nanoparticles (PFNPs) from concentric circle to core shell and then to Janus structures is demonstrated by using alkane chain&#8208;modified AuNPs and AIEgens as building blocks. The spatial position of AuNPs in the signal nanocomposite is controlled by varying the alkane ligand length and density on the AuNP surface. The mechanism behind the formation of various PFNP nanostructures is also elucidated through experiments and theoretical simulation. The obtained PFNPs with diverse structures exhibit spatially tunable optical and photothermal properties for advanced applications in multicolor and multimode immunolabeling and photothermal sterilization. This work presents an innovative synthetic approach of constructing AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs with diverse structures, compositions, and functionalities, thereby championing the progressive development of these OINPs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP), which integrates forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets integrated onto thermally drawn polymer fibers, is presented with an emphasis on its manufacturing novelty and in vivo capabilities: 1) Easy fabrication techniques resulting in structurally aligned fiber implants; 2) Versatile and reliable in vivo performance; 3) Robust long&#8208;term operation in vivo system.








Abstract
Neural probe engineering is a dynamic field, driving innovation in neuroscience and addressing scientific and medical demands. Recent advancements involve integrating nanomaterials to improve performance, aiming for sustained in vivo functionality. However, challenges persist due to size, stiffness, complexity, and manufacturing intricacies. To address these issues, a neural interface utilizing freestanding CNT&#8208;sheets drawn from CNT&#8208;forests integrated onto thermally drawn functional polymer fibers is proposed. This approach yields a device with structural alignment, resulting in exceptional electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties while retaining biocompatibility for prolonged periods of implantation. This Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP) employing forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets demonstrates in vivo capabilities in neural recording, neurotransmitter detection, and brain/spinal cord circuit manipulation via optogenetics, maintaining functionality for over a year post&#8208;implantation. The straightforward fabrication method's versatility, coupled with the device's functional reliability, underscores the significance of this technique in the next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;based implants. Moreover, the device's longevity and multifunctionality position it as a promising platform for long&#8208;term neuroscience research.

The straightforward fabrication method's versatility, coupled with the device's functional reliability, underscores the significance of this technique in the next-generation carbon-based implants. Moreover, the device's longevity and multifunctionality position it as a promising platform for long-term neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Lubricating, Living Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A living hydrogel with embedded biofactories of hyaluronic acid allows the development of contact lens prototypes with permanent self&#8208;lubrication and full transparency. Lubricant release is adjusted by the mechanical and diffusional properties of the hydrogel and regulated by the availability of nutrients in simulated tear fluid.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of dry eye syndrome in aging and digital societies compromises long&#8208;term contact lens (CL) wear and forces users to regular eye drop instillation to alleviate discomfort. Here a novel approach with the potential to improve and extend the lubrication properties of CLs is presented. This is achieved by embedding lubricant&#8208;secreting biofactories within the CL material. The self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs autonomously produce and release hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural lubrication and wetting agent, long term. The hydrogel matrix regulates the growth of the biofactories and the HA production, and allows the diffusion of nutrients and HA for at least 3 weeks. The continuous release of HA sustainably reduces the friction coefficient of the CL surface. A self&#8208;lubricating CL prototype is presented, where the functional biofactories are contained in a functional ring at the lens periphery, outside of the vision area. The device is cytocompatible and fulfils physicochemical requirements of commercial CLs. The fabrication process is compatible with current manufacturing processes of CLs for vision correction. It is envisioned that the durable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach in living CL could enable long&#8208;term wear comfort for CL users and minimize the need for lubricating eye drops.

         <title>A Biohybrid Self&#8208;Dispersing Miniature Machine Using Wild Oat Fruit Awns for Reforestation and Precision Agriculture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plant&#8208;inspired, miniaturized, autonomous hybrid machine mimicking Avena fruits (called HybriBot) is proposed. It combines a biodegradable cargo capsule with two natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological actuators. HybriBot can navigate soil irregularities, achieving forces comparable to natural counterparts, and is functionalized with fertilizers and seeds, successfully germinating diaspores for applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.








Abstract
Advances in bioinspired and biohybrid robotics are enabling the creation of multifunctional systems able to explore complex unstructured environments. Inspired by Avena fruits, a biohybrid miniaturized autonomous machine (HybriBot) composed of a biomimetic biodegradable capsule as cargo delivery system and natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological motors is reported. Microcomputed tomography, molding via two&#8208;photon polymerization and casting of natural awns into biodegradable materials is employed to fabricate multiple HybriBots capable of exploring various soil and navigating soil irregularities, such as holes and cracks. These machines replicate the dispersal movements and biomechanical performances of natural fruits, achieving comparable capsule drag forces up to &#8776;0.38 N and awns torque up to &#8776;100 mN mm&#8722;1. They are functionalized with fertilizer and are successfully utilized to germinate selected diaspores. HybriBots function as self&#8208;dispersed systems with applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.

         <title>A Versatile Synthesis Platform Based on Polymer Cubosomes for a Library of Highly Ordered Nanoporous Metal Oxides Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles with different compositions and periodicity is designed and synthesized via a general and flexible polymer cubosome templating strategy. Due to their favorable porosity and rich active sites, the obtained nanoporous metal oxides, for example, tungsten oxides exhibit excellent gas sensing performances to low&#8208;concentration H2S.








Abstract
Polymer cubosomes (PCs) have well&#8208;defined inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases formed by amphiphilic block copolymer bilayers. The open hydrophilic channels, large periods, and robust physical properties of PCs are advantageous to many host&#8211;guest interactions and yet not fully exploited, especially in the fields of functional nanomaterials. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene block copolymers is systematically investigated and a series of robust PCs is developed via a cosolvent method. Ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles are obtained by selectively filling the hydrophilic channels of PCs via an impregnation strategy, followed by a two&#8208;step thermal treatment. Based on this versatile PC platform, the general synthesis of a library of ordered porous particles with different pore structures 3&#175;$\bar{3}$ 3&#175;$\bar{3}$, tunable large pore size (18&#8211;78&#160;nm), high specific surface areas (up to 123.3&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 for WO3) and diverse framework compositions, such as transition and non&#8208;transition metal oxides, rare earth chloride oxides, perovskite, pyrochlore, and high&#8208;entropy metal oxides is demonstrated. As typical materials obtained via this method, ordered porous WO3 particles have the advantages of open continuous structure and semiconducting properties, thus showing superior gas sensing performances toward hydrogen sulfide.

         <title>Eliminating the Adverse Impact of Composition Modulation in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes toward Ultra&#8208;High Brightness and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The component modulation&#8208;induced ion doping of perovskite emitters and the underlying mechanism of the nature instability are revealed for FAPbI3&#8208;based NIR PeLEDs with excess organic halides. By eliminating adverse effects of the excessively incorporated organoammonium halides using a surface clean&#8208;assisted crosslinking strategy, a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an excellent half&#8208;lifetime of 106.1 h are achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Excess ammonium halides as composition additives are widely employed in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), aiming to achieve high performance by controlling crystallinity and passivating defects. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of whether excess organoammonium components affect the film physical/electrical properties and the resultant device instability is still lacking. Here, the trade&#8208;off between the performance and stability in high&#8208;efficiency formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based PeLEDs with excess ammonium halides is pointed, and the underlying mechanism is explored. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that excess halide salt&#8208;induced ion&#8208;doping largely alters the PeLEDs properties (e.g., carrier injection, field&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;drifting, defect physics, and phase stability). A surface clean assisted cross&#8208;linking strategy is demonstrated to eliminate the adverse impact of composition modulation and boost the operational stability without sacrificing the efficiency, achieving a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 (The highest value for FAPbI3 based PeLEDs), and a prolong lifetime of 106.1 h at large direct current density (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), concurrently. The findings uncovered an important link between excess halide salts and the device performance, providing a guideline for rational design of stable, bright, and high efficiency PeLEDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zn//COF Battery with UltraHigh Self&#8208;Charging Efficiency and Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient air self&#8208;charging Zn//COF&#8208;PTO battery is developed. COF&#8208;PTO spontaneously forms metal heterocyclic complexes with zinc ions (step 2) to promote the self&#8208;charging reaction (step 1), which is a mechanism similar to Le Chatelier's principle in chemical reactions. Therefore, Zn//COF&#8208;PTO batteries exhibit excellent self&#8208;charging efficiency (&#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (&#957;).








Abstract
Self&#8208;charging zinc batteries that combine energy harvesting technology with batteries are candidates for reliable self&#8208;charging power systems. However, the lack of rational materials design results in unsatisfactory self&#8208;charging performance. Here, a covalent organic framework containing pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone groups (COF&#8208;PTO) is reported as a cathode material for aqueous self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. The ordered channel structure of the COF&#8208;PTO provides excellent capacity retention of 98% after 18 000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;fast ion transfer. To visually assess the self&#8208;charging performance, two parameters, namely self&#8208;charging efficiency (self&#8208;charging discharge capacity/galvanostatic discharge capacity, &#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (total discharge capacity after cyclic self&#8208;charging/total cyclic self&#8208;charging time, &#957;), are proposed for performance evaluation. COF&#8208;PTO achieves an impressive &#951; of 96.9% and an &#957; of 30&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 self&#8208;charge capacity per hour in 100 self&#8208;charging cycles, surpassing the previous reports. Mechanism studies reveal the co&#8208;insertion of Zn2+ and H+ double ions in COF&#8208;PTO of self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. In addition, the C&#9552;N and C&#9552;O (on the benzene) in COF&#8208;PTO are ortho structures to each other, which can easily form metal heterocycles with Zn ions, thereby driving the forward progress of the self&#8208;charging reaction and enhancing the self&#8208;charging performance.

         <title>Entangled Mesh Hydrogels with Macroporous Topologies via Cryogelation for Rapid Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal network engineering is proposed to develop the entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs) with a distinct aerogel&#8208;like macroporous topology, exhibiting a significantly improved mass transport property compared with the conventional dense hydrogels&#160;by regular polymerization. As such, the hygroscopic EMHs deliver remarkably faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption kinetics, achieving high&#8208;performance sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising technology to alleviate freshwater scarcity. Recently, hygroscopic salt&#8208;hydrogel composites (HSHCs) have emerged as attractive candidates with their high water uptake, versatile designability, and scale&#8208;up fabrication. However, achieving high&#8208;performance SAWH applications for HSHCs has been challenging because of their sluggish kinetics, attributed to their limited mass transport properties. Herein, a universal network engineering of hydrogels using a cryogelation method is presented, significantly improving the SAWH kinetics of HSHCs. As a result of the entangled mesh confinements formed during cryogelation, a stable macroporous topology is attained and maintained within the obtained entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs), leading to significantly enhanced mass transport properties compared to conventional dense hydrogels (CDHs). With it, corresponding hygroscopic EMHs (HEMHs) simultaneously exhibit faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption. Consequently, a rapid&#8208;cycling HEMHs&#8208;based harvester delivers a practical freshwater production of 2.85 Lwater kgsorbents&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 via continuous eight sorption/desorption cycles, outperforming other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hydrogel&#8208;based sorbents. Significantly, the generalizability of this strategy is validated by extending it to other hydrogels used in HSHCs. Overall, this work offers a new approach to efficiently address long&#8208;standing challenges of sluggish kinetics in current HSHCs, promoting them toward the next&#8208;generation SAWH applications.

         <title>Stabilization of Lattice Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Oxophilic Ce&#8208;Mediated Bi/BiCeO1.8H Electrocatalysts for Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Bi/BiCeO1.8H containing under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms is proposed and demonstrated for lattice oxygen redox&#8208;catalyzed oxygen evolution electrocatalysts using a simple electrosynthesis. Bi/BiCeO1.8H&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V and catalytic stability for 100 h at a practically high current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) offers an efficient reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in energy storage and conversion systems. Owing to the involvement of active lattice oxygen enhancing electrochemical activity, addressing the structural and electrochemical stabilities of LOM materials is crucial. Herein, a heterostructure (Bi/BiCeO1.8H) containing abundant under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms having oxygen nonbonding states is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition method. Given the difference in reduction potentials between Bi and Ce, partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms are generated in BiCeO1.8H. It is found that the lattice oxygen can be activated as a reactant of the OER when the valence state of Bi increases to Bi5+, leading to increased metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and that the oxophilic Ce3+/4+ redox couple can maintain the Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over&#8208;oxidation of Bi. The anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Bi/BiCeO1.8H exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V even at a high practical current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the cell performance remains significantly stable over 100 h with only a 2.2% increase in the initial cell voltage, demonstrating sustainable lattice oxygen redox.

         <title>A Comprehensive Strategy Based on High Clinical Translational Nanosystem for Programmable Immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic of the multifunctional nanosystem (FeSH NPs) with high clinical translational potential preparation with sodium hyaluronate (HA), salvianolic acid B (SAB) and Fe3+, and their application in photothermal&#8208;immunotherapy are demonstrated. In particular, combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody is shown for comprehensive procedural therapy of immunologically cold tumors triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs).








Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs), known as an immunologically cold tumor, is difficult to completely eliminate with existing monotherapies, let alone metastasis and recurrence. It is urgent to design a rational combination of multiple therapies to programmatically reconstitute tumor microenvironment (TME) and reverse the immune &#8220;cold&#8221; into &#8220;hot&#8221; inflammatory tumors to improve the therapeutic effect. Hence, in this work, a multifunctional nanosystem (FeSH NPs) that integrates metal&#8208;polyphenol coordination complex as a photothermal agent and polyphenol, salvianolic acid B (SAB) as immunomodulator is designed and fabricated for synergistic photothermal&#8208;immunotherapy of TNBCs combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody. Guided by photothermal/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode imaging, photothermal therapy (PTT) caused by FeSH NPs induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, the loaded SAB is released with the addition of deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) to remodel TME, specifically TGF&#8208;&#946; inhibition and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation, and eliminate the primary tumors. The combination of PTT and TME reprogramming by FeSH NPs further synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate recurrence and inhibit metastasis of TNBCs concurrently. Given the biosafety of FeSH NPs throughout the lifecycle, this work provides a protocol with high clinical translational promise for comprehensive programmed therapeutics of immunologically cold tumors TNBCs.

         <title>Intrahippocampal Supramolecular Assemblies Directed Bioorthogonal Liberation of Neurotransmitters to Suppress Seizures in Freely Moving Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imbalance between neuronal inhibition and excitation may lead to the onset of epilepsy. In this study, bioorthogonal decaging reactions and photolysis enable on&#8208;demand drug release to address the deficiency of an inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) during seizure symptoms. Such a spatiotemporal&#8208;controlled drug delivery system is applicable for managing epileptic seizures with an unprovoked nature.








Abstract
The precise delivery of anti&#8208;seizure medications (ASM) to epileptic loci remains the major challenge to treat epilepsy without causing adverse drug reactions. The unprovoked nature of epileptic seizures raises the additional need to release ASMs in a spatiotemporal controlled manner. Targeting the oxidative stress in epileptic lesions, here the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in situ supramolecular assemblies that synergized bioorthogonal reactions to deliver inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) on&#8208;demand, are developed. Tetrazine&#8208;bearing assembly precursors undergo oxidation and selectively self&#8208;assemble under pathological conditions inside primary neurons and mice brains. Assemblies induce local accumulation of tetrazine in the hippocampus CA3 region, which allows the subsequent bioorthogonal release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. For induced acute seizures, the sustained release of GABA extends the suppression than the direct supply of GABA. In the model of permanent damage of CA3, bioorthogonal ligation on assemblies provides a reservoir of GABA that behaves prompt release upon 365&#160;nm irradiation. Incorporated with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microelectrode arrays, it is elucidated that the bioorthogonal release of GABA shifts the neuron spike waveforms to suppress seizures at the single&#8208;neuron precision. The strategy of in situ supramolecular assemblies&#8208;directed bioorthogonal prodrug activation shall be promising for the effective delivery of ASMs to treat epilepsy.

         <title>Observation of Omnidirectional Exchange Bias at All&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Polycrystalline Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exchange bias effect at an all&#8208;antiferromagnetic polycrystalline heterointerface is observed. The chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn works as the active layer, replacing conventional ferromagnets. The unidirectional magnetic anisotropy can be determined omnidirectionally due to the absence of the shape anisotropy. These findings are significant for developing various antiferromagnetic spintronic devices, including antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions, essential for ultrafast and ultra&#8208;power&#8208;efficient computing.








Abstract
Due to promising functionalities that may dramatically enhance spintronics performance, antiferromagnets are the subject of intensive research for developing the next&#8208;generation active elements to replace ferromagnets. In particular, the recent experimental demonstration of tunneling magnetoresistance and electrical switching using chiral antiferromagnets has sparked expectations for the practical integration of antiferromagnetic materials into device architectures. To further develop the technology to manipulate the magnetic anisotropies in all&#8208;antiferromagnetic devices, it is essential to realize exchange bias through the interface between antiferromagnetic multilayers. Here, the first observation on the omnidirectional exchange bias at an all&#8208;antiferromagnetic polycrystalline heterointerface is reported. This experiment demonstrates that the interfacial energy causing the exchange bias between the chiral&#8208;antiferromagnet Mn3Sn/collinear&#8208;antiferromagnet MnN layers is comparable to those found at the conventional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface at room temperature. In sharp contrast with previous reports using ferromagnets, the magnetic field control of the unidirectional anisotropy is found to be omnidirectional due to the absence of the shape anisotropy in the antiferromagnetic multilayer. The realization of the omnidirectional exchange bias at the interface between polycrystalline antiferromagnets on amorphous templates, highly compatible with existing Si&#8208;based devices, paves the way for developing ultra&#8208;low power and ultra&#8208;high speed memory devices based on antiferromagnets.

         <title>Multiphase Under&#8208;Liquid Biofabrication With Living Soft Matter: A Route to Customize Functional Architectures With Microbial Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under&#8208;liquid biofabrication utilizes oxygen transport through an oil phase to sustain aerobic bacterial activity at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. This technique combines multiphase systems with living matter to open new opportunities to advance cellulose&#8208;based architectures through soft templating, including those based on capsules, porous materials, filaments, layered film composites, and Janus membranes.








Abstract
The growth of aerobic microbes at air&#8211;water interfaces typically leads to biofilm formation. Herein, a fermentative alternative that relies on oil&#8211;water interfaces to support bacterial activity and aerotaxis is introduced. The process uses under&#8208;liquid biofabrication by structuring bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) to achieve tailorable architectures. Cellulose productivity in static conditions is first evaluated using sets of oil homologues, classified in order of polarity. The oils are shown for their ability to sustain bacterial growth and BNC production according to air transfer and solubilization, both of which impact the physiochemical properties of the produced biofilms. The latter are investigated in terms of their morphological (fibril size and network density), structural (crystallinity) and physical&#8211;mechanical (surface area and strength) features. The introduced under&#8208;liquid biofabrication is demonstrated for the generation of BNC&#8208;based macroscale architectures and compartmentalized soft matter. This can be accomplished following three different routes, namely, 3D under&#8208;liquid networking (multi&#8208;layer hydrogels/composites), emulsion templating (capsules, emulgels, porous materials), and anisotropic layering (Janus membranes). Overall, the proposed platform combines living matter and multi&#8208;phase systems as a robust option for material development with relevance in biomedicine, soft robotics, and bioremediation, among others.

         <title>Knotted Artificial Muscles for Bio&#8208;Mimetic Actuation under Deepwater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of artificial muscles is proposed from intricately knotted liquid crystal elastomer fibers, capable of high stroke, and fast linear contractions. These muscles remain functional even when significantly damaged or submerged at depths of 3000 meters underwater, mirroring the remarkable robustness and adaptability of their natural counterparts.








Abstract
Muscles featuring high frequency and high stroke linear actuation are essential for animals to achieve superior maneuverability, agility, and environmental adaptability. Artificial muscles are yet to match their biological counterparts, due to inferior actuation speed, magnitude, mode, or adaptability. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural muscles, artificial muscles are created that are powerful, responsive, robust, and adaptable. The artificial muscles consist of knots braided from 3D printed liquid crystal elastomer fibers and thin heating threads. The unique hierarchical, braided knot structure offers amplified linear stroke, force rate, and damage&#8208;tolerance, as verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. In particular, the square knotted artificial muscle shows reliable cycles of actuation at 1Hz in 3000m depth underwater. Potential application is demonstrated by propelling a model boat. Looking ahead, the knotted artificial muscles can empower novel biomedical devices and soft robots to explore various environments, from inside human body to the mysterious deep&#160;sea.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Free and Hierarchical Porous Triboelectric Scaffold with Dynamic Hydrophilicity for Efficient Cartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs). During degradation, the TESs exhibit hydrophilicity on the surface for tissue regeneration while hydrophobicity in interior micropores for triboelectric therapy. TESs provide a new platform technology for tissue engineering. The device design successfully addresses the challenge of encapsulation&#8208;free triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) in vivo and will broaden their applications.








Abstract
Tissue engineering and electrotherapy are two promising methods to promote tissue repair. However, their integration remains an underexplored area, because their requirements on devices are usually distinct. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have shown great potential to develop self&#8208;powered devices. However, due to their susceptibility to moisture, TENGs have to be encapsulated in vivo. Therefore, existing TENGs cannot be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds, which require direct interaction with surrounding cells. Here, the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs) is proposed. Poly(glycerol sebacate), a biodegradable and relatively hydrophobic elastomer, is selected as the matrix of TESs. Each hydrophobic micropore in multi&#8208;hierarchical porous TESs efficiently serves as a moisture&#8208;resistant working unit of TENGs. Integration of tons of micropores ensures the electrotherapy ability of TESs in vivo without encapsulation. Originally hydrophobic TESs are degraded by surface erosion and transformed into hydrophilic surfaces, facilitating their role as tissue engineering scaffolds. Notably, TESs seeded with chondrocytes obtain dense and large matured cartilages after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Importantly, rabbits with osteochondral defects receiving TES implantation show favorable hyaline cartilage regeneration and complete cartilage healing. This work provides a promising electronic biomedical device and will inspire a series of new in vivo applications.

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have shown great potential to develop self-powered devices. However, due to their susceptibility to moisture, TENGs have to be encapsulated in vivo. Therefore, existing TENGs cannot be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds, which require direct interaction with surrounding cells. Here, the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs) is proposed. Poly(glycerol sebacate), a biodegradable and relatively hydrophobic elastomer, is selected as the matrix of TESs. Each hydrophobic micropore in multi-hierarchical porous TESs efficiently serves as a moisture-resistant working unit of TENGs. Integration of tons of micropores ensures the electrotherapy ability of TESs in vivo without encapsulation. Originally hydrophobic TESs are degraded by surface erosion and transformed into hydrophilic surfaces, facilitating their role as tissue engineering scaffolds. Notably, TESs seeded with chondrocytes obtain dense and large matured cartilages after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Importantly, rabbits with osteochondral defects receiving TES implantation show favorable hyaline cartilage regeneration and complete cartilage healing. This work provides a promising electronic biomedical device and will inspire a series of new in vivo applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Broadened Phase Boundary with Enhanced Amorphous Superconductivity in Pressurized In2Te5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the Gibbs phase rule, the degree of freedom at conventional phase boundaries is 1 (F = 1). By introducing an intermediate amorphous phase, a rare crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline transition is achieved and the sharp phase boundary is successfully expanded into a broad region (F = 2) in which the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is significantly enhanced.








Abstract
As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law free variables (F) = components (C) &#8211; phases (P) + 2. When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, the sharp phase boundary is expanded to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long&#8208;range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in situ synchrotron diffraction, it is elucidated that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge&#8208;like [Te3]2&#8722; trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25% increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is proposed revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder&#8208;augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.

         <title>Synergizing Fe2O3 Nanoparticles on Single Atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>

Here, the effectiveness of a novel active particle&#8208;active support Fe2O3/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is demonstrated for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption elucidates a reduction in surface Fe3+ to Fe0, during a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, significantly enhancing the NO3RR activity, enabling a partial current density up to 2 A cm&#8722;2 at near 100% efficiency.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrates (NO3&#8722;) enables a pathway for the carbon neutral synthesis of ammonia (NH3), via the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), which has been demonstrated at high selectivity. However, to make NH3 synthesis cost&#8208;competitive with current technologies, high NH3 partial current densities (jNH3) must be achieved to reduce the levelized cost of NH3. Here, the high NO3RR activity of Fe&#8208;based materials is leveraged to synthesize a novel active particle&#8208;active support system with Fe2O3 nanoparticles supported on atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. The optimized 3&#215;Fe2O3/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst demonstrates an ultrahigh NO3RR activity, reaching a maximum jNH3 of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 at a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 of 100% and an NH3 yield rate over 9 mmol hr&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Operando XANES and post&#8208;mortem XPS reveal the importance of a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, reducing the surface Fe2O3 (Fe3+) to highly active Fe0 sites, which are maintained during electrolysis. Durability studies demonstrate the robustness of both the Fe2O3 particles and Fe&#8211;Nx sites at highly cathodic potentials, maintaining a current of &#8722;1.3 A cm&#8722;2 over 24 hours. This work exhibits an effective and durable active particle&#8208;active support system enhancing the performance of the NO3RR, enabling industrially relevant current densities and near 100% selectivity.

         <title>Universal Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Direct Thermal Decomposition of Molten Salts for Boosting Acidic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of noble metal single atoms embedded in non&#8208;noble metal oxides are simply synthesized through the direct thermal decomposition of molten salts. The resultant single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability for both of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in acidic media.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered prominent materials in the field of catalysis due to their high metal atom utilization and selectivity. However, the wide&#8208;ranging applications of SACs remain a significant challenge due to their complex preparation processes. Here, a universal strategy is reported to prepare a series of noble metal single atoms on different non&#8208;noble metal oxides through a facile one&#8208;step thermal decomposition of molten salts. By using a mixture of non&#8208;noble metal nitrate and a small&#8208;amount noble metal chloride as the precursor, noble metal single atoms can be easily introduced into the non&#8208;noble metal oxide lattice owing to the cation exchange in the in situ formed molten salt, followed by the thermal decomposition of nitrate anions during the heating process. Analyses using aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirm the formation of the finely dispersed single atoms. Specially, the as&#8208;synthesized Ir single atoms (10.97 wt%) and Pt single atoms (4.60 wt%) on the Co3O4 support demonstrate outstanding electrocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Highly Stiff and Tough Shape Memory Polyurea with Unprecedented Energy Density by Precise Slight Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative approach utilizing a delicate balance of precise covalent bonds and hierarchical supramolecular interactions has resulted in an advanced shape memory polymer. This polymer boasts a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, and toughness, coupled with excellent resistance to humidity and heat, repairability, high energy density, and exceptional energy output, which allows for a wide range of potential applications.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have attracted significant attention and hold vast potential for diverse applications. Nevertheless, conventional SMPs suffer from notable shortcomings in terms of mechanical properties, environmental stability, and energy density, significantly constraining their practical utility. Here, inspired by the structure of muscle fibers, an innovative approach that involves the precise incorporation of subtle, permanent cross&#8208;linking within a hierarchical hydrogen bonding supramolecular network is reported. This novel strategy has culminated in the development of covalent and supramolecular shape memory polyurea, which exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, including high stiffness (1347&#160;MPa), strength (82.4&#160;MPa), and toughness (312.7&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), ensuring its suitability for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it boasts remarkable recyclability and repairability, along with excellent resistance to moisture, heat, and solvents. Moreover, the polymer demonstrates outstanding shape memory effects characterized by a high energy density (24.5&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), facilitated by the formation of strain&#8208;induced oriented nanostructures that can store substantial amounts of entropic energy. Simultaneously, it maintains a remarkable 96% shape fixity and 99% shape recovery. This delicate interplay of covalent and supramolecular bonds opens up a promising pathway to the creation of high&#8208;performance SMPs, expanding their applicability across various domains.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have attracted significant attention and hold vast potential for diverse applications. Nevertheless, conventional SMPs suffer from notable shortcomings in terms of mechanical properties, environmental stability, and energy density, significantly constraining their practical utility. Here, inspired by the structure of muscle fibers, an innovative approach that involves the precise incorporation of subtle, permanent cross-linking within a hierarchical hydrogen bonding supramolecular network is reported. This novel strategy has culminated in the development of covalent and supramolecular shape memory polyurea, which exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, including high stiffness (1347&#160;MPa), strength (82.4&#160;MPa), and toughness (312.7&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), ensuring its suitability for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it boasts remarkable recyclability and repairability, along with excellent resistance to moisture, heat, and solvents. Moreover, the polymer demonstrates outstanding shape memory effects characterized by a high energy density (24.5&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), facilitated by the formation of strain-induced oriented nanostructures that can store substantial amounts of entropic energy. Simultaneously, it maintains a remarkable 96% shape fixity and 99% shape recovery. This delicate interplay of covalent and supramolecular bonds opens up a promising pathway to the creation of high-performance SMPs, expanding their applicability across various domains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Impact of Local Strain Fields in Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of noncollinear antiferromagnets are highly sensitive to strain, including large local strain fields generated by dislocations. The influence of these on the global magnetization and transport properties is examined, finding that they enhance the magnetization but are deleterious to intrinsic properties important for application. This analysis is timely as efforts are made to integrate these materials into multilayer devices.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets hosting structural or magnetic order that breaks time reversal symmetry are of increasing interest for &#8220;beyond von Neumann&#8221; computing applications because the topology of their band structure allows for intrinsic physical properties, exploitable in integrated memory and logic function. One such group are the noncollinear antiferromagnets. Essential for domain manipulation is the existence of small net moments found routinely when the material is synthesized in thin film form and attributed to symmetry breaking caused by spin canting, either from the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction or from strain. Although the spin arrangement of these materials makes them highly sensitive to strain, there is little understanding about the influence of local strain fields caused by lattice defects on global properties, such as magnetization and anomalous Hall effect. This premise is investigated by examining noncollinear antiferromagnetic films that are either highly lattice mismatched or closely matched to their substrate. In either case, edge dislocation networks are generated and for the former case, these extend throughout the entire film thickness, creating large local strain fields. These strain fields allow for finite intrinsic magnetization in seemingly structurally relaxed films and influence the antiferromagnetic domain state and the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect.

         <title>Tailored Fabrication of Full&#8208;Color Ultrastable Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Carbon Dots Composites with Unexpected Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of carbon dots and urea that exhibit full&#8208;color, long&#8208;life, high&#8208;quantum yield, ultrastable, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, along with thermosensitive delayed fluorescence, are developed, and these are applied to higher&#8208;level information encryption and in vivo imaging. The precise control of the singlet&#8211;triplet splitting of carbon dots through precursor engineering introduces a new method to realize smart dual&#8208;channel afterglow materials.








Abstract
The development of single&#8208;system materials that exhibit both multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with tunable after glow colors and channels is challenging. In this study, four metal&#8208;free carbon dots (CDs) are developed through structural tailoring, and panchromatic high&#8208;brightness RTP is achieved via strong chemical encapsulation in urea. The maximum lifetime and quantum yield reaches 2141 ms and 56.55%, respectively. Moreover, CDs&#8208;IV@urea, prepared via coreshell interaction engineering, exhibits a dual afterglow of red RTP and green TADF. The degree of conjugation and functional groups of precursors affects the binding interactions of the nitrogen cladding on CDs, which in turn stabilizes triplet energy levels and affects the energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;EST) to induce multicolor RTP. The enhanced wrapping interaction lowers the &#916;EST, promoting reverse intersystem crossing, which leads to phosphorescence and TADF. This strong coreshell interaction fully stabilizes the triplet state, thus stabilizing the material in water, even in extreme environments such as strong acids and oxidants. These afterglow materials are tested in multicolor, time, and temperature multiencryption as well as in multicolor in vivo bioimaging. Hence, these materials have promising practical applications in information security as well as biomedical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Thermal Radiation Annealing for Overcoming Processing Temperature Limitation of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;thermal tolerance flexible perovskite solar cells with excellent mechanical stability are successfully achieved by a new thermal radiation annealing methodology, which aids in the vertical growth of perovskite grains, reduction of grain boundaries, and decrease of lattice mismatch. These microstructural improvements are essential in enhancing the performance of flexible perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Common polymeric conductive electrodes, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coated with indium tin oxide, face a major challenge due to their low processing&#8208;temperature limits, attributed to PET's low glass transition temperature (Tg) of (70&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C). This limitation significantly narrows the scope of material selection, limits the processing techniques applicable to the low Tg, and hinders the ripened technology transfer from glass substrates to them. Addressing the temperature constraints of the flexible substrates is impactful yet underexplored, with broader implications for fields beyond photovoltaics. Here, a new thermal radiation annealing methodology is introduced to address this issue. By applying the above Tg radiation annealing in conjunction with thermoelectric cooling, highly ordered molecular packing on PET substrates is successfully created, which is exclusively unachievable due to PET's low thermal tolerance. As a result, in the context of perovskite solar cells, this approach enables the circumvention of high&#8208;temperature annealing limitations of PET substrates, leading to a remarkable flexible device efficiency of 22.61% and a record fill factor of 83.42%. This approach proves especially advantageous for advancing the field of flexible optoelectronic devices.

         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;retardant all&#8208;solid&#8208;state metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) superionic conductor is constructed, incorporating multiple supramolecular interactions through the embedding of molten polar crystalline organic electrolyte into the anionic nanochannels. The distinctive nanochannels exhibit selective acceleration of Li+ transport within various negative electrostatic chemical environments, concurrently suppressing movement of anions, enabling stable operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state full cells under constrained conditions.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with outstanding comprehensive performance is currently a critical challenge for achieving high energy density and safer solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). In this study, a strategy of nano&#8208;confined in situ solidification is proposed to create a novel category of molten guest&#8208;mediated metal&#8211;organic frameworks, named MGM&#8211;MOFs. By embedding the newly developed molten crystalline organic electrolyte (ML20) into the nanocages of anionic MOF&#8211;OH, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH, characterized by multi&#8208;modal supramolecular interaction sites and continuous negative electrostatic environments within nano&#8208;channels, is achieved. These nanochannels promote ion transport through the successive hopping of Li+ between neighbored negative electrostatic environments and suppress anion movement through the chemical constraint of the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized pore wall. This results in remarkable Li+ conductivity of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and high Li+ transference number of 0.81. Leveraging these advantages, the SSBs assembled with MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH exhibit impressive cycle stability and a high specific energy density of 410.5&#160;Wh kganode + cathode + electrolyte&#8722;1 under constrained conditions and various working temperatures. Unlike flammable traditional MOFs, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH demonstrates high robustness under various harsh conditions, including ignition, high voltage, and extended to humidity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly for Creating Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices with Monolayer Graphene as Chiral Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices are created through a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly process, designed to generate optical chirality specifically in the terahertz (THz) range. The configuration of these vertical helices is predetermined and programmed prior to the assembly process. Once formed, the continuous monolayer graphene helices in this vertical alignment exhibit pronounced optical chirality, rendering them exceptionally suitable for applications within the THz spectrum.








Abstract
Graphene's emergence enables creating chiral metamaterials in helical shapes for terahertz (THz) applications, overcoming material limitations. However, practical implementation remains theoretical due to fabrication challenges. This paper introduces a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly technique that enables creating vertically&#8208;aligned continuous monolayer graphene helices at microscale with great flexibility and high controllability. This assembly process not only facilitates the creation of 3D microstructures, but also positions the 3D structures from a horizontal to a vertical orientation, achieving an aspect ratio (height/width) of &#8776;2700. As a result, an array of vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices is formed, reaching up to 4&#160;mm in height, which is equivalent to 4 million times the height of monolayer graphene. The benefit of these 3D chiral structures made from graphene is their capability to infinitely extend in height, interacting with light in ways that are not possible with traditional 2D layering methods. Such an impressive height elevates a level of interaction with light that far surpasses what is achievable with traditional 2D layering methods, resulting in a notable enhancement of optical chirality properties. This approach is applicable to various 2D materials, promising advancements in innovative research and diverse applications across fields.

         <title>Rapid Selenoprotein Activation by Selenium Nanoparticles to Suppresses Osteoclastogenesis and Pathological Bone Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the prompt activation of selenoproteins by lentinan&#8208;functionalized selenium nanoparticles to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss through upregulating GPx1 to repolarize macrophages. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive selenium species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders, with considerable potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Osteoclast hyperactivation stands as a significant pathological factor contributing to the emergence of bone disorders driven by heightened oxidative stress levels. The modulation of the redox balance to scavenge reactive oxygen species emerges as a viable approach to addressing this concern. Selenoproteins, characterized by selenocysteine (SeCys2) as the active center, are crucial for selenium&#8208;based antioxidative stress therapy for inflammatory diseases. This study reveals that surface&#8208;active elemental selenium (Se) nanoparticles, particularly lentinan&#8208;Se (LNT&#8208;Se), exhibit enhanced cellular accumulation and accelerated metabolism to SeCys2, the primary active Se form in biological systems. Consequently, LNT&#8208;Se demonstrates significant inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo studies underscore the superior therapeutic efficacy of LNT&#8208;Se over SeCys2, potentially attributable to the enhanced stability and safety profile of LNT&#8208;Se. Specifically, LNT&#8208;Se effectively modulates the expression of the selenoprotein GPx1, thereby exerting regulatory control over osteoclastogenesis inhibition, and the prevention of osteolysis. In summary, these results suggest that the prompt activation of selenoproteins by Se nanoparticles serves to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss by upregulating GPx1. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive Se species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Ionic&#8208;Conductive Covalent Organic Framework Fibers for Capturing of Sustainable Osmotic Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D covalent organic framework (COF) fibers obtained by processing of COF dispersions using a wet spinning technique: Dispersions of 2D COFs are continuously processed into flexible solid fibers on a large scale using a wet spinning approach. These COF fibers with excellent tensile properties exhibit good performance for the capture of osmotic energy as ionic conductors.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance covalent organic framework (COF) fibers are demanded for an efficient capturing of blue osmotic power because of their excellent durability, simple integration, and large scalability. However, the scalable production of COF fibers is still very challenging due to the poor solubility and fragile structure of COFs. Herein, for the first time, it is reported that COF dispersions can be continuously processed into macroscopic, meter&#8208;long, and pure COF fibers using a wet spinning approach. The two presented COF fibers can be directly used for capturing of osmotic energy, avoiding the production of composite materials that require other additives and face challenges such as phase separation and environmental issues induced by the additives. A COF fiber exhibits power densities of 70.2 and 185.3 W m&#8722;2 at 50&#8208;fold and 500&#8208;fold salt gradients, respectively. These values outperform those of most reported systems, which indicate the high potential of COF fibers for capturing of blue osmotic energy.

         <title>Annual Energy&#8208;Saving Smart Windows with Actively Controllable Passive Radiative Cooling and Multimode Heating Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This smart window not only achieves multistage passive radiative cooling (PRC) efficiency in hot climates but also possesses the capability to deal with complicated heating scenarios due to the combination of triple heating modes including passive radiative heating (PRH), solar heating (SH), and electric heating (EH), which provides a feasible way for on&#8208;demand thermal management and reducing year&#8208;round heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy loads.








Abstract
Smart windows with radiative heat management capability using the sun and outer space as zero&#8208;energy thermodynamic resources have gained prominence, demonstrating a minimum carbon footprint. However, realizing on&#8208;demand thermal management throughout all seasons while reducing fossil energy consumption remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an energy&#8208;efficient smart window that enables actively tunable passive radiative cooling (PRC) and multimode heating regulation is demonstrated by integrating the emission&#8208;enhanced polymer&#8208;dispersed liquid crystal (SiO2@PRC PDLC) film and a low&#8208;emission layer deposited with carbon nanotubes. Specifically, this device can achieve a temperature close to the chamber interior ambient under solar irradiance of 700&#160;W m&#8722;2, as well as a temperature drop of 2.3&#160;&#176;C at sunlight of 500&#160;W m&#8722;2, whose multistage PRC efficiency can be rapidly adjusted by a moderate voltage. Meanwhile, synchronous cooperation of passive radiative heating (PRH), solar heating (SH), and electric heating (EH) endows this smart window with the capability to handle complicated heating situations during cold weather. Energy simulation reveals the substantial superiority of this device in energy savings compared with single&#8208;layer SiO2@PRC PDLC, normal glass, and commercial low&#8208;E glass when applied in different climate zones. This work provides a feasible pathway for year&#8208;round thermal management, presenting a huge potential in energy&#8208;saving applications.

         <title>Tuneable Current Rectification Through a Designer Graphene Nanoribbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of substitutional boron dopants inside a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon localizes a positive&#8208;ion resonance within its bandgap, creating a double&#8208;barrier resonant electronic device. Electric transport through this single&#8208;molecule device suspended between tip and sample of a scanning tunneling microscope reveals unipolar resonant hole tunneling and a peculiar diode effect that can be tuned and reversed with tip&#8208;sample distance.








Abstract
Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic systems due to electron&#8208;hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule&#8208;metal interface. Here, a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally large rectification ratio (&gt;105) and reversible direction is presented. The molecular system comprises a seven&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic precision on a gold substrate by on&#8208;surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates half&#8208;populated in&#8208;gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscope and the substrate, unipolar hole transport is demonstrated through the boron in&#8208;gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic&#160;electronics.

&lt;p&gt;A pair of substitutional boron dopants inside a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon localizes a positive-ion resonance within its bandgap, creating a double-barrier resonant electronic device. Electric transport through this single-molecule device suspended between tip and sample of a scanning tunneling microscope reveals unipolar resonant hole tunneling and a peculiar diode effect that can be tuned and reversed with tip-sample distance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic systems due to electron-hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule-metal interface. Here, a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally large rectification ratio (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) and reversible direction is presented. The molecular system comprises a seven-armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic precision on a gold substrate by on-surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates half-populated in-gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope and the substrate, unipolar hole transport is demonstrated through the boron in-gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic&#160;electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Excellent Mechanical Performances and Magnetic Refrigeration via In Situ Forming Dual&#8208;Phase Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and straightforward method for preparing high&#8208;performance magnetocaloric effect (MCE) materials is proposed in this study. By employing a direct melting approach, the magnetocaloric phase precipitates within MCE intermetallic compounds. The prepared dual&#8208;phase alloy achieves a commendable equilibrium between refrigeration capacity and mechanical properties. This strategy holds significant promise for the large&#8208;scale production of magnetic refrigeration materials.








Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology can achieve higher energy efficiency based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). However, the practical application of MCE materials is hindered by their poor mechanical properties, making them challenging to process into devices. Conventional strengthening strategies usually lead to a trade&#8208;off with refrigeration capacity reduction. Here, a novel design is presented to overcome this dilemma by forming dual&#8208;phase alloys through in situ precipitation of a tough magnetic refrigeration phase within an intermetallic compound with excellent MCE. In the alloy 87.5Gd&#8211;12.5Co, incorporating the interconnected tough phase Gd contributes to enhanced strength (&#8776;505&#160;MPa) with good ductility (&#8776;9.2%). The strengthening phase Gd simultaneously exhibits excellent MCE, enabling the alloy to achieve a peak refrigeration capacity of 720 J kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the alloy shows low thermal expansion induced by the synergistic effect of the two phases. It is beneficial for maintaining structural stability during heat exchange in magnetic refrigeration. The coupling interaction between the two magnetic phases can broaden the refrigeration temperature range and reduce hysteresis. This study guides the development of new high&#8208;performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and magnetic refrigeration properties as needed for gas liquefaction and refrigerators.

         <title>Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite Optoelectronic Synapse for Rapid Trained Neuromorphic Computation with High Accuracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the synergistic effect between ion migration barrier (Ea) and readout voltage (Vread), a stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current is achieved in a dual&#8208;terminal perovskite synapse. The gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs.








Abstract
Emerging neural morphological vision sensors inspired by biological systems that integrate image perception, memory, and information computing are expected to transform the landscape of machine vision and artificial intelligence. However, stable and reconfigurable light&#8208;induced synaptic behavior always relies on independent gateport modulation. Despite its potential, the limitations of uncontrollable defects and ionic characteristics have led to simpler, smaller, and more integration&#8208;friendly two&#8208;terminal devices being used as sidelines. In this work, the synergy between ion migration barriers and readout voltage is proven to be the key to realizing stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current in two&#8208;terminal devices. Following the same mechanism, optical and electrical signal synchronous triggering is proposed to serve as a preprocessing method to achieve a recognition accuracy of 96.5%. Impressively, the gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs. The PSC modulation potential under short optical pulse of 20 ns is also revealed. This optoelectronic device with perception, memory, and computation capabilities can promote the development of new devices for future photonic neural morphological circuits and artificial vision.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels with Fibrillar Connected Double Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels with low plastic deformations based on fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN) are presented. The efficient transfer of stress between the polyacrylamide and agarose fibril networks via chemical crosslinks and better fibril alignment under stretch result in high fracture strength and toughness (55 MJ m&#8722;3). The fc&#8208;DN provides a new toughening strategy and application potential for load&#8208;bearing soft devices.








Abstract
Biological tissues, such as tendons or cartilage, possess high strength and toughness with very low plastic deformations. In contrast, current strategies to prepare tough hydrogels commonly utilize energy dissipation mechanisms based on physical bonds that lead to irreversible large plastic deformations, thus limiting their load&#8208;bearing applications. This article reports a strategy to toughen hydrogels using fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN), which consist of two distinct but chemically interconnected polymer networks, that is, a polyacrylamide network and an acrylated agarose fibril network. The fc&#8208;DN design allows efficient stress transfer between the two networks and high fibril alignment during deformation, both contributing to high strength and toughness, while the chemical crosslinking ensures low plastic deformations after undergoing high strains. The mechanical properties of the fc&#8208;DN network can be readily tuned to reach an ultimate tensile strength of 8 MPa and a toughness of above 55 MJ m&#8722;3, which is 3 and 3.5 times more than that of fibrillar double network hydrogels without chemical connections, respectively. The application potential of the fc&#8208;DN hydrogel is demonstrated as load&#8208;bearing damping material for a jointed robotic lander. The fc&#8208;DN design provides a new toughening mechanism for hydrogels that can be used for soft robotics or bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency of Blue Perovskite QLEDs Exceeding 23% by Trifluoroacetate Passivation and Mixed Hole Transportation Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.5% at 490 nm is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivated by trifluoroacetate and optimal device design through a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have been considered a promising display technology due to their wide color gamut for authentic color expression. Currently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue perovskite QLEDs is about 15%, which still lags behind its green and red counterparts (&gt;25%) and blue film&#8208;based LEDs. Here, blue perovskite QLEDs that achieve an EQE of 23.5% at 490&#160;nm is presented, to the best knowledge, which is the highest value reported among blue perovskite&#8208;based LED fields. This impressive efficiency is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivation and optimal device design. First, blue mixed halide perovskite CsPbCl3&#8722;xBrx QDs passivated by trifluoroacetate exhibit excellent exciton recombination behavior with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 84% due to reducing uncoordinated Pb surface defects. Furthermore, the device is designed by introducing a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer (M&#8208;HTL) to increase hole injection and transportation capacity and improve carrier balance. It is further found that M&#8208;HTL can decrease carrier leakage and increase radiative recombination in the device, evidenced by the visual electroluminescence spectrum at 2.0&#160;V. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.

The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite-based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleating Agent for High&#8208;Boiling&#8208;Point Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleating agent (BTO&#8208;BO) is developed to suppress the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents processing, achieving the active layer with high crystallinity and nano&#8208;scaled phase separation morphology. The resultant OSCs achieve record power conversion efficiencies of 19.42% (0.062&#8208;cm2) and 16.35% (15. 03&#8208;cm2) with excellent operational stabilities.








Abstract
High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents are superior solvents to produce large&#8208;area organic solar cells (OSCs) in industry because of their wide processing window and low toxicity; while, these solvents with slow evaporation kinetics will lead excessive aggregation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small molecule acceptors (e.g. L8&#8208;BO), delivering serious efficiency losses. Here, a heterogeneous nucleating agent strategy is developed by grafting oligo (ethylene glycol) side&#8208;chains on L8&#8208;BO (BTO&#8208;BO). The formation energy of the obtained BTO&#8208;BO; while, changing from liquid in a solvent to a crystalline phase, is lower than that of L8&#8208;BO irrespective of the solvent type. When BTO&#8208;BO is added as the third component into the active layer (e.g. PM6:L8&#8208;BO), it easily assembles to form numerous seed crystals, which serve as nucleation sites to trigger heterogeneous nucleation and increase nucleation density of L8&#8208;BO through strong hydrogen bonding interactions even in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents. Therefore, it can effectively suppress excessive aggregation during growth, achieving ideal phase&#8208;separation active layer with small domain sizes and high crystallinity. The resultant toluene&#8208;processed OSCs exhibit a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.42% (certificated 19.12%) with excellent operational stability. The strategy also has superior advantages in large&#8208;scale devices, showing a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module with a record PCE of 16.35% (certificated 15.97%).

         <title>Precise Capture and Dynamic Release of Circulating Liver Cancer Cells with Dual&#8208;Histidine&#8208;Based Cell Imprinted Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the sialylated glycans present on circulating tumor cells&#8217; (CTCs) surface, an ultrastrong affinity ligand His&#8208;His is designed and integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinting copolymer based on polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate. Precise size matching, specific interactions, and satisfactory biocompatibility endow the material with excellent capabilities for precise capture of CTCs and intact release, significantly facilitating liver cancer early diagnosis and single&#8208;cell multiproteomics analysis.








Abstract
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection presents significant advantages in diagnosing liver cancer due to its noninvasiveness, real&#8208;time monitoring, and dynamic tracking. However, the clinical application of CTCs&#8208;based diagnosis is largely limited by the challenges of capturing low&#8208;abundance CTCs within a complex blood environment while ensuring them alive. Here, an ultrastrong ligand, l&#8208;histidine&#8211;l&#8208;histidine (HH), specifically targeting sialylated glycans on the surface of CTCs, is designed. Furthermore, HH is integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinted polymer, constructing a hydrogel with precise CTCs imprinting, high elasticity, satisfactory blood compatibility, and robust anti&#8208;interference capacities. These features endow the hydrogel with excellent capture efficiency (&gt;95%) for CTCs in peripheral blood, as well as the ability to release CTCs controllably and alive. Clinical tests substantiate the accurate differentiation between liver cancer, cirrhosis, and healthy groups using this method. The remarkable diagnostic accuracy (94%), lossless release of CTCs, material reversibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness ($6.68 per sample) make the HH&#8208;based hydrogel a potentially revolutionary technology for liver cancer diagnosis and single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Li Promoting Long Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Memory Optocoupler Module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low power consumption long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors are fabricated to simultaneously accomplish the functions of in&#8208;memory calculation, light&#8208;emission, and decision&#8208;making process. When combined with optically switchable transistors and photodiode amplifiers, the biological neurotransmitter transfer and biological firing action after spiking excess threshold are mimicked in the chip.








Abstract
The artificial brain is conceived as advanced intelligence technology, capable to emulate in&#8208;memory processes occurring in the human brain by integrating synaptic devices. Within this context, improving the functionality of synaptic transistors to increase information processing density in neuromorphic chips is a major challenge in this field. In this article, Li&#8208;ion migration promoting long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, which display exceptional postsynaptic brightness of 7000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 under low operational voltages of 10&#160;V is presented. The postsynaptic current of 0.1&#160;mA operating as a built&#8208;in threshold switch is implemented as a firing point in these devices. The setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow is employed to drive the photoisomerization process of photochromic molecules that mimic neurotransmitter transfer in the human brain for realizing a key memory rule, that is, the transition from long&#8208;term memory to permanent memory. The combination of setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow with photodiode amplifiers is also processed to emulate the human responding action after the setting&#8208;training process. Overall, the successful integration in neuromorphic computing comprising stimulus judgment, photon emission, transition, and encoding, &#160;to emulate the complicated decision tree of the human brain is demonstrated.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaic Cells for Underwater Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acceptor is designed and named ITO&#8208;4Cl and provides a comprehensive evaluation of its photovoltaic performance, stability, and pressure resistance when incorporated into organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Particularly, the OPV cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.6% at a depth of 1&#160;m underwater, confirming the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology holds tremendous promise as a sustainable power source for underwater off&#8208;grid systems. However, research on underwater OPV cells is relatively scarce. Here, this gap is addressed by focusing on the exploration and development of OPV cells specifically designed for underwater applications. An acceptor, named ITO&#8208;4Cl, with excellent water resistance, is rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from its low energetic disorder and an absorption spectrum well&#8208;suited to the underwater environment, the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell achieves an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25.6% at a water depth of 1&#160;m. Additionally, under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation, the cell demonstrates a notable PCE of 31.6%, indicating its potential for underwater wireless energy transfer. Due to the mitigation of thermal effects from solar irradiation, the lifetime of the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell exceeds 7000&#160;h. Additionally, a flexible OPV cell is fabricated that maintains its initial PCE even under exposure to high pressures of 5&#160;MPa. A 32.5&#160;cm2 flexible module achieves an excellent PCE of 17%. This work fosters a deeper understanding of underwater OPV cells and highlights the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.

         <title>Immunogenic Material Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy by Structure&#8208;Dependent Immune Cell Trafficking and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunogenic material vaccines offer enormous prospects in treating cancer. Here we&#160;report how the structure of materials containing immunopotentiator manganese impacts the dynamic coordination of innate and adaptive immune response. The outperformed rod&#8208;shaped hollow manganese material with an aspect ratio of 4.5 demonstrates the highest competence in immune cell modulation and cellular immunity against cancer in multiple aggressive tumor models.








Abstract
Inherently immunogenic materials offer enormous prospects in enhancing vaccine efficacy. However, the understanding and improving material adjuvanticity remain elusive. Herein how the structural presentation of immunopotentiators in a material governs the dynamic dialogue between innate and adaptive immunity for enhanced cancer vaccination is reported. The immunopotentiator manganese into six differing structures that resemble the architectures of two types of pathogens (spherical viruses or rod&#8208;like bacteria) is precisely manipulated. The results reveal that innate immune cells accurately sense and respond to the architectures, of which two outperformed material candidates (151&#160;nm hollow spheres and hollow microrods with an aspect ratio of 4.5) show higher competence in creating local proinflammatory environment with promoted innate immune cell influx and stimulation on dendritic cells (DCs). In combination with viral peptides, model proteins, or cell lysate antigens, the outperformed microrod material remarkably primes antigen&#8208;specific CD8 cytolytic T cells. In prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, the microrod adjuvanted vaccines display optimal aptitude in tumor suppression in four aggressive murine tumor models, by promoting the infiltration of heterogeneous cytolytic effector cells while decreasing suppressive immunoregulatory populations in tumors. This study demonstrates that a rationally selected architecture of immunogenic materials potentially advances the clinical reality of cancer vaccination.

         <title>Chlorination Design for Highly Stable Electrolyte toward High Mass Loading and Long Cycle Life Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination design strategy is proposed for sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries, and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the chlorinated electrolyte based on chloromethyl ethyl carbonate displays notably enhanced oxidative stability and highly reversible anion intercalation into the graphite cathode; meanwhile, the uniform and efficient plating/stripping of Na+ ions on the anode is also achieved.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered significant attention as novel energy storage devices offering the advantages of high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;cost. Nonetheless, conventional electrolytes exhibit low resistance to oxidation and poor compatibility with electrode materials, resulting in rapid battery failure. In this study, for the first time, a chlorination design of electrolytes for SDIB, is proposed. Using ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as a representative, chlorine (Cl)&#8208;substituted EMC not only demonstrates increased oxidative stability ascribed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of chlorine atom, electrolyte compatibility with both the cathode and anode is also greatly improved by forming Cl&#8208;containing interface layers. Consequently, a discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh g&#8722;1 within a voltage range of 3.0&#8211;5.0&#160;V is achieved for Na||graphite SDIB that employs a high graphite cathode mass loading of 5.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, along with almost no capacity decay after 900 cycles. Notably, the Na||graphite SDIB can be revived for an additional 900 cycles through the replacement of a fresh Na anode. As the mass loading of graphite cathode increased to 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, Na||graphite SDIB is still capable of sustaining over 700 times with &#8776;100% capacity retention. These results mark the best outcome among reported SDIBs. This study corroborates the effectiveness of chlorination design in developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and attaining enduring cycle stability of Na&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Enzymatic Mesoporous Metal Nanocavities for Concurrent Electrocatalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia Coupled with Polyethylene Terephthalate Upcycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as an enzymatic bifunctional electrocatalyst for concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and glycolic acid from waste pollutants (NO3&#8722; and polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived alcohol). Thanks to structural synergies, the performance of PdCu MC nanozymes outperforms the most of the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of waste pollutants into high value&#8208;added fuels and/or chemicals is recognized as a green and sustainable solution that can address the resource utilization on earth. Despite great efforts, their progress has seriously been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. In this work, bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as a new bifunctional enzymatic electrocatalyst that realizes concurrent electrocatalytic upcycling of nitrate wastewater and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. Abundant metal mesopores and open nanocavities of PdCu MCs provide the enzymatic confinement of key intermediates for the deeper electroreduction of nitrate and accelerate the transport of reactants/products within/out of electrocatalyst, thus affording high ammonia Faradic efficiency (FENH3) of 96.6% and yield rate of 5.6&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1 at the cathode. Meanwhile, PdCu MC nanozymes trigger the selective electrooxidation of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into glycolic acid (GA) and formic acid with high FEs of &gt;90% by a facile regulation of potentials at the anode. Moreover, concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and GA is disclosed in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system, further confirming the high efficiency of bifunctional PdCu MC nanozymes in producing value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals from waste pollutants in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Noncontact Microfluidics of Highly Viscous Liquids for Accurate Self&#8208;Splitting and Pipetting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the highly transparent PS platform, the liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s (epoxy) can be noncontact split with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source. Compared with commercial pipettes or droppers (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate PS platform (&gt;83.5%) shows great potential in the quantification of highly viscous liquids.








Abstract
Accurate dosing for various liquids, especially for highly viscous liquids, is fundamental in wide&#8208;ranging from molecular crosslinking to material processing. Despite droppers or pipettes being widely used as pipetting devices, they are powerless for quantificationally splitting and dosing highly viscous liquids (&gt;100&#160;mPa s) like polymer liquids due to the intertwined macromolecular chains and strong cohesion energy. Here, a highly transparent photopyroelectric slippery (PS) platform is provided to achieve noncontact self&#8208;splitting for liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s, just with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source to provide a local temperature difference (&#916;T). Moreover, to guarantee the accuracy for pipetting liquids (&gt;80%), the ultrathin MXene film (within a thickness of 20&#160;nm) is self&#8208;assembled as the photo&#8208;thermal layers, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between transparency and photothermal property. Compared with traditional pipetting strategies (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate microfluidic chip shows great potential in adhesive systems (bonding strength, twice than using the droppers or pipettes).

         <title>Anchored Cobalt Nanoparticles on Layered Perovskites for Rapid Peroxymonosulfate Activation in Antibiotic Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for perovskite oxide catalysts is proposed to address two limiting factors in the development of advanced oxidation process (AOPs): the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the cycling stability of metal catalysts. The comprehensive performance of the catalysts is tested to highlight the technical potential of the PMS heterogeneous reaction&#8208;activated in situ exsolved strategy.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A new strategy for perovskite oxide catalysts is proposed to address two limiting factors in the development of advanced oxidation process (AOPs): the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the cycling stability of metal catalysts. The comprehensive performance of the catalysts is tested to highlight the technical potential of the PMS heterogeneous reaction-activated in situ exsolved strategy.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Main&#8208;Group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts for Selective 2&#8208;Electron and 4&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are developed with varied oxidation states of the Sb sites via changing the contents of sulfur dopants, resulting in tunable ORR selectivity toward either the 4&#8208;electron or 2&#8208;electron pathway.








Abstract
The selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is important for various energy conversion processes such as the fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries for the 4e&#8722; pathway and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis for the 2e&#8722; pathway. However, it remains a challenge to tune the ORR selectivity of a catalyst in a controllable manner. Herein, an efficient strategy for introducing sulfur dopants to regulate the ORR selectivity of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts&#160; is reported. Significantly, Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C with the highest sulfur content follows a 2e&#8722; pathway with high H2O2 selectivity (96.8%) and remarkable mass activity (96.1 A g&#8722;1 at 0.65&#160;V), while the sister catalyst with the lowest sulfur content directs a 4e&#8722; pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.89&#160;V) that is more positive than commercial Pt/C. In addition, practical applications for these two 2e&#8722;/4e&#8722; ORR catalysts are demonstrated by bulk H2O2 electrosynthesis for the degradation of organic pollutants and a high&#8208;power zinc&#8208;air battery, respectively. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the excellent selectivity for the sulfurized Sb&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is attributed to the optimal adsorption&#8208;desorption of the ORR intermediates realized through the electronic structure modulation by the sulfur dopants.

         <title>Thermal Welding of Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep understanding of the assembly behavior of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) that are generated in situ at the oil&#8211;water interface through host&#8211;guest interactions is presented. Taking advantage of the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, thermal&#8208;controlled cargo release and welding of liquids can be achieved, opening a pathway to the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics.








Abstract
Welding of thermoplastics is a common practice in many industrial sectors, but it has yet to be realized with fluids. Here, the thermal welding of liquids by using the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces is reported. By fine&#8208;tuning the dynamic interaction strength within NPSs, the interfacial activity of NPSs, as well as the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be precisely controlled, leading to a dynamic exchange of NPSs, maximizing the reduction in the interfacial energy. With NPSs jammed at the interface, the structures of liquids can be manipulated to complex geometries by applying an external force and, due to the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, when bringing liquids into contact and heating the system, welding of liquids can be achieved. This work provides a straightforward strategy for the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics, opening up numerous opportunities in fields like biotechnology, healthcare, and materials science.

         <title>Universal Design Strategy for Air&#8208;Stable Layered Na&#8208;Ion Cathodes toward Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon footprint of Na&#8208;ion batteries is significantly increased due to the air stability issue of layered cathodes. In this paper, the air degradation origins and mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, and a universal design strategy is proposed for the rational design of air&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion cathodes toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) are sustainable alternatives to Li&#8208;ion technologies due to the abundant and widely&#8208;distributed resources. However, the most promising cathode materials of NIBs so far, O3 layered oxides, suffer from serious air instability issues, which significantly increases the manufactural cost and carbon footprint because of the long&#8208;term use of dry rooms. While some feasible strategies are proposed via case studies, universal design strategies for air&#8208;stable cathodes are yet to be established. Herein, the air degradation mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, with bond dissociation energy proposed as an effective descriptor for predicting air stability. Experimental validations in various unary, binary, and ternary O3 cathodes confirm that the air stability can indeed be effectively improved via simple compositional design. Guided by the predictive model, the designed material can sustain 30&#8208;day air&#8208;storage without structural or electrochemical degradation. It is calculated that such air&#8208;stable cathodes can significantly reduce both energy consumption (&#8776;4&#8201;100&#8201;000&#160;kWh) and carbon footprint (&#8776;2200&#8208;ton CO2) annually for a 2 GWh NIBs manufactory. Therefore, the fundamental understandings and universal design strategy presented open an avenue for rational materials design of NIBs toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic material Fe3GaTe2 is synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method. An unconventional room&#8208;temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance is observed in 2D Fe3GaTe2 devices with the planar symmetry breaking. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room&#8208;temperature thickness&#8208;controlled antisymmetric magnetoresistance.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic materials have emerged as a promising platform for the development of 2D spintronic devices. However, studies to date are restricted to vdW ferromagnetic materials with low Curie temperature (Tc) and small magnetic anisotropy. Here, a chemical vapor transport method is developed to synthesize a high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2 (c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2), which boasts a high Tc = 356 K and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Due to the planar symmetry breaking, an unconventional room&#8208;temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance (MR) is first observed in c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2 devices with step features, manifesting as three distinctive states of high, intermediate, and low resistance with the sweeping magnetic field. Moreover, the modulation of the antisymmetric MR is demonstrated by controlling the height of the surface steps. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room&#8208;temperature thickness&#8208;controlled antisymmetric MR and further design room&#8208;temperature 2D spintronic devices based on the vdW ferromagnet c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2.

&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 356 K and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Due to the planar symmetry breaking, an unconventional room-temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance (MR) is first observed in c-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; devices with step features, manifesting as three distinctive states of high, intermediate, and low resistance with the sweeping magnetic field. Moreover, the modulation of the antisymmetric MR is demonstrated by controlling the height of the surface steps. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room-temperature thickness-controlled antisymmetric MR and further design room-temperature 2D spintronic devices based on the vdW ferromagnet c-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harvesting Multicolor Photoluminescence in Nonaromatic Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanocrystals via Pressure&#8208;Modulated Carbonyls Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 IRMOF&#8208;0 nanocrystals (NCs)&#160;show a photoluminescence&#160;turn&#8208;on behavior via pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect, where aggregation of carbonyls&#160;results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;). IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit an ultrabroad emission tunability, which mainly arises from the retention at varying degrees of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions achieved by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.








Abstract
Interpenetrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nonaromatic ligands provide a unique platform for adsorption, catalysis, and sensing applications. However, nonemission and the lack of optical property tailoring make it challenging to fabricate smart responsive devices with nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs based on ligand&#8208;centered emission. In this paper, the pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect is introduced in nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 (IRMOF&#8208;0) nanocrystals (NCs), where carbonyl groups aggregation results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;), triggering the photoluminescence turn&#8208;on behavior. It is noteworthy that the IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs display an ultrabroad emission tunability of 130&#160;nm from deep blue (440&#160;nm) to yellow (570&#160;nm) upon release to ambient conditions at different pressures. The eventual retention of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions in different degrees via pressure treatment is primarily responsible for achieving a controllable multicolor emission behavior in initially nonemissive IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs. The fabricated multicolor phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the pressure&#8208;treated IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit excellent thermal, chromaticity, and fatigue stability. The proposed strategy not only imparts new vitality to nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs but also offers new perspectives for advancements in the field of multicolor displays and daylight illumination.

         <title>Influence of Li Content on the Topological Inhibition of Oxygen Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, the formation of a migration network of redox&#8208;active oxygen ions can be prevented when the transition metal ions occupy over 5/6 of the sites in the transition metal layer, and thereby, the oxidized oxygen species can be encaged in the lattice, leading to topological inhibition of oxygen loss during cycling.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layer oxide cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their high energy densities. However, the oxygen loss during cycling limits their practical applications. Here, the essential role of Li content on the topological inhibition of oxygen loss in lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials and the relationship between the migration network of oxygen ions and the transition metal (TM) component are revealed. Utilizing first&#8208;principles calculations in combination with percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that TM ions can effectively encage the oxidized oxygen species when the TM concentration in TM layer exceeds 5/6, which hinders the formation of a percolating oxygen migration network. This study demonstrates the significance of rational compositional design in lithium&#8208;rich cathodes for effectively suppressing irreversible oxygen release and enhancing cathode cycling performance.

         <title>Boosting Contact Electrification by Amorphous Polyvinyl Alcohol Endowing Improved Contact Adhesion and Electrochemical Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stronger binding to water molecules, and the consequent higher water uptake, is shown to be responsible for the improved electrical output of triboelectric generators and sensors based on an amorphous polyvinyl alcohol compared to the more common homopolymer derivative. The specific role played by the increased material softness, adhesive contact, and ionic conductivity on devices performance is highlighted.








Abstract
Ion conductive hydrogels are relevant components in wearable, biocompatible, and biodegradable electronics. Polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol (PVA) homopolymer is often the favored choice for integration into supercapacitors and energy harvesters as in sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, to further improve hydrogel&#8208;based TENGs, a deeper understanding of the impact of their composition and structure on devices performance is necessary. Here, it is shown how ionic hydrogels based on an amorphous&#8208;PVA (a&#8208;PVA) allow to fabricate TENGs that outperform the one based on the homopolymer. When used as tribomaterial, the Li&#8208;doped a&#8208;PVA allows to achieve a twofold higher pressure sensitivity compared to PVA, and to develop a conformable e&#8208;skin. When used as an ionic conductor encased in an elastomeric tribomaterial, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 average power is obtained, providing 25% power increase compared to PVA. At the origin of such enhancement is the increased softness, stronger adhesive contact, higher ionic mobility (&gt; 3,5&#8208;fold increase), and long&#8208;term stability achieved with Li&#8208;doped a&#8208;PVA. These improvements are attributed to the high density of hydroxyl groups and amorphous structure present in the a&#8208;PVA, enabling&#160;a strong binding to water molecules. This work discloses novel insights on those&#160;parameters allowing to&#160;develop&#160;easy&#8208;processable,&#160;stable, and highly conductive hydrogels for integration in conformable, soft, and biocompatible TENGs.

         <title>Ultimately Adaptive Fluid Interfacial Phospholipid Membranes Unveiled Unanticipated High Cellular Mechanical Work</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideally adaptive cellular scaffold is developed by decorating a fluid interface with phospholipid membranes. In contrast to conventional solid or hydrogel scaffolds, cell adhesion behaviors thereon follow an adaptive wetting regime with surprisingly high mechanical work, which highlights an analogy of cell adhesion behaviors and droplet wetting on surfaces with a low Young's modulus.








Abstract
Living cells actively interact biochemically and mechanically with the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECMs) and undergo dramatic morphological and dimensional transitions, concomitantly remodeling ECMs. However, there is no suitable method to quantitatively discuss the contribution of mechanical interactions in such mutually adaptive processes. Herein, a highly deformable &#8220;living&#8221; cellular scaffold is developed to evaluate overall mechanical energy transfer between cell and ECMs. It is based on the water&#8211;perfluorocarbon interface decorated with phospholipids bearing a cell&#8208;adhesive ligand and fluorescent tag. The bioinert nature of the phospholipid membranes prevents the formation of solid&#8208;like protein nanofilms at the fluid interface, enabling to visualize and quantify cellular mechanical work against the ultimately adaptive model ECM. A new cellular wetting regime is identified, wherein interface deformation proceeds to cell flattening, followed by its eventual restoration. The cellular mechanical work during this adaptive wetting process is one order of magnitude higher than those reported with&#160;conventional elastic platforms. The behavior of viscous liquid drops at the air&#8211;water interface can simulate cellular adaptive wetting, suggesting that overall viscoelasticity of the cell body predominates the emergent wetting regime and regulates mechanical output. Cellular&#8208;force&#8208;driven high&#8208;energy states on the adaptive platform can be useful for cell fate manipulation.

         <title>Durable Perovskite Solar Cells with 24.5% Average Efficiency: The Role of Rigid Conjugated Core in Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene, a non&#8208;planar double helicene, displays enhanced rigidity compared to tetraphenylethene, enabling the development of a molecular semiconductor with elevated cohesive energy density and hole mobility. Applied in high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cell fabrication, it exhibits remarkable operational stability at 45&#160;&#176;C and storage stability at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Efficient and robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells necessitate superior organic hole&#8208;transport materials with both mechanical and electronic prowess. Deciphering the structure&#8211;property relationship of these materials is crucial for practical perovskite solar cell applications. Through direct arylation, two high glass transition temperature molecular semiconductors, DBC&#8208;ETPA (202&#160;&#176;C) and TPE&#8208;ETPA (180&#160;&#176;C) are synthesized, using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenylethene (TPE) tetrabromides with triphenylene&#8211;ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine (ETPA). In comparison to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, both semiconductors exhibit shallower HOMO energy levels, resulting in increased hole densities (generated by air oxidation doping) and accelerated hole extraction from photoexcited perovskite. Experimental and theoretical studies highlight the more rigid DBC core, enhancing hole mobility due to reduced reorganization energy and lower energy disorder. Importantly, DBC&#8208;ETPA possesses a higher cohesive energy density, leading to lower ion diffusion coefficients and higher Young's moduli. Leveraging these attributes, DBC&#8208;ETPA is employed as the primary hole&#8208;transport layer component, yielding perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency of 24.5%, surpassing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD reference cells (24.0%). Furthermore, DBC&#8208;ETPA&#8208;based cells exhibit superior operational stability and 85&#160;&#176;C thermal storage stability.

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Responsive Cannula for Automated and Electronics&#8208;Free Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is presented for automated insulin delivery without the use of electronics. This cannula, composed of a resilient elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid, changes its permeability in response to glucose levels. Tested in diabetic mice, it effectively maintains blood glucose levels within target ranges for &#8776;3&#160;d, offering a potential solution for user&#8208;centric insulin delivery.








Abstract
Automated delivery of insulin based on continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionizing the way insulin&#8208;dependent diabetes is treated. However, challenges remain for the widespread adoption of these systems, including the requirement of a separate glucose sensor, sophisticated electronics and algorithms, and the need for significant user input to operate these costly therapies. Herein, a user&#8208;centric glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is reported for electronics&#8208;free insulin delivery. The cannula&#8212;made from a tough, elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid membrane formed through a one&#8208;pot solvent exchange method&#8212;changes permeability to release insulin rapidly upon physiologically relevant varying glucose levels, providing simple and automated insulin delivery with no additional hardware or software. Two prototypes of the cannula are evaluated in insulin&#8208;deficient diabetic mice. The first cannula&#8212;an ends&#8208;sealed, subcutaneously inserted prototype&#8212;normalizes blood glucose levels for 3&#160;d and controls postprandial glucose levels. The second, more translational version&#8212;a cannula with the distal end sealed and the proximal end connected to a transcutaneous injection port&#8212;likewise demonstrates tight, 3&#8208;d regulation of blood glucose levels when refilled twice daily. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may aid in the development of &#8220;smart&#8221; cannulas and next&#8208;generation insulin therapies at a reduced burden&#8208;of&#8208;care toll and cost to end&#8208;users.

         <title>Boosting Formate Electrooxidation by Heterostructured PtPd Alloy and Oxides Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructured platinum&#8208;palladium alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant heterojunction interfaces and defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method. PtPd&#8208;ox NWs with optimal electronic structure achieve dual regulation via both regulating key intermediate adsorption behavior and coupling key reaction processes, demonstrating remarkable performance toward formate electrooxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct formate fuel cells (DFFCs) receive increasing attention as promising technologies for the future energy mix and environmental sustainability, as formate can be made from carbon dioxide utilization and is carbon neutral. Herein, heterostructured platinum&#8208;palladium&#160;alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method and demonstrated high activity toward formate electrooxidation reaction (FOR). The electronic tuning arising from the heterojunction between alloy and oxides influence the work function of PtPd&#8208;ox NWs. The sample with optimal work function reveals the favorable adsorption behavior for intermediates and strong interaction in the d&#8722;p orbital hybridization between Pt site and oxygen in formate, favoring the FOR direct pathway with a low energy barrier. Besides the thermodynamic regulation, the heterostructure can also provide sufficient hydroxyl species to facilitate the formation of carbon dioxide due to the ability of combining absorbed hydrogen and carbon monoxide at adjacent active sites, which contributes to the improvement of FOR kinetics on PtPd&#8208;ox NWs. Thus, heterostructured PtPd&#8208;ox NWs achieve dual regulation of FOR thermodynamics and kinetics, exhibiting remarkable performance and demonstrating potential in practical systems.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Mono&#8208;Layered Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets for Simulated Flue Gas Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) is successfully prepared with remarkable performance in selective CO2 photo&#8208;reduction into formic acid under simulated flue gas.








Abstract
The dilemma between the thickness and accessible active site triggers the design of porous crystalline materials with mono&#8208;layered structure for advanced photo&#8208;catalysis applications. Here, a kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) through the exfoliation of specifically designed Co3 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is reported. The sub&#8208;nanometer thickness and inherent light&#8208;sensitivity endow Co&#8208;MOF MNSs with fully exposed Janus Co3 sites that can selectively photo&#8208;reduce CO2 into formic acid under simulated flue gas. Notably, the production efficiency of formic acid by Co&#8208;MOF MNSs (0.85&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) is &#8776;13 times higher than that of the bulk counterpart (0.065&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) under a simulated flue gas atmosphere, which is the highest in reported works up to date. Theoretical calculations prove that the exposed Janus Co3 sites with simultaneously available sites possess higher activity when compared with single Co site, validating the importance of mono&#8208;layered nanosheet morphology. These results may facilitate the development of functional nanosheet materials for CO2 photo&#8208;reduction in potential flue gas treatment.

Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the high&#8208;Entropy A5Fe2O4 nanosheets have metalloid band structures with remarkedly enhanced performance for the electrochemical nitrate reduction toward ammonia.








Abstract
Spinel oxides with tunable chemical compositions have emerged as versatile electrocatalysts, however their performance is greatly limited by small surface area and low electron conductivity. Here, ultrathin high&#8208;entropy Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides nanosheets are rationally designed (i.e., (Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2)Fe2O4; denotes A5Fe2O4) in thickness of &#8776;4.3&#160;nm with large surface area and highly exposed active sites via a modified sol&#8211;gel method. Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the bandgap of A5Fe2O4 nanosheets is significantly smaller than that of ordinary Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides, realizing the transformation of binary spinel oxide from semiconductors to metalloids. As a result, such A5Fe2O4 nanosheets manifest excellent performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), with a NH3 yield rate of &#8776;2.1&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus Reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming other spinel&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Systematic mechanism investigations reveal that the NO3&#8722;RR is mainly occurred on Fe sites, and introducing high&#8208;entropy compositions in tetrahedral sites regulates the adsorption strength of N and O&#8208;related intermediates on Fe for boosting the NO3&#8722;RR. The above findings offer a high&#8208;entropy platform to regulate the bandgap and enhance the electrocatalytic performance of spinel oxides.

         <title>Unraveling Paradoxical Effects of Large Current Density on Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paradox between oriented Zn deposition and poor cell lifetime during large current operation is revealed to be relevant with the multiplied current density in the separator channels. Furthermore, this phenomenon is described as the separator permeation effect, which explains the rapid short circuit despite smooth Zn deposition.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) have been widely investigated owing to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and simple assembly. However, the actual behavior of Zn deposition under large current density is still a severe issue associated with obscure mechanism interpretation of ZBs under high loading. Here, differing from the conventional understanding that short circuit is induced by dendrite penetrating under large current density (10&#8211;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), the separator permeation effect is unraveled to illustrate the paradox between smooth deposition and short lifespan. Generally, a dense plating morphology is achieved under large current density because of intensive nuclei and boosted plane growth. Nevertheless, in the scenes applying separators, the multiplied local current density derived from narrow separator channels leads to rapid Zn2+ exhaustion, converting the Zn deposition mode from nucleation control to concentration control, which eventually results in separator permeation and short circuit. This effect is validated in other aqueous metal anodes (Cu, Sn, Fe) and receives similar results. Based on the understanding, a micro&#8208;pore (150&#160;&#181;m) sponge foam is proposed as separators for large&#8208;current anodes to provide broader Zn2+ path and mitigate the separator permeation effect. This work provides unique perspectives on coordinating fast&#8208;charging ability and anode stability of ZBs.

         <title>Reverse Atom Capture on Perovskite Surface Enabling Robust and Efficient Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced reverse atom capture technique is developed to capture surface segregated Ba and Sr cations from PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) perovskite, resulting in a unique (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructured cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells. The single cell using such heterostructured cathode delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and a robust durability for 240&#160;h.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) hold potential for sustainable energy conversion, yet their widespread application is hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of cathode materials. Here, a facile and efficient reverse atom capture technique is developed to manipulate the surface chemistry of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) cathode for PCFCs. This method successfully captures segregated Ba and Sr cations on the PBSCF surface using W species, creating a (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructure. Benefiting from enhanced kinetics of proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction and strengthened chemical stability, the single cell using the optimized 2W&#8208;PBSCF cathode demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and maintains durable performance for 240&#160;h. Theoretical calculations unveil that the BSCFW perovskite delivers lower oxygen vacancy formation energy, hydration energy, and proton transfer energy compared to the PBSCF perovskite. This protocol offers new insights into advanced atom capture techniques for sustainable energy infrastructures.

Lignin derived ultrathin all&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolytes, which possess 3D nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single&#8208;ion lignin&#8208;based lithium salt&#160;and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#160;as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#160;as the filler, is obtained through spinning/spraying and hot&#8208;pressing.

Abstract
The lignin derived ultrathin all&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with a thickness of only 13.2&#160;&#181;m, which possess 3D nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single&#8208;ion lignin&#8208;based lithium salt (L&#8208;Li) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LiTFSI) as the filler, is obtained through electrospinning/spraying and hot&#8208;pressing. t. The Li&#8208;symmetric cell assembled with the CPE can stably cycle more than 6000&#160;h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with little Li dendrites growth. Moreover, the assembled Li||CPE||LiFePO4 cells can stably cycle over 700 cycles at 0.2 C with a super high initial discharge capacity of 158.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at room temperature, and a favorable capacity of 123 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C for 250 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the reason that the nanofiber ionic bridge network can afford uniformly dispersed single&#8208;ion L&#8208;Li through electrospinning, which synergizes with the LiTFSI well dispersed in PEO to form abundant and efficient 3D Li+ transfer channels. The ultrathin CPE induces uniform deposition of Li+ at the interface, and effectively inhibit the lithium dendrites. This work provides a promising strategy to achieve ultrathin biobased electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium ion batteries.

         <title>In Situ Polymerization Facilitating Practical High&#8208;Safety Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the high&#8208;safety liquid electrolyte with in situ polymerization, the safety of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is significantly enhanced. The in&#8208;depth investigation demonstrates that the thermally stable polymer skeleton covering the electrodes impedes various exothermic reactions at elevated temperatures, promoting the self&#8208;heating temperature (T1) and onset temperature (T2), and reducing the temperature rise rate (dT dt&#8722;1) during battery thermal runaway process.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (QSSBs) are gaining widespread attention as a promising solution to improve battery safety performance. However, the safety improvement and the underlying mechanisms of QSSBs remain elusive. Herein, a novel strategy combining high&#8208;safety ethylene carbonate&#8208;free liquid electrolyte and in situ polymerization technique is proposed to prepare practical QSSBs. The Ah&#8208;level QSSBs with LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode and graphite&#8211;silicon anode demonstrate significantly improved safety features without sacrificing electrochemical performance. As evidenced by accelerating rate calorimetry tests, the QSSBs exhibit increased self&#8208;heating temperature and onset temperature (T2), and decreased temperature rise rate during thermal runaway (TR). The T2 has a maximum increase of 48.4&#160;&#176;C compared to the conventional liquid batteries. Moreover, the QSSBs do not undergo TR until 180&#160;&#176;C (even 200&#160;&#176;C) during the hot&#8208;box tests, presenting significant improvement compared to the liquid batteries that run into TR at 130&#160;&#176;C. Systematic investigations show that the in situ formed polymer skeleton effectively mitigates the exothermic reactions between lithium salts and lithiated anode, retards the oxygen release from cathode, and inhibits crosstalk reactions between cathode and anode at elevated temperatures. The findings offer an innovative solution for practical high&#8208;safety QSSBs and open up a new sight for building safer high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Super&#8208;Ionic Conductor Soft Filler Promotes Li+ Transport in Integrated Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on dipole interaction between super&#8208;ionic conductive soft filler (Li+ conductivity nanocellulose, Li&#8208;NC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) is constructed. The anchoring effect of Li&#8208;NC prevents local concentration polarization in TDCT. An integrated electrode design effectively enhances the Li+ transport at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Composite polymer solid electrolytes (CPEs), possessing good rigid flexible, are expected to be used in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. The integration of fillers into polymer matrices emerges as a dominant strategy to improve Li+ transport and form a Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. However, challenges arise as traditional fillers: 1) inorganic fillers, characterized by high interfacial energy, induce agglomeration; 2) organic fillers, with elevated crystallinity, impede intrinsic ionic conductivity, both severely hindering Li+ migration. Here, a concept of super&#8208;ionic conductor soft filler, utilizing a Li+ conductivity nanocellulose (Li&#8208;NC) as a model, is introduced which exhibits super&#8208;ionic conductivity. Li&#8208;NC anchors anions, and enhances Li+ transport speed, and assists in the integration of cathode&#8211;electrolyte electrodes for room temperature solid&#8208;state batteries. The tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) with Li&#8208;NC and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) demonstrates a high Li+ transfer number (0.79) due to the synergistic coordination mechanism in Li+ transport. Integrated electrodes&#8217; design enables stable performance in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li cells, with 720&#160;cycles at 0.5 C, and 88.8% capacity retention. Furthermore, the lifespan of Li|TDCT|Li cells over 4000&#160;h and Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li cells exhibits excellent performance, proving the practical application potential of soft filler for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries at room temperature.

Smart Contact Lenses
In article number 2313848, the groups around Ar&#225;nzazu del Campo and Christoph Wittmann present a new design concept for long&#8208;term, self&#8208;lubricating hydrogels based on embedded self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs that can autonomously produce and release a lubricating agent. The reservoirs are living biofactories programmed to produce and release hyaluronic acid. The release is passively regulated by the composition and crosslinking of the hydrogel network. The living hydrogel can be processed as a CL laboratory prototype with durable&#8208;by&#8208;design wetting and lubrication.

Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices
In article number 2401451, Jeong&#8208;Hyun Cho and co&#8208;workers introduce a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly method that facilitates the creation of vertically&#8208;aligned monolayer graphene micro helices with heights in the millimeter range. The vertically aligned graphene helices enhance light interactions beyond what is achievable with chiral graphene realized by conventional 2D plane methods, resulting in greatly enhanced optical chiral properties.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2311283, Hee&#8208;Seung Lee, Sangyong Jon, and co&#8208;workers have develop an organ&#8208;selective drug delivery platform based on a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs). Direct in vivo library screening enable identification of GlyNP hits targeting liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain and, moreover, each organ&#8208;selective GlyNP hit shows cellular tropism within the organ. When liver&#8208;, kidney&#8208;, and spleen&#8208;selective GlyNP hits are equipped with therapeutics, the formulations effectively alleviated symptoms in organ&#8208;associated disease models.

         <title>Advances in Cell&#8208;Rich Inks for Biofabricating Living Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofabrication of biomimetic architectures leveraging on cell&#8208;rich living inks matching human tissue cellular densities can lead to unprecedented advances in generating architectures with life&#8208;like features and biofunctionalities, thus moving far beyond conventional biofabricated constructs where biomaterial&#8208;to&#8208;cell ratios remain nonphysiologic. This review showcases recent advances in the design of cell&#8208;rich inks and discusses key challenges toward translation to mainstream clinical applications.








Abstract
Advancing biofabrication toward manufacturing living constructs with well&#8208;defined architectures and increasingly biologically relevant cell densities is highly desired to mimic the biofunctionality of native human tissues. The formulation of tissue&#8208;like, cell&#8208;dense inks for biofabrication remains, however, challenging at various levels of the bioprinting process. Promising advances have been made toward this goal, achieving relatively high cell densities that surpass those found in conventional platforms, pushing the current boundaries closer to achieving tissue&#8208;like cell densities. On this focus, herein the overarching challenges in the bioprocessing of cell&#8208;rich living inks into clinically grade engineered tissues are discussed, as well as the most recent advances in cell&#8208;rich living ink formulations and their processing technologies are highlighted. Additionally, an overview of the foreseen developments in the field is provided and critically discussed.

         <dc:description>
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. In contrast to most previous efforts devoted to developing advanced air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity, here the significance of addressing the challenge facing the complex triple&#8208;phase interface around the anodes from the perspective of materials system engineering is highlighted.








Abstract
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries (AMABs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. To address this challenge, most previous efforts are devoted to advancing the air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity. Recent studies have underlined the solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase interface around the anode can play far more significant roles than previously acknowledged by the scientific community. Besides the bottlenecks of uncontrollable dendrite growth and gas evolution in conventional alkali metal batteries, the corrosive gases, intermediate oxygen species, and redox mediators in AMABs cause more severe anode corrosion and structural collapse, posing greater challenges to the stabilization of the anode triple&#8208;phase interface. This work aims to provide a timely perspective on the anode interface engineering for durable AMABs. Taking the Li&#8211;air battery as a typical example, this critical review shows the latest developed anode stabilization strategies, including formulating electrolytes to build protective interphases, fabricating advanced anodes to improve their anti&#8208;corrosion capability, and designing functional separator to shield the corrosive species. Finally, the remaining scientific and technical issues from the prospects of anode interface engineering are highlighted, particularly materials system engineering, for the practical use of AMABs.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Pore Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Materials for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis is reviewed. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with the optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives during the electrocatalytic applications is emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering.








Abstract
Ordered pore engineering that embeds uniform pores with periodic alignment in electrocatalysts opens up a new avenue for achieving further performance promotion. Hierarchically ordered porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HOP&#8208;MOFs) possessing multilevel pores with ordered distribution are the promising precursors for the exploration of ordered porous electrocatalysts, while the scalable acquisition of HOP&#8208;MOFs with editable components and adjustable pore size regimes is critical. This review presents recent progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of MOF&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis. The synthetic strategies of HOP&#8208;MOFs with different pore size regimes, including the self&#8208;assembly guided by reticular chemistry, surfactant, nanoemulsion, and nanocasting, are first introduced. Then the applications of HOP&#8208;MOFs as the precursors for exploring hierarchically ordered porous electrocatalysts are summarized, selecting representatives to highlight the boosted performance.

&lt;p&gt;Progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of metal&#8211;organic frameworks-based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis is reviewed. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with the optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives during the electrocatalytic applications is emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordered pore engineering that embeds uniform pores with periodic alignment in electrocatalysts opens up a new avenue for achieving further performance promotion. Hierarchically ordered porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HOP-MOFs) possessing multilevel pores with ordered distribution are the promising precursors for the exploration of ordered porous electrocatalysts, while the scalable acquisition of HOP-MOFs with editable components and adjustable pore size regimes is critical. This review presents recent progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of MOF-based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis. The synthetic strategies of HOP-MOFs with different pore size regimes, including the self-assembly guided by reticular chemistry, surfactant, nanoemulsion, and nanocasting, are first introduced. Then the applications of HOP-MOFs as the precursors for exploring hierarchically ordered porous electrocatalysts are summarized, selecting representatives to highlight the boosted performance. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives are emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering. Finally, the remaining scientific challenges and an outlook of this field are proposed. It is hoped that this review will guide the hierarchically ordered pore engineering of nanocatalysts for boosting the catalytic performance and promoting the practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remote Control of Energy Transformation&#8208;Based Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article focuses on a detailed summary of the energy transformation remote control strategy design for efficient cancer targeting long&#8208;term imaging and therapy, thereby expanding the remote control energy transformation window. By reviewing current research progress, this review paves the way for remote control applications of energy transformation&#8208;based cancer imaging and therapy.








Abstract
Cancer treatment requires precise tumor&#8208;specific targeting at specific sites that allows for high&#8208;resolution diagnostic imaging and long&#8208;term patient&#8208;tailorable cancer therapy; while, minimizing side effects largely arising from non&#8208;targetability. This can be realized by harnessing exogenous remote stimuli, such as tissue&#8208;penetrative ultrasound, magnetic field, light, and radiation, that enable local activation for cancer imaging and therapy in deep tumors. A myriad of nanomedicines can be efficiently activated when the energy of such remote stimuli can be transformed into another type of energy. This review discusses the remote control of energy transformation for targetable, efficient, and long&#8208;term cancer imaging and therapy. Such ultrasonic, magnetic, photonic, radiative, and radioactive energy can be transformed into mechanical, thermal, chemical, and radiative energy to enable a variety of cancer imaging and treatment modalities. The current review article describes multimodal energy transformation where a serial cascade or multiple types of energy transformation occur. This review includes not only mechanical, chemical, hyperthermia, and radiation therapy but also emerging thermoelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric therapies for cancer treatment. It also illustrates ultrasound, magnetic resonance, fluorescence, computed tomography, photoluminescence, and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapies. It highlights afterglow imaging that can eliminate autofluorescence for sustained signal emission after the excitation.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesized Glucan Materials: Opportunities from Applied Biocatalysis</title>

Linear d&#8208;glucans, simple yet versatile polysaccharides, shape nanostructures crucial for biomaterial development. Shifting from top&#8208;down to bottom&#8208;up synthesis using natural and engineered enzymes provides meticulous control over polymer structures, fostering diversification for macromolecular materials. This review introduces advancements in non&#8208;natural glucans, copolymers, and supramolecular hybrids, obtained through bottom&#8208;up enzymatic approaches. It emphasizes the potential of enzyme biocatalysis in material development.








Abstract
Linear d&#8208;glucans are natural polysaccharides of simple chemical structure. They are comprised of d&#8208;glucosyl units linked by a single type of glycosidic bond. Noncovalent interactions within, and between, the d&#8208;glucan chains give rise to a broad variety of macromolecular nanostructures that can assemble into crystalline&#8208;organized materials of tunable morphology. Structure design and functionalization of d&#8208;glucans for diverse material applications largely relies on top&#8208;down processing and chemical derivatization of naturally derived starting materials. The top&#8208;down approach encounters critical limitations in efficiency, selectivity, and flexibility. Bottom&#8208;up approaches of d&#8208;glucan synthesis offer different, and often more precise, ways of polymer structure control and provide means of functional diversification widely inaccessible to top&#8208;down routes of polysaccharide material processing. Here the natural and engineered enzymes (glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases and phosphorylases, glycosynthases) for d&#8208;glucan polymerization are described and the use of applied biocatalysis for the bottom&#8208;up assembly of specific d&#8208;glucan structures is shown. Advanced material applications of the resulting polymeric products are further shown and their important role in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials in a bio&#8208;based circular economy is discussed.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change colour in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy efficient windows being one of primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) were observed. The transition temperature was tunable from 11 to 61 &#870; C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement was observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. Here, we controlled TCR clustering via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibited higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. Our approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provide the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of the atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs was favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual-single-atom confined in N/O-doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual-confinement of the atomic sites and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule. CoZn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@CNTs was favorable for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect-rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment and enhanced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactivity/selectivity. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with CoZn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H-type cells. The obtained H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage/transportation. The sequential dual-cathode electron-Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) by activating the in-situ generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sodiophilic Substrate Induces NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate with abundant sodiophilic active sites holds promise for implementing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, the heightened electrode/electrolyte side reactions stemming from high specific surface area still hinder electrode structure stability and cycling reversibility, particularly under high current densities. Herein, we regulated the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) component and restrained detrimental side reactions through the uniform loading of Na&#8208;Sn alloy onto a porous 3D nanofiber framework (NaSn&#8208;PCNF). The strong interaction between Na&#8208;Sn alloy and PF6&#8722; anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn&#8208;PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 hours with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5&#160;mV under harsh condition of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cells and pouch cells exhibit accelerated reaction kinetics and splendid capacity retention, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced Na substrates for high&#8208;energy sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity towards NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here we present a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. We achieve a high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source has been a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. Here, we propose a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real&#8208;timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode Beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and SEI reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing an anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component cathode/electrolyte interphase proves effective for long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
