         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>

Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, we present a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, our Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52 A W&#8722;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34 &#215; 1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector was integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. Our work paves the avenue towards constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Refining Perovskite Heterojunctions for Effective Light&#8208;Emitting Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;heterojunction refinement strategy with wide&#8208;bandgap salts is used to engineer the bottom interfaces and the top interfaces associated with a perovskite. The double&#8208;heterojunction refinement allows both efficient light&#8208;harvesting through a photovoltaic response and light&#8208;emission under ultralow bias in the same device. By connecting to an electric battery, a multifunctional harvesting&#8211;storage&#8211;utilization system is realized.








Abstract
Solar cells capable of light&#8208;harvesting during daytime and light&#8208;emission at night are multifunctional semiconductor devices with many potential applications. Here, it is reported that halide perovskite heterojunction interfaces can be refined to yield stable and efficient solar cells. The cell can also operate effectively as an ultralow&#8208;voltage light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) with a peak external quantum efficiency&#160;of electroluminescence (EQEEL)&#160;of 3.3%. Spectroscopic and microscopic studies reveal that double&#8208;heterojunction refinement with wide&#8208;bandgap salts is key to densifying the packing of perovskite grains and enlarging the bandgaps of the perovskite surfaces that are in contact with charge&#8208;transport semiconductors. The refined perovskite enables a simple device with dual actions of solar cells and LEDs. This type of all&#8208;in&#8208;one device has the potential to be used in multifunctional harvesting&#8211;storage&#8211;utilization (HSU) systems.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, we introduce a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, we can maintain the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area. Our findings will open a new route towards the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, we comprehensively group the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit into three categories: (1) directly bridging one molecule&#8208;electrode component with another electrode, (2) physically bridging two molecule&#8208;electrode components, and (3) chemically bridging two molecule&#8208;electrode components. Finally, we discuss the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization and provide our perspectives, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Transcranial Nongenetic Neuromodulation via Bioinspired Vesicle&#8208;Enabled Precise NIR&#8208;II Optical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcranial nongenetic biological modulation via nanovesicle&#8208;enabled precise second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) optical&#8208;stimulation is presented. The bioinspired vesicles obtained from membrane&#8208;confined enzymatic reactions can mediate NIR&#8208;II photothermal stimuli to elicit neuronal signaling dynamics and evoke defined neural circuits. Eliminating implants and integrating brain&#8208;imaging techniques, the vesicle&#8208;enabled multimodal NIR&#8208;II neurostimulation allows behavioral modulation of nontransgenic organisms with minimal invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution.








Abstract
Regulating the activity of specific neurons is essentially important in neurocircuit dissection and neuropathy therapy. As a recently developed strategy, nanomaterial&#8208;enabled nongenetic neuromodulations that realize remote physical stimuli have made vast progress and shown great clinical potential. However, minimal invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution are still challenging for nongenetic neuromodulation. Herein, a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;light&#8208;induced transcranial nongenetic neurostimulation via bioinspired nanovesicles is reported. The rationally designed vesicles are obtained from vesicle&#8208;membrane&#8208;confined enzymatic reactions. This study demonstrates that the vesicle&#8208;enabled NIR&#8208;II photothermal stimuli can elicit neuronal signaling dynamics with precise spatiotemporal control and thus evoke defined neural circuits in nontransgenic mice. Moreover, the vesicle&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II optical stimulation can regulate mouse motor behaviors with minimal invasiveness by eliminating light&#8208;emitting implants. Furthermore, the biological modulation is integrated with photoacoustic brain imaging, realizing navigational, and efficient neuromodulation. Such transcranial and precise NIR&#8208;II optical neuromodulation mediated by bioinspired vesicles shows the potential for the optical&#8208;theranostics of neurological diseases in nontransgenic organisms.

Leveraging highly oriented thin films, a ferrielectric phase is observed in PbZrO3 at room temperature and low field. Ferrielectricity is observed in modulations of amplitude and direction of the spontaneous polarization and large anisotropy for critical electric fields, and is qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions, and correlates with high dielectric tunability and large strains.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric materials, where the transition between antipolar and polar phase is controlled by external electric fields, offer exceptional energy storage capacity with high efficiencies, giant electrocaloric effect, and superb electromechanical response. PbZrO3 is the first discovered and the archetypal antiferroelectric material. Nonetheless, substantial challenges in processing phase pure PbZrO3 have limited studies of the undoped composition, hindering understanding of the phase transitions in this material or unraveling the controversial origins of a low&#8208;field ferroelectric phase observed in lead zirconate thin films. Leveraging highly oriented PbZrO3 thin films, a room&#8208;temperature ferrielectric phase is observed in the absence of external electric fields, with modulations of amplitude and direction of the spontaneous polarization and large anisotropy for critical electric fields required for phase transition. The ferrielectric state observations are qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions, and correlate with very high dielectric tunability, and ultrahigh strains (up to 1.1%). This work suggests a need for re&#8208;evaluation of the fundamental science of antiferroelectricity in this archetypal&#160;material.

         <title>Taming Solvent&#8211;Solute Interaction Accelerates Interfacial Kinetics in Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desolvation is validated as the predominant contributor to energy loss at low temperatures, largely overwhelming the contributions from other interfacial ion transportation processes. A rational and original design by taming solvent&#8211;solute interaction with low&#8208;affinity solvents like 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is proposed to enable high capacity and durable operation of practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries at &#8722;40 &#176;C.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries promise energy density beyond 400 Wh kg&#8722;1, while their practical operation at an extreme temperature below &#8722;30 &#176;C suffers severe capacity deterioration. Such battery failure highly relates to the remarkably increased kinetic barrier of interfacial processes, including interfacial desolvation, ion transportation, and charge transfer. In this work, the interfacial kinetics in three prototypical electrolytes are quantitatively probed by three&#8208;electrode electrochemical techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. Desolvation as the limiting step of interfacial processes is validated to dominate the cell impedance and capacity at low temperature. 1,3&#8208;Dioxolane&#8208;based electrolyte with tamed solvent&#8211;solute interaction facilitates fast desolvation, enabling the practical Li|LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cells at &#8722;40 &#176;C to retain 66% of room&#8208;temperature capacity and withstand remarkably fast charging rate (0.3 C). The barrier of desolvation dictated by solvent&#8211;solute interaction environments is quantitatively uncovered. Regulating the solvent&#8211;solute interaction by low&#8208;affinity solvents emerges as a promising solution to low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>In Situ Halide Exchange of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskites for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are achieved by introducing multifunctional organic halide salts to treat perovskite films, which can facilitate halide exchange and passivate defects of 3D perovskites. The LEDs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 4.6% and a luminance of &#8776;1680&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), close to the Rec.&#160;2020 blue standard.








Abstract
3D perovskites are promising to achieve efficient and bright deep&#8208;blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which are required for lighting and display applications. However, the efficiency of deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskite&#8208;based LEDs is limited by high density of defects in perovskites, and their deep&#8208;blue emission is not easy to achieve due to the halide phase separation and low solubility of chloride in precursor solutions. Here, an in situ halide exchange method is developed to achieve deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskites by spin&#8208;coating an organic halide salts solution to treat blue 3D perovskites. It is revealed that the halide&#8208;exchange process is mainly determined by halide ion diffusion targeting a concentration equalization, which leads to homogeneous 3D mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. By further introducing multifunctional organic ammonium halide salts into the exchange solution to passivate defects, high&#8208;quality deep&#8208;blue perovskites with reduced trap density can be obtained. This approach leads to efficient deep&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6% and a luminance of 1680&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), very close to the Rec. 2020 blue standard. Moreover, the halide exchange method is bidirectional, and blue perovskite LEDs can be achieved with color coordinates of (0.095, 0.160), exhibiting a high EQE of 11.3%.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling as the precursors, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation under ambient conditions. The liquid precursor allowed easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantages of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene could be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8764;15 wt%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes was demonstrated via a selective in&#8208;situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the highly structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects showed an electrical conductivity of 4380 S/m and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically flat, 2D&#160;edge directed self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers are demonstrated as sub&#8208;10 nm nanopatterns that are remarkably well&#8208;aligned along the atomic edge of 2D flakes, including graphene, MoS2, and h&#8208;BN, and they are readily exploited for nanoscale shape engineering of 2D materials. The resultant highly aligned sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;wide graphene nanoribbon exhibits superior switching characteristics (on&#8208;to&#8208;off ratio of &#8776;6 &#215; 104).








Abstract
Nanoscale shape engineering is an essential requirement for the practical use of 2D&#160;materials, aiming at precisely customizing optimal structures and properties. In this work, sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;scale block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembled nanopatterns finely aligned along the atomic edge of 2D flakes, including graphene, MoS2, and h&#8208;BN, are exploited for reliable nanopatterning of 2D materials. The underlying mechanism for the alignment of the self&#8208;assembled nanodomains is elucidated based on the wetting layer alternation of the BCP film in the presence of intermediate 2D flakes. The resultant highly aligned nanocylinder templates with remarkably low levels of line edge roughness (LER) and line&#8208;width roughness (LWR) yield a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;wide graphene nanoribbon (GNR) array with noticeable switching characteristics (on&#8208;to&#8208;off ratio up to &#8776;6 &#215; 104).

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The importance of modulations has been elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, are utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges, but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which will stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations towards a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>

Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. The in&#8208;situ absorption spectrum study indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1 based 1 cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent PCE of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Slot-die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll-to-roll (R2R) processing of large-area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large-area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx-1 and Qx-2, show quite different film-formation kinetics in the slot-die coating process. The &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; absorption spectrum study indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx-2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx-1 based 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible device exhibits an excellent PCE of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot-die coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx-2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e. gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which improves the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. We&#160;present the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors. We&#160;found that the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (which we&#160;term HACS) response was&#160;dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8211;ratio of diameters and helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, we&#160;could obtain sensors that responded to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values. We&#160;found a greater auxetic character resulted in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8211;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, we&#160;obtained the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far. We&#160;propose a mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally.

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;assembly of Silica Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since we still lack the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, we provide such means based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in&#8208;vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, we generated a library of stereoisomers, which allowed us to characterize different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, we were able to control the morphology of silica particles via manipulation of the template precursors.

         <title>Dynamic Sustainable Polyimide Film Combining Hardness with Softness via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;Like&#8221; Bionic Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic polyimide (PI) film, which can transform among three molecular structures,&#160;is designed by imitating the behavior of the Mimosa plant. The PI film is a super&#8208;corona&#8208;resistant film, a matrix of high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor and carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced composites due to its excellent capabilities of degradation, self&#8208;healable ability, and recyclability.








Abstract
Dielectric polyimides (PIs)&#160;are ubiquitous as insulation in electrical power systems and electronic devices. Generally, dynamic polyimide is required to solve irreversible failure processes of electrical or mechanical damage, for example, under high temperature, pressure, and field strength. The challenge lies in the design of the molecular structure of rigid polyimide to achieve dynamic reversibility. Herein, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyimide gene unit is designed to crosslink with polyimide ligase to prepare the smart film. Interestingly, due to the variability of gene unit and ligase combinations, the polyimide films combining hardness with softness are designed into three forms via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;like&#8221; bionic strategy to adapt to different application scenarios. Meanwhile, the films have good degradation efficiency, excellent recyclability, and can be self&#8208;healable, which makes them reuse. Clearly, the films can be used in the preparation of ultrafast sensors with a response time &#8776;0.15 s and the application of corona&#8208;resistant films with 100% recovery. Furthermore, the construction of polyimide and carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced composites (CFRCs) has been verified to apply to the worse environment. Nicely, the composites have the property of multiple cycles and the non&#8208;destructive recycle rate of carbon fiber (CF) is as high as 100%. The design idea of preparing high&#8208;strength dynamic polyimide by crosslinking simple polyimide gene unit with ligase could provide a good foundation and a clear case for the sustainable development of electrical and electronic polyimides, from the perspective of Mimosa bionics.

         <title>Fluorination Enhances NIR&#8208;II Emission and Photothermal Conversion Efficiency of Phototheranostic Agents for Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination of A&#8211;D&#8211;A type planar phototheranostic agents can simultaneously enhance NIR&#8208;II quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Accordingly, the structure of vasculature and NIR&#8208;IIimaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy of tumor are successfully achieved owing to the high NIR&#8208;II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%) of fluorinated phototheranostic agents. This work provides an intriguing guideline for designing highly efficient NIR&#8208;II phototheranostic agents.








Abstract
Phototheranostics with second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging and photothermal effect have become a burgeoning biotechnology for tumor diagnosis and precise treatment. As important parameters of phototheranostic agents (PTAs), fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) are usually considered as a pair of contradictions that is difficult to be simultaneously enhanced. Herein, a fluorination strategy for designing A&#8211;D&#8211;A type PTAs with synchronously improved QY and PCE is proposed. Experimental results show that the molar extinction coefficient (&#949;), NIR&#8208;II QY, and PCE of all fluorinated PTAs nanoparticles (NPs) are definitely improved compared with the chlorinated counterparts. Theoretical calculation results demonstrate that fluorination can maximize the electrostatic potential difference by virtue of the high electronegativity of fluorine, which may increase intra/intermolecular D&#8211;A interactions, tighten molecule packing,&#160;and further promote the increase of &#949;, ultimately leading to simultaneously enhanced QY and PCE. In these PTA NPs, FY6&#8208;NPs display NIR&#8208;II emission extended to 1400&#160;nm with the highest NIR&#8208;II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%). These features make FY6&#8208;NPs perform well in high&#8208;resolution imaging of vasculature and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors. This study develops a valuable guideline for constructing NIR&#8208;II organic PTAs with high performance.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorination of A&#8211;D&#8211;A type planar phototheranostic agents can simultaneously enhance NIR-II quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Accordingly, the structure of vasculature and NIR-IIimaging-guided photothermal therapy of tumor are successfully achieved owing to the high NIR-II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%) of fluorinated phototheranostic agents. This work provides an intriguing guideline for designing highly efficient NIR-II phototheranostic agents.

         <title>Injectable Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Supramolecular Nanofiber Hydrogel to Promote Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy in Age&#8208;Related Macular Degeneration Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF), with CaCl2. Such a BetP hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents can prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy, and may be readily translated into clinical use for age&#8208;related macular degeneration treatment, with the potential to replace the current therapy.








Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual impairment and severe vision loss worldwide, while the currently available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Previous studies have demonstrated both inflammation and oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;induced damage to the retinal pigment epithelium are involved in the pathogenesis of aberrant development of blood vessels in wet AMD (wet&#8208;AMD). Although antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (e.g., Ranibizumab) can impair the growth of new blood vessels, side effects are still found with repeated monthly intravitreal injections. Here, an injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by simply mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), a clinic anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, anti&#8208;VEGF, the gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;VEGF drug for AMD treatment, with CaCl2. Upon intravitreal injection, such BetP&#8208;based hydrogel (BetP&#8208;Gel),&#160;while enabling long&#8208;term sustained release of anti&#8208;VEGF to inhibit vascular proliferation in the retina and attenuate choroidal neovascularization, can also scavenge reactive oxygen species to reduce local inflammation. Remarkably, such BetP&#8208;Gel can dramatically prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy. Notably, anti&#8208;VEGF&#8208;loaded supramolecular hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents may be readily translated into clinical use for AMD treatment, with the potential to replace the current anti&#8208;VEGF therapy.

         <title>Phosphorous Dendron Micelles as a Nanomedicine Platform for Cooperative Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doxorubicin&#8208;loaded nanomedicine formulation based on phosphorus dendron micelles with intrinsic immunomodulatory activity is constructed. The created nanomedicine can synergistically proliferate natural killer (NK) cells, recruit tumor&#8208;infiltrating NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, and decrease regulatory T cells, thus allowing for chemoimmunotherapy of tumors with strong antitumor immunity and immune memory effect for effective prevention of lung metastasis.








Abstract
Design of effective nanomedicines to modulate multiple immune cells to overcome the immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment is desirable to improve the overall poor clinical outcomes of immunotherapy. Herein, a nanomedicine platform is reported based on chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded phosphorus dendron micelles (M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX, TBP, tyramine bearing two dimethylphosphonate) with inherent immunomodulatory activity for synergistic tumor chemoimmunotherapy. The M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX micelles with good stability and a mean particle size of 86.4 nm can deliver DOX to solid tumors to induce significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). With the demonstrated intrinsic activity of M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa that can promote the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, the ICD&#8208;resulted maturation of dendritic cells of the DOX&#8208;loaded micelles, and the combination of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody, the synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation, recruitment of tumor&#8208;infiltrating NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, and decrease of regulatory T cells for effective tumor chemoimmunotherapy with strong antitumor immunity and immune memory effect for effective prevention of lung metastasis are demonstrated. The developed phosphorous dendron micelles may hold great promise to be used as an advanced nanomedicine formulation for synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation for effective chemoimmunotherapy of different tumor types.

         <title>Tailored Polypeptide Star Copolymers for 3D Printing of Bacterial Composites Via Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printing of biocompatible hydrogel networks based on the self&#8208;assembly of 3&#8208;arm polypeptide stars permits the additive manufacturing of &#8220;living&#8221; objects. In this work, the design of the 3&#8208;arm block copolypeptide stars allows for tuning of mechanical properties and printing performance while also directly impacting the proliferation, activity, and colony formation of embedded Escherichia coli.








Abstract
Hydrogels hold much promise for 3D printing of functional living materials; however, challenges remain in tailoring mechanical robustness as well as biological performance. In addressing this challenge, the modular synthesis of functional hydrogels from 3&#8208;arm diblock copolypeptide stars composed of an inner poly(l&#8208;glutamate) domain and outer poly(l&#8208;tyrosine) or poly(l&#8208;valine) blocks is described. Physical crosslinking due to &#223;&#8208;sheet assembly of these star block copolymers gives mechanical stability during extrusion printing and the selective incorporation of methacrylate units allows for subsequent photocrosslinking to occur under biocompatible conditions. This permits direct ink writing (DIW) printing of bacteria&#8208;based mixtures leading to 3D objects with high fidelity and excellent bacterial viability. The tunable stiffness of different copolypeptide networks enables control over proliferation and colony formation for embedded Escherichia coli bacteria as demonstrated via isopropyl &#223;&#8208;d&#8208;1&#8208;thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. This translation of molecular structure to network properties highlights the versatility of these polypeptide hydrogel systems with the combination of writable structures and biological activity illustrating the future potential of these 3D&#8208;printed biocomposites.

         <title>Reducing Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells via Extending the Fused Ring Donor Unit of an A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;Type Nonfullerene Acceptor for Over 17% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the donor core in a nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) is applied to suppress trap states in organic solar cells (OSCs). TTPIC&#8208;4F with an extended core exhibits higher crystallinity than BTPIC&#8208;4F. Thus, D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based OSCs afford a lower trap density of 4.02&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for higher mobility and reduced &#916;Enr, and achieve an impressive PCE of 17.1%, which is the record for A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type NFAs.








Abstract
The high trap density (generally 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3) in thin films of organic semiconductors is the primary reason for the inferior charge&#8208;carrier mobility and large nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) in organic solar cells (OSCs), limiting improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this study, the trap density in OSCs is efficiently reduced via extending the donor core of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) from a heptacyclic unit to a nonacyclic unit. TTPIC&#8208;4F with a nonacyclic unit has stronger intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, affording higher crystallinity in thin films relative to its counterpart BTPIC&#8208;4F. Thus, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based device achieves a lower trap density of 4.02&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, comparable to some typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid semiconductors, with higher mobility and inhibited charge&#8208;carrier recombination in devices. Therefore, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based OSC exhibits an impressive PCE of 17.1% with a low &#916;Enr of 0.208&#160;eV, which is the best known value for A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type NFAs. Therefore, extending the donor core of NFAs is an efficient method for suppressing trap states in OSCs for high PCEs.

&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt;, and achieve an impressive PCE of 17.1%, which is the record for A&#8211;D&#8211;A-type NFAs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high trap density (generally 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) in thin films of organic semiconductors is the primary reason for the inferior charge-carrier mobility and large nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt;) in organic solar cells (OSCs), limiting improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this study, the trap density in OSCs is efficiently reduced via extending the donor core of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) from a heptacyclic unit to a nonacyclic unit. TTPIC-4F with a nonacyclic unit has stronger intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, affording higher crystallinity in thin films relative to its counterpart BTPIC-4F. Thus, the D18:TTPIC-4F-based device achieves a lower trap density of 4.02&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to some typical high-performance inorganic/hybrid semiconductors, with higher mobility and inhibited charge-carrier recombination in devices. Therefore, the D18:TTPIC-4F-based OSC exhibits an impressive PCE of 17.1% with a low &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.208&#160;eV, which is the best known value for A&#8211;D&#8211;A-type NFAs. Therefore, extending the donor core of NFAs is an efficient method for suppressing trap states in OSCs for high PCEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe in regenerated LiFePO4 (RSLFP@NC), which effectively restrains Fe migration and the formation of antisite defects during cycling. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with &#8776;80% retention after 1000&#160;cycles, which is better than the cycling performance of pristine LiFePO4.








Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) has been produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li+ diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. In this work, spent LFP is regenerated by using environmentally friendly ethanol, and its cycling stability is promoted by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via construction of a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The Li+ diffusion kinetics in the regenerated LFP are improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, &#160;the regenerated LFP exhibits an ultrastable cycling performance at a high rate of 10&#160;C with &#8776;80% capacity retention after 1000&#160;cycles.

         <title>A Janus Au&#8211;Polymersome Heterostructure with Near&#8208;Field Enhancement Effect for Implant&#8208;Associated Infection Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Janus Au&#8211;porphyrin polymersome heterostructure (J&#8208;AuPPS) is constructed by a facile one&#8208;step photocatalytic synthesis process. The near&#8208;field enhancement effect between the porphyrin polymersome and Au nanoparticles in the as&#8208;prepared J&#8208;AuPPS is achieved to synergistically improve the photochemical activity. As a result, J&#8208;AuPPS shows enhanced in vitro&#160;and in vivo phototherapy effects in bacterial ablation and combating implant&#8208;associated infections.








Abstract
Polymer&#8211;inorganic hybrid Janus nanoparticles (PI&#8208;JNPs) have attracted extensive attention due to their special structures and functions. However, achieving the synergistic enhancement of photochemical activity between polymer and inorganic moieties in PI&#8208;JNPs remains challenging. Herein, the construction of a novel Janus Au&#8211;porphyrin polymersome (J&#8208;AuPPS) heterostructure by a facile one&#8208;step photocatalytic synthesis is reported. The near&#8208;field enhancement (NFE) effect between porphyrin polymersome (PPS) and Au nanoparticles in J&#8208;AuPPS is achieved to enhance its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption and electric/thermal field intensity at their interface, which improves the energy transfer and energetic charge&#8208;carrier generation. Therefore, J&#8208;AuPPS shows a higher NIR&#8208;activated photothermal conversion efficiency (48.4%) and generates more singlet oxygen compared with non&#8208;Janus core&#8211;particle Au&#8211;PPS nanostructure (28.4%). As a result, J&#8208;AuPPS exhibits excellent dual&#8208;mode (photothermal/photodynamic) antibacterial and anti&#8208;biofilm performance, thereby significantly enhancing&#160;the in vivo therapeutic effect in an implant&#8208;associated&#8208;infection rat model. This work is believed to motivate the rational design of advanced hybrid JNPs with desirable NFE effect and further extend their biological applications.

         <title>Attenuating Metabolic Competition of Tumor Cells for Favoring the Nutritional Demand of Immune Cells by a Branched Polymeric Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor cells are dominant in the nutritional competition in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and their metabolic abnormalities often lead to microenvironmental acidosis and nutrient deprivation, thereby impairing the function of immune cells and diminishing the anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect. Herein, we report a branched polymeric conjugate and its efficacy in attenuating the metabolic competition of tumor cells. Compared with the control nanoparticles prepared from its linear counterpart, the branched conjugate&#8208;based nanoparticles (branched NPs) could more efficiently accumulate in the tumor tissue and interfere with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the TME, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells. Its combined treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) achieved an enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effect. Our work presents a promising approach for targeting the metabolic competition in the TME to enhance the chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect against cancers.

         <title>Gold Nanobipyramid&#8208;Mediated Apoptotic Camouflage of Adipocytes for Obesity Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Obesity treatment is a global public health challenge due to the inadequate weight loss and weight regain even after endeavors with multimodal treatments. Considering abundant resident macrophages in adipose tissues, precise regulation of the interactions between macrophages and adipocytes may provide chances for immunotherapy of obesity. Herein, inspired by the phagocytosis of macrophages to clear apoptotic cells in homeostasis, an immunotherapy strategy for obesity treatment was proposed for the first time through apoptotic camouflage of adipocytes by PAAu BPs to activate macrophages for clearance, where PAAu BPs were gold nanobipyramids engineered with adipose&#8208;targeting and apoptotic cell&#8208;mimicking functions. During the clearance, macrophage was switched from pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 to anti&#8208;inflammatory M2, remarkably modulating the immune microenvironment of adipose tissues to prevent weight regain. After inguinal injection with PAAu BPs, the body weights of obesity mice were effectively decreased by 24.4%, and could be decreased by 33.3% when combined with photothermal lipolysis, and little weight regain was associated with treatments. This study demonstrates the strategy of camouflaging adipocytes with apoptotic feature holds great potential for obesity immunotherapy.

         <title>Assembly of Fillable Microrobotic Systems by Microfluidic Loading with Dip Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microrobots can provide spatiotemporally well&#8208;controlled cargo delivery that can improve therapeutic efficiency compared to conventional drug delivery strategies. Robust microfabrication methods to expand the variety of materials or cargoes that can be incorporated into microrobots could greatly broaden the scope of their functions. However, current surface coating or direct blending techniques used for cargo loading result in inefficient loading and poor cargo protection during transportation, which leads to cargo waste, degradation, and non&#8208;specific release. Herein, we present a versatile platform to fabricate fillable microrobots using Microfluidic Loading and Dip Sealing (MLDS). MLDS enables the encapsulation of different types of cargoes within hollow microrobots and protection of cargo integrity. The technique is supported by high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with an integrated microfluidic loading system, which realises a highly precise loading process and improves cargo loading capacity. A corresponding dip sealing strategy was developed to encase and protect the loaded cargo whilst maintaining the geometric and structural integrity of the loaded microrobots. This dip sealing technique is suitable for different materials, including thermal and light responsive materials. The MLDS platform provides new opportunities for microrobotic systems in targeted drug delivery, environmental sensing, and chemically powered micromotor applications.

However, current surface coating or direct blending techniques used for cargo loading result in inefficient loading and poor cargo protection during transportation, which leads to cargo waste, degradation, and non-specific release. Herein, we present a versatile platform to fabricate fillable microrobots using Microfluidic Loading and Dip Sealing (MLDS). MLDS enables the encapsulation of different types of cargoes within hollow microrobots and protection of cargo integrity. The technique is supported by high-resolution 3D printing with an integrated microfluidic loading system, which realises a highly precise loading process and improves cargo loading capacity. A corresponding dip sealing strategy was developed to encase and protect the loaded cargo whilst maintaining the geometric and structural integrity of the loaded microrobots. This dip sealing technique is suitable for different materials, including thermal and light responsive materials. The MLDS platform provides new opportunities for microrobotic systems in targeted drug delivery, environmental sensing, and chemically powered micromotor applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Portable Nanowire Array Gas Sensor for Dynamic NO2 monitoring at room temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand of self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8208;i&#8208;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device was designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor was integrated onto a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. Our results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

Abstract
Lithium&#8722;air (Li&#8722;air) batteries stand out among the post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density, which has rapidly progressed in the past years. Regarding the fundamental mechanism of Li&#8208;air batteries that discharge products produced and decomposed during charging and recharging progress, the reversibility of products closely affects the battery performance. Along with the upsurge of the mainstream discharge products lithium peroxide, with devoted efforts to screening electrolytes, constructing high&#8208;efficiency cathodes, and optimizing anodes, much progress has been made in the fundamental understanding and performance. However, the limited advancement is insufficient. In this case, the investigations of other discharge products, including lithium hydroxide, lithium superoxide, lithium oxide, and lithium carbonate, emerge and bring breakthroughs for the Li&#8722;air battery technologies. To deepen the understanding of the electrochemical reactions and conversions of discharge products in the battery, we systematically review recent advances in the various discharge products, mainly focusing on the growth and decomposition mechanisms and the determining factors. We also provide perspectives for Li&#8722;air batteries on the fundamental development of discharge products and future applications.

         <title>A Universal Perovskite Nanocrystal Ink for High&#8208;Performance Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Semiconducting lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are regarded as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices due to their solution processability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. While the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaics (PVs), two prime examples of optoelectronic devices, has recently seen a multitude of efforts towards high&#8208;performance PNC&#8208;based devices, realizing both devices with high efficiencies and stabilities through a single PNC processing strategy has remained a challenge. Herein we demonstrate that diphenylproplyammonium (DPAI) surface ligands, found through a judicious ab initio based ligand search, provide a solution to this problem. Our universal PNC ink with DPAI ligands, prepared through a solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange process, simultaneously allows single&#8208;step processed LED and PV devices with peak electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 17.00% and power conversion efficiency of 14.92% (stabilized output 14.00%), respectively. We reveal that a careful design of the aromatic rings such as in DPAI is the decisive factor in bestowing such high performances, ease of solution processing, and improved phase stability up to 120 days. Our work illustrates the power of ligand design in producing nanocrystal ink formulations for high&#8208;throughput production of optoelectronic devices; it also paves a path for &#8220;dual&#8208;mode&#8221; devices with both PV and LED functionalities.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8208;ZnO Solid Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8208;ZnO homogeneous solid solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8208;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39&#8806;x&#8806;0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density function theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid solution films.

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multi&#8208;Functional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires identifying the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs were mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for identifying the similarity function. Sneak current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying&#8208;memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors' inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

Hydro&#8208;electric nanogenerators have been previously proposed to recycle various water resources (e.g., sea water, ground water, sweat, or rain) and polluted water. However, as the conventional hydro&#8208;electric nanogenerator only utilizes water resources, it cannot provide a fundamental solution for water recycling. In this study, we propose a water purification membrane that can simultaneously generate electricity during the purification process (Electricity generation and purification membrane, EPM) for water recycling. As polluted water passes through the EPM, the water is purified in the perpendicular direction, while electricity is simultaneously produced in the horizontal direction by the movement of ions. Notably, EPM exhibited high energy generation performances (maximum power 16.44 &#956;W and energy 15.16 mJ) by the streaming effect of water&#8208;streaming carbon nanotubes (CNT) and ion&#8208;permselective effect of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). Moreover, by using poly(acrylic acid)/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAA/CMC) binder to EPM, we substantially improved the energy generation performance and long&#8208;term stability and provided outstanding mechanical stability, regardless of the acidity of the water source (pH 1&#8211;10). More importantly, EPM exhibited the water purification characteristics of &gt;90% rejection of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm pollutants and potentiality of angstrom level cation rejection, with simultaneous and continuous energy generation. Overall, this study proposed an efficient EPM model, which can be potentially used as a next&#8208;generation renewable energy generation approach, thus laying the foundation for effective utilization of polluted water resources.

Abstract
Mesocrystals are a class of nanostructured material, where a multiple&#8208;length&#8208;scale structure is a prerequisite of many interesting phenomena. Resolving the mesocrystal structure is quite challenging due to their structuration on different length scales. The combination of small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) techniques offers the possibility of non&#8208;destructively probing mesocrystalline structures simultaneously, over multiple length scales to reveal their microscopic structure. This work describes how high dynamical range of modern detectors sheds light on the weak features of scattering, significantly increasing the information content. The detailed analysis of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) from the magnetite mesocrystals with different particle sizes and shapes is described, in tandem with electron microscopy. The revealed features provide valuable input to the models of mesocrystal growth and the choice of structural motif; the impact on magnetic properties is discussed.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Photosensitizer&#8208;Loaded Nano&#8208;Superartificial Dendritic Cells with Directly Presenting Tumor Antigens and Reversed Immunosuppression for Photodynamically Boosted Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;superartificial dendritic cells (saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs) are developed by coating superartificial dendritic cells membranes onto aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers. The outer cell membranes are derived from engineered 4T1 cells in which pMHC&#8208;I, CD86, and anti&#8208;LAG3 are simultaneously anchored. saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs directly stimulate T&#8208;cell activation and reverse T&#8208;cell exhaustion for cancer immunotherapy. The inner AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers induce immunogenic cell death to improve tumor microenvironment, which boosts immunotherapy efficiency.








Abstract
The success of tumor immunotherapy highlights the potential of harnessing immune system to fight cancer. Activating both native T cells and exhausted T cells is a critical step for generating effective antitumor immunity, which is determined based on the efficient presentation of tumor antigens and co&#8208;stimulatory signals by antigen&#8208;presenting cells, as well as immunosuppressive reversal. However, strategies for achieving an efficient antigen presentation process and improving the&#160;immunosuppressive microenvironment remain unresolved. Here, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) photosensitizer&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;superartificial dendritic cells (saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs) are developed by coating superartificial dendritic cells membranes from genetically engineered 4T1 tumor cells onto nanoaggregates of AIE photosensitizers. The outer cell membranes of saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs are derived from recombinant lentivirus&#8208;infected 4T1 tumor cells in which peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex class I, CD86, and anti&#8208;LAG3 antibody are simultaneously anchored. These saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs could directly stimulate T&#8208;cell activation and reverse T&#8208;cell exhaustion for cancer immunotherapy. The inner AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers induce immunogenic cell death to activate dendritic cells and enhance T lymphocyte infiltration by photodynamic therapy, promoting the transformation of &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into &#8220;hot tumors,&#8221; which further boosts&#160;immunotherapy efficiency. This work presents a powerful photoactive and artificial antigen&#8208;presenting platform for activating both native T cells and exhausted T cells, as well as facilitating tumor photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
Despite recent rapid growth, traditional synthetic approaches to quantum materials have limited architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can tailor structures over a wide range of length scales. This review explores opportunities for soft matter to impact quantum material synthesis, highlighting existing work at the interface, and offering perspectives on soft&#8208;matter&#8208;enabled quantum materials.








Abstract
The field of quantum materials has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by exciting new discoveries with immense transformative potential. Traditional synthetic methods to quantum materials have, however, limited the exploration of architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can be used to tailor material structure over a large range of length scales, with a vast array of possible form factors, promising emerging quantum material properties at the mesoscale. This review explores opportunities for soft matter science to impact the synthesis of quantum materials with advanced properties. Existing work at the interface of these two fields is highlighted, and perspectives are provided on possible future directions by discussing the potential benefits and challenges which can arise from their bridging.

         <title>Suppressing the dynamic oxygen evolution of sodium layered cathodes through synergistic surface dielectric polarization and bulk site&#8208;Selective Co&#8208;doping</title>

Abstract
Utilizing anionic redox activity within layered oxide cathode materials represents a transformational avenue for enabling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the anionic oxygen redox reaction is often accompanied with irreversible dynamic oxygen evolution, leading to unfavorable structural distortion and thus severe voltage decay and rapid capacity fading. Herein, we propose and validate that the dynamic oxygen evolution can be effectively suppressed through the synergistic surface CaTiO3 dielectric coating and bulk site&#8208;selective Ca/Ti co&#8208;doping for layered Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. The surface dielectric coating layer not only suppresses the surface oxygen release but more importantly inhibits the bulk oxygen migration by creating a reverse electric field through dielectric polarization. Meanwhile, the site&#8208;selective doping of oxygen&#8208;affinity Ca into Na layers and Ti into transition metal layers effectively stabilizes the bulk oxygen through modulating the O 2p band center and the oxygen migration barrier. Such a strategy also leads to a reversible structural evolution with a low volume change because of the enhanced structural integrality and improved oxygen rigidity. Because of these synergistic advantages, the designed electrode exhibits greatly suppressed voltage decay and capacity fading upon long&#8208;term cycling. Our study affords a promising strategy for regulating the dynamic oxygen evolution to achieve high&#8208;capacity layered cathode materials.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, most MOFs are difficult to grow spontaneously or be processed into films. Here, we demonstrate a convenient strategy for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, most MOFs are difficult to grow spontaneously or be processed into films. Here, we demonstrate a convenient strategy for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are promising candidates for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the pure&#8208;red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) available today made from mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs suffer from a compromise in their emission efficiency and spectral stability on account of severe trap&#8208;mediated nonradiative recombination loss, halide phase segregation, and self&#8208;doping effect, all of which are caused by the surface halide vacancies. Herein, we introduced a &#8220;halide&#8208;equivalent&#8221; anion of benzenesulfonate (BS&#8722;) into CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs as multifunctional additive to simultaneously address the above challenging issues. Joint experiment&#8208;theory characterizations reveal that the BS&#8722; can not only passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ related defects at surface of NCs, but also increase the formation energy of halide vacancies, resulting in substantially improved optical properties and phase stability of NCs. Moreover, electrons are expected to transfer from the CsPb(Br/I)3 NC to BS&#8722; because of the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing property of sulfonate group, which reduces the self&#8208;doping effect and alters the n&#8208;type behavior of CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs to near ambipolarity for balancing carrier injection in the device. Eventually, synergistic boost in device performance is achieved for pure&#8208;red PeLEDs with Commission Internationale del'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.70, 0.30) and a champion external quantum efficiency of 23.5%, which is a record value among the ever&#8208;reported red PeLEDs approaching to the Rec. 2020 red primary color. Moreover, the BS&#8722;&#8208;modified PeLEDs demonstrates robust spectral stability, showing negligible wavelength shift under different operating voltages. This strategy paves an efficient way for improving the efficiency and stability of pure&#8208;red PeLEDs.

         <title>Simple Visualization of Universal Ferroelastic Domain Walls in Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Domain features and domain walls in lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have attracted broad interest due to their potential impact on optoelectronic properties of this unique class of solution&#8208;processable semiconductors. Using non&#8208;polarized light and simple imaging configurations, we directly visualize ferroelastic twin domains and their switchings through multiple consecutive phase transitions. This direct optical contrast originates from finite optical reflections at the wall interface between two compositionally identical, orientationally different, optically anisotropic domains inside the material bulk. Our findings show these domain walls serve as internal reflectors and steer energy transport inside halide perovskites optically. First&#8208;principles calculations show universal low domain&#8208;wall energies and modest energy barriers of domain switching, confirming their prevalent appearance, stable presence, and facile moving observed in the experiments. The generality of ferroelasticity in halide perovskites stems from their soft bonding characteristics. This work shows the feasibility of using LHP twin domain walls as optical guides of internal photoexcitations, capable of non&#8208;volatile on&#8208;off switching and tunable positioning endowed by their universal ferroelasticity.

         <title>Reshaping de Novo Protein Switches into Bioresponsive Materials for Biomarker, Toxin, and Viral Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
De novo designed protein switches are powerful tools to specifically and sensitively detect diverse targets with simple chemiluminescent readouts.[6] Finding an appropriate material host for de novo design protein switches without altering their thermodynamics while preserving their intrinsic stability over time would enable the development of a variety of sensing formats to monitor exposure to pathogens, toxins, and for disease diagnosis. Here we generate a de novo protein&#8208;biopolymer hybrid that maintains the detection capabilities induced by the conformational change of the incorporated proteins in response to analytes of interest in multiple, shelf&#8208;stable material formats without the need of refrigerated storage conditions. A set of functional demonstrator devices including personal protective equipment such as masks and laboratory gloves, free&#8208;standing films, air quality monitors, and wearable devices is presented to illustrate the versatility of the approach. Such formats are designed to be responsive to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), anti&#8208;hepatitis B (HBV) antibodies, Botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). This combination of form and function offers wide opportunities for ubiquitous sensing in multiple environments by enabling a large class of bio&#8208;responsive interfaces of broad utility.

Abstract
Ferroelectric materials have been intensively investigated for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory devices in past decades owing to their nonvolatile polarization characteristics. Ferroelectric memory devices are expected to exhibit lower power consumption and higher speed than conventional memory devices. However, non&#8208;complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and degradation due to fatigue of traditional perovskite&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have hindered the development of high&#8208;density and high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memories in the past. The recently developed hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have attracted immense attention in the development of advanced semiconductor devices. Because hafnia is typically used in CMOS processes, it can be directly incorporated into the current semiconductor technologies. Additionally, hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectrics show high scalability and large coercive fields that are advantageous for high&#8208;density memory devices. This review summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectric devices, especially ferroelectric transistors, for next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications. First, the types of ferroelectric memories and their operation mechanisms are reviewed. Then, issues limiting the realization of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric transistors and possible solutions are discussed. The experimental demonstration of ferroelectric transistor arrays, including three&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric NAND and its operation characteristics, are also reviewed. Finally, challenges and strategies toward the development of next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications based on ferroelectric transistors are outlined.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next&#8208;generation printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versability and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, for the first time, we present a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture was introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enabled a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual ion penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allowed a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V is demonstrated.

Abstract
The development of unipolar n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers with electron mobility (&#956;e) over 5 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 remains a massive challenge in organic semiconductors. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has proven to be a successful unit for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type and ambipolar polymers. However, DPP's moderate electron&#8208;accepting capability leads to the shallow frontier molecular orbital (FMO) levels of the resultant polymers and hence limit the &#956;e in unipolar n&#8208;type organic transistors. Herein, this issue has been addressed by using a hybrid acceptor&#8208;modulation strategy based on DPP&#8208;containing &#8220;fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture&#8221;, namely DPP&#8208;difluorobenzothiadiazole&#8208;DPP (DFB). Compared with DFB's non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart, DFB features deeper FMO levels and a shape&#8208;persistent framework. Therefore, a series of DFB&#8208;based polymers demonstrate planar backbones and lowered FMO levels by &#8275;0.10 to 0.25&#160;eV versus that of the control polymer. Intriguingly, all DFB&#8208;polymers exhibit excellent unipolar n&#8208;type transistor performances. Especially, a full&#8208;locked backbone conformation and high crystallinity with crystalline coherence length of 524 &#197; are observed for pDFB&#8208;TF, accounting for its high &#956;e of 5.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest &#956;e value for DPP&#8208;based unipolar n&#8208;type polymers reported to date. This work demonstrates that the strategy of &#8220;fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture&#8221; opens a new path towards high&#8208;performance unipolar n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers.

Herein, this issue has been addressed by using a hybrid acceptor-modulation strategy based on DPP-containing &#8220;fluorinated triple-acceptor architecture&#8221;, namely DPP-difluorobenzothiadiazole-DPP (DFB). Compared with DFB's non-fluorinated counterpart, DFB features deeper FMO levels and a shape-persistent framework.

   &lt;sup&gt;&#956;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; value for DPP-based unipolar n-type polymers reported to date. This work demonstrates that the strategy of &#8220;fluorinated triple-acceptor architecture&#8221; opens a new path towards high-performance unipolar n-type semiconducting polymers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8208;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>

Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remains a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, we design Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures with abundant active Ru&#8208;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for HOR in alkaline media. The expertimental and theoritical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8208;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8208;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8208;metal oxide domains.

         <title>m6A Reader YTHDF1&#8208;targeting Engineered Small Extracellular Vesicles for Gastric Cancer Therapy Via Epigenetic and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modulators decide the fate of m6A&#8208;modified transcripts and drive cancer development. RNA interference targeting m6A modulators promises to be an emerging cancer therapy but is challenging due to its poor tumor targeting and high systematic toxicity. Here we develop engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) with high CD47 expression and cyclic arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic (c(RGDyC)) modification for effective delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) against m6A reader YTH N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) to treat gastric cancer via epigenetic and immune regulation. This nanosystem efficiently depletes YTHDF1 expression and suppresses gastric cancer progression and metastasis through hampering frizzled7 (FZD7) translation and inactivating Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin pathway in an m6A dependent manner. Loss of YTHDF1 mediates overexpression of interferon (IFN)&#8208;&#947; receptor 1 (IFNGR1) and enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; response, promoting expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC&#8208;I) on tumor cells to achieve self&#8208;presentation of the immunogenic tumor cells to stimulate strong cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses. CD47 expression on the engineered sEVs can competitively bind with signal regulatory protein &#945; (SIRP&#945;) to enhance phagocytosis of the tumor cells by tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). This versatile nanoplatform provides an efficient and low toxic strategy to inhibit epigenetic regulators and holds great potential in promoting immunotherapy.

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Nanostructure with Interferon Stimulatory DNA Delivers Highly Potent Toxins Activates the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Robust Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor metastases and reoccurrences are considered the leading cause of cancer&#8208;associated deaths. While highly efficient treatments for the eradication of the primary tumor have been developed, the treatment of secondary or metastatic tumors remains poorly accessible. Over the last years, compounds that intervene through the immunogenic cGAS&#8208;STING signaling pathway against tumor metastases have emerged with potential for clinical development. While interferon stimulatory DNAs have demonstrated to activate this immunogenic pathway, these compounds are associated with poor bioavailability, poor stability, and poor cancer selectivity, rendering their use for therapeutic applications. Herein, the encapsulation of a highly potent chemotherapeutic platinum(II) complex and the incorporation of interferon stimulatory DNA strands for activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway into multimodal tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (84bp&#8208;TDNISD/56MESS) for combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy is reported. It is found that 84bp&#8208;TDNISD/56MESS could work as not only a drug delivery carrier for highly potent toxins but also an immunostimulant agent that can activate the STING pathway for anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. The nanomaterial demonstrated to nearly fully eradicate a primary as well as secondary/metastatic breast cancer tumor inside an animal model.

         <title>Venation&#8208;Mimicking, Ultra&#8208;Stretchable, Room Temperature&#8208;Attachable Metal Tapes for Integrated Electronic Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Future electronic skin systems require stretchable conductors and low&#8208;temperature integrations of external components, which remains challenging for traditional metal films. Herein, a bioinspired design concept is reported to endow metal films with 200% stretchability as well as room&#8208;temperature integration capability with diverse components. It is revealed that by controllable defects implantation, distinctive venation&#8208;mimicking cracking modes can be induced in strained metal films, leading to profound stretchability regulation. An intriguing exponential&#8208;to&#8208;linear transition of the film electromechanical performance is observed, which is elucidated by a unified model covering the essence of all modes. Combined with room&#8208;temperature integration capability, an integrated electronic skin is constructed with metal films serving as stretchable electrodes, diverse sensors, and &#8220;tapes&#8221; to attach subcomponents, showing prospects in helping disabled people. This one&#8208;step, defects implantation strategy is applicable to common metals without special substrate treatments, which enables fascinating ultra&#8208;stretchable metal film conductors with low&#8208;temperature integration capability to spark more sophisticated flexible electronic systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging.

&lt;p&gt;Pursuing conversion-type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, for the first time, the kinetically/thermodynamically co-dominat copper-tellurium (Cu-Te) alloying phase conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium were disclosed using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive anti-oxidant addition) was implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu-Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8764;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of which lifespan thousand-fold longer than Cu-Te conversion using CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O electrolyte.

         <title>Tuning the Color of Photonic Glass Pigments by Thermal Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermal or solvent annealing is commonly employed to enhance phase separation and remove defects in block copolymer (BCP) films, leading to well resolved nanostructures. Annealing is of particular importance for photonic BCP materials, where large, well&#8208;ordered lamellar domains are required to generate strong reflections at visible wavelengths. However, such strategies have not been considered for porous BCP systems, such as inverse photonic glasses, where the structure (and thus the optical response) is no longer defined solely by the chemical compatibility of the blocks, but by the size and arrangement of voids within the BCP matrix. In this study, we demonstrate how the concept of &#8220;thermal annealing&#8221; can be applied to porous bottlebrush block copolymer (BBCP) microparticles with a photonic glass architecture, enabling their coloration to be tuned from blue to red. By comparing biocompatible BBCPs with similar composition, but different thermal behavior, we show that this process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the BBCP matrix (i.e., polymer mobility) and the absence of microphase separation (enabling diffusion&#8208;induced swelling of the pores). Lastly, this concept was applied towards the production of a thermochromic patterned hydrogel, exemplifying the potential of such responsive biocompatible photonic&#8208;glass pigments towards smart labelling or anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable High Performance Polyimine Aerogels Derived from Bio&#8208;based Resources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic aerogels are an intriguing class of highly porous and ultralight materials which have found widespread applications in thermal insulation, energy storage, and chemical absorption. These fully cross&#8208;linked polymeric networks, however, pose environmental concerns as they are typically made from fossil&#8208;based feedstock and the recycling back to their original monomers is virtually impossible. In addition, organic aerogels suffer from low thermal stability and potential fire hazard. To overcome these obstacles and create next&#8208;generation organic aerogels, we prepared a set of polyimine aerogels containing reversible chemical bonds which can selectively be cleaved on demand. As precursors, we used different primary amines and cyclophosphazene derivatives made from bio&#8208;based reagents (vanillin and 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde) to elevate the thermal stability and reduce the environmental impact. The resulting polyimine aerogels exhibit low shrinkage, high porosity, large surface area, as well as pronounced thermal stability and flame resistance. More importantly, the aerogels show excellent recyclability under acidic conditions with high monomer recovery yields and purities. This approach allows to prepare fresh aerogels from the retrieved building blocks, thus demonstrating efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling. These high performance, recyclable, and bio&#8208;based polyimine aerogels pave the way for advanced and sustainable superinsulating materials.

         <title>Breaking the Electronic Conductivity Bottleneck of Manganese Oxide Family for High&#8208;Power Fluorinated Graphite Composite Cathode by Ligand&#8208;Field High&#8208;Dimensional Constraining Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Primary lithium fluorinated graphite (Li/CFx) batteries with superior energy density are indispensable energy supply for multiple fields, but suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics of CFx cathode. Designing composite cathode emerges as a solution to this problem. Despite the optimal composite component for CFx, the manganese oxide family represented by MnO2 is still faced with an intrinsic electronic conductivity bottleneck, which severely limits the power density of composite cathode. Here, we propose a cation&#8208;induced high&#8208;dimensional constraining strategy from the perspective of ligand&#8208;field stacking structure topological design, which breaks the molecular orbital hybridization of pristine semiconductive oxides to transform them into high&#8208;conductivity metallic state while competitively maintaining structural stability. Through first&#8208;principles phase diagram calculations, mixed&#8208;valent Mn5O8 (Mn22+Mn34+O8) is explored as an ideal high&#8208;dimensional constraining material with satisfied conductivity and large&#8208;scale production feasibility. Experiments demonstrate that as&#8208;proposed CFx@Mn5O8 composite cathode achieves 2.36 times the power density (11399 W kg&#8722;1) of pristine CFx and a higher CFx conversion ratio (86%). Such a high&#8208;dimensional field&#8208;constraining strategy is rooted in our established four&#8208;quadrant electronic structure tuning framework, which fundamentally changes the orbital symmetry under ligand field to overcome the common conductivity challenge of wide transition metal oxide materials.

         <title>Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Small&#8208;Molecule Donors and Y&#8208;series Nonfullerene Acceptors</title>

Abstract
The emerging Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors (Y&#8208;NFA) prompt the rapid progress of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) from around 12% to 17%. The excellent PCE improvement benefits from not only the outstanding properties of Y&#8208;series acceptors but also the successful development of small&#8208;molecule donors. The short&#8208;circuit current density, fill factor and non&#8208;radiative recombination are all optimized to the unprecedented values, providing a scenery that is obviously different from the ITIC&#8208;series based ASM&#8208;OSCs. In this review, OSCs utilizing small&#8208;molecule donors and Y&#8208;NFA are summarized and classified in order to provide an up&#8208;to&#8208;date development overview and give an insight on structure&#8208;property correlation. Then, the characteristics of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) formation of ASM&#8208;OSCs are discussed and compared with that of polymer&#8208;based OSCs. Finally, the challenges and outlook on designing ground&#8208;breaking small&#8208;molecule donor and forming ideal BHJ morphology are discussed.

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks for Solar Desalination with Directional Salt Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8722;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporators are constructed by alternately arranging superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic sponges secured with hydrophilic threads. The MPN coatings endow the sponges with photothermal properties and selective wettability, enabling the efficient, long&#8208;term, and sustained desalination of high&#8208;salinity brine for both indoor and outdoor field operations.








Abstract
Solar desalination is one of the most promising strategies to address the global freshwater shortage crisis. However, the residual salt accumulated on the top surface of solar evaporators severely reduces light absorption and steam evaporation efficiency, thus impeding the further industrialization of this technology. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporator composed of photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges and side&#8208;twining hydrophilic threads for efficient desalination with directional salt crystallization and zero liquid discharge is reported. The MPN coatings afford the engineering of alternating photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges with high heating efficiency and defined vapor escape channels, while the side&#8208;twining threads induce site&#8208;selective salt crystallization. The 3D evaporator exhibits a high and stable indoor desalination rate (&#8776;2.3&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) of concentrated seawater (20&#160;wt%) under simulated sun irradiation for over 21 days without the need for salt crystallization inhibitors. This direct desalination is also achieved in outdoor field operations with a production rate of clean water up to &#8776;1.82&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 from concentrated seawater (10&#160;wt%). Together with the high affinity and multiple functions of MPNs, this work is expected to facilitate the rational design of solar desalination devices and boost the research translation of MPN materials in broader applications.

Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)-engineered 3D evaporator composed of photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges and side-twining hydrophilic threads for efficient desalination with directional salt crystallization and zero liquid discharge is reported. The MPN coatings afford the engineering of alternating photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges with high heating efficiency and defined vapor escape channels, while the side-twining threads induce site-selective salt crystallization. The 3D evaporator exhibits a high and stable indoor desalination rate (&#8776;2.3&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of concentrated seawater (20&#160;wt%) under simulated sun irradiation for over 21 days without the need for salt crystallization inhibitors. This direct desalination is also achieved in outdoor field operations with a production rate of clean water up to &#8776;1.82&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from concentrated seawater (10&#160;wt%). Together with the high affinity and multiple functions of MPNs, this work is expected to facilitate the rational design of solar desalination devices and boost the research translation of MPN materials in broader applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Capture Effect Printing Atomic&#8208;Thick 2D Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to print arrays of atomic&#8208;thick semiconducting thin films is demonstrated, which enables printed devices with micrometer&#8208;scale resolution, high density, and attractive performance, thus paving the way for practical large&#8208;area application of 2D crystals in electronic devices at an affordable cost.








Abstract
2D semiconductor crystals offer the opportunity to further extend Moore's law to the atomic scale. For practical and low&#8208;cost electronic applications, directly printing devices on substrates is advantageous compared to conventional microfabrication techniques that utilize expensive photolithography, etching, and vacuum&#8208;metallization processes. However, the currently printed 2D transistors are plagued by unsatisfactory electrical performance, thick semiconductor layers, and low device density. Herein, a facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy is demonstrated utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to fabricate high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;thick semiconductor thin&#8208;film arrays without additional surfactants. Printed robust thin&#8208;film transistors using 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) and 2D conductive electrodes (e.g., graphene) exhibit high electrical performance, including a carrier mobility of up to 6.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106 at 25&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, 2D transistors are printed with a density of &#8776;47&#160;000 devices per square centimeter. In addition, this method can be applied to many other 2D materials, such as NbSe2, Bi2Se3, and black phosphorus, for printing diverse high&#8208;quality thin films. Thus, the strategy of printable 2D thin&#8208;film transistors provides a scalable pathway for the facile manufacturing of high&#8208;performance electronics at an affordable cost.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Partially Solvating Diluent for Lithium/Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte employing partially solvating monofluorobenzene as the diluent is developed for Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries. Benefiting from the stable interphases simultaneously formed on both the anode and cathode, dendrite&#8208;free cycling of lithium&#8208;metal anodes with high Coulombic efficiency and highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells with low lithium&#8208;metal excess have been achieved.








Abstract
The development of Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries requires electrolytes that can form stable electrolyte/electrode interphases simultaneously on lithium&#8208;metal anodes (LMAs) and SPAN cathodes. Herein, a low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (LCILE) employing monofluorobenzene (mFBn) as the diluent is proposed for Li/SPAN cells. Unlike non&#8208;solvating diluents in other LCILEs, mFBn partially solvates Li+, decreasing the coordination between Li+ and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;). In turn, this triggers a more substantial decomposition of FSI&#8722; and consequently results in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in inorganic compounds, which enables a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (99.72%) of LMAs. Meanwhile, a protective cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), derived mainly from FSI&#8722; and organic cations, is generated on the SPAN cathodes, preventing the dissolution of polysulfides. Benefiting from the robust interphases simultaneously formed on both the electrodes, a highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells for 250 cycles with a capacity retention of 71% is achieved employing the LCILE and only 80% lithium&#8208;metal excess.

         <title>Anharmonic Cation&#8211;Anion Coupling Dynamics Assisted Lithium&#8208;Ion Diffusion in Sulfide Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By comparing the anharmonic phonon coupling calculations with the ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, this study unveils a unique phenomenon in sulfide solid electrolytes in comparison with halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors often show higher Li&#8208;ion conductivity than other types of electrolyte materials. This work unveils a unique Li&#8208;ion conductive behavior in these materials through the perspective of anharmonic coupling assisted Li&#8208;ion diffusion. Li hopping events can happen simultaneously with various types of lattice dynamics, while only a statistically important synchronization of motions may indicate coupling. This method enables a direct evaluation of the coupling strength between these motions, which more fundamentally decides if a specific type of lattice motion is really anharmonically coupled to the Li hopping event and whether the coupling can facilitate the Li diffusion. By a new ab initio computational approach, this work unveils a unique phenomenon in prototype sulfide electrolytes in comparison with typical halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing phonon modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes. The coupling pushes Li ions toward the diffusion channels for reduced diffusion barriers. The result from the lower temperature range (&#8776;0&#8211;300 K) of simulation can also be more relevant to the application of solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dendrimersomes: A Closer Xenobiotic Mimic of Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphocholine&#8208;based Janus dendrimer is reported, which lacks the &#8220;weak points&#8221; that result in the chemical and physical instability of natural liposomes. Despite their synthetic nature, the resulting self&#8208;assembled dendrimersomes recapitulate the most important physical properties of cell membranes. This enables functionalization with natural functional molecules as well as mimicry of cellular functions on a basic level.








Abstract
Building functional mimics of cell membranes is an important task toward the development of synthetic cells. So far, lipid and amphiphilic block copolymers are the most widely used amphiphiles with the bilayers by the former lacking stability while membranes by the latter are typically characterized by very slow dynamics. Herein, a new type of Janus dendrimer containing a zwitterionic phosphocholine hydrophilic headgroup (JDPC) and a 3,5&#8208;substituted dihydrobenzoate&#8208;based hydrophobic dendron is introduced. JDPC self&#8208;assembles in water into zwitterionic dendrimersomes (z&#8208;DSs) that faithfully recapitulate the cell membrane in thickness, flexibility, and fluidity, while being resilient to harsh conditions and displaying faster pore closing dynamics in the event of membrane rupture. This enables the fabrication of hybrid DSs with components of natural membranes, including pore&#8208;forming peptides, structure&#8208;directing lipids, and glycans to create raft&#8208;like domains or onion vesicles. Moreover, z&#8208;DSs can be used to create active synthetic cells with life&#8208;like features that mimic vesicle fusion and motility as well as environmental sensing. Despite their fully synthetic nature, z&#8208;DSs are minimal cell mimics that can integrate and interact with living matter with the programmability to imitate life&#8208;like features and beyond.

         <title>Information&#8208;Storage Expansion Enabled by a Resilient Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission&#8208;Active Nanocomposite Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite&#160;hydrogel is developed. The AIE luminogen can multiply protonate to interact with the clay through the electrostatic interaction in the gel network under acid stimulation, which causes fluorescence enhancement and a blueshift of the hydrogel. Synergistically taking advantage of this behavior and the high resilience of the hydrogel, information&#8208;storage expansion, and dual&#8208;encryption are realized.








Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel (Laponite is a trademark of the company BYK Additives Ltd.). The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. Moreover, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information&#8208;storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

         <title>Design of Smart Aggregates: Toward Rapid Clinical Diagnosis of Hyperlipidemia in Human Blood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. They can act as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221; and autonomously respond to HLP to realize in vitro detection and in vivo imaging in mice and human blood. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm).








Abstract
Molecular aggregates with environmental responsive properties are desired for their wide practical applications such as bioprobes. Here, a series of smart near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. The aggregates of these molecules exhibit a twisted intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effect in aqueous media, but aggregation&#8208;induced emission in highly viscous media due to the restriction of the intramolecular motion. These aggregates, which can autonomously respond to different environments via switching the aggregation state without changing their chemical structures are described, as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221;. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm). Both in vitro detection and in vivo imaging of HLP can be realized in a mouse model. Linear relationships exist between the emission intensity and multiple pathological parameters in blood samples of HLP patients. Thus, the design of smart aggregate facilitates rapid and accurate detection of HLP and provides a promising attempt in aggregate science.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Bithiophene&#8208;Imide&#8208;Based Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM)&#160;PFBTI is successfully developed for PVSCs. The suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, and excellent surface passivation effects endow PFBTI&#8208;based organic/inorganic hybrid PVSCs with a promising PCE of 23.1% and much&#8208;enhanced stability. PFBTI can be further used in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells and achieve high PCEs.








Abstract
The development of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) with high mobility, long&#8208;term stability, and comprehensive passivation is significant for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers PBTI and PFBTI with alternating benzodithiophene (BDT) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units are successfully developed with desirable hole mobilities due to the good planarity and extended conjugation of molecular backbone. Both copolymers can be employed as HTMs with suitable energy levels and efficient defect passivation. Shortening the alkyl chain of the BTI unit and introducing fluorine atoms on the BDT moiety effectively enhances hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the HTMs, leading to improved efficiency and stability of PVSCs. As a result, the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PVSCs with PFBTI as the HTM deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% with enhanced long&#8208;term operational and ambient stability, which is one of the best efficiencies reported for PVSCs with dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTMs to date. Moreover, PFBTI can be applied in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, achieving a high PCE of 17.4% and 22.2%, respectively. These results illustrate the great potential of PFBTI as an efficient and widely applicable HTM for cost&#8208;effective and stable PVSCs.

         <title>Photoswitchable Microgels for Dynamic Macrophage Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light is demonstrated. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light stimulates in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that increases RGD availability, thereby facilitating macrophage adhesion linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization. Visible light induces the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that decreases RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled structures is achieved irreversibly or under non&#8208;physiological conditions, thereby limiting their biomedical, environmental, and catalysis applicability. In this study, microgels composed of azobenzene derivatives stacked via &#960;&#8211;cation and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are developed that are electrostatically stabilized with Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD)&#8208;bearing anionic polymers. Lateral swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels occurs via cis&#8208;azobenzene formation mediated by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light, which disrupts intermolecular interactions on the visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;coated materials. Real&#8208;time imaging and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;azobenzene formation. Near&#8208;infrared light can induce in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to increase RGD availability and trigger release of loaded interleukin&#8208;4, which facilitates the adhesion structure assembly linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of host macrophages. In contrast, visible light can induce deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to decrease RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization. These microgels exhibit high stability and non&#8208;toxicity. Versatile use of ligands and protein delivery can offer cytocompatible and photoswitchable manipulability of diverse host cells.

         <title>Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes Achieved by Bifunctional, Sustainable Separators with Tailored Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel, mechanically flexible and bifunctional separator integrates the merits of serving as a highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributor to self&#8208;regulate/orientate the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecular level and physically suppresses Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structural level. Remarkably, Na symmetric cells achieve unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities in additive&#8208;free carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large&#8208;scale practical implementation of Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly used and low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising well&#8208;ordered, uniaxially aligned arrays, and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributors to self&#8208;orientate/homogenize the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities (&#8805;1000&#160;h at 1 and 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#8805;700&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive&#8208;free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium&#8211;organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low&#8208;cost, and safe&#8208;credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Large Exchange Coupling Between Localized Spins and Topological Bands in MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic topological materials rely on strong interaction between localized spins and states comprising the topological bands. This interaction is directly interrogated in an intrinsic magnetic topological material, MnBi2Te4, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. It is found that this exchange coupling is &gt;100 times stronger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of &gt;25 meV.








Abstract
Magnetism in topological materials creates phases exhibiting quantized transport phenomena with potential technological applications. The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized spins and the topological bands, and the consequent formation of an exchange gap. However, this remains experimentally unquantified in intrinsic magnetic topological materials. Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi2Te4, a topological insulator with intrinsic antiferromagnetism. This is achieved by optically exciting Bi&#8208;Te p states comprising the bulk topological bands and interrogating the consequent Mn 3d spin dynamics, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. Ultrafast electron scattering and magneto&#8208;optic measurements show that the p states demagnetize via electron&#8208;phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation, the Mn 3d spins, probed by resonant X&#8208;ray scattering, are observed to disorder concurrently with the p spins. Together with atomistic simulations, this reveals that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the surface states. By quantifying this exchange coupling, this study validates the materials&#8208;by&#8208;design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to manipulate topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Zn&#8211;Air Batteries&#160;with Long Lifetime Enabled by Reconstructed Amorphous Multi&#8208;Metallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air battery&#160;works well at high current densities of 100&#8211;400&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low voltages due to the OER intermediate O* migration from the Ni to the Fe site in a defect&#8208;rich ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide derived by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, helping to break the restriction of the scaling relationship and then resulting in high intrinsic OER activity with a theoretical overpotential of 170&#8201;mV.








Abstract
Developing fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries is crucial for widening their application but remains challenging owing to the limitation of sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and insufficient active sites of electrocatalysts. To solve this issue, a reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high density of efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255, and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100, and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, is developed for fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8&#160;mAh (20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi&#8208;solid Zn&#8211;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8722;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The detailed characterizations combine with density functional theory calculations indicate that the defect&#8208;rich crystalline/amorphous ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide forms by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi&#8208;active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to the Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast&#8208;charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self&#8208;reconstruction of the pre&#8208;catalyst but also pioneers a pathway for practical fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Quantum Advantage in a Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule&#8208;based engines with a quantum advantage are implemented using spin electronics to harvest the most basic form of energy: ambient heat. This ground&#8208;breaking interdisciplinary approach enables electrical output above room temperature using nanoscale electrical devices. This opens quantum technologies and spintronics toward disruptive energy applications, as a possible technological game&#8208;changer to help mitigate the energy/climate crises.








Abstract
Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous is proposed. The spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co center of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron&#8208;spin&#8208;selecting Fe/C60 interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C60 interface are measured. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built&#8208;in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic&#8208;based information technology chain, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy.

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide/Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene oxide/porous graphene/graphene oxide (GO/PG/GO) membrane separation technology by pressure&#8208;driven filtration is reported and it is applied in isotope separation at room temperature. It shows&#160;an excellent structural, long&#8208;term stability, ultralow energy consumption, and ultrahigh selectivity for deuterium water, including rejection rate of &#8776;97%, the selectivity of &#8776;35.2 as well.








Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is a strategic material that is widely used in and scientific research and has applications in fields such as nuclear energy generation. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room&#8208;temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores are sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25&#160;&#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O is &#8776;97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O is &#8776;35.2, and the excellent performance can be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water is successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage, and the membrane exhibits excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method does not require ultralow temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Overcoming the Outcoupling Limit of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Artificially Formed Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Textured perovskite films are formed artificially by controlling the dwell time of the antisolvent. Due to scattering at the textured surface, photons trapped in the waveguide mode can be extracted. Therefore, the external quantum efficiency is boosted significantly from 10% for flat perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to 20.5% for textured PeLEDs with an extraordinarily thick perovskite layer of 1.5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art planar&#8208;structure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is mainly limited by the outcoupling efficiency, which is around 20% and decreases significantly with the perovskite thickness. Here, an approach to artificially form textured perovskite films to boost the outcoupling limit of the PeLEDs is reported. By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film&#8208;forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nm, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 &#181;m. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 &#181;m. This study provides a novel way of forming light&#8208;extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Triarylboron&#8208;Doped Acenethiophenes as Organic Sonosensitizers for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy with Low Phototoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes exhibit high sonodynamic therapy efficiency with excellent biocompatibility.








Abstract
The development of efficient organic sonosensitizers is crucial for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in the field of cancer treatment. Herein, a new strategy for the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers based on triarylboron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. The attachment of boron to the linear acenethiophenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, resulting in redshifted absorptions and emissions. After encapsulation with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, it is found that the nanostructured BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs (nanoparticles of BAnTh&#160;and BTeTh) shows efficient hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation under ultrasound (US) irradiation in aqueous solution with almost no phototoxicity, which can overcome the shortcomings of O2&#8208;dependent SDT and avoid the potential cutaneous phototoxicity issue. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic results validate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes as sonosensitizers enable high SDT efficiency with low phototoxicity and good biocompatibility, indicating that boron&#8208;functionalization of acenes is a promising strategy toward organic sonosensitizers for SDT.

         <title>Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell Toward Superior Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ is modified by 2&#8208;propanol to form a eutectic solvation shell, which can promote the oriented deposition of Zn metal and great desolvation kinetics of Zn2+. Attributed to its new outer solvation structure design, fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;term cycling capability of Zn&#8208;ion batteries under extreme temperature operation condition are achieved.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are well regarded among a next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, it is demonstrated that the addition of 2&#8208;propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500&#160;h under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance is achieved in a 150&#160;mAh Zn|V2O5 pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.

         <title>Spontaneous Interface Healing by a Dynamic Liquid&#8208;Crystal Transition for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) molecules interacting with PbI2 retard the crystallization of the perovskite film, and finally increase the grain size. During annealing, the LC molecules undergo a phase transition, and then the flowable LC is extracted by the lower interface to release the residual stress, and accelerate electron extraction. A new engineering of additive phase transition is thus conceived.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature solution processing of thin&#8208;film semiconductors is more cost&#8208;effective than traditional vacuum processing; however, it leads to more defects during fast bulk crystallization and residual tensile stress. Herein, a new strategy of dynamic liquid&#8208;crystal transition (DLCT) is developed to solve these problems in one step. The design principle is used to suggest that the DLCT molecule should firstly interact with the perovskite grains in the bulk and meanwhile go through a dynamic transition to spontaneously heal the interface. A thermotropic LC molecule (CBO6SS6OCB) is then designed to demonstrate the strategy. The LC interacting with perovskite colloid forms an intermediate adduct to retard the crystallization. The annealing processes stimulate the concentrated LC solid, causing it to flow to the electron transport layer to release the residual stress to attain improved electron extraction. Consequently, the device efficiency is increased to 24.38%, where its VOC of 1.184&#160;V is among the best for the formamidine&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the ambient stability (93.0% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of aging) and light stability (96.3% of initial efficiency after 500&#160;h of aging) are much improved. This work conceives a new engineering of additive phase transition for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Vertical Growth of 2D Covalent Organic Framework Nanoplatelets on a Macroporous Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrode with tailor&#8208;made hierarchical pores spanning from nanometer to millimeter scale is fabricated by in&#160;situ growth vertically aligned covalent organic framework nanoplatelets on graphene aerogel. This electrode exhibits an integration of high energy density and high power density as well as good cyclic stability in flexible supercapacitor devices.








Abstract
Hierarchically structural engineering of electrodes is critical to achieving high energy density and high power density in electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, rational regulation of the mesoscopic structure that coordinates microscopic and macroscopic structural features simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Here, the construction of electrodes with well&#8208;defined hierarchical pores spanning multiple length scales from 1&#160;nm to 50&#160;&#181;m is reported. Vertically aligned 2D covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatelets with a thickness around 30&#160;nm are in&#160;situ grown on macroporous graphene aerogel scaffold by a reversible polycondensation&#8208;termination strategy. The obtained electrode thus combines abundant accessible active sites and efficient transport expressways for both ions and electrons. When used for supercapacitors, a superior gravimetric capacitance of 289&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;as well as outstanding capacitance retention at both high charge/discharge rates of 77% from 0.5&#160;to 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and high mass loading of 74% from 1.2&#160;to 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;are achieved. Hierarchical engineering of mesostructured 2D COF units on the macroporous scaffold will bring unprecedented structural designability and performance enhancement for EES electrodes.

         <title>Simultaneously Stabilizing Both Electrodes and Electrolytes by a Self&#8208;Separating Organometallics Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries at Wide Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aid of electrochemical evolution of an organometallic compound, a self&#8208;separating interface layer for Zn anodes is designed, which can promote the electrode and electrolyte stability simultaneously. The interface with a polymeric C4N3 skeleton and cations homogenizes the Zn2+ flux, induces planar deposition, and maintain cathode stability, leading to high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are of great potential as one of the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices due to their low cost and high safety. However, the development of long&#8208;term stable electrodes and electrolytes still suffers from great challenges. Herein, a self&#8208;separation strategy is developed for an interface layer design to optimize both electrodes and electrolytes simultaneously. Specifically, the coating with an organometallics (sodium tricyanomethanide) evolves into an electrically responsive shield layer composed of nitrogen, carbon&#8208;enriched polymer network, and sodium ions, which not only modulates the zinc&#8208;ion migration pathways to inhibit interface side reactions but also adsorbs onto Zn perturbations to induce planar zinc deposition. Additionally, the separated ions from the coating can diffuse to the electrolyte to affect the Zn2+ solvation structure and maintain the cathode structural stability by forming a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface and sodium ions&#8217; equilibrium, confirmed by in situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. Due to these unique advantages, the symmetric zinc batteries exhibit an extralong cycling lifespan of 3000&#160;h and rate performance at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at wide temperatures. The efficiency of the self&#8208;separation strategy is further demonstrated in practical full batteries with an ultralong lifespan over 10&#160;000 cycles from &#8722;35 to 60 &#176;C.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Nanomotors with an Alloyed Engine for Emergency Rescue of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed to construct superactive engines for self&#8208;propulsion of nanomotors under physiological concentration of H2O2. The PtPdMo ternary alloy induced by plasma improves the catalytic activity of the Pt&#8208;based engine, thus promoting movement both in vitro and in vivo and simultaneously achieves nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy in traumatic&#8208;brain&#8208;injury mice.








Abstract
In severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), acute oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades rapidly spread to cause irreversible brain damage and low survival rate within minutes. Therefore, developing a feasible solution for the quick&#8208;treatment of life&#8208;threatening emergency is urgently demanded to earn time for hospital treatment. Herein, Janus catalysis&#8208;driven nanomotors (JCNs) are carefully constructed via plasma&#8208;induced alloying technology and sputtering&#8208;caused half&#8208;coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicate that the heteroatom&#8208;doping alloyed engine endows JCNs with much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species than common Pt&#8208;based engines. When JCNs are dropped to the surface of the ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy. The results demonstrate that the JCNs successfully block the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. This work provides a revolutionary nanomotor&#8208;based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first&#8208;aid scenarios due to their self&#8208;propelled movement combined with highly multienzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.

         <dc:description>
A biocompatible gallium&#8208;based antifungal strategy (MLPGa), integrating lyticase and Ga ions, is&#160;developed for effective fungal keratitis treatment, which can degrade the permeation barrier of exopolysaccharides, then eradicate Candida albicans and biofilms through the mechanisms of extracellular polysaccharide degradation, intrinsic reactive oxygen production, and metabolic interference under Raman/PA bimodal imaging monitors.








Abstract
Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in the fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, lyticase and gallium ions co&#8208;integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) are presented that can degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both planktonic Candida albicans and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and metabolic interference of antioxidant&#8208;related genes, exopolysaccharide&#8208;related genes, iron&#8208;ion&#8208;utilization&#8208;related genes, fungal/biofilm&#8208;development&#8208;related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between the nanosystems and the gallium ions provide a real&#8208;time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa&#8208;based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ternary Tin (II) Alloy as Hole&#8208;Transport Layer of Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed SnOCl ternary tin (II) alloy as hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells is reported, which results in efficiencies of 23.2% and 26.3% for Sn&#8211;Pb single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells, respectively. Greatly enhanced light stabilities with T87 of &gt;1200 h and 85 &#176;C thermal stability with T85 of &gt;1500 h are achieved by using the SnOCl HTM.








Abstract
Tin&#8211;lead (Sn&#8211;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl is reported as the hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. The solution&#8208;processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure that not only reduces the optical loss of the devices, but also changes grain growth of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#181;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1200&#160;h, and keeps 85% efficiency under 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress for 1500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improves the stabilized efficiencies of single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue to the multicomponent metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.

         <title>Isolating Contiguous Ir Atoms and Forming Ir&#8211;W Intermetallics with Negatively Charged Ir for Efficient NO Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst (IrW&#8208;WO3/KIT&#8208;6) containing only 1&#160;wt% Ir is synthesized for efficient catalytic reduction of NO by CO to N2 under O2&#8208;containing conditions. This catalyst consists of ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6) supported with WO3 nanoparticles, and the latter is covered with atomic&#8208;dispersed IrW intermetallics.








Abstract
The lack of efficient catalysts with a wide working temperature window and vital O2 and SO2 resistance for selective catalytic reduction of NO by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) largely hinders its implementation. Here, a novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst with only 1&#160;wt% Ir loading is reported for efficient CO&#8208;SCR. In this catalyst, contiguous Ir atoms are isolated into single atoms, and Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles are formed, which are supported on ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6). Notably, this catalyst enables complete NO conversion to N2 at 250&#160;&#176;C in the presence of 1% O2 and has a wide temperature window (250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C), outperforming the comparison samples with Ir isolated&#8208;single&#8208;atomic&#8208;sites and Ir nanoparticles, respectively. Also, it possesses a high SO2 tolerance. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that single Ir atoms are negatively charged, dramatically enhancing the NO dissociation, while the Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles accelerate the reduction of the N2O and NO2 intermediates by CO.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Spectral Indicators of Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven classifier of band topology for a database of over 10&#160;000 compounds using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) features as input, achieving over 90% accuracy is developed. By leveraging the simplicity and versatility of XAS, this classifier has the potential to accelerate the discovery and screening of a much broader category of candidate topological materials.








Abstract
Topological materials discovery has emerged as an important frontier in condensed matter physics. While theoretical classification frameworks have been used to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental determination of materials&#8217; topology often poses significant technical challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely used materials characterization technique sensitive to atoms&#8217; local symmetry and chemical bonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of topological quantum chemistry (TQC). Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS is known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and calculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can effectively inform experiments. In this work, computed X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10&#160;000 inorganic materials to train a neural network (NN) classifier that predicts topological class directly from XANES signatures, achieving F1 scores of 89% and 93% for topological and trivial classes, respectively is leveraged. Given the simplicity of the XAS setup and its compatibility with multimodal sample environments, the proposed machine&#8208;learning&#8208;augmented XAS topological indicator has the potential to discover broader categories of topological materials, such as non&#8208;cleavable compounds and amorphous materials, and may further inform field&#8208;driven phenomena in situ, such as magnetic field&#8208;driven topological phase&#160;transitions.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles with SHP2 High Expression Promote Mitophagy for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2) is developed. MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates apoptosis, oxidation, and neuroinflammation, accompanied by rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in AD.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, a platform for AD therapy is developed using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2). The high blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 is demonstrated in AD&#8208;mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model.

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal-stem-cells-derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) high-expression (MSC-EVs-SHP2) is developed. MSC-EVs-SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates apoptosis, oxidation, and neuroinflammation, accompanied by rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in AD.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, a platform for AD therapy is developed using nanosized mesenchymal-stem-cells-derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP2) high-expression (MSC-EVs-SHP2). The high blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC-EVs-SHP2 is demonstrated in AD-mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC-EVs-SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. The EV-engineering technology provides a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;Sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germanium oxide can function as a modifier of zeolite crystallization counter to its conventional role as a heteroatom. This effect is observed for two zeolite frameworks wherein GeO2&#160;addition promotes the formation of nano&#8208;sized crystals. Catalytic tests reveal significant enhancement in their performance, suggesting this method can be a commercially viable route to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites.








Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide (GeO2), to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultrasmall dimensions. This effect is observed for zeolites ZSM&#8208;11&#160;and ZSM&#8208;5 over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2&#160;in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2&#160;recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2&#160;compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Electro&#8211;Chemo&#8211;Mechanical Failure of Solid Electrolytes Induced by Growth of Internal Lithium Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiphysics simulation presents electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid electrolyte caused by internal electroplating of lithium (Li) through visualizing local stress, damage accumulation, and crack propagation. The results show that geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the solid electrolyte are critical factors dominating degradation of solid electrolytes, providing novel insights for design of future solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Growth of lithium (Li) filaments within solid electrolytes, leading to mechanical degradation of the electrolyte and even short circuit of the cell under high current density, is a great barrier to commercialization of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Understanding of this electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical phenomenon is hindered by the challenge of tracking local fields inside the solid electrolyte. Here, a multiphysics simulation aiming to investigate evolution of the mechanical failure of the solid electrolyte induced by the internal growth of Li is reported. Visualization of local stress, damage, and crack propagation within the solid electrolyte enables examination of factors dominating the degradation process, including the geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the&#160;electrolyte. Relative damage induced by locally high stress is found to preferentially occur in the region of the electrolyte/Li interface having great fluctuations. A high number density of Li filaments or voids triggers integration of damage and crack networks by enhanced propagation. This model is built on coupling of mechanical and electrochemical processes for internal plating of Li, revealing evolution of multiphysical fields that can barely be captured by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experimental techniques. Understanding mechanical degradation of solid electrolytes with the presence of Li filaments paves the way to design advanced solid electrolytes for future solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Cascade Responsive Nanoparticles Enhance Pancreatic Cancer Therapy by Eliminating Tumor&#8208;Resident Intracellular Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticles, consisting of a hyaluronic acid shell and a core assembled by an antibacterial polymer, are proposed. The nanoparticles sequentially trigger active tumor targeting, deep tumor penetration, efficient killing of intratumoral bacteria, and controlled drug release. The nanoparticles augment anticancer efficacy by eliminating tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria via non&#8208;antibiotic therapy.








Abstract
The limited drug penetration and robust bacteria&#8208;mediated drug inactivation in pancreatic cancer result in the failure of chemotherapy. To fight against these issues, a dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticle (sNP@G/IR) that can sequentially trigger deep penetration, killing of intratumor bacteria, and controlled release of chemo&#8208;drug, is reported. sNP@G/IR consists of a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;core (NP@G/IR), that encapsulates gemcitabine (Gem) and photothermal agent (IR1048). The polymer core, as an antibiotic alternative, is tailored to exert optimal antibacterial activity and selectivity. sNP@G/IR actively homes in on the tumor due to the CD44 targeting of the HA shell, which is subsequently degraded by the hyaluronidase in the extracellular matrix. The resultant NP@G/IR in decreased size and reversed charge facilitates deep tumor penetration. After cellular endocytosis, the exposed guanidine on NP@G/IR kills intracellular bacteria through disrupting cell membranes. Intracellular GSH further triggers the controlled release of the&#160;cargo. Thus, the protected Gem eventually induces cell apoptosis. Under laser irradiation, the hyperthermia of IR1048 helps further elimination of tumors and bacteria. Moreover, sNP@G/IR activates immune response, thereby reinforcing anticancer capacity. Therefore, this dual&#8208;cascade responsive sNP@G/IR eliminates tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria and augments drug delivery efficacy, providing a new avenue for improving cancer therapy.

         <title>Augmented DNA Nanoarchitectures: A Structural Library of 3D Self&#8208;Assembling Tensegrity Triangle Variants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of DNA tensegrity triangle crystals promises the ability to manipulate macroscopic crystalline matter with atomic precision, but a systematic characterization of the ensuing materials has not been previously performed. A generalizable strategy for constructing nanoscale DNA tensegrity architectures, with particular focus on geometrically&#160;asymmetric building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of expanded and tunable crystalline nanomaterials is presented here.








Abstract
The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self&#8208;assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. Here, the library of accessible motifs is expanded through&#160;covalent extensions of intertriangle regions and sticky&#8208;end&#8208;coordinated linkages of adjacent triangles with double helical segments&#160;using both geometrically symmetric and asymmetric configurations. The molecular structures of 18&#160;self&#8208;assembled architectures at resolutions of 3.32&#8211;9.32&#160;&#197; are reported; the observed cell dimensions, cavity sizes, and cross&#8208;sectional areas agree with theoretical expectations. These data demonstrate that fine control over triclinic and rhombohedral crystal parameters and the customizability of more complex 3D DNA lattices are attainable via rational design. It is anticipated that augmented DNA architectures may be fine&#8208;tuned for the self&#8208;assembly of designer nanocages, guest&#8211;host complexes, and proscriptive 3D nanomaterials, as originally envisioned. Finally, designer asymmetric crystalline building blocks can be seen as a first step toward controlling and encoding information in three dimensions.

Tensegrity Architectures
In article number 2206876, Ruojie Sha and co&#8208;workers develop a structural library of augmented tensegrity architectures based on geometric expansion of triangular tiles. The highly asymmetric structure highlighted in the crystal lattice contains three linearly independent design axes that lay the foundation for the self&#8208;assembly of designer, heterogenous nanomaterials.

Organic Sonosensitizers
A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented by Zhenqi Jiang, Frieder J&#228;kle, Xiaodong Yin, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2206594. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes exhibit high SDT efficiency with excellent biocompatibility.

Microgels
In article number 2205498, Sehoon Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report the remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light. The microgels are electrostatically stabilized by cationic photoisomers and polyanions. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light using upconversion nanoparticles stimulates in situ swelling of the microgels and release of loaded cytokines, which facilitates pro&#8208;regenerative and anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of macrophages.

         <title>Maneuvering Applications of Covalent Organic Frameworks via Framework&#8208;Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relation between morphology&#8211;structure and applications is intricate in covalent organic frameworks. This review highlights the progressive utilization of morphology&#8211;structure design toward the success of various applications. Furthermore, an outlook is put forward for improving the material performance by controlling the morphology&#8211;application design space.








Abstract
Translating the performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from laboratory to macroscopic reality demands specific morphologies. Thus, the advancement in morphological modulation has recently gained some momentum. A clear understanding of nano&#8208; to macroscopic architecture is critical to determine, optimize, and improve performances of this atomically precise porous material. Along with their chemical compositions and molecular frameworks, the prospect of morphology in various applications should be discussed and highlighted. A thorough insight into morphology versus application will help produce better&#8208;engineered COFs for practical implications. 2D and 3D frameworks can be transformed into various solids such as nanospheres, thin films, membranes, monoliths, foams, etc., for numerous applications in adsorption, separation photocatalysis, the carbon dioxide reduction, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. However, the research on COF chemistry mainly focuses on correlating structure to property, structure to morphology, and structure to applications. Here, critical insights on various morphological evolution and associated applications are provided. In each case, the underlying role of morphology is unveiled. Toward the end, a correlation between morphology and application is provided for the future development of COFs.

         <title>Catalytic Effects of Electrodes and Electrolytes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Progress and Prospective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with proper catalytic effects are promising in improving the performance of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. To promote the commercialization process of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in the future, the research progress of catalytic effects in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in recent years is reviewed, and the development direction of catalytic effects for next&#8208;generation metal&#8211;sulfur batteries is discussed.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;sulfur (M&#8211;S) batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage devices due to their advantages such as large energy density and the low cost of the raw materials. However, M&#8211;S batteries suffer from many drawbacks. Endowing the electrodes and electrolytes with the proper catalytic activity is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties of M&#8211;S batteries. With regard to the S cathodes, advanced electrode materials with enhanced electrocatalytic effects can capture polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical conversion and, as for the metal anodes, the proper electrode materials can provide active sites for metal deposition to reduce the deposition potential barrier and control the electroplating or stripping process. Moreover, an advanced electrolyte with desirable design can catalyze electrochemical reactions on the cathode and anode in high&#8208;performance M&#8211;S batteries. In this review, recent progress pertaining to the design of advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with the proper catalytic effects is summarized. The current progress of S cathodes and metal anodes in different types of M&#8211;S batteries are discussed and future development directions are described. The objective is to provide a comprehensive review on the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art S cathodes and metal anodes in M&#8211;S batteries and research guidance for future development of this important class of batteries.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. Herein, we study the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8764;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells. We are able to promote charge extraction by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8764;92% of the radiative limit for the band gap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 hours of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 hours of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favoured exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and we use this knowledge to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>3D Framework with Li3N&#8208;Li2S solid electrolyte interphase and fast ion transfer channels for stabilized lithium metal anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li metal anode has been recognized as the most promising anode for its high theoretical capacity and low reduction potential. However, major drawbacks of Li metal such as high reactivity, large volume expansion could lead to dendrite growth and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) fracture, which cause capacity fading, low coulombic efficiency and safety issues. We herein report an in&#8208;situ artificial inorganic SEI layer, consisting of lithium nitride and lithium sulfide, to address the dendrite growth and volume expansion issues. Porous graphene oxide films are doped with sulfur and nitrogen (denoted as SNGO) to work as an effective lithium host. The SNGO film enables the in&#8208;situ formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer, which facilitates the transport of Li ions, improve SEI mechanical strength and avoids SEI fracture. In addition, the COMSOL simulation results reveal that the microchannels fabricated by three&#8208;dimensional printing technique further shorten the Li ion transfer pathways and homogenize heat and stress distribution in the batteries. As a result, the assembled anode shows low capacity fading of 0.1% per cycle at 2 C rate with sulfur cathode. In addition, the high lithium utilization of SNGO host enables the anode to provide stable capacity at low negative/positive electrode ratios under 3 in Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of 2D and&#160;3D Conducting Polymers and Derived Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic synthesis technique based on a bicontinuous microemulsion system is developed to design nanostructures of conducting polymers including 2D, 3D, and nanocomposites with tailored electrical properties and morphologies.








Abstract
In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties. However, the techniques for the manufacture of 2D nanosheets are either complex or expensive. No comprehensive approach for constructing 2D and 3D materials or their composites has been documented. Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of 2D, 3D, and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. In this method, diverse bicontinuous thin layers of oil and water are employed to produce 2D nanosheets of conducting polymers. For the fabrication of 3D polypyrrole (PPY) and their composites, specially designed linkers of the monomers are applied to lock the 3D networks of the conducting polymers and their composites. The technique can be extended to the fabrication of most conducting polymer composites, being cost&#8208;effective and easily scalable.

     alt="Strategic Synthesis of 2D and&#160;3D Conducting Polymers and Derived Nanocomposites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategic synthesis technique based on a bicontinuous microemulsion system is developed to design nanostructures of conducting polymers including 2D, 3D, and nanocomposites with tailored electrical properties and morphologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties. However, the techniques for the manufacture of 2D nanosheets are either complex or expensive. No comprehensive approach for constructing 2D and 3D materials or their composites has been documented. Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of 2D, 3D, and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. In this method, diverse bicontinuous thin layers of oil and water are employed to produce 2D nanosheets of conducting polymers. For the fabrication of 3D polypyrrole (PPY) and their composites, specially designed linkers of the monomers are applied to lock the 3D networks of the conducting polymers and their composites. The technique can be extended to the fabrication of most conducting polymer composites, being cost-effective and easily scalable. The optimum electrical conductivity obtained for 2D PPY nanosheets is 219&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the highest literature value reported to date to the best of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Li/CFx Batteries Enabled by Fast&#8208;Transport and Anion&#8208;Pairing Liquefied Gas Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary batteries serve as indispensable power sources for hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach places or when recharging is unnecessary. A Li/CFx&#160;primary battery with practical loading is developed to provide high energy density down to &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, which is enabled by a liquefied gas electrolyte providing fast transport and anion&#8208;pairing. These design principles are of high interest to similar battery systems operating under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Lithium fluorinated&#8208;carbon (Li/CFx) is one of the most promising chemistries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density primary energy&#8208;storage systems in applications where rechargeability is not required. Though Li/CFx demonstrates high energy density (&gt;2100&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) under ambient conditions, achieving such a high energy density when exposed to subzero temperatures remains a challenge, particularly under high current density. Here, a liquefied gas electrolyte with an anion&#8208;pair solvation structure based on dimethyl ether with a low melting point (&#8722;141&#160;&#176;C) and low viscosity (0.12 mPa s, 20&#160;&#176;C), leading to high ionic conductivity (&gt;3.5 mS cm&#8722;1) between &#8722;70 and 60&#160;&#176;C is reported. Besides that, through systematic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy integrated with transmission electron microscopy characterizations, the interface of CFx is evaluated for low&#8208;temperature performance. The fast transport and anion&#8208;pairing solvation structure of the electrolyte are concluded to bring about reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance at low temperatures, which results in significantly enhanced performance of Li/CFx cells (1690 Wh kg&#8722;1, &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C based on active materials). Utilizing 50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 loading electrodes, the Li/CFx still displays 1530&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides insights into the electrolyte design that may overcome the operational limits of batteries in extreme environments.

         <title>Drug Delivery in Plants Using Silk Microneedles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of silk&#8208;based microneedles is demonstrated in delivery of plant hormones (gibberellic acid) to Arabidopsis thaliana and several crop species with minimal wounding response and higher efficiency and efficacy than foliar spray. Microneedle&#8208;mediated delivery allows tissues restricted by current delivery methods to be reached and opens the door to a new tool for plant science and precision agriculture.








Abstract
New systems for agrochemical delivery in plants will foster precise agricultural practices and provide new tools to study plants and design crop traits, as standard spray methods suffer from elevated loss and limited access to remote plant tissues. Silk&#8208;based microneedles can circumvent these limitations by deploying a known amount of payloads directly in plants&#8217; deep tissues. However, plant response to microneedles&#8217; application and microneedles&#8217; efficacy in deploying physiologically relevant biomolecules are unknown. Here, it is shown that gene expression associated with Arabidopsis thaliana wounding response decreases within 24 h post microneedles&#8217; application. Additionally, microinjection of gibberellic acid (GA3) in A. thaliana mutant ft&#8208;10 provides a more effective and efficient mean than spray to activate GA3 pathways, accelerating bolting and inhibiting flower formation. Microneedle efficacy in delivering GA3 is also observed in several monocot and dicot crop species, i.e., tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), rice (Oryza Sativa), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and soybean (Glycine max). The wide range of plants that can be successfully targeted with microinjectors opens the doors to their use in plant science and agriculture.

         <title>A Monolithic Stochastic Computing Architecture for Energy Efficient Arithmetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stochastic computing architecture for arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and sorting, with low energy and area overhead through monolithic integration of logic gates and stochastic&#8208;bit generator is reported, which exploits the cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle variation in programming of 2D memtransistors based on monolayer MoS2.








Abstract
As the energy and hardware investments necessary for conventional high&#8208;precision digital computing continue to explode in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), a change in paradigm that can trade precision for energy and resource efficiency is being sought for many computing applications. Stochastic computing (SC) is an attractive alternative since, unlike digital computers, which require many logic gates and a high transistor volume to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, sorting, etc., SC can implement the same using simple logic gates. While it is possible to accelerate SC using traditional silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the need for extensive hardware investment to generate stochastic bits (s&#8208;bits), the fundamental computing primitive for SC, makes it less attractive. Memristor and spin&#8208;based devices offer natural randomness but depend on hybrid designs involving CMOS peripherals for accelerating SC, which increases area and energy burden. Here, the limitations of existing and emerging technologies are overcome, and a standalone SC architecture embedded in memory and based on 2D&#160;memtransistors is experimentally demonstrated. The monolithic and non&#8208;von&#8208;Neumann SC architecture occupies a small hardware footprint and consumes a miniscule amount of energy (&lt;1&#160;nJ) for both s&#8208;bit generation and arithmetic operations, highlighting the benefits of SC.

         <title>Van der Waals Multi&#8208;Layer Heterojunction for Low&#8208;Voltage Organic RGB Area&#8208;Emitting Transistor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) have garnered considerable attention from academy and industry due to their potential applications in next&#8208;generation display technologies, multifunctional devices, and organic electrically pumped lasers. However, overcoming the trade&#8208;offs among power consumption, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and uniform area emission remains a long&#8208;standing issue for OLETs. Herein, a van der Waals multi&#8208;layer heterojunction methodology was proposed to enhance the layer&#8208;to&#8208;layer interfacial interaction and contact, resulting in better dipole shielding, carrier transport, exciton recombination, and current density distribution. The prepared multi&#8208;layer heterojunction OLET (MLH&#8208;OLET) array showed uniform and bright RGB area emission and low operating voltage (&lt; 30&#160;V among the lowest applied voltage of reported lateral LETs). Additionally, a high brightness under area emission of 1060&#160;cd m&#8211;2, a high EQE value of 0.85%, and a high loop stability (over 380 cycles, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OLETs) indicated that the proposed multi&#8208;layer heterojunction was obviously superior to the reported lateral device configuration. The van der Waals multi&#8208;layer heterojunction developed for the preparation of OLET arrays sufficiently meets the low&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;performance, and low&#8208;cost requirements of future display technologies.

         <title>Novel Insight into Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries with Promising Selenium Sulfide@Carbon Nanofibers Cathode</title>

Abstract
Due to the unique electronic structure of Al3+ with strong Coulombic interaction and complex bonding situation (simultaneously covalent/ionic bonds), traditional electrodes, mismatching with the bonding orbital of Al3+, usually exhibit slow kinetic process with inferior rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) performance. Herein, to break the confinement of the interaction mismatch between Al3+ and electrode, we potentially develop a previously unexplored Se2.9S5.1&#8208;based cathode with sufficient valence electronic energy overlap with Al3+ and easily accessible structure. Through this new strategy, Se2.9S5.1 encapsulated in multichannel carbon nanofibers with free&#8208;standing structure exhibits a high capacity of 606 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, fast kinetics (211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.0 A g&#8722;1), robust stability (187 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 3,000 cycles), and enhanced flexibility. Simultaneously, in/ex&#8208;situ characterizations also reveal the unexplored mechanism of SexSy in RABs.

         <title>Space&#8208;charge Control of Magnetism in Ferromagnetic Metals: Coupling Giant Magnitude and Robust Endurance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferromagnetic metals show great prospects in ultralow&#8208;power&#8208;consumption spintronic devices, due to their high Curie temperature and robust magnetization. However, there is still a lack of reliable solutions for giant and reversible voltage control of magnetism in ferromagnetic metal films. Here, we propose a novel space&#8208;charge approach which allows us to achieve a modulation of 30.3 emu g&#8722;1 under 1.3&#160;V in Co/TiO2 multilayer granular films. The robust endurance with more than 5,000 cycles was demonstrated. Similar phenomena exist in Ni/TiO2 and Fe/TiO2 multilayer granular films, which shows its universality. The magnetic change of 107% in Ni/TiO2 underlines its potential in voltage&#8208;driven ON&#8208;OFF magnetism. Such giant and reversible voltage control of magnetism can be ascribed to space&#8208;charge effect at the ferromagnetic metals/TiO2 interfaces, in which spin&#8208;polarized electrons are injected into the ferromagnetic metal layer with the adsorption of lithium&#8208;ions on the TiO2 surface. These results open the door for a promising method to modulate the magnetization in ferromagnetic metals, paving the way towards the development of ionic&#8208;magnetic&#8208;electric coupled applications.

         <title>Matching Bidentate Ligand Anchoring: an Accurate Control Strategy for Stable Single&#8208;Atom/ZIF Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Improving metal loading and controlling the coordination environment is nontrivial and challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which have the greatest atomic efficiency and largest number of interface sites. In this study, a matching bidentate ligand (MBL) anchoring strategy was designed for the construction of CuN4 SACs with tunable coordination environment(Cu loading range from 0.4 to15.4 wt%). The obtained Cu SA/ ZIF (0.4 wt%) (ZIF = Zeolitic imidazolate framework with Matching bidentate N&#8208;ligands) nanocomposites exhibited superior performance in homo&#8208;coupling of phenyl acetylene under light irradiation (TON = 580, selectivity &gt; 99%), which was 22 times higher than that of Cu SA/NC&#8208;800 (NC = N&#8208;doped porous carbon). Experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the specific Cu five&#8208;membered ring formed using the MBL anchoring strategy was the key to the immobilization of isolated Cu atoms. This strategy provides a basis for the construction of M SA/MOF, which has the potential to narrow the gap between experimental and theoretical catalysis, as further confirmed by the successful preparation of Fe SA/ZIF and Ni SA/ZIF.

         <title>Inverted and Amplified CP&#8208;EL Behavior Promoted by AIE&#8208;Active Chiral Co&#8208;Assembled Helical Nanofibers</title>

Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) remain a formidable challenge to the future application of circularly polarized luminescent (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, we describe our design of a pair of AIE&#8208;active chiral enantiomers (L/D&#8208;HP) to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies with an achiral naphthalimide dye (NTi). The resulting co&#8208;assemblies emit an inverted CPL signal compared with that from the L/D&#8208;HP enantiomers. After thermal annealing at 120&#176;C, the inverted CPL signal of this kind of L/D&#8208;HP&#8208;NTi with a 1:1 molar ratio showed regular and ordered helical nanofibers arranged through intermolecularly ordered layered packing and was accompanied with a further amplified effect (|gem| = 0.032, &#955;em = 535&#160;nm). Significantly, non&#8208;doped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on a device emitting layer (EML) of L/D&#8208;HP&#8208;NTi exhibited a low turn&#8208;on voltage (Von) of 4.7&#160;V, a high maximum brightness (Lmax) of 2001&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and moderate maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.3%, as well as excellent circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) (|gEL| = 0.023, &#955;em = 533&#160;nm).

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8208;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8208;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. We&#160;study epitaxial Au nanoislands on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. We&#160;observe a strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8208;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. Our&#160;results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8208;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Identification of the Origin of Ultralow Dark Currents in Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic bulk heterojunction photodiodes (OPDs) attract attention for sensing and imaging. Their detectivity is typically limited by a substantial reverse bias dark current density Jd. Recently, using thermal admittance or spectral photocurrent measurements, Jd has been attributed to thermal charge generation mediated by mid&#8208;gap states. Here, we report the temperature dependence of Jd in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPDs with Jd down to 10&#8722;9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V bias. For a variety of donor&#8208;acceptor bulk&#8208;heterojunction blends we find that the thermal activation energy of Jd is lower than the effective bandgap of the blends, by ca. 0.3 to 0.5&#160;eV, but higher than expected for mid&#8208;gap states. Ultra&#8208;sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap photocurrent spectroscopy reveals that the minimum photon energy for optical charge generation in OPDs correlates with the dark current thermal activation energy. The dark current in OPDs is attributed to thermal charge generation at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface mediated by intra&#8208;gap states near the band edges.

         <title>Unraveling Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving nanomedicines' clinical efficacy but was attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form protein corona. Here, we show that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, we developed transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGL) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides were deactivated by plasma corona and lost their targeting capability. Once they reached tumor blood vessels, the US irradiation induced transformation of LPGL from nanodrops into microbubble via liquid&#8208;gas phase transition and decorticated surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regained the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiated ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieved efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and led to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenograft. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Photonic Crystal&#8208;Integrated Optoelectronic Devices with Naked&#8208;Eye Visualization and Digital Readout for High&#8208;Resolution Detection of Ultratrace Analytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The detection of ultratrace analytes is highly desirable for the noninvasive monitoring of human diseases. However, a major challenge is fast, naked&#8208;eye, high&#8208;resolution ultratrace detection. Herein, we first designed a rectangular 3D composite photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based optoelectronic device that combines the sensitivity&#8208;enhancing effects of PCs and optoelectronic devices with fast and real&#8208;time digital monitoring. We developed a crack&#8208;free, centimeter&#8208;scale, mechanically robust ellipsoidal composite PCs with sufficient hardness and modulus, even exceeding most plastics and aluminum alloys. The high mechanical strength of ellipsoidal composite PCs allows them to be hand&#8208;machined into rectangular geometries that can be conformally covered with the centimeter&#8208;scale flat light&#8208;detection area without interference from ambient light, easily integrating 3D composite PC&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. The PC&#8208;based device's signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) increases dramatically from original 30&#8764;40&#160;dB to approximately 60&#8764;70&#160;dB. Droplets of ultratrace analytes on the device are identified by fast digital readout within seconds, with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#956;L, enabling rapid identification of ultratrace glucose in artificial sweat and diabetes risk. The developed 3D PC&#8208;based sensor offers the advantages of small size, low cost and high reliability, paving the way for wider implementation in other portable optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have recently been developed at a tremendous pace in the area of organic luminescent materials by virtue of their superior properties. However, the practical applications of AIEgens still face the challenge of transforming AIEgens from molecular into materials. Till now, many AIEgens have been integrated into fiber, endowing the fiber with prominent fluorescence and/or photosensitizing capacities. AIEgens and fiber complement each other for making progress in flexible smart materials, in which the utilization of AIEgens creates new application possibilities for fiber, and the fiber provides an excellent carrier for AIEgens towards realizing the conversion from molecule to materials and an ideal platform to research the aggregate state of AIEgens in mesoscale and macroscale. This review begins with a brief summary on the recent advances related to some typical AIEgens with various functions and the technology for the fabrication of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized fiber. We then highlight the most representative applications by focusing on energy conversion, personal protect equipment, biomedical, sensor and fluorescence&#8208;related fields. Finally, the challenges, opportunities and tendency in future development are discussed in detail. This review hopes to inspire the innovation in AIEgens and fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Resistant and High&#8208;Entropic Non&#8208;Noble&#8208;Metal Electrodes for Oxygen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corrosion&#8208;resistant non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts demonstrate the possibility of replacing noble metals such as IrO2 as anode catalysts in acidic media. The place replacement of Ni and Co as catalytically active elements in passivation elements such as Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo plays an important role in enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity.








Abstract
To realize a sustainable hydrogen economy, corrosion&#8208;resistant non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts are needed to replace noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The combination of passivation elements and catalytically active elements is crucial for simultaneously achieving high corrosion resistance and high catalytic activity. Herein, the self&#8208;selection/reconstruction characteristics of multi&#8208;element (nonary) alloys that can automatically redistribute suitable elements and rearrange surface structures under the target reaction conditions during the oxygen evolution reaction are investigated. The following synergetic effect (i.e., cocktail effect), among the elements Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo, significantly contributes to passivation, whereas Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, and Fe enhance the catalytic activity. According to the practical water electrolysis experiments, the self&#8208;selected/reconstructed multi&#8208;element alloy demonstrates high performance under a similar condition with proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;type water electrolysis without obvious degradation during stability tests. This verifies the resistance of the alloy to corrosion when used as an electrode under a practical PEM electrolysis condition.

Herein, the self-selection/reconstruction characteristics of multi-element (nonary) alloys that can automatically redistribute suitable elements and rearrange surface structures under the target reaction conditions during the oxygen evolution reaction are investigated. The following synergetic effect (i.e., cocktail effect), among the elements Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo, significantly contributes to passivation, whereas Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, and Fe enhance the catalytic activity. According to the practical water electrolysis experiments, the self-selected/reconstructed multi-element alloy demonstrates high performance under a similar condition with proton exchange membrane (PEM)-type water electrolysis without obvious degradation during stability tests. This verifies the resistance of the alloy to corrosion when used as an electrode under a practical PEM electrolysis condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Mineralization with Protein&#8208;Functionalized Peptoid Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptoid nanotubes functionalized with solid&#8208;binding proteins are used to achieve sub&#8208;5&#197; control over the size of TiO2 particles in a 1.4 to 4.4 nm range that has heretofore been inaccessible to biomimetic mineralization. These novel hybrid nanostructures also support the synthesis of gold nanoparticles, and the dual mineralization of TiO2 and gold to yield integrated nanocomposites capable of photocatalytic activity under visible&#8208;light illumination.








Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined foldamers that self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined architectures are promising scaffolds to template inorganic mineralization. However, it has been challenging to achieve robust control of nucleation and growth without sequence redesign or extensive experimentation. Here, peptoid nanotubes functionalized with a panel of solid&#8208;binding proteins are used to mineralize homogeneously distributed and monodisperse anatase nanocrystals from the water&#8208;soluble TiBALDH precursor. Crystallite size is systematically tuned between 1.4 and 4.4 nm by changing protein coverage and the identity and valency of the genetically engineered solid&#8208;binding segments. The approach is extended to the synthesis of gold nanoparticles and, using a protein encoding both material&#8208;binding specificities, to the fabrication of&#160;titania/gold nanocomposites capable of photocatalysis under visible&#8208;light illumination. Beyond uncovering critical roles for hierarchical organization and denticity on solid&#8208;binding protein mineralization outcomes, the strategy described herein should prove valuable for the fabrication of hierarchical hybrid materials incorporating a broad range of inorganic components.

         <title>Hyperelastic Kevlar Nanofiber Aerogels as Robust Thermal Switches for Smart Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperelastic Kevlar nanofiber aerogels (HEKAs) are synthesized by a slow&#8208;proton&#8208;release&#8208;modulating gelation and thermo&#8208;induced crosslinking strategy. The HEKAs exhibit low thermal conductivity and ultralow density, high porosity, and compression resilience. The application of HEKAs as thermal switches is demonstrated, which exhibit high responsive speed and heat flux. The heat loss can be reversibly switched on/off over 50 times.








Abstract
Aerogels, the lightest artificial solid materials characterized by low density and thermal conductivity, high porosity, and large specific surface area, have attracted increasing interest. Aerogels exhibit single&#8208;mode thermal insulation properties regardless of the surrounding temperature. In this study, hyperelastic Kevlar nanofiber aerogels (HEKAs) are designed and fabricated by a slow&#8208;proton&#8208;release&#8208;modulating gelation and thermoinduced crosslinking strategy. The method does not use crosslinking agents and endows the ultralow&#8208;density (4.7 mg cm&#8722;3) HEKAs with low thermal conductivity (0.029 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), high porosity (99.75%), high thermal stability (550&#160;&#176;C), and increased compression resilience (80%) and fatigue resistance. Proofs of the concept of the HEKAs acting as on&#8211;off thermal switches are demonstrated through experiments and simulations. The thermal switches exhibit a rapid thermal response speed of 0.73&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1, high heat flux of 2044 J m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and switching ratio of 7.5. Heat dissipation can be reversibly switched on/off more than fifty times owing to the hyperelasticity and fatigue resistance of the HEKAs. This study suggests a route to fulfill the hyperelasticity of highly porous aerogels and to tailor heat flux on&#8208;demand.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Mobility Modulation Effect for Transport Enhancement in Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mobilities of transistors based on dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]&#8208;thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT) single crystals are robustly increased via van der Waals epitaxy of crystalline 1,3,4,5,7,8&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (F6TCNNQ) on surface of DNTT crystals. Mobility Modulation Effect from interplay between charge transfer interface and gate electric field has been proposed responsible for transport enhancements, which sufficiently utilizes the high mobility of the bulk transport in the crystals.








Abstract
Molecular doping has conventionally been an effective way to improve the electrical&#8208;transport performances in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while corresponding mechanisms associated with specific doping techniques have been less investigated and discussed in detail. Here, based on ultrathin dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]&#8208;thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT) single crystals, robust transconductance enhancements are realized in OFETs upon surface molecular doping realized via van der Waals epitaxially growing crystalline 1,3,4,5,7,8&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (F6TCNNQ) onto the single crystal's surface. It is proposed that it is the mobility modulation effect (MME) from the interactions between charge&#8208;transfer interface and gate electric field, that contributes to more weighted bulk carriers, and finally improves charge&#8208;transport performances. The evaluations are further supported by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy&#160;(SKPM) surface potential characterizations, which manifest the gate&#8208;induced more delocalized holes near the charge&#8208;transfer interfaces. Space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited current (SCLC) investigations, numerical calculations, and theoretical mobility modeling are also performed to corroborate the analysis. This study can deepen the understanding of charge transport in doped semiconductors and provide effective ways for optimizing the electrical performance of organic devices.

         <title>Toward Plasmonic Neural Probes: SERS Detection of Neurotransmitters through Gold Nanoislands&#8208;decorated Tapered Optical fibers with sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Gaps</title>

Abstract
Integration of plasmonic nanostructures with fiber optics&#8208;based neural probes enables label&#8208;free detection of molecular fingerprints via surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and it represents a fascinating technological horizon to investigate brain function. However, developing neuro&#8208;plasmonic probes that can interface with deep brain regions with minimal invasiveness while providing the sensitivity to detect bio&#8208;molecular signatures in a physiological environment is challenging. In particular, because the same waveguide must be employed for both delivering excitation light and collecting the resulting scattered photons. Here, we present a SERS&#8208;active neural probe based on a tapered optical fiber (TF) decorated with gold nanoislands (NIs) that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micro&#8208;molar range. To do this, we developed a novel, non&#8208;planar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold NIs with sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gaps, uniformly distributed on the wide (&#8764;mm2), highly curved surface of TF. We experimentally and numerically show that the amplified broadband near&#8208;field enhancement of the high&#8208;density NIs layer allows achieving a limit of detection in aqueous solution of 10&#8722;7&#160;M for rhodamine 6G and 10&#8722;5&#160;M for serotonin and dopamine through SERS at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. We envision our technology as a first step towards the unexplored frontier of in&#8208;vivo label&#8208;free plasmonic neural interface.

         <title>Reconstruction of Thiospinel to Active Sites and Spin Channels for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical reconstruction of thiospinel CoFe2S4 evolves both oxyhydroxide species as active site and Fe3S4 component as spin channel, which is unique. The reconstructed CoFe2S4 shows state&#8208;of&#8208;art oxygen evolution reaction activity because of a strong magnetic anisotropy at the interface between oxyhydroxide and Fe3S4 components. The reconstructed configuration also benefits a robust performance in membrane electrolyzers.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a promising technique for carbon neutral hydrogen production. A great challenge remains at developing robust and low&#8208;cost anode catalysts. Many pre&#8208;catalysts are found to undergo surface reconstruction to give high intrinsic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reconstructed oxyhydroxides on the surface are active species and most of them outperform directly synthesized oxyhydroxides. The reason for the high intrinsic activity remains to be explored. Here, a study is reported to showcase the unique reconstruction behaviors of a pre&#8208;catalyst, thiospinel CoFe2S4, and its reconstruction chemistry for a high OER activity. The reconstruction of CoFe2S4 gives a mixture with both Fe&#8211;S component and active oxyhydroxide (Co(Fe)OxHy) because Co is more inclined to reconstruct as oxyhydroxide, while the Fe is more stable in Fe&#8211;S component in a major form of Fe3S4. The interface spin channel is demonstrated in the reconstructed CoFe2S4, which optimizes the energetics of OER steps on Co(Fe)OxHy species and facilitates the spin sensitive electron transfer to reduce the kinetic barrier of O&#8211;O coupling. The advantage is also demonstrated in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work introduces the feasibility of engineering the reconstruction chemistry of the precatalyst for high performance and durable MEA electrolyzers.

&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical reconstruction of thiospinel CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; evolves both oxyhydroxide species as active site and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; component as spin channel, which is unique. The reconstructed CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; shows state-of-art oxygen evolution reaction activity because of a strong magnetic anisotropy at the interface between oxyhydroxide and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; components. The reconstructed configuration also benefits a robust performance in membrane electrolyzers.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water electrolysis is a promising technique for carbon neutral hydrogen production. A great challenge remains at developing robust and low-cost anode catalysts.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni Alloy Polyhedral Nanochains as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni nanostructures, consisting of ordered nanopolyhedra&#8211;nanowires&#8211;nanopolyhedra, are designed and prepared for efficient dual&#8208;function application in direct methanol fuel cells. The nanostructure enjoys the advantages of both the optimal catalytic activity of 0D nanopolyhedra and the robust catalytic stability of 1D nanowires, and also compensates for the nonuniformity of catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by the size effect.








Abstract
Pt nanocatalysts play a critical role in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) due to their appropriate adsorption/desorption energy, yet suffer from an unbalanced relationship between size&#8208;dependent activity and stability. Herein, mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8211;Ni alloy polyhedral nanochains (Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs) with an ordered assembly of a nanopolyhedra&#8211;nanowire&#8211;nanopolyhedra architecture are fabricated as bifunctional electrocatalysts for DMFCs, effectively alleviating the size effect. The Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs exhibit 7.23 times higher mass activity for the anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) than that of commercial Pt/C. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and CO stripping measurements demonstrate the prominent stability of the Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs to resist CO poisoning. For the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a positive half&#8208;wave potential exceeding Pt/C is achieved by the Pt&#8211;Ni PNCs, and it can be well maintained for 10&#160;000 cycles with negligible activity decay. The designed nanostructure can alleviate the agglomeration and dissolution problems of 0D small&#8208;sized Pt&#8211;Ni alloy nanocrystals and enrich surface atom steps and active facets of 1D chain&#8208;like nanostructures. This work provides a proposed strategy to improve the catalytic performance of Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts by constructing novel interfacial relationships in mixed dimensions to alleviate the imbalance between catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by size effects.

         <title>A Demulsification&#8211;Crystallization Model for High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model is constructed to describe the crystallization process of the perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). Furtherly, a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy is designed to optimize the D&#8211;C model for high&#8208;quality PNCs. Finally, the green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the PNCs achieved EQE of 22.5%.








Abstract
A room&#8208;temperature technique with all&#8208;nonpolar&#8208;solvent, which circumvents the sensitivity of ionic perovskite to polar solvent, has become attractive for the synthesis of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). However, the lack of understanding of the inner mechanism, especially for the state of the precursor and the crystallization process of the PNCs, hinders further development of this technique. Here, through systematic study of the Pb precursor and in situ characterization of the PNCs, it is revealed that the reverse micelle nature of the Pb precursor exactly creates a novel demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model, namely, a two&#8208;stage nucleation is divided by a demulsification process for the PNCs. On this basis, a top efficiency for green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on PNCs is obtained with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.5% through tailoring the D&#8211;C model using a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality PNCs. Beyond the high efficiency, the work paves the way for diverse ideas in PNC synthesis.

         <title>Elucidating the Origins of High Preferential Crystal Orientation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation process to form quasi&#8208;2D&#160;perovskites is thermodynamically controlled using the methylammonium chloride additive to achieve films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without degradation. Combining microscopic, macroscopic, and spectrographic observations, the thermodynamics enabling preferential crystal growth are inferred.








Abstract
Incorporating large organic cations to form&#160;2D&#160;and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of the mechanism of photon propagation and carrier kinetics of semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;PSCs. In this paper, the key factors affecting the high light utilization of ST&#8208;PSCs are deeply discussed from the theoretical analysis, and the recent advances from the view of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation of ST&#8208;PSCs are summarized, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development and further commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation are systematically rationalized. First, the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties are provided. Then, insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies are provided. Furthermore, a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs is provided. Finally, the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs is briefly summarized, and the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs are proposed.

The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST-PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST-PSCs. Herein, the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST-PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation are systematically rationalized. First, the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties are provided. Then, insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies are provided. Furthermore, a summary of the promising commercial application of ST-PSCs in BIPV and TSCs is provided. Finally, the main progress of ST-PSCs is briefly summarized, and the directions for the commercialization of ST-PSCs are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extremely Suppressed Energetic Disorder in a Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that the energetic disorder inevitably arising in chemically doped conjugated polymers (CPs) can be suppressed close to the theoretical limit. Even after the incorporation of significant amount of dopant, the distribution of states for intramolecular sites is maintained as narrow because of the high planarity of the CP backbone chains, resulting in excellent charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Chemical doping can be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers (CPs), extending their applications as conducting materials. Unfortunately, chemically doped CP films containing excess dopants exhibit an increase in energetic disorder upon structural alteration, and Coulomb interactions between charge carriers and dopants also affect such disorder. The increase in energetic disorder leads to a broadening of the density of states, which consequently impedes efficient charge transport in chemically doped CPs. However, the molecular origins that are inherently resistant to such incidental increase of energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs have not been sufficiently explored. Here, it is discovered that energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs can be suppressed to a level close to the theoretical limit. Indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) doped with triethyloxonium hexachloroantimonate (OA) exhibits disorder&#8208;free charge&#8208;transport characteristics and band&#8208;like transport behavior with astonishing carrier mobility as a result of reinforced 1D intramolecular transport. Molecular structure of IDTBT provides a capability to lower the energetic disorder that generally arises from the inclusion of heterogeneous dopants. The results suggest the possibilities of implementing disorder&#8208;free CPs that exhibit excellent charge transport characteristics in the chemically doped state and satisfy a prerequisite for their availability in the industry.

         <title>Tuning the C1/C2 Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Cu&#8208;CeO2 Nanorods by Oxidation State Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ceria (CeO2) is one of the most extensively used rare earth oxides. Recently, it has been used as a support material for metal catalsts for electrochemical energy conversion. However, to date, the nature of metal/CeO2 interfaces and their impact on electrochemical processes remains unclear. Here, we present a Cu&#8208;CeO2 nanorod (Cu&#8208;CeO2 NR) selective electrochemical CO2 reduction catalyst having a well&#8208;controlled Cu&#8208;CeO2 interface. Using in operando analysis and computational techniques, we found that, on the application of a reductive electrochemical potential, Cu undergoes an abrupt change in solubility in the ceria matrix. In this window, Cu undergoes a transition from the thermodynamically less stable randomly dissolved single atomic Cu2+ ions to (Cu0,Cu1+) nanoclusters. Unlike single atomic Cu, which produces C1 products as the main product during electrochemical CO2 reduction, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) clusters lowers the energy barrier for C&#8208;C coupling and enables the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons. As a result, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) in the clusters at the Cu&#8208;ceria interface results in a C2+ partial current density/unit Cu weight 27&#8208;times that of a corresponding Cu&#8208;carbon catalyst under the same conditions.

         <title>Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nano Roads Promotes Selective C&#8208;C Coupling Reaction During Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Obtaining multicarbon products via CO2 photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron mediated C&#8208;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO2 conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centres having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&#8208;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, we present a novel photocatalyst, Bi19S27Cl3, which selectively converts CO2 to a C2 product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through Transmission Electron Microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the presence of charge polarized bismuth centres in Bi19S27Cl3, which is well complemented by DFT calculation. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centres renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centres yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&#8208;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates was experimentally mapped by in&#8208;situ FTIR spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.

         <title>Single Zinc Atom Aggregates: Synergetic Interaction to Boost Fast Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) pave new possibilities to improve the utilization efficiency of sulfur electrodes arising from polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish kinetics due to their excellent applicability in atomic&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, nitrogen (N)&#8208;anchored SACs on the highly ordered N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube arrays were reported as the sulfur host for fast redox conversion in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The cube structure of the aligned carbon nanotubes can promote the rapid mass transfer under high sulfur loadings, and abundant single&#8208;atom active sites further accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The synergistic enhancement effect induced by adjacent single atoms with interatomic distances less than 1&#160;nm further accelerates the rapid multi&#8208;step reaction of sulfur at high sulfur loadings. As a result, the obtained Li&#8208;S batteries exhibited outstanding cycle stability with a high areal capacity of 5.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 after 100 cycles under a high sulfur loading of 7.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (electrolyte to sulfur ratio is about 3.7&#160;mL g&#8722;1). Even assembled into a pouch cell, it still delivered a high capacity of 953.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, contributing to the development of the practically viable Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Orbital Hybridization&#8208;Driven Charge Density Wave Transition in CsV3Sb5 Kagome Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to its inherent non&#8208;trivial geometry, the unique structural motif of the recently discovered Kagome topological superconductor AV3Sb5 (A&#8201; = &#8201;K, Rb, Cs) is an ideal host of diverse topologically non&#8208;trivial phenomena, including giant anomalous Hall conductivity, topological charge order, charge density wave (CDW), and unconventional superconductivity. Despite possessing a normal&#8208;state CDW order in the form of topological chiral charge order and diverse superconducting gaps structures, it remains unclear how fundamental atomic&#8208;level properties and many&#8208;body effects including Fermi surface nesting, electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and orbital hybridization contribute to these symmetry&#8208;breaking phenomena. Here, we report the direct participation of the V3d&#8212;Sb5p orbital hybridization in mediating the CDW phase transition in CsV3Sb5. The combination of temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray absorption and first&#8208;principles studies clearly indicate the Inverse Star of David structure as the preferred reconstruction in the low&#8208;temperature CDW phase. Our results highlight the critical role that Sb orbitals plays and establish orbital hybridization as the direct mediator of the CDW states and structural transition dynamics in Kagome unconventional superconductors. This is a significant step towards the fundamental understanding and control of the emerging correlated phases from the Kagome lattice through the orbital interactions and provide promising approaches to novel regimes in unconventional orders and topology.

Abstract
Developing scalable electrical stimulating platforms for cell and tissue engineering applications is limited by external power source dependency, wetting resistance, microscale size requirements, and suitable flexibility. Here, we developed a versatile and scalable platform that enables tunable electrical stimulation for biological applications by harnessing the giant magnetoelastic effect in soft systems to convert gentle air pressure (100 &#8211; 400&#160;kPa) and yield current values of up to 10.5&#160;mA and 9.5&#160;mV. The platform is shown to be easily manufactured and scaled up for integration in multi&#8208;well magnetoelastic plates via three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. We demonstrated that the electrical stimulation generated by this platform enhanced the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons up to 2&#8208;fold (104%) and subsequent neuronal maturation up to 3&#8208;fold (251%). This easily configurable electrical stimulation device has broad applications in high throughput organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems and paves the way for future development of neural engineering, including cellular therapy via implantable self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation devices.

         <title>Dynamic Epitaxial Growth of Organic Heterostructures for Polarized Exciton Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through regulating the location of the dynamic epitaxial growth, a stepwise seeded growth approach is demonstrated for the organic low&#8208;dimensional heterostructures with a hierarchical spatial organization, such as triblock, core/shell, and axial&#8208;branch heterostructures. Moreover, these prepared organic heterostructures can be used in the micro/nanoscale multiple in/output optical logic gates.








Abstract
Highly spatial and angular precision in epitaxial&#8208;growth process is crucial for constructing organic low&#8208;dimensional heterostructures (OLDHs) with the desired substructures, which remains significant challenge owing to the unpredicted location of complex heterogeneous nucleation. Herein, a dynamic epitaxial&#8208;growth approach is developed along the tailored longitudinal/horizontal directions to create diverse OLDHs with hierarchical architectures. The controlled morphology evolution of seed crystals from kinetic to thermodynamic species is achieved via incrementally increasing the crystallization time from 0 to 600&#160;s. Accordingly, the kinetic and thermodynamic seed crystals respectively present the specific lattice&#8208;matching crystal&#8208;planes of (100) and (011), which facilitates the longitudinal epitaxial&#8208;growth (LG) process for triblock heterostructures, and the horizontal epitaxial&#8208;growth (HG) process for axial&#8208;branch heterostructures. The dominant core/shell heterostructures are prepared via both LG and HG processes with a crystallization time of &#8776;30&#160;s. Significantly, these prepared OLDHs realize the rationally polarized exciton conversion for optical logic gate application through the exciton conversion and photon propagation at the heterojunction. This strategy provides an avenue for the precise synthesis of OLDHs with anisotropy optical characters for integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Boosting Perovskite Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability: Interfacial Passivation of Crosslinked Fullerene Eliminates the &#8220;Burn&#8208;in&#8221; Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li+ ion migration induced &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite solar cells is reported. To block the Li+ ion movement, a thin cross&#8208;linked [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester layer is introduced on top of the SnO2 layer, resulting in Li+ immobilization. Finally, the efficiency and stability are significantly improved.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) longevity is nowadays the bottleneck for their full commercial exploitation. Although lot of research is ongoing, the initial decay of the output power &#8211; an effect known as &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation happening in the first 100&#160;h &#8211; is still unavoidable, significantly reducing the overall performance (typically of &gt;20%). In this paper, the origin of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation in n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs is demonstrated that is directly related to Li+ ions migration coming from the SnO2 electron transporting layer visualized by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) measurements. To block the ion movement, a thin cross&#8208;linked [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester layer on top of the SnO2 layer is introduced, resulting in Li+ immobilization. This results in the elimination of the &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; degradation, showing for the first time a zero &#8220;burn&#8208;in&#8221; loss in the performances while boosting device power conversion efficiency to &gt;22% for triple&#8208;cation&#8208;based PSCs and &gt;24% for formamidinium&#8208;based (FAPbI3) PSCs, proving the general validity of this approach and creating a new framework for the realization of stable PSCs devices.

         <title>Heterogeneous Strain Distribution Based Programmable Gated Microchannel for Ultrasensitive and Stable Strain Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ion channels in living organisms, discretely distributed laterally free micropillars are introduced into the fluidic channel to act as the gates and construct a gated strain sensor with the conductive liquid infiltrated within the gaps, obtaining a high gauge factor of up to 45&#8201;300, wide broad range of 590%, and great stability of 90&#8201;000&#160;drift&#8208;free cycling tests.








Abstract
Developing highly sensitive strain sensors requires conduction pathways capable of rapidly switching between disconnection and reconnection in response to strain. Ion channels in living organisms exactly control the channel switch through protein&#8208;composed gates, achieving changeable ion currents. Herein, inspired by the gating characteristics of the ion channels, a programmable fluidic strain sensor enhanced by gating ion pathways through heterogeneous strain distribution of discrete micropillars is proposed. During stretching, the contraction and closure of the widthwise gaps between discrete micropillars greatly weaken or even nearly cut off the conduction pathway, resulting in orders of magnitude increase in resistance and thus ultrahigh sensitivity. By adjusting the combination form and structural parameters of the discrete micropillars in the fluidic channel, the sensitivity and strain range can be customized. Thus, a gauge factor&#160;of up to 45&#160;300&#160;and a stretch range of 590% are obtained. Benefiting from the fluidic gating mechanism, no mechanical mismatch can be observed at the interface, breaking through the sensing stability issue of flexible sensors. The proposed sensor can be used to detect the full range of human motion, and integrated into a data glove to achieve human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly Directed Synthesis of Porous Materials with Ordered Bicontinuous Structures and Their Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the progress of the studies on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided synthesis of bicontinuous porous materials, with the emphases on their synthetic strategies, structural control, and potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.








Abstract
Porous materials with their ordered bicontinuous structures have attracted great interest owing to ordered periodic structures as well as 3D interconnected network and pore channels. Bicontinuous structures may favor efficient mass diffusion to the interior of materials, thus increasing the utilization ratio of active sites. In addition, ordered bicontinuous structures confer materials with exceptional optical and magnetic properties, including tunable photonic bandgap, negative refraction, and multiple equivalent magnetization configurations. The attractive structural advantages and physical properties have inspired people to develop strategies for preparing bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous materials. Among a few synthetic approaches, the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers represents a versatile strategy to prepare various bicontinuous&#8208;structured functional materials with pore sizes and lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 500&#160;nm. This article overviews progress in this appealing area, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies, the structural control (including topologies, pore sizes, and unit cell parameters), and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.

Bicontinuous structures may favor efficient mass diffusion to the interior of materials, thus increasing the utilization ratio of active sites. In addition, ordered bicontinuous structures confer materials with exceptional optical and magnetic properties, including tunable photonic bandgap, negative refraction, and multiple equivalent magnetization configurations. The attractive structural advantages and physical properties have inspired people to develop strategies for preparing bicontinuous-structured porous materials. Among a few synthetic approaches, the self-assembly of block copolymers represents a versatile strategy to prepare various bicontinuous-structured functional materials with pore sizes and lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 500&#160;nm. This article overviews progress in this appealing area, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies, the structural control (including topologies, pore sizes, and unit cell parameters), and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Totipotent &#8220;All&#8208;In&#8208;One&#8221; Peptide Sequentially Blocks Immune Checkpoint and Reverses the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A totipotent &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; peptide can transform into &#945;&#8208;helix in response to the tumor microenvironment. It possesses the abilities of self&#8208;assembling, blocking the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1&#160;axis, inhibiting Rbm38&#8208;eIF4E complex formation, and activating p53.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade combined with reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) can dramatically enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity, which can be achieved by using multiple&#8208;agent therapy. However, the optimal dose and order of administration of different agents remain elusive. To address this dilemma, multiple agents are often grafted together to construct &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; totipotent drugs, but this usually comes at the cost of a lack of synergy between the agents. Herein, by comprehensively analyzing the conserved sites of the immune checkpoint and TME drug targets, peptide secondary structures, assembly properties, and other physicochemical properties, a high&#8208;content peptide library is designed. By using the &#8220;3D&#8208;molecular&#8208;evolution&#8221; screening strategy, an efficient and totipotent &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; peptide (TAP) is obtained, which possesses the abilities of self&#8208;assembling, blocking the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1&#160;axis, inhibiting Rbm38&#8208;eIF4E complex formation, and activating p53. It is shown that in mice treated with TAP, with either subcutaneous tumors or patient&#8208;derived xenografts, PD&#8208;L1&#160;is blocked, with increased activation of both T and NK cells whilst reversing the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, TAP can mitigate tumor activity and suppress tumor growth, showing superior therapeutic effect over antibody&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>Locking Active Li Metal through Localized Redistribution of Fluoride Enabling Stable Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A LiF&#8208;rich interphase is constructed via a LiF dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, which is conceptually different from mainstream methods. The overall protective LiF&#8208;rich interphase endows the metallic Li electrode with significantly improved anticorrosive properties against electrolytes under various test conditions and enables stable Li&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
The creation of fluorinated interphase has emerged as an effective strategy for improving Li&#8208;metal anodes for rechargeable high&#8208;energy batteries. In contrast to the introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing species through widely adopted electrolyte engineering, a Li&#8208;metal composite design is reported in which LiF can locally redistribute on the Li&#8208;metal surface in liquid electrolytes via a dissolution&#8211;reprecipitation mechanism, and enable the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). For validation, a Li/Li22Sn5/LiF ternary composite is investigated, where the as&#8208;formed LiF&#8208;rich SEI locks the active Li metal from corrosive electrolyte. The Li/Li22Sn5/LiF anode displays an impressive average Coulombic efficiency (ACE, &#8776;99.2%) at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a carbonate electrolyte and a remarkable cycling life of over 1600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Applied to a LiCoO2 full cell with a high cathode areal capacity of 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, a high capacity retention of &#8776;91.1% is realized for 100 cycles at 0.5 C between 2.8 to 4.5&#160;V with a low negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2:1. This design is conceptually different from the design employing the widely used fluorine&#8208;containing electrolyte additive and provides an alternative approach to realize reliable Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Rational Screening of Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphases on Zn for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration about solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on Zn anodes is based on trial and error, which is laborious, inefficient, and missing of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art candidates. In this work, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property. As an output, Zn3(BO3)2 is reported as the SEI on Zn anode.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn anodes plays a pivotal role for high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life aqueous batteries, because it effectively inhibits side reactions and dendritic growth. Many materials are explored as SEIs by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, an exercisable way is proposed to screen the potential SEIs on Zn anodes in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property theoretically. As an output of this screening, Zn3(BO3)2 (ZBO) is checked experimentally. In symmetrical cells, Zn@ZBO runs over 250&#160;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for a large areal capacity 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. In full cells, Zn@ZBO||MnO2 shows an impressive cumulative capacity (&#8776;406 mAh cm&#8722;2) under harsh conditions, i.e., a lean electrolyte condition (10&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1), limited Zn supply (negative/positive electrode capacity ratio, N/P ratio = 2.3), and high areal capacity (5.0 mAh cm&#8722;2). The significance of this work lies in not only the first report of ZBO on Zn showing excellent electrochemical performance, but also a feasible way to screen the promising SEI materials for other metal anodes.

         <title>Flash recycling of graphite anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing production of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) will result in a staggering accumulation of waste when they reach their end of life. A closed&#8208;loop solution, with effective recycling of spent LIBs, will lessen both the environmental impacts and economic cost of their use. Presently, &lt;5% of spent LIBs are recycled and the regeneration of graphite anodes has, unfortunately, been mostly overlooked despite the considerable cost of battery&#8208;grade graphite. Here, we develop an ultrafast flash recycling method to regenerate the graphite anode and recover valuable battery metal resources. Selective Joule heating is applied for only seconds to efficiently decompose the resistive impurities. The generated inorganic salts, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese, can be easily recollected from the flashed anode waste using diluted acid, specifically 0.1&#160;M HCl. The flash&#8208;recycled anode preserves the graphite structure and is coated with a solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase&#8208;derived carbon shell, contributing to high initial specific capacity, superior rate performance and cycling stability, when compared to anode materials recycled using a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;calcination method. Life&#8208;cycle&#8208;analysis relative to current graphite production and recycling methods indicate that flash recycling can significantly reduce the total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission while turning anode recycling into an economically advantageous process.

&lt;p&gt;The ever-increasing production of commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) will result in a staggering accumulation of waste when they reach their end of life.

Presently, &amp;lt;5% of spent LIBs are recycled and the regeneration of graphite anodes has, unfortunately, been mostly overlooked despite the considerable cost of battery-grade graphite.

Abstract
Hindered gas bubble release and limited electron conducting process represent the major bottlenecks for large scale electrochemical water splitting. Both the desorption of bubbles and continuous electron transport are achievable on the surfaces of biomimetic catalytic materials by designing multiscale structural hierarchy. Inspired by the tubular structures of the deep&#8208;sea&#160;sponges, we fabricated an exceptionally active and binder&#8208;free porous nickel tube arrays (PNTA) decorated with NiFe&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;pore nanosheets (NiFe&#8208;PZn). The PNTA facilitated removal of bubbles and electron transfer in oxygen evolution reaction by reproducing trunks of the sponges, and simultaneously, the NiFe&#8208;PZn increase the number of catalytic active sites by simulating the sponge epidermis. With improved external mass transfer and interior electron transfer, the hierarchical NiFe&#8208;PZn@PNTA electrode exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 172&#160;mV at 10 mA&#8729;cm&#8722;2 (with a Tafel slope of 50 mV&#8729;dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, this electrocatalytic system recorded excellent reaction stability over 360 hours with constant current density of 100 mA&#8729;cm&#8722;2 at the potential of 1.52&#160;V (versus RHE). This work provides a new strategy of designing hierarchical electrocatalysts for highly efficient water splitting.

         <title>Stable cuprous hydroxide nanostructures by organic Ligand functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Copper compounds have been extensively investigated for diverse applications. However, studies of cuprous hydroxide (CuOH) have been scarce, due to structural metastability. Herein, a facile, wet&#8208;chemistry procedure is reported for the preparation of stable CuOH nanostructures via deliberate functionalization with select organic ligands, such as acetylene and mercapto derivatives. The resulting nanostructures are found to exhibit a nanoribbon morphology consisting of small nanocrystals embedded within a largely amorphous nanosheet&#8208;like scaffold. The acetylene derivatives are found to anchor onto the CuOH forming Cu&#8208;C&#2301; linkages, whereas Cu&#8208;S&#8208; interfacial bonds are formed with the mercapto ligands. Effective electronic coupling occurs at the ligand&#8208;core interface in the former, in contrast to mostly non&#8208;conjugated interfacial bonds in the latter, as manifested in spectroscopic measurements and confirmed in theoretical studies based on first principles calculations. Notably, the acetylene&#8208;capped CuOH nanostructures exhibit markedly enhanced photodynamic activity in the inhibition of bacteria growth, as compared to the mercapto&#8208;capped counterparts, due to a reduced material bandgap and effective photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species. Results from this study demonstrate that deliberate structural engineering with select organic ligands is an effective strategy in the stabilization and functionalization of CuOH nanostructures, a critical first step in exploring their diverse applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the ampltiude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, we report the modulation of the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal via ferroelectric domain patterning, and demonstrate that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The coupling between the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which has been modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. Our study provides a new material platform that enables reconfiguratable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulator, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Improved Molecular Ordering in a Ternary Blend Enables All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) show great commercialization prospects, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still fall behind their small molecule acceptor&#8208;based counterparts. In all&#8208;polymer blends, the optimized morphology and high molecular ordering are difficult to achieve since there is trouble&#8208;some competition between the crystallinity of the polymer donor and acceptor during the film&#8208;formation process. Therefore, it is challenging to improve the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;PSCs. We herein adopt a ternary strategy to modulate the morphology and the molecular crystallinity of an all&#8208;polymer blend, in which PM6:PY&#8208;82 was selected as the host blend and PY&#8208;DT was employed as a guest component. Benefiting from the favorable miscibility of the two acceptors and the higher regularity of PY&#8208;DT, the ternary matrix features a well&#8208;defined fibrillar morphology and improved molecular ordering. As a result, the champion PM6:PY&#8208;82:PY&#8208;DT device produces a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.03%, with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor in comparison with the binary devices. High&#8208;performance large&#8208;area (1 cm2) and thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) all&#8208;PSCs were also successfully fabricated with PCEs of 16.35% and 15.70%, respectively. More importantly, 16.5 cm2 organic solar module affords an encouraging PCE of 13.84% when using the non&#8208;halogenated solvent (o&#8208;xylene), showing the great potential of &#8220;Lab&#8208;to&#8208;Fab&#8221; transition of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Highly Sensitive and Cost&#8208;Effective Polymeric&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Based Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Linear Polarizers with Tailored Fabry &#8211; P&#233;rot Resonance</title>

Abstract
Inverse&#8208;vulcanized polymeric sulfur has received considerable attention for application in waste&#8208;based infrared (IR) polarizers with high polarization sensitivities, owing to its high transmittance in the IR region and thermal processability. However, there have been few reports on highly sensitive polymeric sulfur&#8208;based polarizers by replication of pre&#8208;simulated dimensions to achieve a high transmission of the transverse magnetic field (TTM) and extinction ratio (ER). Herein, we introduce a 400&#8208;nanometer&#8208;pitch mid&#8208;wavelength infrared bilayer linear polarizer with self&#8208;aligned metal gratings on polymeric sulfur gratings integrated with a spacer layer (SM&#8208;polarizer). The dimensions of the SM&#8208;polarizer can be closely replicated using pre&#8208;simulated dimensions via a systematic investigation of thermal nanoimprinting conditions. Spacer thickness is tailored from 40 to 5100&#160;nm by adjusting the concentration of polymeric sulfur solution during spin&#8208;coating. A tailored spacer thickness can maximize TTM in the broadband MWIR region by satisfying Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonance. The SM&#8208;polarizer yields TTM of 0.65, 0.59, and 0.43 and ERs of 3.12 &#215; 103, 5.19 &#215; 103, and 5.81 &#215; 103 at 4&#160;&#956;m for spacer thicknesses of 90, 338, and 572&#160;nm, respectively. This demonstration of a highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective SM&#8208;polarizer opens up exciting avenues for infrared polarimetric imaging and for applications in polarization manipulation.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption via Charge Transfer at the Semiconductor&#8211;Metal Heterointerface&#160;for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which effectively increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2. The interfacial electron transfer can activate the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2, effectively promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics.

Designing and synthesizing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important for realizing the hydrogen economy. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts is essential to achieve optimal HER activity, and interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to induce electron transfer in a heterostructure interface to optimize HER kinetics. In this study, ultrafine RhP2/Rh nanoparticles are synthesized with a well&#8208;defined semiconductor&#8211;metal heterointerface embedded in N,P co&#8208;doped graphene (RhP2/Rh@NPG) via a one&#8208;step pyrolysis. RhP2/Rh@NPG exhibits outstanding HER performances under all pH conditions. Electrochemical characterization and first principles density functional theory calculations reveal that the RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2, thereby accelerating the HER kinetics. Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer activates the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2 in neutral and alkaline environments, thereby promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster HER kinetics.

         <title>Skyrmions Under Control&#8212;FIB Irradiation as a Versatile Tool for Skyrmion Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel way to guide the motion and control the nucleation of skyrmions, magnetic bubbles envisioned for next&#8208;generation spintronic data storage and computation, by means of local ion irradiation, is presented. It is shown that ion irradiation with an optimized dose can create repulsive barriers and even nucleation centers for skyrmions.








Abstract
Magnetic data storage and processing offer certain advances over conventional technologies, amongst which nonvolatility and low power operation are the most outstanding ones. Skyrmions are a promising candidate as a magnetic data carrier. However, the sputtering of skyrmion films and the control of the skyrmion nucleation, motion, and annihilation remains challenging. This work demonstrates&#160;that using optimized focused ion beam irradiation and annealing protocols enables the skyrmion phase in W/CoFeB/MgO thin films to be accessed easily. By analyzing ion&#8208;beam&#8208;engineered skyrmion hosting wires, excited by sub&#8208;100 ns current pulses, possibilities to control skyrmion nucleation, guide their motion, and control their annihilation unfold. Overall, the key elements needed to develop extensive skyrmion networks are presented.

         <title>Tuning surface acidity of mixed conducting electrodes: Recovery of Si&#8208;induced degradation of oxygen exchange rate and area specific resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal oxides are an important class of functional materials, and for many applications, ranging from solid oxide fuel/electrolysis cells, oxygen permeation membranes, and oxygen storage materials to gas sensors (semiconducting and electrolytic) and catalysts, the interaction between the surface and oxygen in the gas phase is central. Ubiquitous Si&#8208;impurities are known to impede this interaction, commonly attributed to the formation of glassy blocking layers on the surface. Here, we examine the surface oxygen exchange coefficient (kchem) of Pr0.1Ce0.9O2&#8208;&#948; (PCO), a model mixed ionic electronic conductor, via electrical conductivity relaxation measurements, and the area&#8208;specific resistance (ASR) by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We demonstrate that even low silica levels, introduced by infiltration, depress kchem by a factor 4,000, while the ASR increases 40&#8208;fold and attribute this to its acidity relative to that of PCO. We further show the ability to fully regenerate the poisoned surface by the subsequent addition of basic Ca&#8208; or Li&#8208;species. This ability to not only recover Si&#8208;poisoned surfaces by tuning the relative surface acidity of an oxide surface, but subsequently outperform the pre&#8208;poisoned response, promises to extend the operating life of materials and devices for which the catalytic oxygen/solid interface reaction is central.

         <title>Recent Progress in Developing a LiOH&#8208;Based Reversible Nonaqueous Lithium&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries is reviewed, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions during cell operation. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered on the identities of the reaction intermediates, locations of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, and the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, which all warrant further investigation.








Abstract
The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2O2. Herein, the progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous LABs is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid&#8208;state, that can activate a LiOH&#8208;based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media.&#160;We&#160;identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2O2&#160;and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalize potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

         <title>Acoustic Crystallization of 2D Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D colloidal self&#8208;assembly provides a simple strategy to produce functional nanostructure arrays. Regularity of the formed 2D crystal is essential to ensure functionality, but can be difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems. The acoustic crystallization of 2D crystals process provides a simple methodology to anneal interfacial colloidal monolayers by periodic extension of the interfacial area, creating long&#8208;range order over macroscopic dimensions.








Abstract
2D colloidal crystallization provides a simple strategy to produce defined nanostructure arrays over macroscopic areas. Regularity and long&#8208;range order of such crystals is essential to ensure functionality, but difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems. Here, a simple loudspeaker setup for the acoustic crystallization of 2D colloidal crystals (ACDC) of polystyrene, microgels, and core&#8211;shell particles at liquid interfaces is introduced. This setup anneals an interfacial colloidal monolayer and affords an increase in average grain size by almost two orders of magnitude. The order is characterized via the structural color of the colloidal crystal, the acoustic annealing process is optimized via the frequency and the amplitude of the applied sound wave, and its efficiency is rationalized via the surface coverage&#8208;dependent interactions within the interfacial colloidal monolayer. Computer simulations show that multiple rearrangement mechanisms at different length scales, from the local motion around voids to grain boundary movements via consecutive particle rotations around common centers, collude to remove defects. The experimentally simple ACDC process, paired with the demonstrated applicability toward complex particle systems, provides access to highly defined nanostructure arrays for a wide range of research communities.

Abstract
Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi&#8208;scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition&#8208;phase structure&#8208;thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag2Q materials are also demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Q-based (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi-scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition-phase structure-thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero-shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Q materials are also demonstrated. Several key problems and challenges are put forward concerning further understanding and optimization of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Q-based thermoelectric chalcogenides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenges of Wafer&#8208;Scale Integration of 2D Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Transistor Circuits</title>

MX2&#8208;based devices for high&#8208;performance circuits are expected to be introduced in production after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET. A stacked&#8208;sheet MX2 device will look like that prepared by process simulation. The status of the process development needed to produce such a device in a fab environment, and the gaps to be overcome are described.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices may find applications as sensor or photonics devices or can be incorporated in the back end of line (BEOL) to provide additional functionality. The introduction of highly scaled 2D&#8208;based circuits for high&#8208;performance logic applications in production is projected to be implemented after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET devices. Here, a view on the requirements needed for full wafer integration of aggressively scaled 2D&#8208;based logic circuits, the status of developments, and the definition of the gaps to be bridged is provided. Today, typical test vehicles for 2D devices are single&#8208;sheet devices fully integrated in a lab environment, but transfer to a more scaled device in a fab environment has been demonstrated. This work reviews the status of the module development, including considerations for setting up fab&#8208;compatible process routes for single&#8208;sheet devices. While further development on key modules is still required, substantial progress is made for MX2 channel growth, high&#8208;k dielectric deposition, and contact engineering. Finally, the process requirements for building ultra&#8208;scaled stacked nanosheets are also reflected on.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Static Random&#8208;Access Memory</title>

         <dc:description>
The optimized two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) static random&#8208;access memory designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet gate&#8208;all&#8208;around structure to 2DMs further improves speed and area density, showing the feasible scaling path beyond the Si technology. The process challenges of 2DM nanosheet field&#8208;effect transistors are also discussed.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WSe2, with adequate bandgaps are promising channel materials for ultrascaled logic transistors. This scalability study of 2D material (2DM)&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM) cells analyzing the impact of layer thickness reveals that the monolayer 2DM FET with superior electrostatics is beneficial for its ability to mitigate the read&#8211;write conflict in an SRAM cell at scaled technology nodes (1&#8211;2.1&#160;nm). Moreover, the monolayer 2DM SRAM exhibits lower cell read access time and write time than the bilayer and trilayer 2DM SRAM cells at fixed leakage power. This simulation predicts that the optimization of 2DM SRAM designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance, mobility, and equivalent oxide thickness leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet (NS) gate&#8208;all&#8208;around (GAA) structure to 2DM further reduces cell read access time and write time and improves the area density of the SRAM cells, demonstrating a feasible scaling path beyond Si technology using 2DM NSFETs. In addition to the device design, the process challenges for 2DM NSFETs, including the cost&#8208;effective stacking of 2DM layers, formation of electrical contacts, suspended 2DM channels, and GAA structures, are also discussed.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide with Increased Entropy for Piezoelectric Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D transition metal dichalcogenide alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, is synthesized to investigate the influence of configurational entropy on the piezoelectrical property. Mo0.46W0.54S2, in which two cations have similar concentrations and the maximum configurational entropy is attained, exhibits the best piezoelectric properties. Combined with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, a ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8722;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x&#160;= 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties, such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8722;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.

         <title>Pass&#8208;Transistor Logic Circuits Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconductors</title>

A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is realized on a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 wafer. Such preliminary integration efforts exhibit a promising future for 2D semiconductors in integrated circuit application.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have attracted tremendous attention in constructing advanced monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) for future flexible and energy&#8208;efficient electronics. However, the development of large&#8208;scale ICs based on 2D materials is still in its early stage, mainly due to the non&#8208;uniformity of the individual devices and little investigation of device and circuit&#8208;level optimization. Herein, a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 film is successfully synthesized, which is then used to fabricate top&#8208;gated (TG) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors with wafer&#8208;scale uniformity. Some basic circuits such as static random access memory and ring oscillators are examined. A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is then employed to design more complex MoS2 logic circuits, which are successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.

A pass-transistor logic configuration based on pseudo-NMOS is then employed to design more complex MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; logic circuits, which are successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer-scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal Deposition on 2D Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.








Abstract
2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here it is shown that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultrathin 2D materials, and it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nanochemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. The results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Precise Layer Control and Electronic State Modulation of a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide via Phase&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth is effective for synthesizing layer&#8208;controlled and electronic&#8208;state&#8208;modulated MoS2 films. The energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy is efficiently converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film on a wafer scale with excellent uniformity. The number of layers is precisely controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer from one to eleven layers, which is applicable in the growth of both intrinsic and heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of transition metal dichalcogenides with precise control over the number of layers, and hence the electronic state is an essential technology for expanding the practical application of 2D materials. Herein, a new growth method, phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth (PTG), is proposed for the precisely controlled growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films consisting of one to eleven layers with spatial uniformity on a 2 in. wafer. In this method, an energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy (a&#8208;MoSxOy) phase is effectively converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film. The number of MoS2 layers is readily controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer by controlling the amount of Mo atoms in a&#8208;MoSxOy, which is also applicable for the growth of heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2. The electronic states of intrinsic and Nb&#8208;inserted MoS2 with one and four layers grown by PTGare are analyzed based on their work functions. The work function of monolayer MoS2 effectively increases with the substitution of Nb for Mo. As the number of layers increases to four, charge screening becomes weaker, dopant ionization becomes easier, and ultimately the work function increases further. Thus, better electronic state modulation is achieved in a thicker layer, and in this respect, PTG has the advantage of enabling precise control over the film thickness.

         <title>Production of Large&#8208;Area Nucleus&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene&#8208;Mesh Metamaterials with Zigzag Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable production approach of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials with zigzag edges is presented. The isotopic labeling approach and the high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization nucleus etching method are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films on a Cu(111) substrate without chemical contamination and physical contact. The findings of this study provide insights for producing resist&#8208;free high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional metamaterial films.








Abstract
In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices. Herein, the controlled production of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films with zigzag edges is demonstrated. The 13C&#8208;isotopic labeling graphene&#8208;growth approach, large&#8208;area Raman mapping techniques, and a uniquely designed high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization etching method are utilized to directly remove the graphene nuclei. Subsequently, a hydrogen&#8208;assisted anisotropic etching process is employed for transforming irregular edges into zigzag edges within the hexagonal&#8208;shaped holes, producing a large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;quality graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial film on a Cu(111) substrate. The carrier mobilities of the fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors on the as&#8208;produced films are measured. The findings of this study enable the large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials and provide insights for the application of integrated circuits based on graphene and other 2D metamaterials.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area transistor circuits are successfully fabricated using solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene as source/drain and gate contact electrodes, wafer&#8208;scale MoS2 film as the channel, and an ultrathin HfO2/Al2O3 layer of about 8&#160;nm as the dielectric layer. The high yield and performance uniformity of the device array indicate great potential for Ti3C2Tx MXene in large&#8208;area ultrathin 2D electronics.








Abstract
It is very challenging to employ solution&#8208;processed conducting films in large&#8208;area ultrathin nanoelectronics. Here, spray&#8208;coated Ti3C2Tx MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS2 transistor circuits. Ti3C2Tx films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as&#8208;prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti3C2Tx film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti3C2Tx film shows a better band alignment for n&#8208;type transport in MoS2 channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS2 film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti3C2Tx surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large&#8208;area array of Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm&#8208;thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative&#8208;channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage&#8208;shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene films in large&#8208;area 2D nanoelectronics.

&lt;/i&gt; MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub-10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistor circuits. Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as-prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; film shows a better band alignment for n-type transport in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large-area array of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; MXene&#8211;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm-thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative-channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage-shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution-processed Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Nonvolatile Logic and Ternary Content&#8208;Addressable Memory Based on Complementary Black Phosphorus and Rhenium Disulfide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;footprint nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide are demonstrated. A logic inverter with a high gain of over 270 and retention of 1000 s with a Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop feature is demonstrated by using only two transistors. Furthermore, a four&#8208;transistor nvTCAM cell with low processing temperature is realized with a high Rratio of &#8776;103.








Abstract
Hardware realization of in&#8208;memory computing for efficient data&#8208;intensive computation is regarded as a promising paradigm beyond the Moore era. However, to realize such functions, the device structure using traditional Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology is complex with a large footprint. 2D material&#8208;based heterostructures have a unique advantage to build versatile logic functions based on novel heterostructures with simplified device footprint and low power. Here, by adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism between a black phosphorus (BP) channel and a phosphorus oxide (POx) layer, a nonvolatile CMOS logic circuit based on 2D BP and rhenium disulfide (ReS2) with a high voltage gain of &#8776;275 is realized with a persistent hysteresis window. A Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop using only two transistors is also demonstrated, with far fewer transistor numbers than the conventional silicon counterpart, which usually requires six transistors. Furthermore, four&#8208;transistor (4T) nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory (nvTCAM) cells are demonstrated with far fewer transistors for parallel data search. The nvTCAM cells exhibit high resistance ratios (Rratio) up to &#8776;103 between match and mismatch states with zero standby power thanks to the nonvolatility of the BP transistors. This back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible nvTCAM shows advantages over other structures with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

         <title>A Reconfigurable Two&#8208;WSe2&#8208;Transistor Synaptic Cell for Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hardware implementation for reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is demonstrated with a unique 2T synaptic cell structure, which realizes the functions of both STDP and anti&#8208;STDP using a simple hardware structure. The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.








Abstract
Reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is a brain&#8208;inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision&#8208;making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward&#8208;modulation process in R&#8208;STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe2 ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n&#8208;type and the other as p&#8208;type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/&#8722;1.23), and large Gmax/Gmin ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti&#8208;)STDP component of 2T cell, R&#8208;STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart&#8211;pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low&#8208;power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area&#8208;efficient (100 &#181;m2) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Power&#8208;Detector Circuits based on MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Wafer&#8208;Scale Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power&#8208;detector circuits are realized based on MoS2 channel transistors fabricated on flexible polyimide substrates. The work compares the DC and radio&#8208;frequency performance of multilayer and monolayer wafer&#8208;scale grown MoS2 for power detection and shows that both materials allow the fabrication of circuits that work at GHz frequencies with excellent dynamic range and responsivity.








Abstract
The design, fabrication, and characterization of wafer&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;bias power detectors based on 2D MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are demonstrated. The MoS2 FETs are fabricated using a wafer&#8208;scale process on 8&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick polyimide film, which, in principle, serves as a flexible substrate. The performances of two chemical vapor deposition MoS2 sheets, grown with different processes and showing different thicknesses, are analyzed and compared from the single device fabrication and characterization steps to the circuit level. The power&#8208;detector prototypes exploit the nonlinearity of the transistors above the cut&#8208;off frequency of the devices. The proposed detectors are designed employing a transistor model based on measurement results. The fabricated circuits operate in the Ku&#8208;band between 12 and 18&#160;GHz, with a demonstrated voltage responsivity of 45&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 18&#160;GHz in the case of monolayer MoS2 and 104&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 16&#160;GHz in the case of multilayer MoS2, both achieved without applied DC bias. They are the best&#8208;performing power detectors fabricated on flexible substrate reported to date. The measured dynamic range exceeds 30&#160;dB, outperforming other semiconductor technologies like silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits and GaAs Schottky diodes.

         <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stackable reservoir is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 with voltage input and output, enabling interdevice cascading and multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated in the deep reservoir architecture, providing a promising pathway for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;Timing&#8208;Based Adaptive Photoencoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent sparse and adaptive photoencoder using an optoelectronic integrated circuit constructed using monolayer MoS2&#8208;based 2D memtransistors is demonstrated. The photoencoder offers an energy&#160;and area efficient in&#8208;sensor encoding solution that can be transformative for the acceleration of spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitutes the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here a medium&#8208;scale integrated circuit composed of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21&#160;memtransistors based on photosensitive 2D&#160;monolayer MoS2&#160;for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information, is introduced. It is shown that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, that is, higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in the photoencoder is exploited for adaptive photoencoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1&#160;&#181;J by the 2D&#8208;memtransistor&#8208;based photoencoder highlights the benefits of in&#8208;sensor and bioinspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

Logic Circuits
Are 2D semiconductors ready for next&#8208;generation IC application? In article number 2202472, Yufeng Xie, Lifeng Bian, Wenzhong Bao, and co&#8208;workers present a wafer&#8208;scale demonstration by circuit&#8208;level fabrication on a 4&#8208;inch MoS2 wafer. While pass&#8208;transistor configuration is more like an expedient to build logic circuits based on n&#8208;type MoS2, future development should add complementary p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors to realize more complex ICs.

Memory Cells
In article number 2106321, Yanqing Wu and co&#8208;workers report the smaller footprint of nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide transistors. By adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism, four&#8208;transistor nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory cells are realized for parallel search operations with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the employment of graphene in microwave circuits is presented. The review starts with methods of the growth and transfer of graphene followed by different graphene&#8208;based devices. Thenceforth, exploiting these devices in different circuits is discussed. Finally, a perspective on the potential of graphene for enabling applications beyond the capabilities of classic semiconductors concludes this review.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, research on 2D materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high&#8208;frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility. Here, the research about the employment of graphene in micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits is reviewed. The review starts with the different methodologies to grow and transfer graphene, before discussing the way graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (GFETs) and diodes are built. A review on different approaches for realizing these devices is provided before discussing the employment of both GFETs and graphene diodes in different micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits, showing the possibilities but also the limitations of this 2D material for high&#8208;frequency applications.

         <title>Perspective of 2D Integrated Electronic Circuits: Scientific Pipe Dream or Disruptive Technology?</title>

2D field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (FETs) are affected by time&#8208;dependent changes in their performance, which must be minimized for industrial&#8208;scale applications. In this work, the stability of circuits based on 2D transistors is evaluated. The results suggest that the performance parameters of certain material combinations for 2D FETs are already close to Si technologies. Furthermore, parameter variability criteria are formulated to evaluate the future development of 2D technologies.








Abstract
Within the last decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating transistors utilizing 2D semiconductors. Also, small circuits consisting of a few transistors have been demonstrated, including inverters, ring oscillators, and static random access memory cells. However, for industrial applications, both time&#8208;zero and time&#8208;dependent variability in the performance of the transistors appear critical. While time&#8208;zero variability is primarily related to immature processing, time&#8208;dependent drifts are dominated by charge trapping at defects located at the channel/insulator interface and in the insulator itself, which can substantially degrade the stability of circuits. At the current state of the art, 2D transistors typically exhibit a few orders of magnitude higher trap densities than silicon devices, which considerably increases their time&#8208;dependent variability, resulting in stability and yield issues. Here, the stability of currently available 2D electronics is carefully evaluated using circuit simulations to determine the impact of transistor&#8208;related issues on the overall circuit performance. The results suggest that while the performance parameters of transistors based on certain material combinations are already getting close to being competitive with Si technologies, a reduction in variability and defect densities is required. Overall, the criteria for parameter variability serve as guidance for evaluating the future development of 2D technologies.

     alt="Perspective of 2D Integrated Electronic Circuits: Scientific Pipe Dream or Disruptive Technology?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D field-effect-transistors (FETs) are affected by time-dependent changes in their performance, which must be minimized for industrial-scale applications. In this work, the stability of circuits based on 2D transistors is evaluated. The results suggest that the performance parameters of certain material combinations for 2D FETs are already close to Si technologies. Furthermore, parameter variability criteria are formulated to evaluate the future development of 2D technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the last decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating transistors utilizing 2D semiconductors. Also, small circuits consisting of a few transistors have been demonstrated, including inverters, ring oscillators, and static random access memory cells. However, for industrial applications, both time-zero and time-dependent variability in the performance of the transistors appear critical. While time-zero variability is primarily related to immature processing, time-dependent drifts are dominated by charge trapping at defects located at the channel/insulator interface and in the insulator itself, which can substantially degrade the stability of circuits. At the current state of the art, 2D transistors typically exhibit a few orders of magnitude higher trap densities than silicon devices, which considerably increases their time-dependent variability, resulting in stability and yield issues. Here, the stability of currently available 2D electronics is carefully evaluated using circuit simulations to determine the impact of transistor-related issues on the overall circuit performance. The results suggest that while the performance parameters of transistors based on certain material combinations are already getting close to being competitive with Si technologies, a reduction in variability and defect densities is required. Overall, the criteria for parameter variability serve as guidance for evaluating the future development of 2D technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The developments of circuit&#8208;level memory technologies and in&#8208;memory computing applications realized experimentally using 2D materials are reviewed. Reports on large&#8208;scale material synthesis methods, circuits with different levels of integration, logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory, and neuromorphic computing applications are systematically summarized. Major challenges and perspectives of large&#8208;scale 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory are provided.








Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging 2D materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances and low power consumption, as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices are discussed. Reports on 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory, static random&#8208;access memory, and flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to 3D monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, mostly on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory are reviewed, and perspectives on possible approaches toward a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication are also given, hopefully shedding some light on future research.

         <title>The Trend of 2D Transistors toward Integrated Circuits: Scaling Down and New Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials show great potential to enable the transistor scaling down below 1&#160;nm node. This review focuses on the introduction of the optimization of 2D materials&#8208;based transistor, new mechanisms, design flow, and circuits, which indicate the trend of 2D transistors toward very large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.








Abstract
2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS2, have recently attracted considerable research interest in the context of their use in ultrascaled devices owing to their excellent electronic properties. Microprocessors and neural network circuits based on MoS2 have been developed at a large scale but still do not have an advantage over silicon in terms of their integrated density. In this study, the current structures, contact engineering, and doping methods for 2D TMDC materials for the scaling&#8208;down process and performance optimization are reviewed. Devices are introduced according to a new mechanism to provide the comprehensive prospects for the use of MoS2 beyond the traditional complementary&#8211;metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor in order to summarize obstacles to the goal of developing high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, prospects for the use of MoS2 in large&#8208;scale ICs from the perspectives of the material, system performance, and application to nonlogic functionalities such as sensor circuits and analogous circuits, are briefly analyzed. The latter issue is along the direction of &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; research.

         <title>Progress and Challenges for Memtransistors in Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems</title>

Recent progress and ongoing challenges for memtransistors are reviewed in the context of neuromorphic computing in solid&#8208;state circuits and systems. Gate&#8208;tunable learning and bio&#8208;realistic functions in multi&#8208;terminal synaptic devices are compared for memtransistors and related floating gate and ferroelectric memories, suggesting opportunities for new architectures that are suitable as hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence algorithms.








Abstract
Due to the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI), significant recent effort has been devoted to the development of neuromorphic circuits that seek to emulate the energy&#8208;efficient information processing of the brain. While non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) based on resistive switches, phase&#8208;change memory, and magnetic tunnel junctions has shown potential for implementing neural networks, additional multi&#8208;terminal device concepts are required for more sophisticated bio&#8208;realistic functions. Of particular interest are memtransistors based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, which are capable of electrostatically tuning memory and learning behavior at the device level. Herein, a conceptual overview of the memtransistor is provided in the context of neuromorphic circuits. Recent progress is surveyed for memtransistors and related multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices including dual&#8208;gated floating&#8208;gate memories, dual&#8208;gated ferroelectric transistors, and dual&#8208;gated van der Waals heterojunctions. The different materials systems and device architectures are classified based on the degree of control and relative tunability of synaptic behavior, with an emphasis on device concepts that harness the reduced dimensionality, weak electrostatic screening, and phase&#8208;changes properties of nanomaterials. Finally, strategies for achieving wafer&#8208;scale integration of memtransistors and multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices are delineated, with specific attention given to the materials challenges for practical neuromorphic circuits.

         <title>The Road for 2D Semiconductors in the Silicon Age</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon technologies, including 2D logic and memory devices, enabling the mitigation of challenges related to silicon integrated circuits (ICs) and even the creation of technologies beyond silicon, is highlighted. The progress of 2D IC applications and the prospects for realizing wafer&#8208;scale heterogeneous integration compatible with silicon ICs are also summarized.








Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's law approaches physical limits, high&#8208;performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultrathin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon&#8208;compatible processes of 2D materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. Here, the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture, is presented, and the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs are discussed. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one perception, memory, and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer&#8208;scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon are presented.

         <title>Integrated Memory Devices Based on 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in emerging 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory devices are reviewed in terms of working principles, device architectures, array integration, and specific brain&#8208;inspired applications. Future challenges and promising research lines toward reliable, practical neuromorphic computing chips are highlighted.








Abstract
With the advent of the Internet of Things and big data, massive data must be rapidly processed and stored within a short timeframe. This imposes stringent requirements on memory hardware implementation in terms of operation speed, energy consumption, and integration density. To fulfill these demands, 2D materials, which are excellent electronic building blocks, provide numerous possibilities for developing advanced memory device arrays with high performance, smart computing architectures, and desirable downscaling. Over the past few years, 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory&#8208;device arrays with different working mechanisms, including defects, filaments, charges, ferroelectricity, and spins, have been increasingly developed. These arrays can be used to implement brain&#8208;inspired computing or sensing with extraordinary performance, architectures, and functionalities. Here, recent research into integrated, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memory devices made from 2D materials, as well as their implications for brain&#8208;inspired computing are surveyed. The existing challenges at the array level are discussed, and the scope for future research is presented.

         <title>Compact Modeling Technology for the Simulation of Integrated Circuits Based on Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress made toward the development of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors under DC, transient, AC, and noise analysis, is reported. This includes non&#8208;idealities such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, traps&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi&#8208;static&#8208;effects.

Abstract
The progress made toward the definition of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) that enables the electrical analysis of arbitrary GFET&#8208;based integrated circuits is reported. A set of primary models embracing the main physical principles defines the ideal GFET response under DC, transient (time domain), AC (frequency domain), and noise (frequency domain) analysis. Another set of secondary models accounts for the GFET non&#8208;idealities, such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, trapping/detrapping&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi static&#8208;effects, which can have a significant impact under static and/or dynamic operation. At both device and circuit levels, significant consistency is demonstrated between the simulation output and experimental data for relevant operating conditions. Additionally, a perspective of the challenges during the scale up of the GFET modeling technology toward higher technology readiness levels while drawing a collaborative scenario among fabrication technology groups, modeling groups, and circuit designers, is provided.

         <title>High Entropy Approach to Engineer Strongly Correlated Functionalities in Manganites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a new approach to materials design based on the inherent magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneities present in high entropy (HE) materials to manipulate and enhance strongly correlated functionalities in oxide systems. In this case study, substantial degree of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and unique lattice imperfections are observed in charge&#8208;doped HE&#8208;manganites.








Abstract
Technologically relevant strongly correlated phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and metal&#8208;insulator transitions (MIT) exhibited by perovskite manganites are driven and enhanced by the coexistence of multiple competing magneto&#8208;electronic phases. Such magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneity is governed by the intrinsic lattice&#8208;charge&#8208;spin&#8208;orbital correlations, which, in turn, are conventionally tailored in manganites via chemical substitution, charge doping, or strain engineering. Alternately, the recently discovered high entropy oxides (HEOs), owing to the presence of multiple&#8208;principal cations on a given sub&#8208;lattice, exhibit indications of an inherent magneto&#8208;electronic phase separation encapsulated in a single crystallographic phase. Here, the high entropy (HE) concept is combined with standard property control by hole doping in a series of single&#8208;phase orthorhombic HE&#8208;manganites (HE&#8208;Mn), (Gd0.25La0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)1&#8208;xSrxMnO3 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.5). High&#8208;resolution transmission microscopy reveals hitherto&#8208;unknown lattice imperfections in HEOs: twins, stacking faults, and missing planes. Magnetometry and electrical measurements infer three distinct ground states&#8212;insulating antiferromagnetic, unpercolated metallic ferromagnetic, and long&#8208;range metallic ferromagnetic&#8212;coexisting or/and competing as a result of hole doping and multi&#8208;cation complexity. Consequently, CMR &#8776;1550% stemming from an MIT is observed in polycrystalline pellets, matching the best&#8208;known values for bulk conventional manganites. Hence, this initial case study highlights the potential for a synergetic development of strongly correlated oxides offered by the high entropy design approach.

         <title>Complex Oxides for Brain&#8208;Inspired Computing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computers inspired by the brain offer the exciting prospect of energy efficiency. Complex oxides can serve as building blocks for brain&#8208;inspired computing owing to their adaptive electronic structure and high sensitivity to environmental stimuli.








Abstract
The fields of brain&#8208;inspired computing, robotics, and, more broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) seek to implement knowledge gleaned from the natural world into human&#8208;designed electronics and machines. In this review, the opportunities presented by complex oxides, a class of electronic ceramic materials whose properties can be elegantly tuned by doping, electron interactions, and a variety of external stimuli near room temperature, are discussed. The review begins with a discussion of natural intelligence at the elementary level in the nervous system, followed by collective intelligence and learning at the animal colony level mediated by social interactions. An important aspect highlighted is the vast spatial and temporal scales involved in learning and memory. The focus then turns to collective phenomena, such as metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions (MITs), ferroelectricity, and related examples, to highlight recent demonstrations of artificial neurons, synapses, and circuits and their learning. First&#8208;principles theoretical treatments of the electronic structure, and in situ synchrotron spectroscopy of operating devices are then discussed. The implementation of the experimental characteristics into neural networks and algorithm design is then revewed. Finally, outstanding materials challenges that require a microscopic understanding of the physical mechanisms, which will be essential for advancing the frontiers of neuromorphic computing, are highlighted.

         <title>Advances in Biodegradable Electronic Skin: Material Progress and Recent Applications in Sensing, Robotics, and Human&#8211;Machine Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developments of biodegradable electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) have attracted considerable attention for successful application in wearable biosensors, artificial intelligence, physiological signal monitoring, robotics, and prosthetics. Progress in materials and various strategies for performance improvement of biodegradable e&#8208;skins and flexible electronics are comprehensively described. The most recent research advances, current challenges, and future perspectives are also outlined and extrapolated to future applications.








Abstract
The rapid growth of the electronics industry and proliferation of electronic materials and telecommunications technologies has led to the release of a massive amount of untreated electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) into the environment. Consequently, catastrophic environmental damage at the microbiome level and serious human health diseases threaten the natural fate of the planet. Currently, the demand for wearable electronics for applications in personalized medicine, electronic skins (e&#8208;skins), and health monitoring is substantial and growing. Therefore, &#8220;green&#8221; characteristics such as biodegradability, self&#8208;healing, and biocompatibility ensure the future application of wearable electronics and e&#8208;skins in biomedical engineering and bioanalytical sciences. Leveraging the biodegradability, sustainability, and biocompatibility of natural materials will dramatically influence the fabrication of environmentally friendly e&#8208;skins and wearable electronics. Here, the molecular and structural characteristics of biological skins and artificial e&#8208;skins are discussed. The focus then turns to the biodegradable materials, including natural and synthetic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based materials, and their recent applications in the development of biodegradable e&#8208;skin in wearable sensors, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces (HMIs). Finally, the main challenges and outlook regarding the preparation and application of biodegradable e&#8208;skins are critically discussed in a near&#8208;future scenario, which is expected to lead to the next generation of biodegradable e&#8208;skins.

         <title>Ultrafast Non&#8208;Equilibrium Synthesis of Cathode Materials for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast high&#8208;temperature shock strategy is proposed to synthesize cathode materials in seconds for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, avoiding high energy and long time consumption. It provides an ultrahigh heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics. Mainstream cathode materials are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultrasmall particle sizes, and good electrochemical performance, indicative of a universal and efficient synthesis approach.








Abstract
The synthesis of cathode materials plays an important role in determining the production efficiency, cost, and performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, conventional synthesis methods always experience a slow heating rate and involve a complicated multistep reaction process and sluggish reaction dynamics, leading to high energy and long time consumption. Herein, a high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) strategy is reported for the ultrafast synthesis of cathode materials in seconds. The HTS process experiences an ultrahigh heating rate, leading to a non&#8208;equilibrium reaction and fast reaction kinetics, and avoids high energy and long time consumption. Mainstream cathode materials (such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and Li&#8208;rich layered oxide/NiO heterostructured material) are successfully synthesized with pure phases, oxygen vacancies, ultrasmall particle sizes, and good electrochemical performance. The HTS process not only provides an efficient synthesis approach for cathode materials, but also can be extended beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Tethered Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors Simultaneously Enhance the Efficiency and Stability of Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamic relaxation of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in its blend with polymer donor raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of polymer solar cells. With flexible spacers to restrict the motion of individual SMAs, the tethered SMAs show higher efficiency, and, most important, large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains.








Abstract
For polymer solar cells (PSCs), the mixture of polymer donors and small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) is fine&#8208;tuned to realize a favorable kinetically trapped morphology and thus a commercially viable device efficiency. However, the thermodynamic relaxation of the mixed domains within the blend raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of the devices, especially in the record&#8208;holding Y&#8208;series SMAs. Here, a new class of dimeric Y6&#8208;based SMAs tethered with differential flexible spacers is reported to regulate their aggregation and relaxation behavior. In their polymer blends with PM6, it is found that they favor an improved structural order relative to that of Y6 counterpart. Most importantly, the tethered SMAs show large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains. For the high&#8208;performing dimeric blend, an unprecedented open circuit voltage of 0.87&#160;V is realized with a conversion efficiency of 17.85%, while those of regular Y6&#8208;base devices only reach 0.84&#160;V and 16.93%, respectively. Most importantly, the dimer&#8208;based device possesses substantially reduced burn&#8208;in efficiency loss, retaining more than 80% of the initial efficiency after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 700&#160;h. The tethering approach provides a new direction to develop PSCs with high efficiency and excellent operating stability.

         <title>The Use of Exchange Coupled Atom Qubits as Atomic&#8208;Scale Magnetic Field Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron spin qubits in silicon are shown to serve as magnetic field sensors at the atomic scale. The work presents a novel spectroscopy technique where a pair of exchange&#8208;coupled electron spins on phosphorus qubits in silicon is used to probe the local magnetic fields to determine the exact location of nuclear spins within the silicon chip.








Abstract
Phosphorus atoms in silicon offer a rich quantum computing platform where both nuclear and electron spins can be used to store and process quantum information. While individual control of electron and nuclear spins has been demonstrated, the interplay between them during qubit operations has been largely unexplored. This study investigates the use of exchange&#8208;based operation between donor bound electron spins to probe the local magnetic fields experienced by the qubits with exquisite precision at the atomic scale. To achieve this, coherent exchange oscillations are performed between two electron spin qubits, where the left and right qubits are hosted by three and two phosphorus donors, respectively. The frequency spectrum of exchange oscillations shows quantized changes in the local magnetic fields at the qubit sites, corresponding to the different hyperfine coupling between the electron and each of the qubit&#8208;hosting nuclear spins. This ability to sense the hyperfine fields of individual nuclear spins using the exchange interaction constitutes a unique metrology technique, which reveals the exact crystallographic arrangements of the phosphorus atoms in the silicon crystal for each qubit. The detailed knowledge obtained of the local magnetic environment can then be used to engineer hyperfine fields in multi&#8208;donor qubits for high&#8208;fidelity two&#8208;qubit&#160;gates.

         <title>Suppressing the Loss of Polymer&#8208;Based Dielectrics for High Power Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to suppress the loss of polymer&#8208;based dielectrics has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to attain a high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency in the film capacitors. The theoretical progress, measurement of properties, and development of materials are reviewed. The challenges and opportunities in loss suppression research for the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are proposed.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based dielectrics have received intensive interest from academic community in the field of high&#8208;power energy storage owing to their superior flexibility and fast charge&#8211;discharge ability. Recently, how to suppress the loss of polymer&#8208;based dielectrics has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to attain a high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency in the film capacitors. Some achievements are made in analyzing the source of loss and suppressing loss via Edison's trial and error method. In this review, the significance of suppressing loss in polymer&#8208;based dielectrics is firstly emphasized. Then, different sources of loss are discussed carefully and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the related measurements is presented. Next, recent research results in suppressing loss are summarized and discussed in detail according to different strategies. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in the loss suppression research for the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are proposed.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site cathode is developed by wreathing monolayered MoS2 and Mo1 on sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The constructed atomic level MoS2&#8208;Mo1 with delocalized electron effects facilitates substantial charge transfer and a completely reversible reaction between S and Na, thus alleviating the shuttle effect.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries possess high potential for grid&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the issues arising from the low S mass loading and poor cycling stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously limit their operating capacity and cycling capability. Herein, sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Mo1 (S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF) with a record high sulfur mass loading of 80.9&#160;wt.% are synthesized as an integrated dual active sites cathode for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF display unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000&#160;cycles. Experimental and computational results including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that atomic&#8208;level Mo in this integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.

Impressively, the as-prepared S@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Mo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/SGF display unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low-capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000&#160;cycles. Experimental and computational results including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and density-functional theory calculations reveal that atomic-level Mo in this integrated dual-active-site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance dual-site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Ultrathin Chiral Metasurfaces by Twisted Stacking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple twisted stacking of two layers of nanomaterials can produce ultrathin planarized nanostructures with optical chirality. This review thoroughly examines the recent progress in ultrathin chiroptical metasurfaces prepared through chiral stacking, discussing the monolayer materials, fabrication strategies, and the induced circular dichroism. A special focus is placed on the flexible tunability of the chiroptical responses and relevant optical applications.








Abstract
Artificial chiral nanostructures have been subjected to extensive research for their unique chiroptical activities. Planarized chiral films of ultrathin thicknesses are in particular demand for easy on&#8208;chip integration and improved energy efficiency as polarization&#8208;sensitive metadevices. Recently, controlled twisted stacking of two or more layers of nanomaterials, such as 2D van der Waals materials, ultrathin films, or traditional metasurfaces, at an angle has emerged as a general strategy to introduce optical chirality into achiral solid&#8208;state systems. This method endows new degrees of freedom, e.g., the interlayer twist angle, to flexibly engineer and tune the chiroptical responses without having to change the material or the design, thus greatly facilitating the development of multifunctional metamaterials. In this review, recent exciting progress in planar chiral metasurfaces are summarized and discussed from the viewpoints of building blocks, fabrication methods, as well as circular dichroism and modulation thereof in twisted stacked nanostructures. The review further highlights the ever&#8208;growing portfolio of applications of these chiral metasurfaces, including polarization conversion, information encryption, chiral sensing, and as an engineering platform for hybrid metadevices. Finally, forward&#8208;looking prospects are provided.

         <title>Harnessing the Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition of VO2 in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
VO2 manifests a remarkable metal&#8211;insulator transition that affords the nonlinear, dynamical response needed to emulate the function of biological neurons and synapses. Neuromorphic function is tunable through site&#8208;selective modification, stress, tuning of interfaces, and modification of external circuit elements. Strategies for modulating transformation characteristics are reviewed and inverse design approaches across decades of length and time scales are outlined.








Abstract
Future&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing seeks to overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures by colocating logic and memory functions, thereby emulating the function of neurons and synapses in the human brain. Despite remarkable demonstrations of high&#8208;fidelity neuronal emulation, the predictive design of neuromorphic circuits starting from knowledge of material transformations remains challenging. VO2 is an attractive candidate since it manifests a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature, discontinuous, and hysteretic metal&#8211;insulator transition. The transition provides a nonlinear dynamical response to input signals, as needed to construct neuronal circuit elements. Strategies for tuning the transformation characteristics of VO2 based on modification of material properties, interfacial structure, and field couplings, are discussed. Dynamical modulation of transformation characteristics through in situ processing is discussed as a means of imbuing synaptic function. Mechanistic understanding of site&#8208;selective modification; external, epitaxial, and chemical strain; defect dynamics; and interfacial field coupling in modifying local atomistic structure, the implications therein for electronic structure, and ultimately, the tuning of transformation characteristics, is emphasized. Opportunities are highlighted for inverse design and for using design principles related to thermodynamics and kinetics of electronic transitions learned from VO2 to inform the design of new Mott materials, as well as to go beyond energy&#8208;efficient computation to manifest intelligence.

         <title>Fabrication and Functionality Integration Technologies for Small&#8208;Scale Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale soft robots have immense potential at present and in the foreseeable future, with utility in exploration, medical, and biomimetic applications, among others. Being enabling technologies, here, the fabrication and integration techniques of small&#8208;scale soft robots are systematically reviewed. By discussing the challenges and opportunities, potential directions for the further development of small&#8208;scale soft robots are highlighted.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale soft robots are attracting increasing interest for visible and potential applications owing to their safety and tolerance resulting from their intrinsic soft bodies or compliant structures. However, it is not sufficient that the soft bodies merely provide support or system protection. More importantly, to meet the increasing demands of controllable operation and real&#8208;time feedback in unstructured/complicated scenarios, these robots are required to perform simplex and multimodal functionalities for sensing, communicating, and interacting with external environments during large or dynamic deformation with the risk of mismatch or delamination. Challenges are encountered during fabrication and integration, including the selection and fabrication of composite/materials and structures, integration of active/passive functional modules with robust interfaces, particularly with highly deformable soft/stretchable bodies. Here, methods and strategies of fabricating structural soft bodies and integrating them with functional modules for developing small&#8208;scale soft robots are investigated. Utilizing templating, 3D printing, transfer printing, and swelling, small&#8208;scale soft robots can be endowed with several perceptual capabilities corresponding to diverse stimulus, such as light, heat, magnetism, and force. The integration of sensing and functionalities effectively enhances the agility, adaptability, and universality of soft robots when applied in various fields, including smart manufacturing, medical surgery, biomimetics, and other interdisciplinary sciences.

         <title>Fast Transport and Transformation of Biomacromolecular Substances via Thermo&#8208;Stimulated Active &#8220;Inhalation&#8211;Exhalation&#8221; Cycles of Hierarchically Structured Smart pNIPAM&#8211;DNA Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the respiration systems of organisms, highly efficient transport and transformation of biomacromolecular substances are achieved through the thermo&#8208;stimulated active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles of hierarchically structured smart DNA hydrogels. The application of active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles in the poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)&#8211;DNA hydrogels improves the catalytic efficiency of the incorporated DNAzyme or CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a systems by up to 280% or 390%, respectively.








Abstract
Although smart hydrogels hold great promise in biosensing and biomedical applications, their response to external stimuli is governed by the passive diffusion&#8208;dependent substance transport between hydrogels and environments and within the 3D hydrogel matrices, resulting in slow response to biomacromolecules and limiting their extensive applications. Herein, inspired by the respiration systems of organisms, an active strategy to achieve highly efficient biomolecular substance transport through the thermo&#8208;stimulated &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles of hydrogel matrices is demonstrated. The cryo&#8208;structured poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM)&#8211;DNA hydrogels, composed of functional DNA&#8208;tethered pNIPAM networks and free&#8208;water&#8208;containing macroporous channels, exhibit thermally triggered fast and reversible shrinking/swelling cycles with high&#8208;volume changes, which drive the formation of dynamic water stream to accelerate the intake of external substances and expelling of endogenous substances, thus promoting the functional properties of hydrogel systems. Demonstrated by catalytic DNAzyme and CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;incorporating hydrogels, significantly enhanced catalytic efficiency with up to 280% and 390% is achieved, upon the introduction of active &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles, respectively. Moreover, remotely near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;triggering of &#8220;inhalation&#8211;exhalation&#8221; cycles is achieved after the introduction of NIR&#8208;responsive MXene nanosheets into the hydrogel matrix. These hydrogel systems with enhanced substance transport and transformation properties hold promise in the development of more effective biosensing and therapeutic systems.

         <title>A MoS2 Hafnium Oxide Based Ferroelectric Encoder for Temporal&#8208;Efficient Spiking Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temporal&#8208;efficient noise&#8208;resilient ferroelectric encoder, exploiting the time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike encoding scheme, is proposed for information preprocessing in spiking neural networks.&#160;Our&#160;device manifests prominent ferroelectric dynamics, showing an excellent classification accuracy of 95.14%, in addition to resilience against noise attacks. This work manifests the potential to enable spike&#8208;driven computations for energy&#8208;efficient machine learning and artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Spiking neural network (SNN), where the information is evaluated recurrently through spikes, has manifested significant promises to minimize the energy expenditure in data&#8208;intensive machine learning and artificial intelligence. Among these applications, the artificial neural encoders are essential to convert the external stimuli to a spiking format that can be subsequently fed to the neural network. Here, a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hafnium oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric encoder is demonstrated for temporal&#8208;efficient information processing in SNN. The fast domain switching attribute associated with the polycrystalline nature of hafnium oxide&#8208;based ferroelectric material is exploited for spike encoding, rendering it suitable for realizing biomimetic encoders. Accordingly, a high&#8208;performance ferroelectric encoder is achieved, featuring a superior switching efficiency, negligible charge trapping effect, and robust ferroelectric response, which successfully enable a broad dynamic range. Furthermore, an SNN is simulated to verify the precision of the encoded information, in which an average inference accuracy of 95.14% can be achieved, using the Modified National Insitute of Standards and Technology&#160;(MNIST) dataset for digit classification. Moreover, this ferroelectric encoder manifests prominent resilience against noise injection with an overall prediction accuracy of 94.73% under various Gaussian noise levels, showing practical promises to reduce the computational load for the neural network.

         <title>In Situ Confinement of Ultrasmall Metal Nanoparticles in Short Mesochannels for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal in situ confinement strategy is developed to synthesize ultrasmall metal nanoparticles in the mesochannels of 1D mesoporous carbon. The obtained catalysts show an impressive electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction performance with nearly 100% conversion efficiency, 98% N2&#160;selectivity, 55% current efficiency, an ultralong cycling stability over 30&#160;days, and an ultrahigh removal capacity of 15&#8201;000&#160;mg&#160;N&#160;g&#8722;1 CuPd.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction is a sustainable approach for NO3&#8722; removal and high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing compounds manufacturing, which, however, is strongly obstructed by sluggish kinetics, low selectivity, and poor stability. Herein, the in situ confinement of ultrasmall CuPd alloy nanoparticles in mesochannels of conductive core&#8211;shell structured carbon nanotubes@mesoporous carbon substrates (CNTs@mesoC@CuPd) via a simple molecule&#8208;mediated interfacial assembly method is reported. As a catalyst for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction, the CNTs@mesoC@CuPd shows a splendid conversion efficiency (100%), N2&#160;selectivity (98%), cycling stability (&gt;30&#160;days), and removal capacity as high as 30&#160;000&#160;mg&#160;N&#160;g&#8722;1 CuPd, which are much superior to most of the prior reports. Notably, experimental (in situ testing and isotopic labeling) and theoretical results unveil that bimetallic and monometallic catalysts for electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction exhibit exclusive selectivity for N2&#160;and NH3, respectively. This in situ confinement strategy is universal for the synthesis of stable and highly accessible metallic catalysts, which opens an appealing way to synthesize advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability.

         <title>Triggering ZT to 0.40 by Engineering Orientation in One Polymeric Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimodal orientation of diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer films exhibits a figure of merit of 0.40, which is more than 400% superior to the corresponding values of face&#8208;on/edge&#8208;on unimodal films.








Abstract
Breaking the thermoelectric (TE) trade&#8208;off relationship is an important task for maximizing the TE performance of polymeric semiconductors. Existing efforts have focused on designing high&#8208;mobility semiconductors and achieving ordered molecular doping, ignoring the critical role of the molecular orientation during TE conversion. Herein, the achievement of ZT to 0.40 is reported by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular orientation of one diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer (DPP&#8208;BTz). Films with bimodal molecular orientation yield superior doping efficiency by increasing the lamellar spacing and achieve increased splitting between the Fermi energy and the transport energy to enhance the thermopower. These factors contribute to the simultaneous improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity in an unexpected manner. Importantly, the bimodal film exhibits a maximum power factor of up to 346 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, &gt;400% higher than that of unimodal films. These results demonstrate the great potential of molecular orientation engineering in polymeric semiconductors for developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic TE (OTE) materials.
