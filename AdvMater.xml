         <title>Bioactive Materials&#8208;Mediated Regulation of Bone Marrow Microenvironment: Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in biomaterials that regulate the bone marrow microenvironment (encompassing osteocytes, stem cells, immune cells, nerves, and blood vessels). It introduces the action mechanisms of various materials and the limitations of current research, while outlining the development potential of biomaterials and their transformative impacts on medical paradigms.








Abstract
The bone marrow microenvironment(BME) maintains bone homeostasis through multi&#8208;cellular cooperation and signal crosstalk, its&#160;dysregulation drives&#160;pathological bone&#160;loss. In recent years, Materiobiology, a scientific discipline studying how biomaterial properties affect biological functions, has opened new avenues for the precise regulation of this complex microenvironment. Biomaterials enable sophisticated regulation of the BME through biomimetic design and functionalization strategies. They not only activate osteoblast signaling pathways to promote bone formation but also inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption functions. Additionally, they integrate nerve and vascular regeneration processes with immunomodulatory mechanisms to optimize stem cell behavior and improve the tissue repair microenvironment. This review comprehensively summarizes advances in biomaterial&#8208;mediated BME regulation, emphasizing interdisciplinary integration and intelligent material development to overcome the limitations of conventional therapies. The innovation of intelligent materials lies in their ability to mimic biological systems. Recent research has leveraged generative design models to engineer new thiol&#8208;containing antimicrobial peptides. These approaches achieve spatiotemporal coordination of cellular interactions and functional reconstruction during bone regeneration. Future efforts need to address challenges in material stability, personalized adaptation, and clinical translation, promoting cross&#8208;scale therapeutic innovation from molecular intervention to tissue regeneration, providing revolutionary solutions for bone metabolic diseases and complex defect repair.

At the beginning, the luminescence mechanism of inorganic phosphors, covering photoluminescence (downconversion, upconversion, and long persistent luminescence) and mechanoluminescence, as well as their recent research trends, is elaborated on the diversity of phosphor luminescence characteristics and the achievements of cutting&#8208;edge exploration. Afterward, this review further delves into the preparation methods of PDMS films, laying a technological foundation for the innovative applications of photoluminescent films in display technology, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, message encryption, and flexible optical temperature sensors, as well as the mechanoluminescent films for biomedical/biomechanical testing and stress sensing technology. Eventually, the present challenges and future prospects are discussed to advance their potential in real&#8208;world applications. This review is expected to inspire experts in the field to break through bottlenecks and expand the new frontiers of applications of inorganic oxide phosphors&#8208;PDMS composite films.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based ROS&#8208;Regulating Strategy: Reprogramming the Oxidative Stress Imbalance in Advanced Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically explores the critical role of ROS in diabetic wound progression and highlights advanced hydrogel&#8208;based strategies for smart spatiotemporal ROS modulation. It discusses how engineered hydrogels respond to internal or external stimuli to resolve infection, oxidative stress, inhibit inflammation, and promote vascularization, neural and cutaneous appendages repair, offering innovative solutions for diabetic wound therapy.








Abstract
Due to hyperglycemia and redox imbalance, diabetic wounds are prone to recurrent ulceration and non&#8208;healing, severely affecting patients' quality of life. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in wounds impede repair by damaging proteins and nucleic acids, activating inflammation, and suppressing immunity. A growing body of evidence suggests that harnessing the high oxidative stress within the microenvironment and modulating ROS levels to overcome repair barriers has become a breakthrough in treating chronic diabetic wounds. Hydrogels, with excellent biocompatibility and designability, are key for intelligent ROS regulation. Here, the role of ROS in the progression of diabetic skin wounds is detailed, which includes inducing oxidative damage, exacerbating inflammation and immune imbalance, as well as degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM), hindering neovascularization, and inhibiting nerve repair. Then, the ROS&#8208;regulating strategy based on the hydrogel platform is discussed. Engineered hydrogels adjust ROS levels via external stimulus such as light, ultrasound, and electricity, or the microenvironment of hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and acidity in wounds, and even bidirectionally in specific spatiotemporal contexts. Furthermore, the therapeutic and repair potential of ROS&#8208;regulated hydrogels in the healing process of diabetic wounds is outlined, the current deficiencies in the field of diabetic wounds treatment are addressed, and prospects for the future are proposed.

         <title>Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticle&#8208;Immobilized Macrophage&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicle Nanohybrid Facilitates Diabetic Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomineralization, a calcium phosphate nanoparticle&#8208;immobilized macrophage&#8208;derived extracellular vesicle nanohybrid (M2EV@CaP) is developed through in situ crystallization on the vesicle surface. This strategy stabilizes vesicles and enables pH&#8208;responsive release of calcium, phosphorus, and bioactive components, promoting M2 macrophage polarization and osteogenesis under high&#8208;glucose inflammatory conditions. Hydrogel&#8208;assisted M2EV@CaP delivery significantly enhances bone regeneration via synergistic immunomodulation and osteoinduction.








Abstract
Diabetes significantly hinders bone regeneration, and existing tissue engineering therapies struggle to improve the hyperglycemia&#8208;induced inflammatory microenvironment, resulting in unbalanced bone remodeling. M2&#8208;macrophage&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (M2EVs) possess inherent immunomodulatory properties and promote stem cell differentiation; however, their therapeutic potential in diabetic bone regeneration is significantly limited by poor stability and insufficient osteoinductive capacity. Inspired by biomineralization, a calcium phosphate nanoparticle&#8208;immobilized macrophage&#8208;derived small extracellular vesicle nanohybrid (M2EV@CaP) is developed by in situ growth of inorganic nanocrystals on M2EV surfaces. In the nanohybrid system, the chemically inert CaP&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;reinforced shell provides structural protection for M2EV, inhibiting vesicle aggregation caused by membrane protein denaturation/cross&#8208;linking or lipid phase transition through physical barrier. More importantly, M2EV@CaP provides bioavailable calcium/phosphorus ion reservoirs and signaling molecules for bone regeneration and releases responsively under inflammation&#8208;induced acidic conditions. In vitro, M2EV@CaP significantly enhances macrophage polarization toward a reparative M2 phenotype, and promotes stem cell osteogenic differentiation under high&#8208;glucose inflammatory conditions by activating the Ca2+&#8211;Akt signaling axis. In vivo, hydrogel&#8208;assisted delivery of M2EV@CaP significantly promotes bone regeneration in diabetic rat calvarial defects through immunomodulation and osteoinduction. This study proposes a nanohybridization strategy based on inorganic nanoparticles reinforcing biostructures, offering a promising extracellular vesicle therapy for complex pathological conditions.

         <title>Deciphering the Quantitative Relationship Between the Photocatalytic Activity and the Built&#8208;In Electric Field of Heterojunction</title>

Existence of the linear dependence between BIEF intensity and photocatalytic activity for heterojunction photocatalyst.








Abstract
The principle of heterojunction in physics has been extensively referenced in heterogeneous photocatalysis, but it appears to have been utilized qualitatively more as a concept than as a method. The reason is that the quantitative correlation between the intensity of the built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) and photocatalytic activity has not been established, primarily due to the challenges in directly measuring the BIEF of nanosized photocatalysts. To address this, both powder&#8208;type and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;type SiC@WO3&#8208;x&#8208;T heterostructures are prepared to quantitatively investigate the dependence of photocatalytic CO2 reduction activities on BIEF intensity. A strong linear correlation between the effective photoelectron number (NEPN) for CO2 reduction and the BIEF intensity is revealed for the first time. Specifically, NEPN increases by 0.25 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 when Vbi (built&#8208;in potential) increases by 1 kV for the powder sample. In contrast, for the single&#8208;crystal sample, NEPN rises by 0.16 &#181;mol with a 1 kV cm&#8722;1 increase in Ebi (built&#8208;in electric field). This study not only bridges a critical gap in heterojunction photocatalysis research but also demonstrates a method to amplify the built&#8208;in electric field by engineering the interface species, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition Driven by the Interplay of Vacancies and Charge Orders in Square&#8208;Net Materials GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;</title>

Conventional 2D/3D charge density wave (CDW) materials are limited by partial gap opening, typically retain metallic behavior even with Fermi surface nesting. This work reveals a synergistic interplay between CDW and vacancies as a distinct pathway to induce metal&#8211;insulator transition and tunable narrow bandgaps in square&#8208;net material GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;.








Abstract
Engineering narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductors remains a pivotal challenge for next&#8208;generation electronic and energy devices. Charge density wave (CDW) systems offer a promising platform for bandgap engineering. However, most 2D and 3D CDW systems remain metallic despite exhibiting&#160;Fermi surface nesting. Here, a doping&#8208;dependent metal&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) with tunable bandgaps is reported in square&#8208;net materials GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948; and a cooperative interaction between CDWs and vacancies that drives the MIT is discovered. Angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals the MIT in the low Sb&#8208;content regime of GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;, with a maximum energy gap of &#916; &#8776; 98 meV at x = 0.16, corroborated by electrical transport measurements. Following the MIT, X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a doping&#8208;dependent shift of the CDW wavevector toward a commensurate structure with&#160;q = 0.25 a*, concurrent with the appearance of Te vacancies in the square&#8208;net layers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations attribute the gap formation to the ordered Te vacancies modulated by the 4&#215;1&#215;1 CDW superstructure, which suppresses the electronic states near the Fermi level. Contrasting with the partial gap scenarios in conventional CDW systems, this synergy between the CDW and the vacancy stabilizes the insulating phase, offering a distinct avenue for narrow bandgap engineering in electronic materials.

         <title>Advances and Prospects in Multifunctional Composite Fibrous Materials Utilizing Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospinning transforms processability&#8208;limited porous organic polymers (POPs) into versatile fibrous architectures with enhanced mechanical robustness and tunable functionality. By integrating various classes of POPs with advanced electrospinning strategies, the resulting POP&#8208;incorporated fiber materials (POP&#8208;FMs) exhibit controllable nano&#8211;micro morphologies and hierarchical porosity, opening new avenues for catalysis, sensing, environmental remediation, and biomedical applications.








Abstract

Porous organic polymers (POPs) offer exceptional surface area, tunable pore sizes, and versatile chemical functionality, making them attractive for a range of advanced applications. However, their conventional powdered form limits processability, structural integration, and practical deployment. Integrating POPs into fibrous matrices through electrospinning, a scalable and versatile technique for producing nonwoven fibers, helps overcome these limitations and enables the creation of new material architecture. The resulting POP&#8208;incorporated fibrous materials (POP&#8208;FMs) combine the intrinsic advantages of POPs with enhanced mechanical integrity, tailored surface properties, and improved mass transport characteristics. These features expand the potential of POP&#8208;FMs in areas such as catalysis, environmental remediation, sensing, and biomedical fields. This review discusses recent progress in the design and synthesis of electrospinning&#8208;compatible POPs, strategies for fabricating POP&#8208;FM composites, and the structure&#8211;property relationships that govern their performance. Key challenges and future directions are also explored, underscoring the potential of POP&#8208;FMs as next&#8208;generation functional materials.

         <title>Heterogenized Copper(II) Phenanthroline Catalysts for Electroreduction of CO2 to C2 Compounds: Substitution on the Ligand Causes Structural Changes to the Molecular Framework and Stability Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a previously reported binuclear Cu(II) phenanthroline catalyst, a structurally modified version with enhanced stability for electrochemical reduction of CO2 is developed. The second&#8208;generation system allows for stable operation in an MEA electrolyzer with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;70% for C2 products at elevated current densities. In situ XAS spectroscopy provided mechanistic insights.








Abstract
Molecular Cu catalysts have shown promise for electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon products. Unlike metallic Cu facets, they offer precise control over the active site's electronic and steric configuration. However, prior studies identified critical challenges related to irreversible potential&#8208;induced formation of Cu particles, which participate in the eCO2RR and obscure the role of molecular motifs. Based on a previously reported binuclear Cu(II) phenanthroline catalyst, a structurally modified second&#8208;generation system with enhanced stability is developed. By introducing methoxy groups to the phenanthroline ligand, the molecular framework changes from a binuclear complex to an oligonuclear step&#8208;like structure consisting of Cu(II) ions linked by &#181;2&#8208; and &#181;3&#8208;OH groups. When immobilized on a gas diffusion electrode, stable operation with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;70% for C2 products is achieved at elevated current densities. In situ XAS spectroscopy shows only negligible changes of the Cu coordination environment up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. When approaching 250 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, partial and reversible phase evolution occurs under Cu2+ valence state reduction, followed by phase recovery upon bias removal. This system combines structural robustness with adaptive redox behavior, demonstrating a route for implementing molecular electrocatalysts in eCO2RR processes at industrial current densities.

         <title>Neuroimmune Microenvironment Reprogramming via Immuno&#8208;piezoelectric Transducers for Synergistic Stem Cell Therapy in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer is innovatively developed. This device promotes neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation and maturation via ultrasound&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and it amplifies the therapeutic efficacy of NSC in traumatic brain injury (TBI) by modulating the immune microenvironment. This piezoelectric transducer with &#8220;immune&#8208;neuro&#8221; dual&#8208;modulation functions, combined with NSC, provides a new strategy for nerve regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Secondary traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces a pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment that hampers neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy and tissue regeneration. To address this challenge, an immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer have been developed to create an anti&#8208;inflammatory immune microenvironment, deliver wireless electrical stimulation, and facilitate multimodal NSCs therapy. The immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer drives the polarization of microglia towards the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype and secretion of anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. This modulation significantly reduces the inflammatory response, creating an optimal microenvironment for NSCs survival. Furthermore, the wireless electrical stimulation generated by ultrasound facilitates NSCs differentiation into glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, enhances neurite complexity, upregulates synaptic proteins expression and neural integration in injured regions. The multimodal therapy demonstrates superior outcomes in restoring structural integrity, improving functional, and enhancing behavioral action in TBI rat models.

     alt="Neuroimmune Microenvironment Reprogramming via Immuno-piezoelectric Transducers for Synergistic Stem Cell Therapy in Traumatic Brain Injury"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel immuno-piezoelectric transducer is innovatively developed. This device promotes neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation and maturation via ultrasound-induced electrical stimulation and it amplifies the therapeutic efficacy of NSC in traumatic brain injury (TBI) by modulating the immune microenvironment. This piezoelectric transducer with &#8220;immune-neuro&#8221; dual-modulation functions, combined with NSC, provides a new strategy for nerve regeneration and repair.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that hampers neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy and tissue regeneration. To address this challenge, an immuno-piezoelectric transducer have been developed to create an anti-inflammatory immune microenvironment, deliver wireless electrical stimulation, and facilitate multimodal NSCs therapy. The immuno-piezoelectric transducer drives the polarization of microglia towards the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This modulation significantly reduces the inflammatory response, creating an optimal microenvironment for NSCs survival. Furthermore, the wireless electrical stimulation generated by ultrasound facilitates NSCs differentiation into glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, enhances neurite complexity, upregulates synaptic proteins expression and neural integration in injured regions. The multimodal therapy demonstrates superior outcomes in restoring structural integrity, improving functional, and enhancing behavioral action in TBI rat models. This study integrates piezoelectric with immunomodulation to reprogram the neuroimmune microenvironment, providing novel therapeutic paradigm for brain injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Self&#8208;Encrypted Interlock&#8208;Cascade&#8208;Hashing Optical Storage Based on Multicolor Photochromic Lithographic Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing lithography and mask patterning, on&#8208;chip arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of spatiotemporal self&#8208;encrypted optical information storage and interlock&#8208;cascade&#8208;hashing encryption. This work holds significant promise for advancing anti&#8208;cloning and anti&#8208;cracking technologies for high&#8208;value devices, assets, and information.








Abstract
Continuing deve7lopments in artificial intelligence and quantum computing challenge the information security of physical assets and intellectual property. Photochromic materials have emerged as promising candidates for optical encryption and storage applications due to their intrinsic reversible, real&#8208;time light absorption modulation capability. Although all&#8208;inorganic devices exhibit pronounced stability and fatigue resistance, single&#8208;component multicolor photochromic systems remain exceedingly rare. Here, a multicolor photochromic phenomenon is reported in PbMoO4 microcrystal, demonstrating both volatility and non&#8208;volatility through distinct photochromic channels. The input, output, and control signals of this material are all different wavelengths of light, which operate in an all&#8208;optical and non&#8208;destructive manner. Moreover, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state nature of PbMoO4 ensures its stable modulation capability after multiple photoresponse cycles with upconversion luminescence modulation up to 99%. By combining experimental characterizations with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, the mechanisms of each photochromic channel are revealed. Employing lithography and mask patterning, on&#8208;chip arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of spatiotemporal self&#8208;encrypted optical information storage and interlock&#8208;cascade&#8208;hashing encryption. This work holds significant promise for advancing anti&#8208;cloning and anti&#8208;cracking technologies for high&#8208;value devices, assets, and information.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes advances in photocatalyst design and system integration for solar water splitting. Strategies include bandgap engineering, morphology and facet control, heterostructures, cocatalysts, and external fields. System optimization from reactor to panel assembly is discussed. Efficiency and stability factors are analyzed, with future directions proposed for next&#8208;generation photocatalysts and scalable solar hydrogen systems.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis, which converts and stores solar energy as chemical energy, holds immense potential for promoting sustainable development and achieving carbon neutrality. Solar&#8208;driven water splitting offers an ideal method for storing solar energy, with one of the most promising approaches based on efficient particulate photocatalysts. In recent years, significant progress has been made in particulate photocatalyst&#8208;based water splitting systems, from fundamental scientific research to exploratory practical applications. However, to date, no photocatalytic water splitting system has achieved the efficiency required for practical applications. The development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts and optimized photocatalytic systems is urgently needed. This review examines the crucial factors limiting the activity of photocatalysts for overall water splitting and summarizes design strategies to enhance photocatalyst performance and overcome these barriers. The design and modification strategies for high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts are highlighted, including bandgap regulation, localized surface plasmon resonance, morphology control, crystal facet engineering, heterostructures, cocatalysts, and external&#8208;field association. Additionally, the scalability of using particulate photocatalysts for overall water splitting driven by natural sunlight is discussed. Finally, insights into advanced strategies for improving the performance of particulate photocatalysts are provided, and perspectives on the future development of solar water splitting systems for commercial applications are offered.

         <title>Triplet Exciton&#8208;Enhanced Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by Topologically Tuned Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel triplet exciton&#8208;singlet oxygen (1O2) H2O2 photosynthesis pathway is achieved using a topological tuning strategy and demonstrates a reduction in the generation barrier compared to typical electron/hole&#8208;mediated photosynthesis pathways. This work circumvents the limitations of water oxidation reactions and paves the way for future advancements in electro&#8208;, photoelectron&#8208;, organo&#8208;, and environmental catalysis using triplet excitons.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis technology can utilize water, oxygen, and solar energy to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an environmentally friendly oxidant and a clean fuel. However, H2O2 photosynthesis mainly follows photogenerated electrons/holes pathway, which suffers from high thermodynamic barriers and competing reactions. Triplet excitons can spontaneously convert O2 into singlet oxygen (1O2) intermediate and bypass these challenges, but demonstrating its effects on photocatalysis is still scarce. Here, this study designs twist pyrimidine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with excellent triplet exciton production using a topological tuning strategy. The twist configuration modulates the molecular orbital overlap between singlet and triplet states and achieves a 1.8 &#215; 107 enhancement in the intersystem crossing rate, obtaining excitation of triplet excitons and the generation of 1O2, rather than exciting photogenerated electrons and holes. A novel triplet exciton&#8208;1O2 H2O2 photosynthesis pathway is achieved and demonstrates a 38.6% reduction in the generation barrier compared to typical redox pathway, obtaining record activity with rates of 10.80&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in an O2 atmosphere and 7.82&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, without the need for a sacrificial agent. The solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is 1.25%.

         <title>Integrating High&#8208;Efficient Delamination and Structural Reconstruction Boosting Direct Regeneration of Spent Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a synergistic strategy for delaminating cathode active materials from current collectors of spent cathodes within 2 min, and reconstructing the surface structure that boosts the lithium replenishment to achieve efficient direct regeneration of NCM523 by catalytically activating potassium peroxymonosulfate. The regenerated material exhibits commercial&#8208;level capacity and remarkable cycling stability, advancing sustainable recycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Direct regeneration presents a promising solution for tackling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its environmental and economic advantages. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of direct regeneration hinges on the efficient and precise separation of cathode materials from current collectors. Current separation methods not only suffer from incomplete separation and low delamination efficiency but also risk inflicting damage to the already degraded surface structure of cathode materials, which further renders the direct regeneration less effective. Herein, an approach is introduced that synergistically achieves high&#8208;efficient delamination and surface reconstruction of spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) by catalytically activating potassium peroxymonosulfate. This approach achieves delamination of cathode materials from current collectors with a separation efficiency over 99% within only 2 min. Moreover, the surface reconstruction is simultaneously accomplished during the delamination process, building fast lithium&#8208;ion diffusion pathway, greatly reducing the lithium&#8208;ion migration barrier. Consequently, the NCM523 regenerated through this method successfully restores its capacity to commercial level at 152 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 and maintains outstanding cycling stability, retaining 75% of its capacity after 1000 cycles. The findings underscore the necessity of complete separation of cathode materials from current collectors and surface structural reconstruction in direct regeneration and offer critical insights into optimizing sustainable recycling processes for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Cathode Additive Enables Highly Reversible Four&#8208;Electron I&#8722;/I0/I+ Conversion in Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>

A quasi&#8208;solid BMICl/CNTs additive addresses dual challenges in four&#8208;electron zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (4eZIBs). It suppresses polyiodide shuttling via bonding in the I&#8722;/I0 step and enhances I+ kinetics while curbing hydrolysis via Cl&#8722; immobilization and BMI&#8208;ICl2 complex formation in the I0/I+ step. This enables 418.9 mA h&#160;g&#8722;1 capacity at 0.5C and 93.4% retention after 600 cycles at 1C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries with four&#8208;electron (4e) I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion (4eZIBs) offer high energy density but face both&#8208;step I&#8722;/I0 and I0/I+ challenges, including the polyiodide shuttle effect, sluggish I0/I+ conversion kinetics, and severe I+ hydrolysis. To mitigate these issues, a quasi&#8208;solid additive composed of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride (BMICl) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is introduced into the cathode. Specifically, by co&#8208;grinding BMICl with CNTs, a homogeneous quasi&#8208;solid additive is formed due to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between CNTs and imidazole rings. This additive not only suppresses the shuttle effect by binding with polyiodides in the first&#8208;step I&#8722;/I0 conversion, but also enhances I+ conversion kinetics by immobilizing Cl&#8722; inside the electrode and curbs I+ hydrolysis through forming a BMI&#8208;ICl2 complex in the second&#8208;step conversion. This innovative approach enables the 4eZIBs to achieve a near&#8208;theoretical specific capacity of 418.9&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5C, while maintaining a robust lifespan of over 600 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.4% at 1C. Moreover, pouch cells under a high areal capacity of 7.1&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2 for each side of the cathode demonstrate a high&#8208;capacity retention of 95.8% after 150 cycles at 6.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (&#8776;0.5C).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Debye&#8208;Type Relaxor Ferroelectric Crystals Enable Broadband Photo&#8208;Pyroelectric Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Debye&#8208;type relaxation is unlocked in a metal&#8208;free molecular ferroelectric, of which large pyroelectric figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit enable wide&#8208;spectral photodetection covering UV to NIR&#8208;II wavelengths.








Abstract
Relaxor ferroelectrics have shown promising potential for various device applications, such as medical ultrasound transducers, pyroelectric infrared detectors, and electro&#8208;optic elements. Currently, relaxor ferroelectrics primarily consist of inorganic oxides, while achieving a pronounced relaxation in metal&#8208;free molecular ferroelectrics remains challenging due to the strong coupling between the relaxation mechanism and molecular dipole dynamics under applied electric fields. Consequently, this constraint leads to limited studies on their relaxation behavior and hinders progress in high&#8208;sensitivity applications, such as photo&#8208;pyroelectric detection. Here, Debye&#8208;type relaxation is unlocked in the molecular ferroelectric of bis(imidazolium) L&#8208;tartrate. In contrast to inorganic counterparts, this metal&#8208;free transparent single&#8208;crystal ferroelectric exhibits rare Debye&#8208;type dielectric relaxation arising from the molecular dipole reorientation that relates to the dynamic motion of organic imidazolium. Exceptionally, broadband photo&#8208;pyroelectric effects allow inch&#8208;size crystals for wide&#8208;spectral photodetection spanning UV to NIR&#8208;II wavelengths (266&#8211;1950 nm), breaking the conventional bandgap constraint on conventional materials. This work demonstrates that Debye&#8208;type relaxor molecular ferroelectrics are promising candidates for high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;pyroelectric detectors.

         <title>Engineering B&#8210;N Covalent Bond&#8208;Fused Naphthalene Derivatives for Narrowband Yellow Emission and Power&#8208;Efficient White OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double B&#9472;N covalent bond fusion on naphthalene has been proposed to design novel yellow fluorophores, showing a considerable bathochromic shift, decreased FWHM, and improved photoluminescent quantum yield. The corresponding white OLEDs achieve an unprecedented warm white light with a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 101.4 lm W&#8722;1@1000 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
The doping of B&#8210;N covalent bond into multiple resonance (MR) emitters is believed to enable easy synthesis while maintaining the intrinsic narrow spectral profile for high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, there is still an unexplored spot if the residual MR section is further removed. Herein, the molecular engineering of B&#8210;N covalent bond&#8208;fused naphthalene derivatives is demonstrated that are free of MR for yellow emission with a reduced spectral bandwidth and power&#8208;efficient white OLEDs. Starting from the BN&#8208;nap1 reference, a dual fusion strategy is proposed to design two new yellow emitters, BN&#8208;nap2 and BN&#8208;nap3, by integrating B&#8210;N bonds with naphthalene via a centro and axial symmetry, respectively. Both of them exhibit significantly red&#8208;shifted light to the yellow region, decreased full width at half maximum, improved photoluminescent quantum yield, due to the B&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;B conjugation and suppressed high&#8208;frequency vibrations. As a result, the corresponding warm white devices achieve a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 101.4 lm W&#8722;1 at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.342, 0.542). Further device optimization leads to a standard white electroluminescence with CIE coordinates of (0.334, 0.342). The unprecedented performance indicates the great potential of B&#8210;N covalent bond&#8208;fused naphthalene derivatives in power&#8208;efficient white OLEDs.

         <title>Heat&#8208;Responsive Phase&#8208;Change Cream Broadly Enhances Transdermal Delivery Through a Mild Photothermal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transdermal cream containing phase&#8208;change materials, polydopamine nanoparticles, and glycerin capable of carrying various drugs is developed. The phase&#8208;change material maintains skin temperature at &#8764;40 &#176;C during the photothermal treatment. This mild photothermal strategy with temperature control offers a general yet versatile platform to enhance the transdermal delivery of various drugs for treating diverse diseases.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature&#8208;mediated transdermal delivery often relies on extreme heating to disrupt the skin barrier, but these approaches risk tissue damage and drug denaturation. Mild thermal stimulation promises safer uptake, yet achieving precise temperature control is inconvenient, and its transdermal efficacy and mechanisms remain unclear. A heat&#8208;responsive cream made from a stearic acid&#8208;lauric acid eutectic, polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles, glycerin, and drugs is introduced. This cream maintains skin temperature &#8764;40&#160;&#176;C under simulated sunlight by absorbing excess heat through phase change, preventing overheating while preserving the effectiveness of the drug without requiring manual adjustments. Mild photothermal treatment boosted penetration of PDA nanoparticles (2.4&#8211;406.9&#160;nm) by 5.5&#8211;7.1&#8208;fold, and achieved 28.9&#8208;, 24.6&#8208;, and 10.7&#8208;fold increase of fluorescent signals in dermis for rhodamine B (RB), RB&#8208;labeled 5 or 20&#160;kDa dextran versus nonheated controls, respectively. Mechanistic studies revealed that the photothermal effect enhances transdermal delivery by inducing micropores on the skin and through the transappendageal route. Moreover, insulin delivered through this strategy reduced blood glucose by 75% in diabetic mice, and co&#8208;delivery of PDA NPs with methotrexate significantly improved psoriasis lesions. This self&#8208;regulating platform uniquely unites precise thermal control and dual&#8208;pathway enhancement, offering a generalizable route for enhancing transdermal delivery efficiency.

         <title>Crystal Growth Engineering for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Plating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research employed the rare&#8208;earth ion dysprosium (Dy) to modulate aqueous zinc (Zn) metal plating. Integrated multiscale experiments and computational modeling unveiled the preferential adsorption of Dy on specific crystal facets, which activated screw dislocation&#8208;driven Zn growth. Consequently, dense, uniform, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating is realized, delivering markedly enhanced cycling stability and enabling high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge during Zn plating/stripping.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is limited by uncontrolled zinc (Zn) dendrite growth during anode plating, compromising both safety and cycle life. Typically, Zn plating proceeds via 2D growth along the six equivalent prismatic [101&#175;0]$10\bar 10]$ directions of the hexagonal close&#8208;packed (HCP) Zn lattice, forming hexagonal platelets that promote dendrite formation. Here, an effective electrolyte engineering strategy is presented using rare&#8208;earth ions to regulate Zn plating. Combined multiscale experimental analyses and computational modeling reveal that these ions preferentially adsorb onto the prismatic {101&#175;0$10\bar 10$} facets, suppressing lateral epitaxial growth of the basal (0002) planes. This redirects Zn plating toward an apparent screw dislocation&#8208;driven growth along the [0001] axis. The resulting growth pathway, together with randomly oriented Zn nucleation, yields dense, uniform, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn layers with markedly improved cycling stability and high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge operation, thereby challenging the prevailing assumption that dendrite suppression requires (0002)&#8208;oriented growth parallel to the substrate. This work provides new mechanistic insights into Zn plating dynamics and establishes a scalable strategy for stable, dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes in next&#8208;generation AZIBs.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Distribution and Microenvironment Dual Regulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work rationally synthesized a series of COFs from co&#8208;controlling ET by skeletons and PT by pore microenvironment, and successfully used them as efficient catalysts for photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 and H2O&#8208;to&#8208;H2 reaction, which put forward a new method for the dual regulation of COFs for enhancing photocatalytic reactions.








Abstract
The proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process which related to charge&#8208;distribution and proton environment of photocatalysts play a key role in the photocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, there is short of systematic studies on the influences of photocatalytic PCET process by regarding the above two factors at the molecular level. Herein, a series of covalent organic framework (COFs)&#160;(Py&#8208;Bd COF, Py&#8208;Sa COF and Py&#8208;OH&#8208;Sa COF) were synthesized by co&#8208;controlling charge&#8208;distribution of skeletons and microenvironment of pores, and were used as photocatalysts for O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 and H2O&#8208;to&#8208;H2 reaction. Particularly, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone groups and strong electron&#8208;rich hydroxy groups in Py&#8208;OH&#8208;Sa COF boosted photo&#8208;generated charge separation, also triggered more hydrophilic pores, thus enabling efficient transfer of the photo&#8208;induced electrons and protons to catalytic sites. By the above dual regulation, Py&#8208;OH&#8208;Sa COF showed high photocatalytic H2O2 yield (4.78&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and H2 production (64.21&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Moreover, the Py&#8208;OH&#8208;Sa COF exhibits an extraordinary apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 6.52% and 8.25% at 380 nm for H2O2 and H2 production. This work develops an important strategy for precise regulating PECT by co&#8208;regulation of charge&#8208;distribution and microenvironment of photocatalyst to enhance catalytic activity, which also offers novel insights for the design anddevelopment of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Anchored on Perovskite With Strong Metal&#8208;Oxide Interaction for Efficient High Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to in situ exsolution, surface single&#8208;atom engineering may play a more significant role in enhancing both the electrocatalytic activity and stability of cathodes in CO2RR. Accordingly, Ir atoms anchoring on the Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8208;&#948; (SFM) are stabilized in a four&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Fe/Mo motif through strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). This structure drives interfacial charge redistribution and reduces the CO2RR activation barrier.








Abstract
Efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction remains a grand challenge in advancing carbon&#8208;neutral energy technologies. Here, an efficient solid&#8208;state approach for the fabrication of a novel single&#8208;atom Ir anchored Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8208;&#948; (SFM) perovskite electrocatalyst, designed for high temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) is reported. The resulting four&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Fe/Mo configuration induces pronounced interfacial electronic reconstruction and strong metal&#8208;oxide interaction, substantially lowering the energy barrier for CO2 electrolysis, as indicated by extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. When employed as a cathode in SOECs, the 2Ir/SFM (2 wt.% Ir) electrocatalyst achieves a high current density of 1.63 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.5 V and 800&#160;&#176;C, along with excellent Faradaic efficiency and long&#8208;term operational stability. These findings offer atomistic insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship of single&#8208;atom/perovskite heterostructures, underscoring the commercial potential of SOECs for CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Organic Cation Methylation Design of Hybrid Eu(II)&#8208;based Halide Scintillators for Improved X&#8208;Ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic cation methylation strategy is proposed to design PMIMEuX3 (PMIM&#8208;X, PMIM = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium, X = Br, I) and PDMIMEuX3 (PDMIM&#8208;X, PDMIM = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium). PDMIM&#8208;X scintillator with a low detection limit and ultra&#8208;high light output effectively suppresses nonradiative recombination between luminescent centers and the halogen vacancy defects. Moreover, highly transparent, large&#8208;area PDMIM&#8208;Br@film with a resolution of 21.1 lp mm&#8722;1 is prepared by rapid in situ solution processing for X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid scintillators (OIHSs) have emerged as promising candidates for X&#8208;ray imaging. However, inhibiting the concentration quenching effect and reducing vacancy defects remain major challenges for high&#8208;performance OIHSs. Herein, a modification strategy of organic cation methylation is introduced to prepare PDMIMEuX3 (PDMIM&#8208;X, PDMIM = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium, X = Br, I) upon PMIMEuX3 (PMIM&#8208;X, PMIM = 1&#8208;Propyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium). Benefiting from the increased Eu&#8208;Eu chain spacing and structural rigidity by the steric effect of inserted cationic methylation, PDMIM&#8208;X suppresses nonradiative recombination between luminescent centers and the halogen vacancy defects. Particularly, PDMIM&#8208;Br designed via such a cation methylation exhibits high light output, which is 3.57 and 9.7 times higher than that of commercial Lu3Al5O12:Ce and original PMIM&#8208;Br, respectively, and thus it also demonstrates a low detection limit of 42.61 nGy s&#8722;1. Moreover, leveraging the capability of rapid in situ solution processing, a transparent and large&#8208;area PDMIM&#8208;Br@film is prepared with a spatial resolution of 21.1 lp mm&#8722;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging. This study developed high&#8208;performance OIHSs and further provided an effective strategy via materials design to improve the detection and imaging capabilities.

         <title>Positive and Negative Triboelectricity Checkered Board Design for Friction Force and Heat Suppression in Triboelectrification Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed to suppress strong interface electrostatic adhesion and heat generation in triboelectrification process by material arrangement and structure design.








Abstract
Interfacial electrostatic attraction during the triboelectrification process inevitably increases frictional resistance and heat loss. However, rational strategies to mitigate these strong electrostatic forces at the triboelectric interface remain lacking. Herein, a positive and negative triboelectricity checkered board design is proposed to suppress both friction and heat generation in sliding triboelectric nanogenrator (TENG). The continuous balance of interfacial charge attraction and repulsion forces is maintained during the sliding process. By systematically investigating the friction and adhesion force, frictional heating, and electrical outputs of various types of sliding&#8208;mode TENGs, this checkered board design TENG (CB&#8208;TENG) reduces the sliding friction force and static friction force by more than 30% and 80% compared with the lock&#8208;free TENG, and exhibits a maximum temperature reduction of 69.5% as that of the freestanding TENG (FS&#8208;TENG). Besides, the CB&#8208;TENG achieves 220% enhancement in transferred charge and fourfold enhancement in output energy of FS&#8208;TENG over the same sliding distance. Moreover, the segmented electrode design and phase difference in dual&#8208;channel AC outputs also enable it function as a direction and displacement sensor for intelligent driving systems. The proposed novel strategy to solve friction resistance and heat loss must lead TENG with high output and durability to more mature applications.

         <title>MoO2&#8208;Mediated Ni&#9472;Fe Bond Contraction and Electronic Modulation in Ni3Fe Alloy for Efficient Water Electrolysis at High&#8208;Current&#8208;Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoO2 effectively modulates the electronic structure of Ni3Fe and optimizes the Ni&#9472;Fe bonding configuration, thereby enabling dual regulation of the Volmer&#8208;Heyrovsky steps and the evolution pathways of reaction intermediates during the water electrolysis process, which collectively accelerates&#160;both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction; in addition, the catalyst exhibits superhydrophilic/superaerophobic properties, facilitating electrolyte exchange and bubble release.








Abstract
Ni3Fe alloy electrocatalysts show promising activity for water electrolysis but are limited by sluggish hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) kinetics, and inefficient gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer under high&#8208;current&#8208;densities. Here, a superhydrophilic/superaerophobic 3D carbonized wood&#8208;loaded Ni3Fe&#8208;MoO2 (Ni3Fe/MoO2/CW) heterojunction is designed to address these challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of MoO2 shortens the Ni&#9472;Fe bond length, induces electron transfer from Ni3Fe to MoO2, and regulates the d&#8208;band center of Ni/Fe. These optimized Ni&#9472;Fe bonds and electronic structure enhance H&#9472;OH bond dissociation and H* adsorption/desorption, thereby accelerating the HER Volmer&#8208;Heyrovsky step. Simultaneously, for the OER adsorption evolution mechanism on Ni3Fe (1.462 eV), the strengthened Ni&#9472;O&#9472;Mo bond on Ni3Fe&#8208;MoO2 heterojunction reduces the energy barrier (1.092 eV) of the rate&#8208;determining step, significantly improving catalytic efficiency. Thus, Ni3Fe/MoO2/CW displays good activity (HER: &#951;&#8722;10/&#8722;750 = 45/342 mV; OER: &#951;300/1000 = 251/306 mV). Notably, the large specific area of Ni3Fe/MoO2/CW from its nanosheet&#8208;particle structure enhances the electrolyte/bubble exchange at the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface, enabling stable operation at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 for 24 h in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer. This work demonstrates a MoO2&#8208;driven strategy for electronic modulation and metal bond regulation to boost HER/OER kinetics, advancing Ni3Fe&#8208;based catalysts toward practical high&#8208;current&#8208;densities water electrolysis.

         <title>Gel&#8208;Locked Lamellar Membranes: Overcoming the Limitations of Permeance, Selectivity, and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a facile photothermal&#8208;triggered confined gelation approach to manufacture novel gel&#8208;locked lamellar membranes (GLLMs) with versatile gel&#8208;rich nanochannel chemistry and gel&#8208;locked lamellar nanochannel architecture. These gel&#8208;locked lamellar nanochannels render GLLMs with excellent antiswelling property and extraordinary structure stability, realizing exceptional permeance, selectivity, and stability simultaneously for isotopic separation, optical resolution, organic solvent nanofiltration, and gas separation.








Abstract
Nanosheets&#8208;stacked lamellar membranes with unique 2D nanochannels are promising platform to achieve ultrafast molecule sieving over conventional membranes in numerous separation applications. Despite significant successes in material design and structure optimization, existing lamellar membranes remain challenging to achieve boosted permeance, selectivity, and stability simultaneously, owing to their limited nanochannel chemistry and unstable nanochannel architecture. Herein, a new class of gel&#8208;locked lamellar membranes (GLLMs) that feature versatile gel&#8208;decorated nanochannel chemistry and gel&#8208;crosslinked lamellar nanochannel architecture are discovered by an original photothermal&#8208;triggered confined gelation (PTCG) approach. In the PTCG, the photothermal&#8208;enabled localized heating from nanosheets is leveraged to trigger rapid and efficient generation of free radicals in their vicinity, allowing for precisely confining polymerization and gelation into lamellar nanochannels. With this method, a series of GLLMs are constructed by easily devising functional monomers and nanosheets and exhibit ultrastable nanochannel architecture with antiswelling ability in many harsh conditions. It is demonstrated that the GLLMs with customized gel&#8208;decorated nanochannels showcase boosted permeance and selectivity over conventional lamellar membranes in many separation scenarios such as isotopic separation, optical resolution, organic solvent nanofiltration, and CO2/CH4 separation. The findings represent a paradigm shift in exploiting a family of advanced lamellar membranes with broader applications.

         <title>Ni&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) Reaction Energy Barrier Regulation in Passive Film for Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate with Cr, enhancing the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film, and achieving excellent anode stability in industrial seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis offers a promising route for green hydrogen production, but anode corrosion by chloride (Cl&#8722;) and bromide (Br&#8722;) ions hinders its practicality. Although effective catalyst modification strategies have been developed to mitigate Cl&#8722;&#8208;induced corrosion, the extensive spallation of the catalyst layer caused by accumulated Br&#8722; highlights the urgent need to address co&#8208;corrosion by both Br&#8722; and Cl&#8722;. Here, a Ni&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate to enhance the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film.

&lt;p&gt;A Ni-X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate with Cr, enhancing the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film, and achieving excellent anode stability in industrial seawater electrolysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seawater electrolysis offers a promising route for green hydrogen production, but anode corrosion by chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and bromide (Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) ions hinders its practicality. Although effective catalyst modification strategies have been developed to mitigate Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-induced corrosion, the extensive spallation of the catalyst layer caused by accumulated Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; highlights the urgent need to address co-corrosion by both Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, a Ni-X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate to enhance the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film. Theoretical simulations predict that NiCr alloy has substantial potential as an anode substrate.

Submillimeter, ultrathin single&#8208;crystal NdOCl nanosheets are synthesized via modified PVD. It exhibits high&#8208;&#954; (&#8776;11.7), ultralow leakage (&#8776;10&#8722;7&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a wide bandgap (4.57&#160;eV). MoS2/NdOCl FETs show a high Ion/Ioff ratio, steep subthreshold swing, suppressed scattering, and enhanced mobility. The 100&#8208;nm channel MoS2 FETs and high&#8208;gain inverters with NdOCl gate, demonstrating their potential as a next&#8208;generation 2D dielectric.








Abstract
2D dielectrics integrated with atomically thin semiconductors hold immense potential to address the scaling challenges in future nanoelectronics. However, existing 2D dielectrics are limited by insufficient dielectric constants, poor interfacial quality, and degraded gate controllability. Here, a controlled synthesis of single&#8208;crystal neodymium oxychloride (NdOCl) nanosheets with submillimeter sizes (169&#160;&#181;m) and ultrathin thickness (5&#160;nm) is presented using a modified physical vapor deposition (PVD) approach. The NdOCl nanosheets exhibit a high dielectric constant (&#954;&#8776;11.7), ultralow leakage currents (&#8776;10&#8722;7&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a wide bandgap of 4.57&#160;eV. MoS2/NdOCl field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) achieve high on/off current ratios (108), steep subthreshold swings, and suppressed Coulomb scattering, enabling a carrier mobility of 123&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at 80&#160;K, a value three times higher than MoS2/SiO2 FETs. The implementation of high&#8208;&#954; NdOCl dielectrics facilitates the successful fabrication of short&#8208;channel MoS2 FETs (100&#160;nm) and high&#8208;gain logic inverters (60.9). These findings underscore the great potential of NdOCl as a next&#8208;generation 2D gate dielectric for advanced, miniaturized nanoelectronic applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Driven Allosteric and Self&#8208;Encapsulating Polymers for Tumor&#8208;Specific Fluorescence Imaging and Dual&#8208;Enzymatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimetic fluorescent polymer is constructed through Cu2&#8314; chelation, exhibiting conformational transition, fluorescence quenching, and self&#8208;folding encapsulation properties. Under GSH&#8208;triggered reductive conditions, it enables FRET&#8208;mediated visualization of drug release, alongside dual enzymatic activity for tumor imaging. 








Abstract
Metal ion&#8208;mediated redox process and protein folding are fundamental to numerous physiological functions. However, the mechanisms underlying copper ion interactions with macromolecules remain insufficiently understood, and the therapeutic potential of polymer&#8208;copper complexes is largely underexplored. Here, a biomimetic metallopolymer is reported in which copper ion coordination induces a conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix, accompanied by oxidative self&#8208;encapsulation and fluorescence quenching. By leveraging the tunable intrinsic fluorescence of the polymer, the first systematic elucidation of the coordination interaction mechanism between polythiols and copper ions is presented. This interaction enhances the structural stability, catalytic efficiency, membrane activity, and drug loading capacity. Furthermore, the polymer&#8208;copper complex demonstrates tumor&#8208;activated fluorescence and dual enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities, enabling precise tumor imaging and multimodal therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work provides new insights into the interactions between macromolecules and metal ions and establishes a versatile and intelligent nanosystem for advanced disease diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>Tailoring Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfaces via Electrolyte Additive Engineering for Reliable 5&#160;V&#8208;Class 500&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1 Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A major obstacle for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) lies in electrode interfacial instability and the intrinsic flammability of electrolytes. An innovative additive engineering strategy along with facile fire&#8208;retardant mixing is smartly developed to efficiently tackle these long&#8208;standing stability and safety challenges in high&#8208;voltage LMBs, while enabling a high energy density exceeding 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
The inherent incompatibility of nonaqueous electrolytes with highly reactive cathodes, along with their high flammability, severely impedes the development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, functional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes are designed by incorporating 1,2&#8208;bis(bromoacetoxy)ethane (BBAE) additive, demonstrating the intrinsic nonflammability and remarkable operation of 5.0&#160;V cells. Experimental results and theoretical simulations uncover that the addition of BBAE induces a self&#8208;absorption plane and modifies the solvation structure, leading to the in situ formation of reinforced hybrid halide electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (EEIs), which suppress surface parasitic reactions under high&#8208;voltage conditions above 4.5&#160;V while inhibiting lithium dendrite growth on the lithium metal anode. Moreover, the optimized electrolytes exhibit enhanced fire retardancy thanks to the contribution from the bromine functionality within BBAE and the effective combination with nonflammable triethyl phosphate. Consequently, LMBs equipped with typical cathodes including LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM90), high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2, etc., exhibit exceptional deep cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerant capability over a broad voltage window of 4.1 &#8722; 5.0&#160;V. Additionally, 520&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 NCM90||Li pouch cells surprisingly pass the nail penetration tests, highlighting the prominent safety. This straightforward and cost&#8208;effective approach provides an inspirational strategy for the safe application of LMBs by reinforcing the interface stability and reconciling the electrolyte flame retardancy.

Schematic diagram of TSMs classification, future development directions, and potential applications.








Abstract
Controllable thermal management is essential in environmental&#8208;sensitive application scenarios, such as lithium batteries, data centers, and human body systems. This necessity has spurred the development of next&#8208;generation intelligent materials. Thermal smart materials (TSMs), which can self&#8208;adjust their thermal conductivity (TC) in a specific temperature range in response to external stimuli, have attracted significant interest due to their advantages over traditional temperature control systems or devices, including convenience, efficiency, and compact structure. Here, an overview of the non&#8208;temperature&#8208;responsive TSMs stimulated is first presented by various factors such as electrical/magnetic, light, mechanical force, humidity, and temperature, followed by a focused summary of the key mechanisms underlying temperature&#8208;responsive TSMs that have thermal sensitivity. By addressing existing gaps and opportunities in the field of TSMs, we outlook future directions of thermoresponsive TSMs from three aspects: crystal state transition, reconfigurable chemical structures, and temperature&#8208;based multi&#8208;mechanism coupling. Finally, the potential applications of TSMs in data centers, electronic components, and individual thermal management are discussed. Based on the existing research on TSMs and the advances in related fields, we hope this perspective will guide the future development of high&#8208;performance TSMs.

By addressing existing gaps and opportunities in the field of TSMs, we outlook future directions of thermoresponsive TSMs from three aspects: crystal state transition, reconfigurable chemical structures, and temperature-based multi-mechanism coupling. Finally, the potential applications of TSMs in data centers, electronic components, and individual thermal management are discussed. Based on the existing research on TSMs and the advances in related fields, we hope this perspective will guide the future development of high-performance TSMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Chiral Recognition of Biothiols by Enantiomeric Nanoclusters in Plasma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral silver nanoclusters with a twisted octahedral framework enable the enantioselective recognition, quantification, and differentiation of biothiols in plasma through circular dichroism, owing to their hierarchical enantioselectivity and intrinsic chirality. These properties facilitate the formation of supramolecular aggregates with distinct binding affinities and assembly structures, enhancing the sensitivity and specificity in biothiol detection.








Abstract
The biomimetic chiral recognition and detection of biothiols, such as cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione, in plasma present significant challenges due to the limited understanding of chiral recognition mechanisms beyond the molecular level. Herein, enantiomeric and twisted octahedron silver nanoclusters (D&#8208;/L&#8208;Ag6SP6), featuring bichirality at both the molecular and nanoscopic scales, are designed and synthesized by employing a chiral bidentate ligand of thiazolethione enantiomer (D&#8208; or L&#8208;4&#8208;phenylthiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione, abbreviated as D&#8208;SP or L&#8208;SP) in conjunction with silver acetate. The resulting nanoclusters are further modified with PEG2000 to produce water&#8208;dispersible D&#8208;Ag6SP6@PEG and L&#8208;Ag6SP6@PEG nanoparticles, enabling enantioselective recognition and quantitative determination of various biothiols in plasma through circular dichroism measurements. The study also elucidates the bichiral recognition and determination of biothiols through a ligand&#8208;induced disassembly&#8208;assembly mechanism. Both D&#8208; and L&#8208;type Ag6SP6@PEG nanoparticles demonstrate excellent anti&#8208;interference properties for discriminating biothiols using principal component analysis. The bichirality of nanoclusters shows high enantioselectivity in chiral recognition of biothiols and their corresponding enantiomers. This work not only provides a convenient strategy for bichiral recognition and quantitative determination of biothiols in plasma, but also holds promise for developing hierarchically chiral nanomaterials applicable in biomedical engineering, nanomedicine, and drug screening.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Charged Gold Nanoparticles: A New Powerful Tool for Lithium Delivery and Modulation of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces glutathione&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles for targeted lithium delivery (LiG&#8208;AuNPs), enabling the controlled modulation of Glycogen Synthase Kinase&#8208;3&#160;(GSK&#8208;3&#946;).&#160;These non&#8208;toxic, 2&#8208;nm particles release lithium intracellularly, effectively inhibiting GSK&#8208;3&#946; in the brain without significant plasma lithium alterations. LiG&#8208;AuNPs show potential for treating GSK&#8208;3&#946;&#8208;related conditions like mood disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and viral infections through prolonged, targeted administration.








Abstract
&#8220;A Trojan Horse for Lithium Delivery&#8221;. Lithium has important pharmacological applications, although its use is severely limited due to its narrow therapeutic window of administrable concentrations. This study presents a novel nanocarrier for this metal cation based on glutathione&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles (LiG&#8208;AuNPs), which enable targeted release of lithium. LiG&#8208;AuNPs are easily synthesized, with dimensions of &#8776;2&#160;nm, with a lithium loading of 2 wt%. These particles show a tendency to aggregate and a narrow size distribution. Aggregates of LiG&#8208;AuNPs (a&#8208;LiG&#8208;AuNPs) are non&#8208;toxic to cells at concentrations lower than 2&#160;mg mL&#8722;1 and are rapidly internalized into cells, where they release lithium in the cytosol through cation exchange, effectively modulating Glycogen Synthase Kinase&#8208;3 (GSK&#8208;3&#946;) activity, especially the &#946; isoform. Administration of a&#8208;LiG&#8208;AuNPs in murine models increased the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK&#8208;3&#946; at Ser9. Intranasal administration of a&#8208;LiG&#8208;AuNPs modulated GSK&#8208;3&#946; activity in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, without significantly altering plasma lithium levels, even when the administration lasted several months. LiG&#8208;AuNPs thus represent a powerful tool for the targeted administration of lithium, enhancing its therapeutic effects in modulating GSK&#8208;3&#946;. They have potential applications for treating illnesses depending on GSK&#8208;3&#946; (hyper)activation, such as mood disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and viral infections.

         <title>All&#8208;Round Enhancement of Wide pH Hydrogen Evolution Enabled by Tungsten&#8208;Based Amorphous Alloy&#8208;Mediated Adjacent Platinum Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tungsten&#8208;based amorphous alloy (FeNiWPB) supported adjacent Platinum single&#8208;atom catalyst (PtASSA@FeNiWPB) is designed to enable all&#8208;round enhancement of hydrogen evolution across broad pH ranges, in which metal&#8208;metal synergy constructed by adjacent Pt atoms, robust M&#9472;W bonds (M = Pt, Fe, Ni), electron redistribution induced by Pt&#8208;W/Fe/Ni polarized pairs contribute to the catalyst outstanding HER performance and remarkable stability in both acidic and alkaline environments.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting based on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) offers a sustainable route for hydrogen production. However, conventional SACs suffer from weak synergistic effects in harsh electrolytes. Here, we report a tungsten&#8208;based amorphous alloy (FeNiWPB) supported adjacent Platinum single&#8208;atom catalyst (PtASSA@FeNiWPB). Spectroscopic and computational analyses disclose that the amorphous W&#8208;based alloy matrix provides abundant defect sites to anchor and mediate adjacent Pt atoms, thereby boosting multiple H conversions via metal&#8208;metal synergy. Additionally, the catalyst's corrosion resistance is significantly enhanced through the formation of robust M&#9472;W bonds (M&#9552;Pt, Fe, Ni), which effectively suppress metal leaching across broad pH ranges. Furthermore, the formation of Pt&#8208;W/Fe/Ni polarized pairs at the alloy surface via Pt&#8208;support interactions induces electron redistribution and accelerates H*/OH* adsorption kinetics, thereby enhancing multiple H2O* dissociation pathways. Consequently, PtASSA@FeNiWPB exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 17 mV (acidic) and 18 mV (alkaline) at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2, with mass activities 5.8 times (acidic) and 63.6 times (alkaline) higher than commercial Pt/C. Notably, it maintains performance for 600 h in both acidic and alkaline environments, far exceeding W&#8208;free counterparts (&lt;50 h) and previous reports, positioning it at the forefront of HER performance. This work establishes a universal strategy for engineering durable electrocatalysts.Electrochemical water splitting based on single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) offers a sustainable route for hydrogen production.

         <title>A Pupillary Light Reflex Inspired Self&#8208;Adaptive Spiking Visual Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a self&#8208;adaptive spiking visual neuron (SASVN) to enable active visual adaptation, extend the perception range, and facilitate frequency&#8208;modulated encoding in neuromorphic electronics. Such devices achieve spike&#8208;encoded and self&#8208;adaptive vision with a 160 dB dynamic range and light&#8208;intensity regimes spanning over 6 orders of magnitude (0.2 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 to 1.64 W/cm&#8722;2), outperforming previous artificial adaptive visual neurons.








Abstract
The development of neuromorphic visual systems aims to address the energy&#8208;efficiency and adaptability constraints in machine vision. However, artificial visual neurons in these systems mostly encode amplitude&#8208;modulated signals and adjust the perception range through passive gate voltage modulation, resulting in low biological fidelity. A pupillary&#8208;light&#8208;reflex&#8208;inspired self&#8208;adaptive spiking visual neuron with a superior perception range and active visual adaptation is proposed. The device functionally emulates the hierarchical visual adaptation process of human eyes through the active optical regulation of a photochromic film, photoelectric conversion through an IGCdO&#8208;based transistor, and spiking encoding through a TaOX&#8208;based memristor&#8208;based memristor). This configuration possesses a perception range of 160 dB and active visual adaptation under extreme light intensity conditions ranging from 0.2 &#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 to 1.64 W&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming previous artificial visual neurons. The advantage of active visual adaptation has been validated by integration with a spiking neural network, achieving an 86% recognition accuracy in classification tasks, a 66% improvement over non&#8208;adaptive counterparts.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports a self-adaptive spiking visual neuron (SASVN) to enable active visual adaptation, extend the perception range, and facilitate frequency-modulated encoding in neuromorphic electronics. Such devices achieve spike-encoded and self-adaptive vision with a 160 dB dynamic range and light-intensity regimes spanning over 6 orders of magnitude (0.2 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.64 W/cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), outperforming previous artificial adaptive visual neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of neuromorphic visual systems aims to address the energy-efficiency and adaptability constraints in machine vision. However, artificial visual neurons in these systems mostly encode amplitude-modulated signals and adjust the perception range through passive gate voltage modulation, resulting in low biological fidelity. A pupillary-light-reflex-inspired self-adaptive spiking visual neuron with a superior perception range and active visual adaptation is proposed. The device functionally emulates the hierarchical visual adaptation process of human eyes through the active optical regulation of a photochromic film, photoelectric conversion through an IGCdO-based transistor, and spiking encoding through a TaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-based memristor-based memristor). This configuration possesses a perception range of 160 dB and active visual adaptation under extreme light intensity conditions ranging from 0.2 &#181;W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.64 W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming previous artificial visual neurons. The advantage of active visual adaptation has been validated by integration with a spiking neural network, achieving an 86% recognition accuracy in classification tasks, a 66% improvement over non-adaptive counterparts. This bio-inspired design would endow machine vision systems with a high-level of biological fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Efficiency (&#8764;18%) Organic Solar Cells with 500 nm&#8208;Thick Toluene Cast Active Layer by Aggregation Manipulation and Additive Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, additive engineering is successfully applied to reduce the free volume of the strongly aggregated active layer, suppressing the electron&#8208;phonon coupling, thus promoting thick&#8208;film OSC performance.








Abstract
Thick&#8208;film organic solar cells (OSCs) are crucial for mass&#8208;production: however, the efficiency of such cells is limited by the lack of morphological control afforded by methods that rely on high&#8208;vapor&#8208;pressure solvents. Herein, a systematic solvent and additive engineering strategy is reported for improving the performance of thick&#8208;film (&gt;300&#160;nm) OSCs through aggregation modulation via solidification acceleration and electronic property enhancement. Two oligomers derived from the polymer donors PM6 and D18&#8208;Fu are employed as solid additives to prepare the active layer. Characterizations&#160;reveal that the D18&#8208;Fu&#8208;derived oligomer exhibits stronger interactions with both the benzodifuran donor (D18&#8208;Fu) and the acceptor (L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X), resulting in suppressed electron&#8208;phonon coupling, more balanced donor&#8211;acceptor fibrillation, and enhanced face&#8208;on molecular orientation. Devices treated with the D18&#8208;Fu&#8208;derived oligomer achieve a greater improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Both additives enhance thickness&#8208;&#160;tolerance of the device owing to their structural compatibility with the D18&#8208;Fu&#8208;derived oligomer,&#8208; yielding superior performance. Notably, devices processed from toluene, a nonhalogenated solvent, demonstrate high PCEs with excellent thickness tolerance; the thick&#8208;film device (500&#160;nm active layer) exhibits an independently certified PCE of &#8764;18%, a record for thick&#8208;film OSCs, with no significant loss in performance compared to its thin&#8208;film (100&#160;nm) counterparts (&gt;19%).

         <title>Spin and Charge Control of Topological End States in Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons on a 2D Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral graphene nanoribbons on a ferromagnetic gadolinium&#8208;gold&#160;surface alloy display tunable spin and charge states at their termini. Atomic work function variations and exchange fields enabe transitions between singlet, doublet, and triplet configurations. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and a minimal Hubbard model reveal how local fields control &#960;&#8208;radicals adsorbed on magnetic substrates.








Abstract
Tailor&#8208;made graphene nanostructures can exhibit symmetry&#8208;protected topological boundary states that host localized spin&#8208;1/2 magnetic moments at half filling. However, one frequently observes charge transfer on coinage metal substrates, which results in closed&#8208;shell configurations. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, it is demonstrated here that pristine topologically nontrivial chiral graphene nanoribbons synthesized directly on the ferromagnet GdAu2 can either maintain a charge&#8208;neutral diradical state, or convert to a singly anionic doublet. As an underlying mechanism, both a work function and an exchange field modulated by the moir&#233;&#8208;induced superstructure are identified, as corroborated by Kelvin probe force microscopy and spin&#8208;flip spectroscopy. The joint electrostatic and magnetic interactions allow reversibly switching between the three spin multiplicities by atomic manipulation. An effective Hubbard dimer model is introduced that unifies the effects of local electrostatic gating, electron&#8211;electron correlation, hybridization and an&#160;exchange field to outline the phase diagram of accessible spin states. These results establish a platform for the local control of &#960;&#8208;radicals adsorbed on metallic&#160;substrates.

         <title>Mechanically Induced Bridged Interlayer Enabling Highly Reversible All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sulfur Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical mechanically induced bridged interlayer formation approach that enables highly reversible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sulfur cathodes is proposed. The mechanochemically formed LPSI interlayer simultaneously establishes an efficient and durable ionic conducting network through reduced Li&#8314; diffusion energy barrier and reinforced solid&#8211;solid interfacial contact, while functioning as redox mediators to facilitate spontaneous sulfur species activation and utilization.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high energy density, low cost, and enhanced safety features. However, constrained solid&#8208;state sulfur conversion severely limits their cycling stability and rate performance, presenting significant obstacles to industrial implementation. Here, a mechanochemical synthesis approach is developed that simultaneously addresses multiscale kinetic limitations of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sulfur cathodes across molecular, interfacial, and electrode levels. The in situ generated amorphous lithium iodothiophosphate (LPSI) interlayer, chemically bridged between sulfur active materials and sulfide catholytes, establishes effective and durable Li&#8208;ion conduction pathways through reduced diffusion resistance and reinforced interfacial contact. Moreover, the LPSI functions as percolated redox mediators that modulate sulfur redox pathways and electrochemically activate sulfur species, facilitating rapid sulfur redox kinetics. The developed sulfur cathode (S@LPSI/LPSC) demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, maintaining 93.8% capacity retention, exceeding 1600 cycles at a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and an elevated current density of 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Pouch cells incorporating the S@LPSI/LPSC cathode demonstrate gravimetric energy densities exceeding 420&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides valuable insights into highly reversible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sulfur cathodes, significantly advancing the industrialization of ASSLSB technology.

         <title>Design Strategies and Roles of Hydrogels for Sustainable Energy Conversion and Harvesting from Natural and Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines hydrogel&#8208;based technologies driven by environmental stimuli and emphasizes their unique contributions to energy conversion. It provides insights into design strategies and recent advancements in functional hydrogels, highlighting opportunities and challenges in this field. As hydrogel&#8208;based energy harvesting evolves, innovative design, deeper mechanistic understanding, and interdisciplinary integration are needed to unlock its potential.








Abstract
The growing demand for sustainable energy has spurred interest in harvesting ambient sources, such as solar radiation, mechanical vibrations, water flow, and temperature gradients, and biological activities, such as motion and respiration. In this context, hydrogels have emerged as promising materials bridging natural and physiological energy environments. Known for their polymer networks and biocompatibility, hydrogels are widely used across bioengineering, biomedicine, and agriculture. Beyond these applications, hydrogels are also gaining attention in environmental and energy&#8208;related technologies, including solar&#8208;driven desalination, catalysis, and energy generation and storage. Their appeal lies in unique physicochemical properties, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, tunable interfacial chemistry, environmental benignity, and efficient mass and heat transfer while maintaining mechanical compatibility with hybrid or soft&#8211;hard systems. Despite these promising attributes, few reviews focus on the role of hydrogels in energy harvesting. This review addresses that gap by examining hydrogel&#8208;based technologies driven by environmental stimuli and emphasizing their unique contributions to energy conversion. It offers insights into design strategies and recent advancements in functional hydrogels, highlighting opportunities and challenges in this field. As hydrogel&#8208;based energy harvesting evolves, innovative design, deeper mechanistic understanding, and interdisciplinary integration are needed to unlock its potential.

One&#8208;step interfacial redox strategy for enhancing catalytic performance in seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis is a promising strategy for sustainable hydrogen production, yet it faces critical challenges in catalyst design, including scalability, chloride corrosion resistance, and cost efficiency. A one&#8208;step interfacial redox strategy is reported to construct Fe/Co co&#8208;doped Ru@Ni(OH)2 electrodes (Ru@FeCo&#8211;Ni(OH)2), enabling precise control of metal coordination environments while ensuring industrial&#8208;scale manufacturability. This method enables the fabrication of 5000 cm2 electrodes with no performance deviation, demonstrating compatibility with commercial electrolyzers. The Ru@FeCo&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrodes exhibit remarkable durability (&gt;3000&#160;h) and achieve hydrogen production at $0.87 per kg using natural seawater from the South China Sea (unpurified, with KOH added), surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy's 2031 cost target of $1 per kg. Operando spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a synergistic co&#8208;doping mechanism: 1) d&#8208;band center downshifting (&#916;E = 0.68&#160;eV) optimizes hydrogen adsorption for superior hydrogen evolution reaction performance, while 2) accelerated surface reconstruction forms chloride&#8208;resistant oxyhydroxide layers, improving oxygen evolution reaction efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm in bifunctional catalyst design, providing mechanistic insights into active site evolution and a scalable pathway for cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production directly from seawater.

         <title>The Bionic Interface: Considering the Material Mediated Electrical Stimulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical stimulation directs stem cell fate in tissue engineering. Cellular responses are influenced by membrane properties, intrinsic cell state, material charge&#8208;transport characteristics, and the applied electrical signal. Additionally, a material&#8217;s ability to inject, store, and redistribute charge further modulates these responses. Understanding these mechanisms enables the rational design of highly effective electroactive scaffolds for precise stem cell control.








Abstract
Electromaterials, in the field of tissue engineering, are designed to use an electrical signal to induce specific biological responses in cells and tissues. Using materials to control stem cell fate is a substantial field of research within tissue engineering, where stem cell differentiation is controlled through careful design of the material properties (roughness, topography, stiffness, and surface chemistry); the introduction of electromaterials into this field has added an extra dimensionality along with the ability to provide dynamic, temporally controlled cues through electrical stimulation. While significant research has focused on the cell&#8208;material interface for electrical stimulation platforms, the underlying reasons why certain materials outperform others remain poorly understood. Most existing studies emphasise mechanical stiffness and chemical composition, often overlooking the role of electronic charge transport. In this perspective, the focus is shifted to the charge transport properties of commonly used electrically conductive materials&#8212;such as metal&#8208;based electrode, carbon&#8208;based composites, and conjugated polymers&#8212;and discusses how these mechanisms modulate cellular responses. It is proposed that a deeper understanding of how materials inject, store, and redistribute charge at the interface can offer a new paradigm in designing electrically active scaffolds for more predictable and effective stem cell modulation.

         <title>Ultrafast Preparation of 10&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;Thick Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Au (111) Foils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
10&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Au (111) foils are rapidly prepared by annealing commercial polycrystalline Au foils in air at 1040 &#176;C. The mechanism of multiple abnormal grains growth is revealed by combining experiments and phase&#8208;field simulation. During the annealing, oxygen plays an important role in inhibiting thermal grooves of grain boundaries, thereby reducing the resistance to abnormal grain growth.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal Au foils are widely used in mechanics, catalysis, and as substrates for 2D material growth. However, the preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Au foils, particularly thin foils, remains challenging because of the inhibition of abnormal grain growth by thermal grooves caused by surface self&#8208;diffusion. Here, an oxygen&#8208;promoted annealing method is reported for the preparation of 10&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick single&#8208;crystal Au (111) foils. The nonuniform distribution of residual stress in the polycrystalline Au foil accelerates the growth and coalescence of multiple abnormal grains, so that a single&#8208;crystal Au (111) foil with an area of up to 100&#8208;cm2 can be obtained within a 10 min annealing process. This method demonstrates superior preparation efficiency compared to current techniques. Mechanistic analysis confirms that oxygen incorporation effectively inhibits the formation of thermal grooves, and the resulting reduction in groove depth enhances abnormal grain growth. Furthermore, bulk single&#8208;crystal Au (111) foils can be prepared using the as&#8208;obtained foils as an epitaxial template. This method is also applicable for the preparation of single&#8208;crystal Pt (111) foils. The findings open new pathways for the scalable production and application of single&#8208;crystal noble metal foils.

         <title>2D Chitin Sub&#8208;Nanosheets with Extreme Ion Transport for Nanofluidic Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study exfoliates chitin sub&#8208;nanosheets (&#8776;0.7 nm) via acid&#8208;directed stripping and&#160;mechanical dispersion, enabling&#160; an ultrathin nanofluidic membrane (&lt;2 &#181;m) through vacuum&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly. Applied to environmental sensing, it shows ultrahigh sensitivity. In osmotic energy harvesting, it achieves 12.95 W&#160;m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold gradient&#8212;the highest reported for bio&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
Nanofluidic membranes possess unique ion&#8208;selective transport properties, offering considerable potential for energy harvesting and sensing applications. However, the scarcity of anion&#8208;selective membranes has significantly hindered progress in these fields. Herein, the energy disparities among chitin crystalline planes are exploited to selectively cleave the low&#8208;energy (020) plane, facilitating the directional exfoliation of Bouligand&#8208;structured chitin into 2D sub&#8208;nanosheets (CSs) with an average thickness of 0.7 nm and lateral dimensions of 50&#8211;100 nm. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that a reduction in thickness significantly enhances both the ion transport flux (1.53 times) and selectivity (1.14 times), which in turn boosts the power output density to 12.95 W&#160;m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient surpassing all&#8208;existing biomass&#8208;based nanofluidic membranes (max. 2.87&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2) and the commercial benchmark (5.0 W&#160;m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the membranes' extreme ion management capabilities facilitate real&#8208;time nanofluidic sensing, as demonstrated in jellyfish cultivation monitoring. This study presents a cost&#8208;effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, positively&#8208;charged nanofluidic membranes with exceptional energy harvesting and sensing capabilities, laying the foundation for advanced energy and sensing technologies.

         <title>Comparative Advances in Sulfide and Halide Electrolytes for Commercialization of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compares sulfide&#8208; and halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs), highlighting their ionic conductivity, chemical stability, manufacturability, and compatibility with lithium metal. Sulfides offer higher conductivity, while halides provide enhanced stability and scalability. The study emphasizes hybrid strategies, interfacial design, and material selection to enable safer, high&#8208;performance, and commercially viable next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) outperform lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in safety, energy density, and thermal stability. Their performance depends on high ionic conductivity, chemical/physical stability, and scalable manufacture of solid electrolytes (SEs). This study compares sulfide&#8208; and halide&#8208;based SEs, two promising next&#8208;generation energy storage options. Soft mechanics permit sulfides with high room&#8208;temperature conductivity, low activation energies, and processability, but high&#8208;voltage cathode instability, moisture sensitivity, and probable hydrogen sulfide (H2S) release. Market prospects are favorable as the industry improves crystallinity and elemental substitution, especially for automotive cells. Chloride&#8208;based halides are more environmentally friendly, have adequate voltage stability, and can be used with oxide cathodes without coatings. Despite traditionally low conductivity, high&#8208;entropy, and oxyhalide chemistries currently reach 10 mS cm&#8722;1, and scalable solvent syntheses and dry processing are driving adoption. Mechanical compliance and the use of rare elements (In, Sc) continue to cause integration and cost issues. Composition, microstructure, synthesis techniques, interfacial behavior, mechanical characteristics, and scalability are evaluated. The findings show sulfides have better conductivity and Li&#8208;metal compatibility, but halides are more stable and manufacturable, recommending hybrid or tailored material selection based on application. Optimizing ASSB systems requires complementary sulfide/chloride utilization due to halides' mechanical constraints.

Soft mechanics permit sulfides with high room-temperature conductivity, low activation energies, and processability, but high-voltage cathode instability, moisture sensitivity, and probable hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) release. Market prospects are favorable as the industry improves crystallinity and elemental substitution, especially for automotive cells. Chloride-based halides are more environmentally friendly, have adequate voltage stability, and can be used with oxide cathodes without coatings. Despite traditionally low conductivity, high-entropy, and oxyhalide chemistries currently reach 10 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and scalable solvent syntheses and dry processing are driving adoption. Mechanical compliance and the use of rare elements (In, Sc) continue to cause integration and cost issues. Composition, microstructure, synthesis techniques, interfacial behavior, mechanical characteristics, and scalability are evaluated. The findings show sulfides have better conductivity and Li-metal compatibility, but halides are more stable and manufacturable, recommending hybrid or tailored material selection based on application. Optimizing ASSB systems requires complementary sulfide/chloride utilization due to halides' mechanical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Implanting Crystal Nuclei at the Buried Interface to Regulate the Growth of Inorganic Perovskite for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface of TiO2 with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminobutyl)guanidine sulfate (AGS) is modified to improve the performance of inorganic perovskite solar cells. AGS can induce in situ formation of PbSO4 crystal nuclei and regulate perovskite crystallization. Furthermore, better energy&#8208;level alignment and the inhibition of ion migration are also demonstrated. Therefore, the AGS&#8208;modified devices exhibit a high efficiency of 22.22%, with superior operational stability.








Abstract
The substitution of organic cations with inorganic Cs+ in metal halide perovskites provides a broad chance for the development of high&#8208;performance tandem solar cells due to excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgaps of inorganic perovskites. However, the buried interface that governs interfacial charge transport and initialization of perovskite film crystallization is often overlooked due to difficulties in tailoring it. Herein, a strategy of modifying TiO2 surface with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminobutyl) guanidine sulfate (AGS) is proposed to tackle these issues. It is found that the introduction of AGS induces in situ formation of PbSO4 dots and interaction with perovskite precursors, which rigorously regulate the crystallization of inorganic perovskite, featuring fast nucleation and acceleration of the phase transition process. This results in more uniform films, enlarged grain size, with reduced defects. The modified buried interface exhibits alleviated strain, suppressed ion migration, fewer voids, and better contact. Together with improved interfacial energy level match between perovskite and TiO2, the power conversion efficiency of modified inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) increases from 19.84% to 22.22%, with a voltage deficit of only 0.44&#160;V. Furthermore, PSCs still maintain 91.5% of its initial value after continuous operation at maximum power point tracking and illumination for 800&#160;h.

         <title>A Promising Biomimetic Hydrogen Sulfide System for Advancing Inflammatory Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by endogenous enzymatic H2S production, a biomimetic H2S supply system is developed. This system sustainably produces H2S at a constant rate throughout the dosing period, ensuring therapeutic efficacy while avoiding toxicity. This strategy also presents a versatile platform for delivering other highly reactive gasotransmitters with great therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exhibits a Janus&#8208;faced nature in the regulation of inflammatory diseases, acting as both a therapeutic agent and a pathological aggravator. Effectively harnessing its beneficial effects while mitigating its harmful impacts is pivotal for advancing H2S&#8208;based therapies. Here, an innovative H2S supply system is introduced that enables H2S to primarily exhibit its therapeutic effects. Unlike conventional synthetic H2S donor&#8208;based strategies, a biomimetic H2S supply system (termed CP) is presented that mimics endogenous enzymatic H2S production. The CP sustainably produces H2S at a constant rate throughout the dosing period, ensuring therapeutic benefits while avoiding toxicity. Furthermore, by functionalizing CP with hyaluronic acid, the resulting system (CPH) not only achieves targeted delivery to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) tissues but also provides controllable H2S production within the diseased microenvironment. Consequently, CPH significantly mitigates immune inflammation, promotes intestinal epithelial barrier repair, and modulates gut microbiota by sustainably and constantly supplying the multifunctional H2S. This study revolutionizes the H2S supply strategies and provides new insights into gas&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Probing Local Asymmetric Site Anchored Anion Based on Multifunctional Polymer Electrolyte for Sustainable Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals an asymmetric Na+ transport mechanism in the PDNC electrolyte, in which nanocellulose selectively coordinates Na+, immobilizes anions, and promotes fast ion conduction, ultimately enabling stable sodium metal battery operation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SSMBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their inherent safety and high energy density. Among these various SSMBs, however, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) suffer from low room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity, poor mechanical stability, and unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. To alleviate the detrimental effects, the study has designed a multifunctional polymer electrolyte based on localized asymmetric anion anchoring sites. After introducing nanocellulose (NC) fillers to form asymmetric PVDF&#8208;NC (PDNC)&#160;surface sites locally, the PDNC matrix can effectively coordinate TFSI&#8722; and Na+. This coordination facilitates the rapid transport of Na+, enabling effective regulation of sodium ion migration pathways and anion behavior. Specifically, &#8208;CF2&#8208;, F&#8722;, and N3&#8722; species stemming from the decomposition of CF3SO2NSO22&#8722; and CF3&#8208; groups through cleavage and reduction processes combine with Na to form NaF and Na3N, thereby enhancing interfacial stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that the asymmetric sites facilitate charge exchange and enhance interactions between the electrolyte and different molecules. The system demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance and universality when paired with diverse cathodes (layered oxides and polyanion compounds). This work provides a sustainable strategy for designing high&#8208;performance SPEs, thus paving the way for safe and scalable SSMBs.

         <title>Conjugated Macrocycles for Host&#8208;Guest Recognition and Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated macrocycles, including those with axially oriented &#960;&#8208;orbitals and radially oriented &#960;&#8208;orbitals, demonstrate significant potential in host&#8208;guest recognition as well as optoelectronic device applications such as organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and organic solar cells (OSCs).








Abstract
Since the 1960s, &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles have garnered significant interest from both organic and materials chemists due to their aesthetically pleasing molecular architectures, distinctive electronic features, and tunable optical properties. Recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in the design of synthetic strategies, geometric structure construction, and physicochemical property optimization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, thereby fostering their applications and development in supramolecular chemistry and organic electronic materials.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Driven Dual&#8208;Function Wood Composites: Integrating Hydrovoltaic Generation and Thermal Management in Architectural Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a biomass dual&#8208;functional platform with chemically modified metasequoia wood, using vertical microchannels for concurrent power generation and evaporative cooling. The prototype cabin demonstrates stable performance in diverse scenarios, validated by practical tests for off&#8208;grid energy and cooling in sustainable architecture. 








Abstract
Natural materials, prized for their hierarchical microchannels, eco&#8208;friendliness, and low cost, show great promise for evaporation&#8208;driven power generation. Yet developing them into bifunctional platforms that simultaneously produce electricity and cooling remains an unmet challenge. This study demonstrates a biomass&#8208;based dual&#8208;functional platform using chemically modified metasequoia wood for concurrent electricity generation and evaporative cooling. The wood's vertically aligned microchannels enable anisotropic water transport, integrating carboxylation&#8208;modified structure with stainless steel electrodes to form a green energy device. In deionized water, it delivers &#8776;265.8 mV open&#8208;circuit voltage, &#8776;4.3 &#181;A short&#8208;circuit current, and a record &#8776;408 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2 power density&#8212;beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomass harvesters constructed via interface engineering. Its stable, adaptable performance across environments is further enhanced by circuit integration. Under solar radiation, an energy&#8208;saving cabin prototype achieves &#8776;6.1 &#176;C cooling (&#8776;857.5 W&#160;m&#8722;2) and maintains &#8776;2.1 &#176;C night&#8208;time temperature reduction. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a metasequoia wood cabin prototype, generates power and cools simultaneously. Yangzhou tests show &#8776;1580&#8211;1630 mV output and &#8776;4.9&#160;&#176;C/1.1&#160;&#176;C day/night cooling, proving sustainable architecture viability. This work innovates sustainable energy&#8208;water technologies, enabling off&#8208;grid power and passive cooling for self&#8208;sufficient architectures.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Ni&#8208;Doped Cu&#8208;Based Catalyst Shielded by Carbon Overlayer for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid plasma shock approach creates a Ni&#8208;doped Cu catalyst with a protective carbon overlayer for efficient ammonia electrosynthesis, which suppresses surface degradation and boosts NO3&#8722; hydrogenation by optimizing intermediate adsorption and hydrogen availability.








Abstract
Plasma&#8208;enabled N2 oxidation coupled with electrocatalytic NOx&#8722; reduction (pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR) represents a highly promising approach for sustainable, scalable, and distributed NH3 production under mild conditions. However, the eNOx&#8722;RR for NH3 synthesis is hindered by catalyst degradation, which results in low NH3 selectivity and poor stability. Here, inspired by solid&#8208;state source doping in photolithography, this work reports a rapid plasma shock strategy to build a Ni&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;based catalyst shielded by a carbon overlayer. It demonstrates long&#8208;term stability, maintaining an NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96% for 156&#160;h at a current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More importantly, this work establishes a continuous&#8208;flow pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR system using air and water as feedstocks, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 5.36&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 FE of 85%. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the carbon overlayer suppresses electrochemical surface degradation and stabilizes the coexistence of Cu2O and Cu during eNO3&#8722;RR, while Ni doping simultaneously balances the mismatch between NO3&#8722; adsorption and *H supply and accelerates both processes. This study provides a new approach for designing stable catalysts and offers insights into the pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR system, paving the way for continuous NH3 production directly from air and water under ambient conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Switching Dynamic Infrared Radiative Cooler Enabling Triple&#8208;Mode Temperature Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;switching dynamic infrared radiative cooler is proposed that enables adapting selective and broadband infrared emission spectrum conversion through temperature&#8208;regulated molecular vibrations engineering without external energy input. The dynamic infrared radiative cooler achieves triple&#8208;mode temperature regulation, including sub&#8208;ambient building cooling, near&#8208;ambient personal comfort cooling, and above&#8208;ambient solar panels cooling.








Abstract
Passive radiative cooling offers zero&#8208;energy heat dissipation, yet static photonic structures fail in multi&#8208;scenario applications due to distinct or even incompatible requirements of infrared emission spectra across different thermal environments. Herein, a self&#8208;switching dynamic infrared radiative cooler (DIRC) is proposed that achieves triple&#8208;mode temperature regulation, including sub&#8208;ambient, near&#8208;ambient, and above&#8208;ambient cooling application. By leveraging temperature&#8208;triggered directional migration of broadband emission water molecules within thermoresponsive hydrogel, the spectral conversion between infrared selective emission for sub&#8208;ambient cooling and broadband emission for above&#8208;ambient cooling is realized. The resulting DIRC exhibits an average broadband emissivity of 94.1% across 2.5&#8211;25&#160;&#181;m and adaptively switches to a selective emissivity of 81.6% within the 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m, solar reflectivity maintains &#8776;90% during spectral conversion. The spectral transition is rapid and autonomous, with response times between 85.6 and 37.3 s across 35&#8211;45&#160;&#176;C temperature range. Notably, triple&#8208;mode thermal&#8208;regulated DIRC achieves a sub&#8208;ambient cooling of 9.5&#160;&#176;C for building thermal management, near&#8208;ambient cooling of 7.0&#160;&#176;C for enhanced personal comfort, and above&#8208;ambient cooling of 6.9&#160;&#176;C for photovoltaic panels. By overcoming the single&#8208;scenario and weather conditions limitations of static designs, the proposed DIRC represents a versatile strategy for triple&#8208;mode thermal regulation across a wide applications.

         <title>Adaptive and Multifunctional Emulsion Solar Evaporators with High Operating Stability in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;like Pickering emulsion solar evaporator is developed for the first time, which enables continuous, stable, and ultrahigh&#8208;rate water evaporation under harsh conditions, including oil contamination, high salinity, and bacteria, while offering self&#8208;cleaning, pollutant degradation, and recyclability. This multifunctional and adaptable platform provides a transformative solution for sustainable clean water production in complex environments.








Abstract
Global water scarcity and pollution demand innovative solutions for sustainable clean water production. While interfacial solar evaporation holds great promise, current evaporators face significant challenges in achieving stable clean water&#160;productivity under harsh conditions. Here, a highly adaptive, liquid&#8208;like, multifunctional Pickering emulsion solar evaporator is developed, which can be formed in situ on oil&#8208;contaminated water or preconstructed with optimized rheological properties for flexible and scalable deployment. The resulting emulsion evaporator exhibits multidirectional water transport pathways, enhanced thermal localization, controllable salt deposition, and gravity&#8208;assisted self&#8208;cleaning capabilities. During operation, this evaporator can actively integrate oil contaminants into its emulsion structure without compromising efficiency, while inhibiting salt accumulation, realizing stable, long&#8208;term ultrahigh&#8208;rate evaporation (12.5&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) even in hypersaline (26&#160;wt.%) conditions under elevated solar irradiation intensity (11 kW cm&#8722;2). It also degrades organic pollutants (e.g., nearly 100% phenol removal), deactivates bacteria, and prevents biofouling. Its phase transformation capability enables easy recovery and recycling, further enhancing practicality and sustainability. This study overcomes the limitations of conventional solid&#8208;state solar evaporators, offering a versatile platform for clean water production in challenging environments.

     alt="Adaptive and Multifunctional Emulsion Solar Evaporators with High Operating Stability in Extreme Environments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A liquid-like Pickering emulsion solar evaporator is developed for the first time, which enables continuous, stable, and ultrahigh-rate water evaporation under harsh conditions, including oil contamination, high salinity, and bacteria, while offering self-cleaning, pollutant degradation, and recyclability. This multifunctional and adaptable platform provides a transformative solution for sustainable clean water production in complex environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global water scarcity and pollution demand innovative solutions for sustainable clean water production. While interfacial solar evaporation holds great promise, current evaporators face significant challenges in achieving stable clean water&#160;productivity under harsh conditions. Here, a highly adaptive, liquid-like, multifunctional Pickering emulsion solar evaporator is developed, which can be formed in situ on oil-contaminated water or preconstructed with optimized rheological properties for flexible and scalable deployment. The resulting emulsion evaporator exhibits multidirectional water transport pathways, enhanced thermal localization, controllable salt deposition, and gravity-assisted self-cleaning capabilities. During operation, this evaporator can actively integrate oil contaminants into its emulsion structure without compromising efficiency, while inhibiting salt accumulation, realizing stable, long-term ultrahigh-rate evaporation (12.5&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) even in hypersaline (26&#160;wt.%) conditions under elevated solar irradiation intensity (11 kW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It also degrades organic pollutants (e.g., nearly 100% phenol removal), deactivates bacteria, and prevents biofouling. Its phase transformation capability enables easy recovery and recycling, further enhancing practicality and sustainability. This study overcomes the limitations of conventional solid-state solar evaporators, offering a versatile platform for clean water production in challenging environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Mechanoluminescence Performance in Doped CaZnOS by the Facile Self&#8208;Reduction Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;reduction primarily enhances mechanoluminescence intensity by deliberately introducing lattice defects, which increase structural distortion and amplify the piezoelectric response, thereby improving the force&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion efficiency. Additionally, self&#8208;reduction optimizes the local distribution of Mn2+ ions, promoting energy concentration within the emission band.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML), the emission of light under mechanical stimuli, shows great potential in passive sensing, wearable devices, and biomedical diagnostics. However, the practical application of ML materials is hindered by low intensity and poor self&#8208;recoverable performance. Herein, a Mn4+&#8594;Mn2+ self&#8208;reduction strategy is presented to significantly enhance the self&#8208;recoverable ML performance of CaZnOS by inducing lattice defects and promoting distortion in its noncentrosymmetric hexagonal structure. This approach enhances the internal piezoelectric response and increases the maximum ML intensity up to 4 times. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, electron paramagnetic resonance, piezoresponse force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations reveal that the composite defects involving VO&#183;&#183;${\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}}^{\cdot \cdot}$ and VZn&#8242;&#8242;${\mathrm{V}}_{{\mathrm{Zn}}}^{{\mathrm{^{\prime\prime}}}}$ are the key to the significant enhancement of ML. Furthermore, this strategy is successfully extended to rare&#8208;earth ions codoped systems, achieving a general enhancement of near&#8208;infrared ML emission. Based on these findings, a multilayer orthodontic sensor is developed, capable of real&#8208;time occlusal mapping and bite&#8208;force monitoring. The device exhibits sensitive response across 0&#8211;12 N and achieves 96.89% accuracy in occlusal localization through neuromorphic image recognition. This work offers a generalizable route toward ML performance optimization and paves the way for the development of advanced intelligent sensing technologies.

         <title>Beyond Transistor Miniaturization: A Single&#8208;Device Approach to Reconfigurable Logic Gates in 2D Organic Single&#8208;Crystalline Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;device platform integrating transistors, rectifiers, and logic gates using 2D organic single&#8208;crystalline heterojunctions is reported. The device achieves a record rectification ratio of 1.1 &#215;&#160;108 and enables real&#8208;time reconfiguration between AND and OR logic operations through polarity&#8208;controlled charge injection and bias&#8208;modulated photoresponse.








Abstract
Reconfigurable device architectures are crucial for overcoming the scaling limitations of organic electronics. In this study, a single&#8208;device platform is presented that integrates transistor, rectifier, and logic gate functionalities using molecularly thin 2D organic single&#8208;crystalline heterojunctions. The reconfigurable asymmetric heterojunction (RAH), featuring a drain&#8208;aligned p&#8211;n interface, enables polarity&#8208;controlled switching between Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling and thermally activated injection, achieving a record rectification ratio of 1.1 &#215;&#160;108 and a dynamic rectification window spanning eight orders of magnitude. The asymmetric injection also induces a significant bias&#8208;polarity&#8208;dependent photoresponse, with a maximum photoresponsivity of 788&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a specific detectivity of 1.17 &#215;&#160;1014 Jones under positive bias, and a substantially suppressed photoresponse due to heterointerface recombination under negative bias. The synergistic interplay between electrostatic gating and bias&#8208;modulated photocarrier transport further enables real&#8208;time reconfiguration between AND and OR logic operations within a single device, effectively doubling functional density. These results position 2D RAHs as building blocks for compact, reconfigurable optoelectronic circuits.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Reservoir Computing with a Reconfigurable Multifunctional Memristor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a hardware physical reservoir computing system using a tri&#8208;modal memristive crossbar array. Stochastic masking, bistable nonlinear activation, and analog readout enable fully in&#8208;memory spatiotemporal processing. Demonstrations on cellular automata, Lorenz prediction, ADHD EEG classification, and chaotic KS modeling highlight its multifunctionality and potential for compact, reconfigurable reservoir&#8208;computing hardware.








Abstract
The existing physical implementations of reservoir computing are constrained mainly by time&#8208;delay architectures that lack capabilities for spatial data processing. This study presents a multifunctional memristor&#8208;based reservoir computing system, the memristive echo state network (MESN), which enables spatiotemporal computation within a single device crossbar array. Utilizing a reconfigurable Ta/HfO2/RuO2 memristor, three distinct switching modes are realized: stochastic for input masking, bistable for sigmoidal activation, and analog for precise readout. A full in&#8208;memory implementation is experimentally demonstrated using a one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;resistor crossbar array integrated with indium oxide thin&#8208;film transistors. Spatial inference is validated through cellular automata, confirming reliable hardware operation. High&#8208;level simulations based on the hardware results demonstrate the performance of the proposed MESN, achieving high accuracy in predicting the Lorenz attractor and classifying attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The system also predicted the Kuramoto&#8211;Sivashinsky equation, representing the first memristor&#8208;based reservoir to model complex spatiotemporal partial differential equations. These results highlight the potential of multifunctional memristor arrays for scalable in&#8208;memory spatiotemporal computing.

         <title>Confined Dynamic and Static Disorder Realized by Entropy Engineering, a New Path to Excellent High Temperature Energy Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by reviewing the recent research in the field of high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage, a new paradigm of achieving superior energy storage performance is proposed through entropy engineering to regulate the dynamic/static disorder in polymers. This new paradigm has good inclusiveness for many previous research results and may have significant implications for in&#8208;depth research in the field of high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based capacitors are essential in modern electronics, yet their energy storage performance declines significantly at high temperatures, limiting extreme&#8208;condition applications. Extensive research has been conducted to address this challenge. Since ideal dielectrics are insulators, existing models often empirically summarize conductive behaviors based on inorganic materials. However, the complex aggregated structures of polymers make accurately describing their conduction particularly difficult. This review consolidates previous findings and proposes a novel research paradigm centered on the internal order degree of the polymer system. Grounded in thermodynamic principles and experimental studies on polymer conduction, this framework offers a fresh perspective for understanding the nonlinear conductive behavior under high temperatures and electric fields. It provides critical insights for designing advanced polymer&#8208;based capacitors with superior high&#8208;temperature performance.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Type Solvation Structure Enables Freeze&#8208;Tolerant Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To construct freeze&#8208;tolerant aqueous Zn&#8208;V batteries with improved low&#8208;temperature performance, a fluorinated solvent with weak coordination and dissociation capacity is utilized as a functional co&#8208;solvent to re&#8208;shape the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+ from H2O&#8208;dominated to anion&#8208;dominated in an aqueous environment.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries represent a promising solution for large&#8208;scale energy storage, offering inherent safety and cost advantages. However, their subzero operation is fundamentally constrained by severely retarded reaction kinetics of Zn2+. Herein, to construct high&#8208;performance, freeze&#8208;tolerant aqueous zinc&#8208;vanadium batteries, 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) with weak coordination and dissociation capacity is introduced as a functional co&#8208;solvent to reconstruct Zn2&#8314; solvation structures from water&#8208;dominated ([Zn(H2O)6]2+) to anion&#8208;dominated ([Zn(H2O)2(OTf&#8722;)4]2&#8722;) in 1&#160;M Zn(OTf)2. The as&#8208;constructed anion&#8208;type solvation configuration creates low&#8208;barrier desolvation/migration ion channels and anion&#8208;rich interface, leading to key improvements in bulk Zn2&#8314; ion transport and interfacial stability, benefiting both the anodic and cathodic chemistry. Substantial improvement of Zn plating/stripping reversibility, contributed by promoted Zn&#8208;diffusion kinetics and OTf&#8722;&#8208;derived robust protective interphase, is obtained from 25 to &#8722;20 &#176;C, while long&#8208;term structure integrity of NaV3O8&#8729;1.5H2O cathode, attributed to the prohibition of H2O&#8208;driven degradation and dissolution issues, is also effectively maintained. Consequently, even at &#8722;20 &#176;C, where the pure aqueous electrolyte hardly works, the Zn||NaV3O8&#8729;1.5H2O assembled in 2&#8208;MeTHF&#8208;containing electrolyte still presents long&#8208;term cycling durability up to 8000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1, with negligible capacity decay throughout the test. This work highlights the significant role of anion&#8208;type solvation of Zn2+ in achieving wide&#8208;temperature aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>Reconfigurable Magnetotransport in MnBi2Te4 via Gate and Magnetic Field Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gate&#8208;tunable magnetoresistance sign reversal under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields is observed in an ultrathin MnBi2Te4 device, arising from spin reorientation and distinct scattering mechanisms. Moreover, angular&#8208;dependent measurements reveal clear gate&#8208;controlled magnetotransport anisotropy, underscoring the strong coupling between gating, spin configuration, and transport behavior in MnBi2Te4.








Abstract
The intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 is a promising platform for exploring quantum phases with nontrivial band topology and for enabling electrical control over coupled magnetic and electronic phase transitions. In&#8208;plane magnetic fields, in particular, offer a distinct means of tuning these properties by strengthening quantized Hall effects, enhancing surface energy gaps, and driving spin reorientation transitions. However, a systematic understanding of how such fields affect magnetotransport is limited. Here, the magnetotransport behavior of few&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 as a function of gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field angle, with a primary focus on in&#8208;plane field effects, are investigated. A gate&#8208;tunable crossover in magnetoresistance is observed from positive to negative values under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as the gate voltage is swept below the charge neutrality point at temperatures below the N&#233;el temperature. The in&#8208;plane field drives a transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a ferromagnetic configuration with spins aligned in&#8208;plane, while simultaneously altering the electronic structure, as revealed by gate&#8208;dependent transport features. The angle&#8208;dependent measurements reveal strongly gate&#8208;tunable magnetotransport anisotropy. These results establish in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as an effective tuning parameter for modulating spin and charge transport in MnBi2Te4, advancing prospects for reconfigurable spintronic and topological devices.

         <title>Chloroaluminate Molten Salts for Low&#8208;Temperature Electrochemical Recycling of Layered Metal Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point alkali chloroaluminate (AlCl3&#8211;LiCl) melt electrolyte, a low&#8208;temperature electrochemical recycling (LTMS&#8208;ECR) approach is developed, operating at only 150&#160;&#176;C. High O2&#8722; solubility in the melt facilitates the reductive de&#8208;structuring of cathodes, while the insolubility of resulting products enables their facile separation via water leaching. The LTMS&#8208;ECR approach is energy&#8208;saving and offers a 97.3% cobalt recovery rate with high economic viability.








Abstract
Electrochemical recycling (ECR) offers a promising strategy that harnesses renewable energy to deconstruct spent layered metal oxides (LMOs). However, current ECR approaches are limited to high&#8208;temperature operation (up to 750&#160;&#176;C) employing alkali carbonate or chloride melts as electrolytes, leading to high energy consumption for heat input. Here, this study proposes a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point alkali chloroaluminate melt electrolyte composed of AlCl3&#8211;LiCl, enabling ECR electrolysis at a temperature as low as 150&#160;&#176;C. Owing to the high solubility of O2&#8722; charge carrier in alkali chloroaluminate melt, LMO cathode undergoes electrochemical reductive de&#8208;structuring to yield elemental transition metals and lithium chloride (LiCl). Importantly, two products are insoluble in the Li2O&#8208;added melt and can be separated by a facile water leaching treatment. Notably, by incorporating an inert TiN anode, CO2 emission during the electrolysis is eliminated by instead generating O2, further contributing to carbon neutrality. With the low&#8208;temperature molten salt electrolyte ECR (LTMS&#8208;ECR) approach, a high cobalt recovery rate of 97.3% is achieved for LiCoO2. Technoeconomic analyses project that the LTMS&#8208;ECR technology reduces energy consumption and CO2 emission by &#8776;20% and is nearly ten times more profitable compared to conventional methods. The approach represents a revolutionary alternative for energy&#8208;effective, sustainable and economically viable recycling of spent LIBs.

Quantum Materials
In article number 2501884, Michael K. Bowman, Jason D. Azoulay, and co&#8208;workers report a high&#8208;spin donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymer with newly realized quantum functionalities including long solid&#8208;state spin relaxation times, coherent control of the superposition state, and single qubit operations. These attributes, coupled with high chemical tunability, robust stability, interrelated optoelectronic properties, and solution processability, offer a fundamentally new approach to readily integrating quantum phenomena within functional device platforms.

These attributes, coupled with high chemical tunability, robust stability, interrelated optoelectronic properties, and solution processability, offer a fundamentally new approach to readily integrating quantum phenomena within functional device platforms.

Bioinspired Smart Nanogels
Inspired by the spiny protrusions of waxberry, dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles are designed. By loading them with thrombin and GelMA, Chaoqiang Fan, Malcolm Xing, Shiming Yang, and co&#8208;workers create a new hemostatic system. Endoscopically delivered to gastrointestinal bleeding sites and activated by blue laser, this device rapidly forms a dual&#8208;network &#8216;gel&#8208;protein&#8217; barrier within seconds, achieving ultra&#8208;fast hemostasis with enhanced clot stability. More details can be found in article number 2506955.

Efficient Oxygen Reduction
In article number 2501603, Jong&#8208;Beom Baek and co&#8208;workers illustrate the tunable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through alkoxy side&#8208;chain engineering. The alkoxy&#8208;functionalized COFs exhibit enhanced hydrophilicity and optimized pore wall electronic environments, enabling stronger adsorption of water and *OOH intermediates. This study highlights a new strategy to tailor the COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts via molecular side&#8208;chain modulation.

All&#8208;Heat Control of Magnetization Dynamics
As the demand for data&#8208;driven technologies accelerates, the need to enhance the efficiency of how heat is generated and dissipated in data storage becomes critical. In article number 2501043, Elton J. G. Santos and co&#8208;workers show that magnetisation dynamics induced by ultrafast laser pulses in novel van der Waals magnets is determined by the thermal conductivity mismatch between the underneath substrate and the magnetic media.

         <title>Emerging Surface Engineering Methods for Lithium Metal Anodes: Critical Review Beyond Conventional SEI and Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores innovative strategies to overcome the limitations of traditional lithium metal anodes by focusing on tunable SEI designs, chemical synergies, and advanced fabrication techniques. It highlights recent breakthroughs that improve battery performance and safety while proposing integrative approaches to address remaining challenges for practical applications.








Abstract
For rechargeable lithium batteries with high energy density, lithium metal anode is an ideal candidate due to its high theoretical capacity (3860 mAh g&#8722;1) and low electrode potential (&#8722;3.04&#160;V versus standard hydrogen electrode). Despite its promising characteristics, it faces formidable obstacles such as dendritic growth and poor formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To overcome such obstacles, multifaceted unconventional surface engineering approaches are hypothesized, tested, and examined. In this review, in addition to the conventional SEI and surface coatings, the principles and recent progress of the unconventional surface engineering methods are summarized and assessed, based on the interfacial thermodynamics and factors governing the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. It connects and provides the newest insight on material science, design methodologies, and fabrication techniques, which require significant attention. This review reveals the significance of unconventional methods in enhancing both electrochemical performance and safety of the next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current research landscape and roadmaps for future technological breakthroughs.

         <title>Inhibiting Interfacial Failure in Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries with High&#8208;Capacity Anodes: Mechanism and Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines interfacial failure mechanisms in garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) with high&#8208;capacity anodes (Si, Li). It reveals strain&#8208;induced lithiation limitations at Si/garnet interfaces and grain boundary charge effects on Li dendrite propagation. With the proposal of innovative strategies to suppress interfacial degradation, this work charts a scalable path toward industrial SSBs exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8315;&#185; energy density.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with exceptional reductive stability and superior ionic conductivity have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). However, critical interface challenges still persist in practical implementations. This review systematically examines interfacial failure mechanisms in garnet SSE systems with high&#8208;capacity anodes (Si, metallic Li) through combined mechanical&#8208;electrochemical perspectives. For Si&#8208;based anodes, a microstructure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship is established by analyzing strain mismatch&#8208;induced degradation, correlating ionic transport barriers with lithiation kinetics under varying internal microstructures, particle sizes, and external pressures. Multiscale stress&#8208;relief strategies spanning atomic&#8208;level interface engineering to macroscopic pressure optimization are proposed. Regarding Li metal interfaces, breakthrough understandings of grain boundary (GB) charge distribution effects on Li filament propagation are highlighted, along with innovative solutions for kinetic inhibition. Particular emphasis is placed on dry battery electrode (DBE) fabrication techniques as scalable approaches for achieving intimate interfacial contact in industrial&#8208;scale SSB production. By integrating fundamental mechanical&#8208;electrochemical insights with practical engineering considerations, this work quantitatively decouple&#160;the strain&#8208;lithiation interplay at Si/garnet interfaces, the regulation law of GB charge distribution on lithium dendrites and the industrial potential of combining DBE with fluidized bed technology for the first time, charting a viable path toward industrial SSBs with &gt;400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction methods, optimization strategies and application scenarios of Janus electrospun membranes (JEMs) with different structures are systematically summarized. The underlying functional principles and key mechanisms are analyzed. The practical challenges and bottlenecks faced are explored in detail to guide future researchers.








Abstract
Janus electrospun membranes (JEMs) exhibit irreplaceable advantages in advanced functional nanofiber materials. However, as an emerging concept, their profound connotations and academic value have not yet been fully recognized by the scientific community. Herein, the broad scope and relevant categories of JEM are first defined. Subsequently, the construction methods of JEMs with different layers and structures become the focus of summarization and discussion. The enhancement of interlayer bonding forces through various chemical and physical strategies, considered as the core challenge in this field, is classified and compared. Furthermore, according to different asymmetric properties, the applications of JEM in fields such as functional clothing, clean energy, and intelligent sensing are systematically reviewed. The construction methods, functional principles, and key mechanisms of JEM in various application scenarios are deeply analyzed. Finally, the practical challenges and technical bottlenecks JEM faces in large&#8208;scale preparation, performance optimization, cross&#8208;disciplinary applications, and other aspects are explored in detail, providing inspiration and guidance for promoting the technological breakthroughs and industrial transformation of JEM technology.

         <dc:description>
Sun et&#160;al. reviews recent progress in enhancing the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic selectivity of SAzymes through the rational design of their spatial coordination structures. They emphasize the structure&#8208;activity relationships of various attributes of these coordination structures in promoting selective catalytic behavior, the strategic design of coordination structures for target enzyme&#8208;like reactions, and effective synthesis methods for integrating these structures onto supports.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are nanomaterials that rely on atomic&#8208;level active sites to efficiently express catalytic functions like natural enzymes. With their outstanding robustness and exceptional atomic utilization, they are among the most competitive nanozymes used to overcome the inherent shortcomings of natural enzymes. However, SAzymes lack the precise structural complexity of natural enzymes and therefore do not exhibit the same level of catalytic selectivity&#8212;a major barrier to fully replacing natural enzymes. Previous studies have primarily focused on summarizing the methods and rules for improving the enzyme&#8208;like activity of SAzymes, while comparatively little attention has been given to their catalytic selectivity. Herein, this work reviews recent progress in enhancing the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic selectivity of SAzymes through the rational design of their spatial coordination structures. It emphasizes the structure&#8208;activity relationships of various attributes of these coordination structures in promoting selective catalytic behavior, the strategic design of coordination structures for target enzyme&#8208;like reactions, and effective synthesis methods for integrating these structures onto supports. In addition, the development prospects and current challenges in exploring SAzyme coordination structures are analyzed to provide new inspiration constructing next generation, highly selective SAzymes.

         <title>Fundamental Chemistry and Functional Mechanisms of Nitrile&#8208;Based Electrolyte in Advanced Battery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the critical role of electrolyte engineering in advancing secondary batteries with high energy density and enhanced safety, this review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of nitrile&#8208;based electrolytes. It explores the electrochemical behavior of nitriles as solvents and additives, and their influence on battery performance, and highlights recent advancements and challenges for future development.








Abstract
Nitriles have gained attention as promising candidates for secondary battery electrolytes due to the high polarity of cyano groups, excellent cathode compatibility, remarkable oxidation resistance, and broad thermal stability. As additives, nitriles effectively stabilize cathode surfaces and inhibit the dissolution of transition metals. Besides, as the electrolyte solvent, the characteristics of a wide liquidus range, excellent high&#8208;voltage tolerance, and superior conductivity endow it with outstanding performance. Moreover, nitriles are also beneficially applied in solid&#8208;state electrolytes, offering advantages such as strong cation coordination, excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, and enhanced ionic conductivity. However, obstacles such as side reactions with anodes, the formation of non&#8208;robust SEI layers, and inherent toxicity hinder their broader application. Herein, the mechanism of nitriles as additives, and the application progress of nitriles in liquid electrolytes and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are introduced in detail. Furthermore, the current challenges faced by nitriles are in depth analyzed, and the advanced modification strategies of nitriles as secondary battery electrolytes are thoroughly summarized and discussed. Additionally, the future development of nitriles in the field of secondary batteries is prospected. This review provides important references for the future development of nitrile&#8208;based electrolytes, with guiding significance for other electrolyte solvents and additives.

         <title>Activation and Stabilization Strategies of Aluminum Metal Anode Toward High Performance Aqueous Al Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review spotlights the critical challenges faced by aluminum metal anodes and aqueous electrolytes. Recent progress on activating and stabilizing Al metal anode is summarized and discussed in terms of two aspects, including anode engineering and electrolyte optimization. Finally, some revelatory insights and possible strategies are provided for the future design of high reaction activity of Al anode and electrolytes.








Abstract
Aqueous aluminum metal batteries (AAMBs) have garnered significant attention due to the abundant reserves, low cost, high theoretical capacity, and intrinsic safety of aluminum (Al). However, Al3+&#8208;based energy storage technologies remain in their nascent stages, facing a multitude of challenges. One major issue is the poor thermodynamic stability of the aluminum metal anode in aqueous electrolytes, stemming from self&#8208;corrosion, surface passivation, or hydrogen evolution reactions. These parasitic reactions dramatically reduce the reactivity, prevent reversible deposition/dissolution of aluminum, and restrict the electrochemical performance of AAMBs. This review spotlights the critical challenges faced by aluminum metal anodes and aqueous electrolytes. Then, recent progress on activating and stabilizing Al metal anode is summarized and discussed in terms of two aspects, including anode engineering and electrolyte optimization. Ultimately, future designs of high reaction activity of Al metal anode and electrolytes with high reversibility, long lifespan, and high energy density are proposed, which potentially facilitate the development of new generation of Al&#8208;based energy storage batteries.

         <title>Aramid Nanofiber Aerogels: Versatile High Complexity Components for Multifunctional Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different forms of aramid nanofibers (ANFs) and especially aerogels from them, offer a sustainable route to high&#8208;performance biomimetic nanocomposites. Due to the cartilage&#8208;like architecture, ANF&#8208;based materials enable breakthroughs in energy, electromagnetic, biomedical, and water purification technologies. This review outlines key advancements, applications, and future directions for ANF&#8208;based structures, including their engineering using graph theory capable of capturing the complex organization characteristic for a variety of high&#8208;performance biomaterials and nanostructured gels.








Abstract
Aramid nanofibers (ANFs) have emerged as versatile and readily accessible building blocks for multifunctional, complex nanostructures. A key motivation for studying and utilizing ANFs lies in their potential to directly recycle commercial macro&#8208;aramid plastics, such as poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide), for diverse applications. Retaining the advantageous properties of parent aramid fibers and fabrics, ANFs enable the creation of a variety of nanostructured solids, both independently and in combination with polymeric and nanoscale components. A wide spectrum of ANF&#8208;based aerogels is developed, many of which exhibit property sets previously unattainable in other materials&#8212;properties critical for advancing sustainable development. These biomimetic composites replicating complex organization of cartilage, combine high toughness, thermal resilience, nanoscale porosity, and low density with the capability for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing. The transformative advancements in materials for energy storage, electromagnetic interference shielding, thermal management, biomedical implants, water purification, and other applications are spurred by ANF&#8208;based aerogels and related composites. This review summarizes recent progress in the engineering, fabrication, characterization, modification, and implementation of ANF aerogels. It also highlights future research directions, potential applications, and key challenges including the development of structural descriptors for ANF solids, that must be addressed to fully realize the potential of ANF&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Adsorption Materials toward Highly&#8208;Efficient Lithium Extraction from Non&#8208;Conventional Lithium Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review establishes a systematic framework for designing lithium adsorption materials by integrating selectivity and application&#8208;driven optimization. Key challenges and opportunities from synergistic/template effects and application optimization are highlighted, emphasizing future adsorption technology directions for non&#8208;conventional lithium resources.








Abstract
The exponential growth of new energy vehicles and energy storage systems has generated an urgent and ever&#8208;increasing demand for lithium resources. As a result, efficient and direct lithium extraction (DLE) from non&#8208;conventional lithium sources, including low&#8208;grade salt&#8208;lake brines, geothermal brines, lithium&#8208;containing wastewater, and seawater, has emerged as a critical challenge for ensuring sustainable lithium supply. DLE of adsorption technology offers demonstrated unique advantages for lithium recovery from complex lithium&#8208;containing solutions, due to its operational simplicity, exceptional selectivity, and scalable accessibility. Achieving this capability fundamentally rely on the rational design of adsorption materials for lithium extraction from complex solutions, integrating high selectivity, good capacity, and robust environmental resilience. In this review, recent advancements and persisting challenges are systematically summarized in lithium extraction from these demanding yet promising resources. Specifically, one particular focus is targeted material design for Li+ recognition and practical application&#8208;oriented optimizations. In addition, a principle is presented for future lithium adsorption materials and perspectives on lithium adsorption extraction from non&#8208;conventional lithium source scenarios. This review aims to promote the development of innovative adsorption extraction methods for complex and low&#8208;concentration lithium&#8208;containing solutions.

The future of the automotive energy field is inseparable from the research and application of novel nanomaterials. This review provides a detailed overview of the potential applications of metal single&#8208;atom materials in dominating automotive fields, including fuel production, power supply equipment, and exhaust treatment.








Abstract
Automobiles are constantly evolving with advancements in green energy and environmental technologies, e.g., sustainable energy devices, green synthesis, carbon utilization, catalytic exhaust conversion, etc. Therefore, the automotive field has become a complex system engineering, which requires the coordination of these sub&#8208;fields for the future vehicle industry. Developing these sub&#8208;fields is inseparable from the research and application of novel nanomaterials. Among the nanomaterials that have emerged in recent years, metal single&#8208;atom materials (MSAMs) have received particular attention due to their ultrahigh host atom utilization rate and abundant adjustability. MSAMs will likely accelerate vehicle development, which is mainly reflected in transforming energy structures and innovating specific green technologies. Herein, we first concluded&#160;the relationship between nanomaterials and sub&#8208;applications of automobiles. Then, the progress of large&#8208;scale preparation of MSAMs and their potential applications in dominating automotive fields, including fuel production, power supply equipment, and exhaust treatment are systematically summarized. Finally, the possible contributions and impacts of MSAMs on the automotive field are presented. This review aims to provide a systematic summary of MSAMs applied in specific sustainable energy and environmental applications for vehicles, thus achieving the rational design and utilization of atomic&#8208;scale modification on nanomaterials for developing a revolutionary automobile transportation system.

         <title>All&#8208;Heat Control of Magnetization Dynamics on Van der Waals Magnets</title>

         <dc:description>
Heat dissipation in nanomagnetic devices mediated by femtosecond laser excitation constitutes one of the pressing challenges toward energy&#8208;efficient information communication technologies. Here it is shown that heat and magnetization play together to determine the ultrafast spin dynamics of van der Waals magnets across any substrates and magnet thickness.








Abstract
Heat dissipation in nanomagnetic devices mediated by femtosecond laser excitation constitutes one of the pressing challenges toward energy&#8208;efficient applications yet to be solved. Of particular interest are heterostructures based on 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which benefit from superior interfacial controllability, mechanical flexibility for smart storage platforms, and open&#8208;source for large&#8208;scale production. However, how heat affects the ultrafast magnetization dynamics in such systems, and/or how the spin dynamics can provide alternative pathways for effective heat dissipation have so far been elusive. Here it is shown that the missing link between magnetization dynamics and heat transport is mediated by the thermal conductivity mismatch between the underneath substrate and the vdW magnet. By modeling the laser&#8208;induced ultrafast spin dynamics of three popular vdW materials (CrI3, CrGeTe3, Fe3GeTe2) of different electronic characteristics across sixteen substrates of distinct chemical composition, it is found that both the demagnetization and remagnetization timescales are very sensitive to the phonon temperature dynamics through the supporting materials, which defines the heating dissipation efficiency at the interface. The process can be further tuned with the thickness of the vdW magnets, where thin (thick) systems result in faster (slower) magnetization dynamics. It is unveiled that the non&#8208;thermal nature of spin dynamics in vdW heterostructures creates interfacial spin accumulation that generates spin&#8208;polarized currents with dominant frequencies ranging from 0.18 to 1.0 GHz accordingly to the layer thickness and substrate. The findings demonstrate that substrate engineering liaised with the choice of magnetic compounds open venues for efficient spin&#8208;heat control, which ultimately determines the optically excited magnetic characteristics of the vdW&#160;layers.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Quantum Coherence From a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;spin donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers demonstrate newly realized quantum functionalities such as long solid&#8208;state spin relaxation times, coherent control of the superposition state, and single qubit operations. These attributes coupled with high chemical tunability, robust stability, interrelated optoelectronic properties, and solution processability offer a fundamentally new approach to readily integrating quantum phenomena within functional device platforms.








Abstract
Molecular spin systems that can be chemically tuned, coherently controlled, and readily integrated within devices remain central to the realization of emerging quantum technologies. Organic high&#8208;spin materials are prime candidates owing to their similarity in electronic structure to leading solid&#8208;state defect&#8208;based systems, light element composition, and the potential for entanglement and qubit operations mediated through spin&#8208;spin exchange. However, the inherent instability of these species precludes their rational design, development, and application. Here, the first example of an organic high&#8208;spin qubit based on a conjugated polymer semiconductor comprised of alternating dithienosilole and thiadiazoloquinoxaline heterocycles is demonstrated. It is shown that electron spins within the macromolecule demonstrate high&#8208;fidelity coherent control of the superposition state with room temperature coherence and solid&#8208;state relaxation times that are competitive with or exceed other synthetic molecular qubits. These attributes, along with robust stability, chemical tunability, rich interrelated optoelectronic functionalities, and solution processability, offer a fundamentally new approach to integrating quantum phenomena within functional device platforms.

         <title>Van Der Waals Integration of 4&#8208;Inch Single&#8208;Crystalline III&#8208;Nitride Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization&#8208;engineered van der Waals (vdW) integration facilitates the growth of 4&#8208;inch single&#8208;crystalline GaN, revealing polarization&#8208;regulated vdW gaps and substantially reduced dislocation densities. This method achieves an exceptionally low dislocation density, thereby enabling the fabrication of high&#8208;performance HEMTs with enhanced saturation current density and effectively mitigating off&#8208;state leakage current.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxy III&#8208;nitride semiconductors on 2D materials, characterized by a van der Waals (vdW) interface, enables strain relaxation, reduction in dislocation density, and facile release from substrate. However, the limited wettability of 2D materials and weak interfacial interactions pose significant challenges in achieving ordered crystallographic orientation of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors at the wafer scale. Here, this study has been successfully developed a polarization&#8208;engineered vdW integration strategy (PEVIS) for the growth of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. By engineering robust electronic polarization in epitaxial substrates, the growth of 4&#8208;inch single&#8208;crystalline GaN layers is successfully achieved on wafers coated with 2D materials using PEVIS. Additionally, this approach exhibits a remarkably low threading dislocations density of 3.49&#160;&#215;&#160;108 cm&#8722;2 on the vdW surface, even when the GaN epitaxial layer thickness is reduced to 400&#160;nm. Furthermore, the fabricated GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) achieve an average high mobility of 2080.7 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, a high saturation current density of 790&#160;mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, and effectively mitigates the off&#8208;state leakage current to 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;6&#160;mA&#160;mm&#8722;1. This work signifies a significant advancement in the theoretical comprehension of heteroepitaxy on 2D materials and introduces a novel methodology for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline high&#8208;quality III&#8208;nitride semiconductors.

         <title>Active Biopaste for Coral Reef Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preserving coral reefs is essential. A conductive, hardening paste for coral attachment and mineral accretion technology is developed, using a bio&#8208;based acrylate soybean oil matrix and graphene nanoplatelets. Corals are attached with and onto the conductive paste, electricity is applied, water electrolysis is induced, and calcium is deposited at the cathode to enhance coral growth via faster calcium carbonate deposition.








Abstract
Preserving coral reefs is crucial for safeguarding marine biodiversity, global ecosystems, and coastal communities. Coral restoration focuses on farming and transplanting corals back onto reefs. However, traditional attachment methods, such as petroleum&#8208;based epoxy, pose environmental risks or provide inefficient affixation. Moreover, maximizing coral growth while farming boosts the restoration rate of the reefs. Hence, an environmentally friendly, conductive hardening bicomponent paste is developed to transplant and anchor corals, provide them with a solid growing substrate, and enable mineral accretion technology (MAT), a strategy to accelerate coral farming. The bicomponent paste consists of bio&#8208;based and biodegradable acrylate soybean oil matrix and graphene nanoplatelets fillers. The paste hardens through mixing, transitioning from a Young's modulus of &#8771;0.1 to &#8771;60&#160;MPa and reaching a strength of &#8771;5&#160;MPa. Rheological tests demonstrate the tunability of the crosslinking dynamics of the paste. The paste exhibits a resistivity of 0.1 &#937;&#8729;m, with stable electrical properties for over 40 days in seawater. MAT tests show significant enhancement of coral growth rates within two weeks, doubling those of the control group. This paste offers versatility for application in aquaria and nurseries, does not require prone&#8208;to&#8208;oxidation metallic structures underwater, and can be employed on reefs.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Ion Intercalation in Graphene via Thermal and Electrostatic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Europium ions reversibly intercalate into the van der Waals gap of bilayer graphene when heat and electrostatic gate act together, switching the stacking order and electronic response on demand. Real&#8208;time transport, simulations, and device tests expose a hidden 2D Eu sheet and its temperature&#8208;tuned diffusion, showing a versatile electrochemical route toward reconfigurable 2D heterostructures with rare&#8208;earth functionality.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale control and understanding the controlling strategy of ion intercalation are pivotal for advancing energy storage, quantum technologies, and adaptive electronics. While intercalation &#8211; the insertion of ions into layered materials &#8211; has transformative potential, the mechanisms driving it, particularly for rare&#8208;earth ions, remain poorly understood. Here, a thermal&#8208;electrostatic strategy is developed to achieve reversible and tunable europium ion intercalation that enables precise control over intercalation dynamics. This study investigates how temperature and voltage influence the intercalation of europium ions into bilayer graphene. Our results reveal the formation of a 2D europium layer and ionic state of intercalation europium within the graphene structure, providing fundamental insights into intercalation energetics. This work establishes a versatile platform for designing adaptive 2D heterostructure, engineering advanced materials and devices with unique electronic and optoelectronic properties.

A novel three&#8208;terminal PeLET device vertically integrated through a permeable electrode expands additional functionality beyond conventional two&#8208;terminal devices. the specific mechanism is elucidated of E&#8208;field penetration from the integrated capacitor unit to the LED via transient electroluminescence measurements. The PeLET device enables dual&#8208;channel data modulation and on&#8208;device encryption for secure visible light communication.








Abstract
Visible&#8208;light communication (VLC) is a promising technology for alleviating data traffic and spectrum allocation problems. Traditional optoelectronic devices such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are crucial components of VLC systems. However, two&#8208;terminal devices are limited in their functionality and integration capabilities. Thus, a third permeable electrode (PE) is incorporated for high&#8208;efficiency quantum&#8208;dot PE light&#8208;emitting triodes (PeLETs), with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.4% and luminance exceeding 29,000 cd m&#8208;2. Then, we elucidate the interplay between the resistor&#8211;capacitor circuit and the charge injection process using transient electroluminescence measurements. The expanded functionalities allow the simultaneous modulation of two input data streams within a single device. The PeLETs enhance data throughput and transmission capacity through dual&#8208;channel communication. Furthermore, on&#8208;device data encryption is achieved using the concept of interference in the data transmission process. Single&#8208;device data modulation using PeLETs provides a novel concept for on&#8208;device data encryption for next&#8208;generation, highly secure VLC systems.

         <title>Stochastic Orientational Encoding via Hydrogen Bonding Driven Assembly of Woven&#8208;Like Molecular Physically Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel stochastic orientational encoding approach utilizing a nanoscopic film of a novel rod&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;architecture, achieved through facile ambient&#8208;atmosphere solution processing. Energetically favorable molecular assembly, driven by directional multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs and uniaxial microcrystal growth, results in a woven&#8208;textured pattern with random 1D features. The rich variations in microcrystal domain properties and crystal orientations coupled with artificial coloration enable high encoding capacity in a single&#8208;material, solution&#8208;processed system.








Abstract
The prevention of counterfeiting and the assurance of object authenticity require stochastic encoding schemes based on physically unclonable functions (PUFs). There is an urgent need for exceptionally large encoding capacities and multi&#8208;level responses within a molecularly defined, single&#8208;material system. Herein, a novel stochastic orientational encoding approach is demonstrated using a facile ambient&#8208;atmosphere solution processing of a molecular thin film based on the rod&#8208;shaped oligo(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene) (OPE) &#960;&#8208;architecture. The nanoscopic film, derived from the small molecule 2EHO&#8208;CF3PyPE with donor, acceptor, and &#960;&#8208;spacer building units, is designed for energetically favorable uniaxial molecular assembly and crystal growth via directional multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs at the molecular termini and short C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; contacts at the center. A facile solvent vapor annealing induces concurrent dewetting and microscopic 1D random crystallization, yielding a woven&#8208;textured random features. Using convolutional neural networks, the rich variations in microcrystal domain properties and stochastic encoding of 1D crystal orientations generate artificial coloration, achieving an encoding capacity reaching (6.5 &#215; 10&#8308;)(2752 &#215; 2208). The results demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving ultrahigh encoding capacities in a thin film composed of a single&#8208;material. This approach enables low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processed fabrication for mass production and broad adoption, while opening new opportunities to explore molecular&#8208;PUFs through structural design and engineering noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Bimodal Spin Switch Emerging from Hybridized 2D MoS2/Ferromagnet Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a novel integration of 2D semiconductors with ferromagnets using pulsed laser deposition, revealing hybridization&#8208;driven spin manipulation. Vertical spin valves with MoS2 and Ni(111) show exotic bimodal spin signals and strong deviations from Julli&#232;re's model. These results highlight the &#171;&#160;2D spinterfaces&#160;&#187; key role in unlocking 2D materials&#8217; potential for advanced spintronic applications and novel spin functionalities.








Abstract
Over the past decade, MRAMs developments have focused on improving magnetic tunnel junctions while using magnetic electrodes with fixed properties as spin sources. Interestingly, 2D semiconductors offer interface tailoring opportunities for spin valve devices, with many atomically thin materials now available. However, integrating them with oxidation&#8208;prone spintronics materials remains a challenge. Here, spin devices are fabricated and evaluated with large&#8208;scale MoS2 directly grown on a monocrystalline ferromagnetic spin source. While most spin transport experiments with 2D semiconductors focus on their isolated dielectric properties, the presented approach unlocks an additional spin manipulation opportunity from MoS2 hybridization with ferromagnetic electrodes. The experimental results show a substantial tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) value of over 65%, an order of magnitude higher than previously observed for exfoliated 2D semiconductor&#8208;based devices. A non&#8208;monotonic dependence of the spin signal on the applied bias, including a sign reversal, is also uncovered, which is attributed to the modulation of the MoS2 band structure by the ferromagnetic electrode. Ab initio calculations support these findings by illustrating how the MoS2 band structure evolves upon hybridization, introducing a pronounced exchange&#8208;induced spin splitting and resulting in an unusual bimodal spin response.

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates a novel integration of 2D semiconductors with ferromagnets using pulsed laser deposition, revealing hybridization-driven spin manipulation. Vertical spin valves with MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni(111) show exotic bimodal spin signals and strong deviations from Julli&#232;re's model. These results highlight the &#171;&#160;2D spinterfaces&#160;&#187; key role in unlocking 2D materials&#8217; potential for advanced spintronic applications and novel spin functionalities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, MRAMs developments have focused on improving magnetic tunnel junctions while using magnetic electrodes with fixed properties as spin sources. Interestingly, 2D semiconductors offer interface tailoring opportunities for spin valve devices, with many atomically thin materials now available. However, integrating them with oxidation-prone spintronics materials remains a challenge. Here, spin devices are fabricated and evaluated with large-scale MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly grown on a monocrystalline ferromagnetic spin source. While most spin transport experiments with 2D semiconductors focus on their isolated dielectric properties, the presented approach unlocks an additional spin manipulation opportunity from MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybridization with ferromagnetic electrodes. The experimental results show a substantial tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) value of over 65%, an order of magnitude higher than previously observed for exfoliated 2D semiconductor-based devices. A non-monotonic dependence of the spin signal on the applied bias, including a sign reversal, is also uncovered, which is attributed to the modulation of the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; band structure by the ferromagnetic electrode. Ab initio calculations support these findings by illustrating how the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; band structure evolves upon hybridization, introducing a pronounced exchange-induced spin splitting and resulting in an unusual bimodal spin response. This study demonstrates the unique spin manipulation opportunities offered by 2D semiconductors unlocked by direct integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Defect Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Carbon Nitride&#8208;Based Heterostructural Nanocatalyst for Improving the Therapeutic Efficacy of &#945;PD&#8208;1 via Tumor Immune Microenvironment Remodelling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound responsive carbon nitride&#8208;based heterostructural nanocatalyst of tri&#8208;modality catalytic ROS generation and cell cuproptosis inducing properties is fabricated and employed to remodel the suppressive tumor immune microenvironment, by triggering immunogenic cell death of tumor, activating systematic antitumor immune response, and repolarizing the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, which remarkably improves the therapeutic efficacy of &#945;PD&#8208;1 on orthotopic osteosarcoma.








Abstract
Low immunogenicity, insufficient immune infiltrates, and inhibitive microenvironment of tumors ruthlessly weakened the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapies. How to improve the therapy efficacy by reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment still remains a challenge that needs to be urgently addressed. Here, a novel dual&#8208;defect nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon nitride&#8208;based heterostructural nanocatalyst (CNO@CuMS) possessing brilliant piezocatalytic H2O2 generation, sonocatalytic 1O2 generation, Fenton&#8208;like catalytic &#8226;OH generation, and cell cuproptosis inducing properties are developed. Accompanied by the ultrasonic treatment, immunogenic cell death (ICD) and the subsequent releasing of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of tumor cells are successfully triggered by CNO@CuMS, which resulted in the activation of systematic antitumor response and enhanced the infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells at tumor site. The large quantitatively generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) also promoted the polarization of M2&#8208;type macrophage to M1&#8208;type as well. Benefitting from this tumor immune microenvironment remodelling effect, remarkable malignant orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy efficacy is achieved employing CNO@CuMS + &#945;PD&#8208;1 combination strategy under ultrasonic treatment, with no significant side effects are observed. This research not only proposes a method to fabricate high proformance carbon nitride&#8208;based nanocatalyst but also provides a new strategy to realize highly efficient malignant bone tumor therapy during clinical practice.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of &#960;&#8208;Extended Thiazolothiazole for High&#8208;Performance UV&#8208;OPDs Seamlessly Integrated with CMOS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance, semi&#8208;transparent UV&#8208;selective photodiodes are developed by elucidating how the backbone planarity and conjugation length of Tz molecules influence film morphology and charge transport within the device. These vacuum&#8208;deposited organic photodetectors are monolithically integrated with CMOS image sensors, showcasing multifunctional imaging capabilities and advancing the commercialization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based photodetectors.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;deposited organic photodiodes (OPDs) offer unique advantages&#8212;including narrowband selectivity and compatibility with standard fabrication processes&#8212;but achieving ultraviolet (UV) selectivity in such devices remains a key challenge. This is due to the need to reconcile two competing design requirements: 1) strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking for efficient charge transport, and 2) limited &#960;&#8208;conjugation to retain a wide bandgap suitable for UV absorption and vacuum deposition. Here, we report a molecular design strategy for UV&#8208;selective OPDs based on thiazolothiazole (Tz)&#8208;based small molecules with tailored backbone planarity and conjugation length. The resulting vacuum&#8208;deposited active layers simultaneously exhibit wide bandgaps and robust &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The optimized devices achieve outstanding UV selectivity (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum: 60 nm), high specific detectivity (1.06 &#215; 1012 Jones), and fast dynamic response (cutoff frequency of 50,100 Hz)&#8212;representing the highest performance for vacuum&#8208;deposited UV&#8208;OPDs reported to date. Furthermore, it is demonstrated the seamless integration of these semi&#8208;transparent OPDs with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors (CIS), underscoring their potential for multifunctional imaging applications. The findings provide key molecular insights for advancing UV&#8208;selective organic photodetectors.

         <title>Engineered&#8208;Macrophage&#8208;Escorted Rotaxane Nanoscavengers for Precise Diquat Detoxification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops macrophage&#8208;escorted, ROS&#8208;responsive rotaxane nanoscavengers loaded with charge&#8208;neutralizing carboxymethyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anti&#8208;inflammatory 4&#8208;octyl itaconate, enabling precise renal targeting, active diquat detoxification, disruption of ROS&#8208;inflammatory cycles, and significantly improved survival in poisoned mice.








Abstract
This study proposes a bioinspired on&#8208;demand detoxification strategy addressing the critical need for efficient toxin poisoning therapies. Focusing on the high&#8208;mortality herbicide diquat, an active toxin&#8208;hunting paradigm is developed, diverging from passive methods like hemodialysis. Charge&#8208;neutralizing carboxymethyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CCD) is computationally designed to recognize, sequester, and detoxify diquat by counteracting its positive charge and suppressing ROS generation. To enhance renal targeting (diquat's primary toxic site), CCD is threaded onto PEG5K chains forming cyclodextrin rotaxanes, stabilized by ROS&#8208;cleavable cationic polymers, and encapsulated into macrophages to exploit inflammatory chemotaxis. The system incorporates 4&#8208;octyl itaconate (4&#8208;OI) to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, synergistically breaking the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cycle. In poisoned mice, this biomimetic system demonstrates precise renal accumulation, significantly reducing ROS damage and increasing survival rates. The work validates a demand&#8208;driven molecular design framework integrating organ&#8208;specific antidote delivery with inflammation regulation&#8212;simultaneously enabling ROS scavenging and upstream pathway modulation&#8208;establishing an active toxin&#8208;neutralization theory. This strategy bridges biomaterials engineering and redox biology, where supramolecular stability during circulation synergizes with renal targeting to overcome limitations of current reactive therapies.

         <title>Fully Degradable Protein Gels with Superior Mechanical Properties and Durability: Regulation of Hydrogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong, stiff, tough, and durable protein gels are constructed by using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with variable hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) as solvent to regulate and crosslink protein chains. This strategy promotes abundant supramolecular interactions between gelatin chains and DESs, thus the obtained gel has ultra&#8208;high strength and toughness with multifunction, which can be regulated by changing HBDs of DESs.








Abstract
Protein gels hold great promise in various applications due to their high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and abundant sources. However, most existing protein gels suffer from low strength, stiffness, and toughness because conventional solvent within gels usually weakens crosslinked network structure. Here, strong, stiff, and tough protein gels are developed by using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with tunable hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) as the dispersion medium. The DESs not only facilitate protein chain&#8211;chain interaction, but also form abundant non&#8208;covalent crosslinks between protein chains through protein chain&#8211;solvent interaction. More importantly, these crosslinked interactions can be tailored by varying HBDs, further toughening the gels. As a result, the obtained protein gels exhibit excellent mechanical properties, including tensile strength of 10.25&#160;&#177;&#160;1.28&#160;MPa, tensile strain of 892.51&#160;&#177;&#160;39.66%, elastic modulus of 24.57&#160;&#177;&#160;0.27&#160;MPa, toughness of 17.34&#160;&#177;&#160;0.46&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and fracture energy of 6.76&#160;&#177;&#160;0.99&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2, which surpass the previously reported protein gels. Despite their enhanced mechanics, they retain key advantages such as adhesiveness, retrievability, environmental durability, and full degradability.

     alt="Fully Degradable Protein Gels with Superior Mechanical Properties and Durability: Regulation of Hydrogen Bond Donors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong, stiff, tough, and durable protein gels are constructed by using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with variable hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) as solvent to regulate and crosslink protein chains. This strategy promotes abundant supramolecular interactions between gelatin chains and DESs, thus the obtained gel has ultra-high strength and toughness with multifunction, which can be regulated by changing HBDs of DESs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein gels hold great promise in various applications due to their high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and abundant sources. However, most existing protein gels suffer from low strength, stiffness, and toughness because conventional solvent within gels usually weakens crosslinked network structure. Here, strong, stiff, and tough protein gels are developed by using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with tunable hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) as the dispersion medium. The DESs not only facilitate protein chain&#8211;chain interaction, but also form abundant non-covalent crosslinks between protein chains through protein chain&#8211;solvent interaction. More importantly, these crosslinked interactions can be tailored by varying HBDs, further toughening the gels. As a result, the obtained protein gels exhibit excellent mechanical properties, including tensile strength of 10.25&#160;&#177;&#160;1.28&#160;MPa, tensile strain of 892.51&#160;&#177;&#160;39.66%, elastic modulus of 24.57&#160;&#177;&#160;0.27&#160;MPa, toughness of 17.34&#160;&#177;&#160;0.46&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and fracture energy of 6.76&#160;&#177;&#160;0.99&#160;kJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which surpass the previously reported protein gels. Despite their enhanced mechanics, they retain key advantages such as adhesiveness, retrievability, environmental durability, and full degradability. This work presents a novel strategy for designing robust, multifunctional protein gels, expanding their potential in emerging technologies that demand both mechanical toughness and functional versatility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Based Thin Microporous Polymer Films for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with electropolymerized microporous films enable a direct and scalable process for the production of industrial relevant amounts of hydrogen gas. For developing cost&#8208; and material&#8208;effective devices it is beneficial to increase the accessible outer surface area via microstructuring and stacking of polymeric films instead of using thick polymeric films.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a direct pathway to store solar energy in chemicals. Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are porous organic photocatalysts, that are typically applied in powder form in heterogenous catalytic reactions. However, the use of powder photocatalysts in dispersion poses some major challenges when it comes to practical applications in larger scales. In this manuscript, the photocatalytic performance of a carbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer (C&#8208;POP) film produced by electro polymerizing 1,2,3,5&#8208;Tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) is investigated, well&#8208;known for its intriguing photocatalytic properties. The thickness of the intrinsic microporous film is tuneable by the amount of cyclic voltammetry cycles but it is shown that the hydrogen production is not dependent on film thickness. It can therefore be concluded that catalysis is mainly occuring on the outer surface of the films, questioning whether high surface areas are always required for efficient photocatalysis. A microstructured film offers the advantage that, with a reduced amount of polymer material, a constant or even increased external surface area of the film can be achieved. The approach presented here is therefore advantageous for achieving high hydrogen production per unit area with minimal amounts of polymer, as very thin layers are already sufficient for high activity.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Driven Closed&#8208;Loop Chemical Recycling System for Polypinacols</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel strategy for the photochemical closed&#8208;loop recycling of hydroxyl&#8208;rich polymers. Simple bis&#8208;aldehyde precursors are employed to synthesize polypinacols via UV light irradiation. Subsequent depolymerization is achieved under visible light using a cerium&#8208;based photocatalyst, enabling monomer recovery through selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds within the polymer backbone.








Abstract
The development of innovative recycling strategies for polymers is crucial to addressing the rapidly growing plastic waste challenge. While thermal ground&#8208;state chemistry is the standard for closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling, the potential of photochemical excited&#8208;state chemistry remains largely unexplored. This study bridges this gap by investigating light&#8208;driven polymerization and depolymerization processes for hydroxyl&#8208;rich polymers. Through consecutive pinacol coupling reactions, a range of simple bis&#8208;aldehyde monomers is photopolymerized into well&#8208;defined polypinacols on a gram scale. These polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability, retaining their integrity up to 306&#160;&#176;C, with glass transition temperatures ranging from 72 to 137&#160;&#176;C. Using an earth&#8208;abundant cerium photocatalyst, selective cleavage of stable C&#9472;C bonds within the polypinacol backbone is achieved under visible light, efficiently regenerating the original monomer. As this approach tolerates the presence of standard commodity plastics, it presents an opportunity for orthogonal recycling methods that could help recover specific polymers from diverse plastic waste streams. The successful completion of one recycling cycle, resulting in a polymer with comparable properties to the original, highlights the significant potential and advantages of (photo)chemical recycling.

         <title>Observation of Z2 Non&#8208;Hermitian Skin Effect in Projective Mirror&#8208;Symmetric Acoustic Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;protected Z&#8322; non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is experimentally demonstrated in acoustic metamaterials. By implementing projective mirror symmetry&#8212;which enables pseudospins in spinless systems&#8212;both uniform and bidirectional Z&#8322; NHSEs characterized by different accumulation directions are observed. Active feedback circuits provide the requisite non&#8208;Hermitian gain/loss, establishing a platform for topological wave manipulation.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize at the boundary of non&#8208;Hermitian lattices, has gained significant attention in various fields. This phenomenon, driven by the point&#8208;gap topology of complex energy bands, occurs even without special symmetries. Nevertheless, additional symmetry may significantly enrich the NHSE. Notably, time&#8208;reversal symmetry protects a Z2 NHSE, featuring oppositely accumulated skin modes. Here, a 1D bilayer Z2 NHSE model based on projective mirror symmetry is proposed, making Z2 NHSE possible in spinless systems. Experimentally, both uniform and bidirectional Z2 NHSEs are observed in acoustic metamaterials, where the necessary non&#8208;Hermitian elements&#8212;gain and loss&#8212;are achieved through active feedback circuits. These findings open new avenues for exploring symmetry&#8208;enriched non&#8208;Hermitian topological phenomena and pave the way for potential applications in wave manipulation, sensing, and beyond.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Dynamic Catalytic Domains for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;activated Co/Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst on C&#8323;N&#8324; is developed to construct dynamic catalytic domains, enabling accelerated sulfur redox kinetics and uniform Li&#8322;S deposition. This strategy delivers outstanding rate capability and long&#8208;term stability in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries under high&#8208;loading and lean&#8208;electrolyte conditions, offering new insights into light&#8208;driven electrocatalyst engineering.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) face significant challenges due to sluggish reaction kinetics and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Here, a light&#8208;induced anchoring strategy is employed to construct Co/Cu diatomic catalysts (DACs) on C3N4, introducing dual active sites with strong polysulfide adsorption and bifunctional catalytic activity. Upon light excitation, the synergistic Co&#8211;Cu interaction induces local electronic redistribution, which triggers broader electronic rearrangement and directional charge carrier migration. This process generates dynamic catalytic domains with enhanced polysulfide adsorption and catalytic conversion capability. These domains not only promote effective photogenerated carrier separation but also play a pivotal role in accelerating sulfur redox kinetics and regulating Li&#8322;S deposition behavior. As a result, the Co/Cu&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324; cathode exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving 1200 stable cycles at 8 C with a capacity decay of 0.025% per cycle. Remarkably, under lean electrolyte conditions (E/S = 4 &#181;L mg&#8315;&#185;) and ultra&#8208;high sulfur loading (14.73 mg cm&#8315;2), the battery maintains excellent cycling stability. This work offers a conceptual framework for photo&#8208;induced catalytic microenvironment design and highlights the potential of spatiotemporal electronic modulation for next&#8208;generation photo&#8208;assisted energy storage systems.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Nanotube Array Membrane Generating Ultrahigh Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents high&#8208;density (&#8776;10&#185;&#185; cm&#8315;2) ionic nanotube (INT) arrays self&#8208;assemble by a minimal amount of carboxylic groups (&#8776;0.22 meq&#183;g&#8315;&#185;), driven by a cross&#8208;phase&#8208;miscibility effect of their twinned groups. The INT arrays exhibit excellent anti&#8208;swelling properties and high ion conductivity, enabling ultrahigh osmotic energy conversion (39.5 W&#183;m&#8315;2 under a 500&#8208;fold gradient). This work proposes a novel concept for membrane&#8208;based separation processes.








Abstract
Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) are critical components in osmotic energy conversion. However, traditional IEMs suffer from disordered nanochannels due to the lack of precise control over the content and distribution of ionic groups, resulting in an inherent trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and conductivity. One promising strategy is constructing high&#8208;density ion channels with minimal ionic groups. Herein, high&#8208;density ionic nanotube (INT) arrays are assembled from tiny carboxylic groups (&#8776;0.22 meq&#183;g&#8722;1), achieving efficient&#160;osmotic energy conversion. Using styrene&#8208;ethylene/butylene&#8208;styrene block copolymers, paired carboxyl groups and tetraphenylethylene (TPE) in the polyethylene/butylene block self&#8208;assemble into a transmembrane cylindrical phase. Driven by the cross&#8208;phase&#8208;miscibility effect of TPE, carboxyl groups aggregate at the cylinder interface, forming INT array membranes with an exceptional density of &#8776;10&#185;&#185; cm&#8315;2. The unique structure is directly observed and further validated by self&#8208;consistent field theory. The INT array membranes exhibit 2 orders of magnitude higher current than the control membrane, and an ultrahigh power density of 39.5 W&#183;m&#8315;2 under a 500&#8208;fold salinity gradient, significantly outperforming the traditional IEMs. This INT design strategy not only provides a promising approach for osmotic energy harvesting but also opens new avenues for advanced membrane&#8208;based separation processes.

         <title>Bioinspired Smart Nanogels for Rapid Blue Laser&#8208;Activated Hemostasis in Gastrointestinal Bleeding</title>

Waxberry&#8208;inspired branched&#8208;silica nanogel can swiftly stop bleeding upon blue laser endoscopy for gastrointestinal hemostasis in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum of mini&#8208;pigs.








Abstract
Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a critical condition that requires rapid and effective intervention. Although thrombin is a widely used hemostatic agent, its efficacy is limited in the harsh environment of the digestive tract, especially in patients with chronic liver disease or coagulation disorders. Current treatment techniques often fall short, particularly when faced with severe blood loss and coagulation challenges. Here, a novel solution: waxberry&#8208;inspired smart nanogels that offer a cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and mechanically stable approach for local hemostasis is presented. Drawing inspiration from the microfibrous structures of waxberry, a waxberry&#8208;like nano&#8208;silica with a radially fibrous structure is synthesized for effective thrombin loading and release upon emergency. This nano&#8208;silica, coated with GelMA, forms a stable nanogel network activated by blue laser during endoscopy. Within just 5 s, the nanogel effectively triggers coagulation, even in patients with coagulation disorders. The formed blood clots are stable enough to withstand the challenging conditions of the digestive tract, preventing secondary bleeding. Upon injection, thrombin rapidly converts fibrinogen to fibrin, creating a secondary network that reinforces clot stability. This dual&#8208;network system demonstrates strong adhesive properties and effective hemostasis in the blood of cirrhotic patients, as well as in gastrointestinal bleeding scenarios involving the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum of mini&#8208;pigs.

         <title>Use of CsPbCl3 Quantum Dots as a Chlorine Source Enables Formation of Thick Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Performance Blue Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid chlorine sources allows the preparation of thick perovskite films, leading to sky&#8208;blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.2%.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and stable blue&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) remains a challenge due to the poor solubility of conventional chloride precursors and the difficulty to form thick, uniform films with a well&#8208;controlled phase distribution. A new strategy is proposed to address this challenge using CsPbCl3 quantum dots (QDs) capped with oleylamine (OLA) ligands as an alternative chlorine source. It is demonstrated how the use of these QDs enables formation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with vertically aligned crystalline structure, thickness over 100&#160;nm, and improved stability. OLA ligands regulate the crystal phase distribution and grain boundaries, suppressing the appearance of small&#8208;n 2D phases and reducing the number of crystal defects, while inorganic CsPbCl3 QD cores induce vertical crystallization of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films, endowing them with enhanced structural stability. The use of this non&#8208;conventional chlorine source is proven instrumental in improving external quantum efficiency of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite sky&#8208;blue LEDs, reaching 26.2% at 485&#160;nm, with significantly enhanced electroluminescence stability both in terms of peak position and brightness. This study demonstrates&#160;a novel methodology using CsPbCl3 QDs capped with conventional organic ligands to achieve thick quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers for blue LEDs, addressing existing limitations in perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Local Proton&#8208;Rich Solid Solution Catalyst with a Cluster&#8208;in&#8208;Cluster Structure for Anti&#8208;interference Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;cleaning cathode with cluster&#8208;in&#8208;cluster solid solution catalysts (HfOx&#8208;in&#8208;Ir SSC) realizes the seawater splitting for the co&#8208;production of H2 and Mg(OH)2. The HfOx&#8208;in&#8208;Ir SSC establishes a persistent acidic microenvironment at the interface to resist Mg2+ attack. Meanwhile, using the adverse trace Cl&#8722;/ClO&#8722; produced by the anode breaks the cathode's local OH&#8722; concentration gradient and achieves a long&#8208;term deposition resistance for hydroxide.








Abstract
The poor proton coverage of electrocatalysts in neutral hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the incapacity to resist alkali hydroxides for seawater electrolysis have resulted in a large kinetics gap from acidic water splitting. Facing this challenge, a cluster&#8208;in&#8208;cluster solid solution catalyst with a proton&#8208;rich microenvironment and anti&#8208;interference interface composed of an amorphous hafnium oxide cluster penetrating in crystalline iridium cluster (HfOx&#8208;in&#8208;Ir SSC), is reported which can achieve superior activity for direct seawater splitting. The structure characterizations, in situ FT&#8208;IR and Raman, and theoretical calculations reveal that the HfOx clusters in the Ir cluster endow an interfacial proton&#8208;rich microenvironment by increasing the coverage and optimizing the adsorption of *H, thereby achieving a low overpotential of 30&#160;mV in neutral electrolytes. Fascinating, the interfaces of HfOx&#8208;in&#8208;Ir SSC catalysts present abundant *H and OH* species and simultaneously superior anti&#8208;poison to Cl&#8722;/ClO&#8722; and anti&#8208;deposition to Mg(OH)2, eventually achieving an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 117&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability in seawater splitting.

         <title>Anisotropic Magnetic Heating for Adaptive Thermal Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimorph thermal ablation probe is designed by integrating a heating layer containing magnetically aligned Fe3O4@SiO2 nanorods in PDMS and an actuation layer with NdFeB microparticles. Under alternating magnetic fields, anisotropic nanorods generate directional heating, and the application of a static magnetic field induces controlled probe bending to dynamically adjust nanorod orientation, thereby modulating heat generation for targeted ablation while minimizing collateral tissue damage.








Abstract
Thermal ablation provides minimally invasive treatment for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions but risks damaging healthy tissues due to their low imaging contrast against diseased areas. This study introduces an adaptive thermal ablation probe leveraging anisotropic magnetic heating of magnetite nanorods pre&#8208;aligned within a polymer substrate. During magnetic pre&#8208;alignment, the nanorods form chain&#8208;like aggregates, enhancing their magnetic anisotropy and minimizing demagnetization effects. Under an alternating magnetic field, these features create a distinct difference in heat generation along the aggregates&#8217; easy and hard axes. This probe utilizes a bimorph structure incorporating a heating layer with aligned nanorods and an actuation layer containing NdFeB microparticles. Exposure to static and alternating magnetic fields induces probe bending, adjusting nanorod orientation to modulate heat generation and prevent overheating. In vitro experiments demonstrate successful thrombus phantom ablation in both fluid flow and porcine artery models while preserving tissue viability. This innovative approach advances thermal ablation technology by offering a safer, more precise, and adaptive solution with a high potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Low&#8208;Frequency Terahertz Absorption ON&#8208;OFF Switchability in Spin&#8208;Crossover Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable Fe(II)&#8211;Hg(II) coordination polymer exhibits reversible ON&#8208;OFF terahertz (THz) absorption through temperature&#8208; and light&#8208;induced spin&#8208;crossover. The material shows strong, tunable THz responses linked to phonon modes around Fe(II) centers, supported by spectroscopic measurements and calculations. This work highlights the potential of spin&#8208;crossover materials in future THz&#8208;responsive devices.









Abstract
Thermal and optical&#8208;induced ON&#8208;OFF switchable materials show vast potential in various fields like sensors, spintronics, and electronic devices, but remain underexplored in the essential terahertz (THz) region. In this context, a unique 1D spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) network, {[FeII(4&#8208;cyanopyridine)2][HgII(&#181;&#8208;SCN)2(SCN)(4&#8208;cyanopyridine)]2}n (1), has been designed. Temperature&#8208;dependent crystallographic, magnetic, and THz absorption spectroscopic studies indicate an abrupt SCO phenomenon from a high&#8208;spin (HS) state to a complete or partial low&#8208;spin (LS) state, depending on the cooling rate. At low temperatures, the LS state can be converted into the metastable HS state via the light&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (LIESST) effect using visible or near&#8208;infrared lights. Both temperature and light reversibly modulate the THz absorbance (e.g., 0.82 and 1.37 THz) associated with phonons around Fe(II) centers, confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations and photocrystallographic analysis. This work advances comprehension of the intersection between structures, THz properties, and external&#8208;stimuli switching effects and is pivotal for future THz device applications.

         <title>Carbon Doped Boron Nitride Nano&#8208;Coatings for Durable, Low Emissivity Glass Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room temperature carbon doped boron nitride nano&#8208;coated glass shows low&#8208;emissivity, excellent environmental stability and scratch protection, important for durable and energy&#8208;efficient low&#8208;E glass window technology.








Abstract
Energy&#8208;efficient, durable low&#8208;emissivity (low&#8208;E) glass windows are in demand for reducing energy consumption and comfortable living environments. However, commercial low&#8208;E coating materials are expensive, prone to abrasion, and hence coated only on the interior side of windows, limiting their energy efficiency. Here, a new material is introduced, namely chemically inert and transparent carbon (C) doped boron nitride (BN) nano&#8208;coatings on glass surfaces at room temperature using pulsed laser deposition, that shows promising long&#8208;wave infrared emissivity (&#949;LWIR &#8776;0.42). The hydrophilic C&#8208;BN coatings on glass show excellent environmental stability including high temperature&#8208;high humidity degradation resistance, UV&#8208;light, thermal cycling, freezing condition, and saltwater resilience. Furthermore, the coating shows promising adhesion on the glass surface with full scratch protection. In an actual&#8208;sized building energy simulation for cold&#8208;climates, the intended exterior&#8208;side C&#8208;BN coated low&#8208;E glass shows 2.9% energy savings compared to the interior&#8208;side coated commercial low&#8208;E glass. C&#8208;BN would be a useful coating material for durable and energy&#8208;efficient low&#8208;E glass window technology.

         <title>Polycondensation as a Universal Method for Preparing High&#8208;Density Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Libraries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a universal bottom&#8208;up polycondensation strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts (HD&#8208;SACs) with metal loadings up to 27.5 wt%. Using various metal monomers with 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione ligands, it generates atomically dispersed mono&#8208; and bimetallic HD&#8208;SACs. The materials demonstrate high stability in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications, and the method is compatible with automation and scale&#8208;up.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) present a promising subclass of classic heterogeneous catalysts by maximizing metal dispersion and enhancing efficiency. Although high&#8208;density SACs (HD&#8208;SACs) are reported, their synthesis is typically constrained to specific metal&#8208;support combinations and high&#8208;temperature annealing, limiting their translation to wider applications. Herein, a universal bottom&#8208;up approach for the preparation of mono&#8208; and bimetallic HD&#8208;SACs based on the polycondensation of 1,2,4,5&#8208;benzenetetramine with a wide range of metal monomers containing 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione ligands is introduced. The synthesized materials are atomically dispersed and exhibit metal loadings up to 27.5 wt% with high structural stability. Their versatility as catalysts is explored in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications. The materials exhibit remarkable stability under operational conditions. Furthermore, this synthetic strategy is scaled up and automated, demonstrating the robustness and reproducibility and laying the groundwork for self&#8208;optimizing data&#8208;driven materials discovery.

This is achieved by employing supramolecular interactions between a variety of monomers and a metal halide, which is easily removed during development. The new ink design is extendable to other monomer compositions to achieve multifunctional and stimuli&#8208;responsive 4D microprinted materials.








Abstract
Multiphoton 3D laser printing of polymers has become a widespread technology for manufacturing 3D architectures on the micro&#8208; and nanometer scale, with booming applications in micro&#8208;optics, micro&#8208;robotics, and micro&#8208;scaffolds for biological cell culture. However, many applications demand material properties that are not accessible by conventional polymer inks. These include large stiffness, for which recent breakthroughs based on inorganic materials have been reported. Conversely, some applications require very low stiffness and high mechanical compliance. Existing solutions achieve softness by low crosslinking densities, at the inherent expense of deteriorated spatial resolution and structure quality. Herein, this apparent contradiction is resolved by introducing multiphoton inks based on deep eutectic systems, comprising Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids/bases. The 3D printed materials support extremely large strains and bulk Young's moduli as low as 260&#160;kPa under aqueous conditions, well suited for biological applications &#8211; at comparable ease of use and spatial resolution as well&#8208;established commercially available polymer inks.

         <title>Precisely Patterning Liquid Metal Microfibers Through Electrohydrodynamic Printing for Soft Conductive Composites and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrohydrodynamic printing process is developed to precisely pattern liquid metal microfibers with ultra&#8208;high resolution (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and minimal defects, which effectively overcomes the limitations of electrospinning. To the best of their knowledge, the patterning resolution achieved in this work is the highest reported for liquid metal particle&#8208;based inks. Applications in soft sensors and soft conductive composites are demonstrated.








Abstract
Liquid metal particle&#8208;based microfibers attract great interest in soft and wearable electronics. The most facile method to fabricate sub&#8208;50&#160;&#181;m liquid metal fiber is electrospinning. However, electrospinning has poor patterning ability and the electrospun fibers have inherent defects, which significantly lowers the electrical conductivity and limits their application. Therefore, better manufacturing methods are needed to precisely deposit high&#8208;quality liquid metal fibers. In this work, an electrohydrodynamic printing process is developed to precisely pattern liquid metal microfibers with minimal defects and ultra&#8208;high resolution (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m), overcoming the limitations of electrospinning. The patterned liquid metal fibers can be used for soft conductive composites and soft electronics with highly customized microscale features. The conductive composites embedded with these fibers not only exhibit high conductivity (up to 214 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), but also possess nearly strain&#8208;insensitive resistance (7.3% resistance change at 200% strain) and exceptional cyclic stability. Additionally, the potential applications of the liquid metal fibers and composites in soft sensors, stretchable heaters, and transparent electrodes are demonstrated.

         <title>Adaptive Stress Response in 2D Graphene@Se Composite toward Ultra&#8208;Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Selenium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The accumulation of stress leads to electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation, resulting in rapid capacity loss of solid&#8208;state batteries. A stress&#8208;adaptive graphene@selenium cathode is developed in this work to enhance ion transport and relieve mechanical stress in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;selenium batteries, enabling superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;selenium batteries (ASSLSeBs) offer high energy density and improved safety for next&#8208;generation energy storage. Still, selenium cathodes suffer from large volume changes during cycling, leading to mechanical stress and rapid capacity fade. To address this, a stress&#8208;adaptive 2D graphene@Se composite cathode is developed, where small Se nanoparticles are anchored onto acid&#8208;treated expanded graphite (AcEG) to enhance charge transport and alleviate stress. Mechanical characterization confirms that the composite effectively mitigates Li&#8208;ion&#8208;induced strain. As a result, ASSLSeBs with this cathode achieve exceptional cycling stability with ultrahigh capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 2&#160;C and stable performance for over 400 cycles even under high active&#8208;material loading. Furthermore, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;Se pouch cell with a record energy density of 376.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; is demonstrated, the highest reported for ASSLSeBs. This work presents a strategy for designing stress&#8208;adaptive cathodes, enabling ultra&#8208;stable ASSLSeBs for practical applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Hybrid White Electroluminescent Devices with Extended Operational Lifetime and Wide Color Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept architecture is proposed to realize high&#8208;performance perovskite/organic hybrid white electroluminescent devices for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition display and illumination applications, which enables simultaneous high&#8208;efficiency, wide color gamut and extended operational lifetime.








Abstract
Rapid and substantial progress is made in monochromatic perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), however, challenges remain in achieving white electroluminescence for high&#8208;definition display and lighting applications with perovskites as emitters. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept configuration is proposed that successfully demonstrates monolithic perovskite/organic hybrid white LEDs (P/O&#8208;WLEDs) with a wide color gamut for the first time. In this configuration, pure&#8208;green and deep&#8208;blue organic emission units are successively superimposed onto a red emission perovskite layer, forming a hybrid emissive system. The unique carrier transporting and luminescent characteristics of the organic emission units facilitate a broadened carrier distribution, high exciton utilization, and narrowband emission peaks. Consequently, the developed P/O&#8208;WLEDs achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.1%, ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.6&#160;V, and simultaneously a significantly extended operational lifetime of 21.9&#160;h (LT50 at an initial luminance of 500&#160;cd m&#8722;2). Furthermore, by regulating the charge transport properties through an RbI&#8208;treated perovskite unit and an optimized thin LiF layer, the P/O&#8208;WLEDs not only maintain comparable performance but also demonstrate obviously improved spectral stability and a suitable correlated color temperature, opening a new avenue for the development of display and lighting technologies.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printing of Ultratough and Healable Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a 3D&#8208;printable elastomer that achieves both excellent mechanical properties (toughness of 158.5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) and self&#8208;healing performances (healing efficiency of 95.6%), achieved through the ingenious formulation of two dynamic bonds (acylsemicarbazide and carbamate) into the DLP printable resin, making it ideal for flexible and versatile fabrication of complex structures.








Abstract
Although 3D&#8208;printing has offered a promising solution for the freeform fabrication of complex, arbitrary structures, developing elastomeric materials that simultaneously possess mechanical robustness and self&#8208;healing functionality remains a significant challenge. To address this, a 3D&#8208;printable elastomer is reported by the strategic incorporation of hierarchical hydrogen bonding (acylsemicarbazide and carbamate) into the photoactive resin, thereby overcoming the traditional trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and dynamic functionality. The resulting elastomer exhibits ultra&#8208;toughness (158.5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), with tensile strength and breaking strain of 49.6&#160;MPa and 1136%, respectively. In addition, the acylsemicarbazide moieties endow the 3D&#8208;printed elastomers with unique dynamic characteristics, including self&#8208;healing capabilities and shape reconfigurability, thus significantly enhancing the design flexibility and versatility of complex structures.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of MOFs Anodes via Solid&#8208;State Corrosion Prelithiation for High&#8208;Energy Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state corrosion prelithiation strategy (SSC) is applied to MOFs. The full cell with SSC&#8208;prelithiated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) anode enables an energy density of 493&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with 83.3% capacity retention after 240 cycles at 0.2 C. The Ni dissolution percentage is reduced from 15.32% to 1.16%, identified as the key factor underpinning the enhanced full cell performance.








Abstract
Pristine metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with their excellent cycling stability and high capacity are considered as promising next&#8208;generation anode materials for advanced high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Despite extensive efforts to improve initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) via electrochemical prelithiation, the fundamental processes governing transition metals (TMs) dissolution and associated degradation mechanisms in MOFs&#8208;based full cells remain unclear. In this study, crystalline cobalt&#8208;nickel bimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks CoNix&#8208;MOF (CoNix&#8208;Benzene dicarboxylic MOFs), specifically derived from benzene dicarboxylic (BDC) ligands, are selected as the target material for investigation. A solid&#8208;state corrosion (SSC) strategy for prelithiating MOFs anodes with corrosion of lithium metal is proposed for the first time. The full cell with prelithiated MOFs anode achieves an energy density of 493&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and demonstrates superior cycling stability with 83.3% capacity retention after 240 cycles at 0.2 C. The SSC prelithiation strategy effectively passivates Co/Ni nanoparticles, reducing Ni dissolution percentage by an order of magnitude (from 15.32% to 1.16%), which is identified as the key factor underpinning the enhanced full cell performance. This study underscores the practical applicability of MOFs&#8208;based anodes prelithiated by the SSC strategy for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;cycling lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>1D Van Der Waals Superlattices for Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D PbI2 superlattice are synthesized utilizing an antisolvent diffusion method, in which demonstrates in&#8208;plane anisotropic phonon vibrations and optical transport characteristics. Leveraging on the anisotropic optical transport nature and effective coupling with vdWMs, filter&#8208;free polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector comprising vdWMs and PbI2 superlattice waveguide are realized in a broad spectra range with linear dichroism ratio values of 1.43&#8211;1.73.








Abstract
The ability to detect polarimetric information of light over a broad spectra range is central to practical optoelectronic applications and has been successfully demonstrated with photodetectors of low&#8208;symmetry 2D van der Waals materials (vdWMs). However, polarization sensitivity within such a photodetectors remains elusive due to the limited diversity. To address this challenge, an approach is proposed by transforms 2D Lead iodine (PbI2) into 1D superlattice microwires (SLMs) through a solution&#8208;phase antisolvent diffusion method. This structural shifting enables the creation of low&#8208;symmetry crystal characteristics, a well&#8208;defined geometric microcavity structure, and an increased bandgap, which collectively confer anisotropic waveguide properties across visible and near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. By integrating PbI2 SLMs with isotropic 2D vdWMs, that waveguide&#8208;integrated photodetectors are demonstrated capable of polarization detection, achieving linear dichroism ratio (LDR) values of 1.66 at 405&#160;nm for PbI2 photodetectors and 1.73 at 785&#160;nm for WSe2 photodetectors. This paradigm&#8208;shifting strategy enables polarimetric information detection using isotropic vdWMs and advances the development of next&#8208;generation polarization&#8208;resolved optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Regulating Polymeric Adsorption Dynamics via Monolayer&#8208;Architected Hydrotalcite Integration for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>

A molecular aggregation control strategy utilizing a 2D atomic crystal, hydrotalcite, regulates polymeric adsorption dynamics of donor polymers, achieving an overall efficiency of 20.63%.








Abstract
In organic solar cells (OSCs), the molecular aggregation property of donor&#8211;acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architectures serves as a critical determinant in device performance. Nevertheless, the intrinsic steric constraints imposed by polymeric side chains frequently lead to metastable molecular packing configurations with diminished structural coherence. In this study, a morphological modulation strategy is proposed by adopting a 2D layered hydrotalcite (HDC) nanocrystal to regulate polymeric adsorption dynamics. By leveraging hydroxyl&#8208;directed interfacial coordination to HDC matrices, the nanocrystal&#8208;integrated BHJ systems manifest a pronounced donor&#8208;phase H&#8208;aggregation, synergistically coupled with reduced &#960;&#8208;orbital overlap distances and enhanced long&#8208;range crystalline ordering. These nanoscale structural advancements collectively engender superior charge transfer kinetics with reduced activation energy barriers and improved charge carrier transport properties. The HDC nanocrystal&#8208;blended devices not only achieve a top&#8208;notch power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.63%, but also shows its applicability across various donor &#8211; acceptor BHJ systems. This work develops a crystal&#8208;engineering strategy that concurrently optimizes nanoscale morphology and charge transport networks in OSCs, yielding state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance through synergistic structural&#8208;electronic modulation.

         <title>Coupling Tensile Strain and Electronic Modulation in Mesoporous PdMo Metallene Nanoveins for Improved Oxygen Reduction</title>

A universal ligand adsorption strategy for controllable synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional (1D and 2D) Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts to establish a fundamental understanding of the relationship between catalyst morphological structure and performance.








Abstract
Unraveling the fundamental determinants of the intrinsic activity of practical catalysts has long been challenging, mainly due to the complexity of the structures and surfaces of such catalysts. Current understandings of intrinsic activity mostly come from model catalysts. Here, a pH&#8208;induced ligand adsorption strategy is developed to achieve controllable synthesis of self&#8208;assembled low&#8208;dimensional PdMo nanostructures, including 1D nanowires, 2D metallenes, and 2D metallene nanoveins. A strong correlation is established between the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the density of grain boundaries. Increased grain boundary density induces more extensive tensile strain, which, in synergy with electronic interactions within PdMo alloys, effectively lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*O to *OH). 2D PdMo metallene nanoveins, featuring the highest grain boundary density and a unique mesoporous structure, exhibit superior ORR activity and mass transport capabilities. Computational fluid dynamics simulations and in situ spectroscopy are employed to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. This work provides fundamental insights into the critical role of grain boundary engineering in enhancing ORR electrocatalysis in Pd&#8208;based nanostructures.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Fabrication of Robust Physical Hydrogels via Bulk Copolymerization for Underwater Acoustics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free bulk copolymerization results in hydrophobically associated hydrogels exhibiting markedly different network structures and mechanical properties compared to those prepared via solution or micellar copolymerization. The synergistic effects of dense chain entanglements and pronounced phase separation lead to exceptional mechanical robustness and emergent viscoelasticity, enabling potential applications in underwater acoustic absorption.

Conventional hydrogel preparation typically involves the use of solvents (mostly water), which increases the free volume between polymer chains and weakens their interactions, resulting in mechanically weak hydrogels with limited viscoelasticity. Here, a solvent&#8208;free synthesis strategy is presented to produce tough, swelling&#8208;resistant physical hydrogels with ultra&#8208;wide frequency viscoelasticity (loss factor tan&#948; &gt; 0.3 at 10&#8722;10&#8211;105&#160;Hz). This is achieved through the bulk copolymerization of highly miscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers, forming water&#8208;free copolymers that develop into phase&#8208;separated hydrogels with dense chain entanglements upon equilibration in water. The resulting hydrogel exhibits significant mechanical enhancements over counterparts prepared through classical micellar copolymerization, with stiffness, strength, and fracture toughness increased by up to 81, 46, and 41 times, respectively. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the tough hydrogel with excellent swelling resistance is applied as a sound&#8208;absorbing coating for underwater vehicles, minimizing acoustic interference during marine research through its strong viscoelasticity and near&#8208;perfect acoustic impedance matching with water. Unlike conventional solvent&#8208;assisted polymerization methods used for hydrogel preparation, bulk copolymerization offers advantages such as ultra&#8208;high monomer concentration, pure products, and straightforward process, providing new insights for developing simple yet tough hydrogels that are not only promising for underwater applications but also conducive to theoretical studies.

         <title>Active Diffusion Controlled Dual Stability in Thermoelectrics for Sustainable Heat Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing a Mg interlayer at the junction simultaneously stabilizes Mg3(Bi,Sb)2 materials and contacts for over 100 days. This dual stabilization derives from suppressing detrimental Mg diffusion and compensating for Mg loss, thereby maintaining an outstanding power density of 0.45 W cm&#8722;2 and remarkable conversion efficiency of 8.6% in aged modules, offering new insights for durable thermoelectric energy harvesting.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technology offers a promising pathway toward global sustainability by harvesting waste heat. However, long&#8208;term stability is hindered by inevitable elemental diffusion, degrading both the thermoelectric junction and material properties, which prevents the realization of power generation applications. Here, dual and superior stability is achieved in high&#8208;performance Mg3(Bi,Sb)2, surpassing prior studies that focus on either junction or material stability. By introducing an Mg layer at the junction, detrimental Mg diffusion is suppressed and compensate for Mg loss in the material, effectively stabilizing both junctions and materials for over 100 days. As a result, a thermoelectric module with 30&#8208;day&#8208;aged Mg3(Bi,Sb)2 is able to maintain an outstanding power density of 0.45 W cm&#8722;2 and remarkable conversion efficiency of 8.6%, demonstrating unprecedented stability. These findings provide new insights into thermoelectric junction engineering, shifting from interface optimization to comprehensive stabilization, advancing the practical viability of thermoelectric energy harvesting for renewable and waste heat applications.

         <title>Early Terminating Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation via Nucleophilic Fluorination to Achieve High Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) can be effectively enhanced by early terminating solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation via equivalent chemical fluorination. This study presents novel insights into optimizing SEI compositions and electrochemical performance by manipulating the inherent self&#8208;terminating chemistry.








Abstract
The initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, quantifying the irreversible Li+ loss during the first cycle, is critical for determining practical energy density. Many electrode materials exhibit substandard ICEs (&lt;90%) due to excessive formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Traditional strategies modifying SEI formation mainly focus on the generating process but often consume extra Li+ and yield limited improvements. Here, a strategy is introduced that targets the terminating process of SEI formation, usually impeded by interfacial parasitic reactions, to achieve ICEs exceeding 90%. Using TiO2 as a model electrode, it is demonstrated that equivalent chemical fluorination suppresses the parasitic reaction between phosphorus pentafluoride (PF&#8325;) and surface hydroxyl groups (&#9472;OH), early terminating SEI formation. Interfacial analysis and theoretical simulations reveal that this approach reduces organic SEI formation while preserving the beneficial LiF&#8208;rich inner SEI layer. As a result, the fluorinated TiO2 anode exhibits an ICE of 92.1%, significantly higher than the 74.1% of pristine TiO2, without compromising other electrochemical performance metrics. Pouch cell tests confirm the practical applicability of the method. This work provides deep insights into mechanisms of terminating SEI formation and opens a new pathway for optimizing the battery performances through inherent SEI manipulation.

         <title>Fukui Function&#8208;Engineered Gel Electrolytes: Thermodynamic/Kinetic&#8208;Synergistic Regulation for Long&#8208;Cycling Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed gel electrolyte, engineered through the Fukui function to synergistically modulate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the zinc anode interface, enables both symmetric and full&#8208;cell configurations to achieve exceptional cycling stability. Notably, the cells maintain remarkable electrochemical performance even under elevated temperature conditions. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells demonstrate achieved superior cycling durability and excellent mechanical robustness.








Abstract
While traditional gel electrolytes address critical issues such as electrolyte leakage and dendrite growth in zinc metal batteries (ZMBs), their intrinsic inability to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a fundamental limitation. Herein, a Fukui function&#8208;guided molecular engineering approach is proposed to develop a gel electrolyte (HG&#8208;3TP) with higher Gibbs free energy of HER (&#916;GHER). The reduced electrophilic Fukui function inhibits Zn electron extraction while participating in Zn2&#8314; solvation to decrease free water activity. Simultaneously, attenuated nucleophilic Fukui function creates an inert barrier on Zn anodes, raising H&#8314; desorption energy and lowering proton diffusion. These synergistic effects suppress the Volmer/Heyrovsky step, significantly increasing &#916;GHER and inhibiting HER. Meanwhile, optimized interfacial energetics facilitate uniform Zn plating/stripping while maintaining cathode compatibility. As a result, Zn batteries with HG&#8208;3TP exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, achieving 4,000&#160;h in Zn||Zn symmetric cells and maintaining operation for 710&#160;h at 60&#160;&#176;C, while demonstrating 83.5% capacity retention over 11&#160;000 cycles in Zn||VO2 full cells. This work establishes a thermodynamics&#8208;kinetics orchestrated paradigm through Fukui function&#8208;guided electrolyte design, advancing ultrastable ZMBs for scalable energy storage.

         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the combined advantages of the LbL deposition strategy and dual&#8208;channel FRET, a broader spatial distribution of exciton generation sites is achieved, accompanied by significantly improved exciton utilization efficiency, enhanced carrier mobility, and suppressed charge recombination. The optimal device achieves a remarkable PCE of 17.76%, ranking among the highest PCE values reported so far in ASM&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) hold great potential for commercialization owing to their well&#8208;defined molecular structures and minimal batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations. Nevertheless, the inherent challenges in precise control of blend morphology of the active layer restrict exciton utilization efficiency, resulting in the restricted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in ASM&#8208;OSC compared with polymer&#8208;based OSCs. Herein, small molecule donor Por&#8208;BR is incorporated into the acceptor layer of the DAPor&#8208;DPP/6TIC system utilizing a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition strategy to construct high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs. The LbL deposition strategy facilitates the formation of a more pronounced vertical phase distribution in the active layer. Besides, dual&#8208;channel FRET from Por&#8208;BR to both DAPor&#8208;DPP and 6TIC occurs in the active layer. Benefiting from the combined advantages of the LbL deposition strategy and dual&#8208;channel FRET, a broader spatial distribution of exciton generation sites is achieved, accompanied by significantly improved exciton utilization efficiency, enhanced carrier mobility, and reduced charge recombination. The optimal device delivers a remarkable PCE of 17.76%, representing one of the highest PCE values reported so far in ASM&#8208;OSCs. This work offers an effective strategy for device performance enhancement, which in turn facilitates the industrialization of OSCs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-small-molecule organic solar cells (ASM-OSCs) hold great potential for commercialization owing to their well-defined molecular structures and minimal batch-to-batch variations. Nevertheless, the inherent challenges in precise control of blend morphology of the active layer restrict exciton utilization efficiency, resulting in the restricted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in ASM-OSC compared with polymer-based OSCs. Herein, small molecule donor Por-BR is incorporated into the acceptor layer of the DAPor-DPP/6TIC system utilizing a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition strategy to construct high-performance ASM-OSCs. The LbL deposition strategy facilitates the formation of a more pronounced vertical phase distribution in the active layer. Besides, dual-channel FRET from Por-BR to both DAPor-DPP and 6TIC occurs in the active layer. Benefiting from the combined advantages of the LbL deposition strategy and dual-channel FRET, a broader spatial distribution of exciton generation sites is achieved, accompanied by significantly improved exciton utilization efficiency, enhanced carrier mobility, and reduced charge recombination. The optimal device delivers a remarkable PCE of 17.76%, representing one of the highest PCE values reported so far in ASM-OSCs. This work offers an effective strategy for device performance enhancement, which in turn facilitates the industrialization of OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;entropy Antiperovskite Nitride Enables Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive and high&#8208;entropy antiperovskite nitride FeZnNNiCoV is developed to present outstanding oxygen evolution performance in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer through eliminating the ohmic loss at high&#8208;current density and triggering efficient lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism. Impressively, the FeZnNNiCoV needs merely 310 mV of overpotential to achieve 1 A cm&#8722;2 and shows ultra&#8208;high stability at 1 A cm&#8722;2 over 1000 h.








Abstract
Despite the availability of many (oxy)hydroxide&#8208;based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with favorable intrinsic activity, few perform well in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Their poor electrical conductivity confines the OER to the boundary between the current collector and electrocatalyst, resulting in poor catalyst utilization. Herein, the use of highly conductive antiperovskite nitride is proposed as a platform to develop robust OER electrodes for AEMWEs with outstanding performance. By growing over nickel foam, high catalyst surface is realized. Under operation conditions, surface reconstruction leads to the formation of a thin layer of metal oxy&#8208;hydroxide, which acts as the real catalyst while protecting the bulk nitride from further corrosion, in turn the conductive antiperovskite effectively improves the catalyst utilization due to efficient current collection. By further rational design of the antiperovskite with a high&#8208;entropy composition capable of selective dissolution of elements, lattice oxygen participation in the OER catalysis is enhanced, resulting in boosted intrinsic activity. Specifically, FeZnNNiCoV shows a 108&#8208;fold increase in OER specific activity compared to low&#8208;entropy ZnNNiCo and ultra&#8208;high stability at 1 A cm&#8722;2 over 1000 h. The corresponding AEMWE requires a potential of only 1.76 V to reach 1 A cm&#8722;2, making it highly promising for practical applications.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Directional Etching for Fabricating Defect Hollow Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Hierarchical Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comprehensive phase diagram is established by a directional etching technique with H3PMo12O40 as an etchant to target MOFs defect&#8208;engineered hollow hierarchical structures. The etched MOF achieves an exceptional H2 evolution rate due to the enhanced exposure of encapsulated polyoxometalate clusters in the hollow structure.








Abstract
Encapsulating guests in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can widely expand their functionality, but usually reduces porosity, hindering reactant and product diffusion. Herein, a simple and rapid room temperature directional etching technique is developed to engineer MOFs with tailored hierarchical structures. With H3PMo12O40 (PMo12) as an etchant, classical cubic morphology of WNi@Z8, a ZIF&#8208;8 MOF encapsulating SiW11NiO39 (WNi), can be transformed into various defect&#8208;engineered hollow structures, and a comprehensive phase diagram is established by systematically adjusting etching parameters. Mechanistic studies reveal that PMo12 infiltrates ZIF&#8208;8 preferentially through {111} facet, followed by controlled etching along {110} and {100} facets, enabling precise spatial control over cavity formation. The etched WNi@Z8 achieves an exceptional H2 evolution rate of 12,667&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, nearly threefold enhancement over the non&#8208;etched counterpart due to the enhanced exposure of encapsulated WNi clusters in the hollow structure. This work provides a generalizable strategy for engineering guest@MOFs to achieve high&#8208;efficiency catalysis.

         <title>Alkoxy Side Chain Engineering in Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how alkoxy side chains influence COF properties to enhance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. Incorporating varying alkoxy groups improves hydrophilicity and modulates the electronic structure via p&#8208;&#960; conjugation. Notably, longer alkoxy side chains facilitate fine&#8208;tuning of the COFs' electronic states, resulting in enhanced ORR activity that outperforms previously reported metal&#8208;free COFs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gain significant attention as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key process in energy conversion technologies like fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. While substantial efforts are devoted to unravelling the mechanisms, by which heteroatom&#8208;containing building blocks in linkers, vertices, and linkages, enhance catalytic activity and selectivity, the potential of side&#8208;chain engineering to modulate pore wall surfaces and optimize the catalytic environment remains largely underexplored. This study investigates the role of alkoxy side chains in modulating the properties of COFs to enhance ORR performance. The synthesized COFs have adjustable pore surfaces, integrating triazine rings and alkoxy groups to enhance channel hydrophilicity by modulating interactions with water molecules. Moreover, the alkoxy side chains act as electron donors through p&#8211;&#960; conjugation, creating active and tuneable electronic sites, further enhancing hydrophilicity and facilitating efficient catalytic cycles. Notably, COFs with longer alkoxy side chains exhibit superior ORR activity, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.77&#160;V, surpassing previously reported metal&#8208;free COFs. Theoretical calculations suggest that this enhancement is because of the stronger binding affinity of water molecules and *OOH intermediates to the carbon atoms adjacent to the alkoxy side chains.

         <title>Engineering Red Blood Cells for Amplified Tumor Dual&#8208;Gas Transfusion Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cells (RBCs) are nano/gas&#8208;engineered for tumor dual&#8208;gas (CO and NO) transfusion therapy. The engineered RBCs release dual&#8208;gas in tumor cell to amplify ROS and RNS production through HbFe2&#8314;&#8208;mediated catalysis, disrupting glycometabolism and reshaping tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for effective treatment with biosafety. When combined with tumor cell membrane engineering, this strategy enables personalized therapy and suppresses metastatic in synergy with &#945;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy constitutes a vital medical intervention primarily aimed at enhancing oxygen delivery. Furthermore, RBCs possess the ability to stably bind therapeutic gas molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO). As natural gas carriers, RBCs have the potential to mitigate the non&#8208;specific gas release and biosafety issues associated with conventional gas donors, which currently hinder the clinical application of gas therapy. In this study, RBCs are innovatively engineered for amplified tumor dual&#8208;gas transfusion therapy. The RBCs delivering CO and NO are developed using advanced nano&#8208; and gas&#8208;engineering techniques. These engineered RBCs are activated by tumor cell&#8208;specific&#160;hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to release gases, and it induces a cascade amplification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (ONOO&#8722;) production through the catalytic action of the ferrous hemoglobin (HbFe2+). This process disrupts glycometabolism and reshapes the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy. By integrating tumor cell membrane engineering, this approach enables targeted, personalized therapy and effectively suppresses metastatic tumors synergistically with &#945;PD&#8208;L1. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that engineered RBC&#8208;based amplified tumor dual&#8208;gas transfusion therapy exhibits excellent biosafety, and holds significant potential as a highly translatable and promising cancer treatment modality.

These engineered RBCs are activated by tumor cell-specific&#160;hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to release gases, and it induces a cascade amplification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) production through the catalytic action of the ferrous hemoglobin (HbFe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). This process disrupts glycometabolism and reshapes the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy. By integrating tumor cell membrane engineering, this approach enables targeted, personalized therapy and effectively suppresses metastatic tumors synergistically with &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;PD-L1. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that engineered RBC-based amplified tumor dual-gas transfusion therapy exhibits excellent biosafety, and holds significant potential as a highly translatable and promising cancer treatment modality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Soft Extrudable Dendritic Particles with Nanostructured Tendrils for Local Adhesion and Drug Release to Bladder Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft dendritic particles (SDPs) made of biodegradable polymers and small&#8208;molecule drugs are manufactured using a fluid flow templating method. In alginate gels, extruded SDPs sustainably adhere on tumor sites and selectively kill cancer cells. Intravesical instillation of SDPs in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse bladders triggers a CD45+ immune response with minimal toxicity, highlighting their potential for targeted cancer therapy.








Abstract
Bladder cancer is a leading cause of cancer&#8208;related mortality, yet current intravesical drug delivery methods often suffer from poor retention times in the bladder. Gecko feet&#8208;like nanomaterials offer the potential to overcome this challenge, however, conventional methods to fabricate high surface area nanomaterials for drug delivery involve complex and expensive manufacturing processes. In this work, a simple fluid flow templating method is reported for manufacturing soft dendritic particles (SDPs) composed of poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) with a chitosan coating for enhanced adhesion to epithelial tissues via van der Waals interactions. The biodegradable SDPs encapsulate chemotherapeutic agents and are administered using an alginate hydrogel, enabling precise deposition by extrusion for sustained drug release. The results demonstrate that SDPs adhere to mouse and human cancer cells for several days. The SDPs effectively encapsulate and release several clinically utilized chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine, docetaxel, and methotrexate, exhibiting superior cancer cell killing in vitro. In murine models, gemcitabine&#8208;loaded SDPs instilled into tumor&#8208;bearing bladders elicited stronger CD45+ immune cell responses than control groups while maintaining minimal toxicity. This work presents a simple, biomimetic drug delivery platform with prolonged retention and controlled drug release, offering a versatile approach for enhancing therapeutic delivery in epithelial cancer models.

         <title>Industry&#8208;Compatible Fully Laminated Perovskite&#8208;CIGS Tandem Solar Cells with Co&#8208;Evaporated Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a highly efficient bilayer methylammonium lead iodide perovskite is fabricated using a scalable co&#8208;evaporation technique. This strategy enhances the film's stability, allowing the deposition of a tin oxide buffer layer via atomic layer deposition without damaging the perovskite. Moreover, this approach is compatible for tandem applications, enabling the fabrication of 26.1% efficient fully laminated perovskite&#8208;CIGS tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;CIGS thin&#8208;film tandem solar cells could potentially share vacuum&#8208;based production equipment between sub&#8208;cells, reducing CapEx and supply chain dependence while enabling flexible, lightweight designs for versatile photovoltaic applications. However, scalable vacuum&#8208;based fabrication techniques for perovskite&#8208;CIGS tandems remain limited and challenging. Here, a highly efficient and stable bilayer methylammonium lead iodide perovskite fabricated using a scalable co&#8208;evaporation technique is presented. In this bilayer structure, an additional thin layer with an enhanced PbI&#8322; evaporation rate is deposited atop a thick stoichiometric perovskite film. This approach reduces film roughness and improves the contact potential difference at the perovskite interface. For the first time, this interface engineering strategy enhances absorber film stability, enabling the deposition of a SnOx buffer layer via atomic layer deposition without damaging the perovskite layer. The bilayer film is used to fabricate single&#8208;junction solar cells, achieving a maximum power conversion efficiency of 23.1%, with over 93% of its efficiency retained after 500 h of continuous maximum power point tracking. Ultimately, its compatibility for tandem applications is demonstrated, leading to the fabrication of fully laminated perovskite&#8208;CIGS tandem solar cells with an efficiency of 26.1%, surpassing the current record for monolithic perovskite&#8208;CIGS tandems at the same 1 cm2 active area. The sub&#8208;cells are integrated via POE lamination, a widely adopted industrial process, ensuring compatibility with large&#8208;scale manufacturing.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Engineering Cellulose Nanofibers via In Situ PEDOT Polymerization for Superior Thermoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>

A strategy for homogeneous in situ polymerization of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) along cellulose nanofibril surfaces is presented. Featuring enhanced charge delocalization and exceptional durability under 2000 bends and 5000 abrasions, wet&#8208;heat aging, freezing, and UV aging tests, the conductive nanocellulose fibers maintain stable electrical conductivity and thermoelectric output&#8212;a key advance for nanocellulose wearables and flexible electronics.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are abundant and possess exceptional mechanical strength, but their intrinsic electrical insulation limits their application in wearable electronics. In this study, a versatile methodology is presented to produce highly conductive and durable CNFs through electrostatic potential&#8208;enhanced in situ polymerization of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Guided by molecular dynamics simulations, electrostatic interactions are controlled by tailoring the chain length of PEDOT, achieving homogeneous polymerization. Compared to conventional polymerization and blending methods, this approach prevented the self&#8208;aggregation of PEDOT crystallites, which would otherwise localize charge carriers and hinder electrical transport, as confirmed by scanning Kelvin probe microscope (SKPM). These fibers can leverage nanocellulose's capillary effects to rearrange PEDOT crystallites, thereby boosting electrical conductivity by 5 orders of magnitude over suboptimal samples. The conductive nanocellulose paper achieves superior electrical conductivity (91 S cm&#8722;1) and durability, retaining 90% of electrical properties over 2000 bending cycles, 5000 abrasion tests, and prolonged wet&#8208;heat aging, freezing, and UV aging, while also demonstrating stable thermoelectric performance with power factor exceeding 3.8 &#181;W mK&#8722;2 and a promising device output of 46.6 nW. These findings advance the conventional notion that charge&#8208;transporting nanocellulose can only be obtained by carbonization, graphitization, or physical blending with conductive components, which further boosts its potential for wearable applications.

         <title>Unraveling and Modulating the Competitive Dynamics in Direct Regeneration of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Material</title>

Prior&#8208;relithiation regulates the competitive dynamics of the direct regeneration process by increasing the oxygen vacancy formation energy, thereby achieving ideal direct regeneration.








Abstract
Direct regeneration, as a promising technology for recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion battery materials, fundamentally involves replenishing missing components in degraded materials to promote structural reconstruction. Current methods to achieve lithium replenishment typically rely on lithium salt conversion at high temperatures. However, the inherent lithium deficiencies in spent cathode materials trigger lattice oxygen loss under thermal conditions, exacerbating structural degradation and hindering further relithiation. The conflicts between relithiation and thermal decomposition are the key to limiting the regeneration effect. Due to insufficient understanding of the competitive mechanisms among the various reactions in direct regeneration, avoiding these conflicts by strategy design remains challenging. Herein, this study elucidates the sequence and dynamic evolution of critical reactions in direct regeneration, identifying a previously unknown prior&#8208;relithiation process that occurs at significantly lower temperatures. By promoting this prior&#8208;relithiation process, the oxygen vacancy formation energy of spent cathode materials is increased, stabilizing the cathode material structure and mitigating thermal decomposition during direct regeneration. The regeneration effect is therefore significantly improved, achieving a 15% higher capacity recovery rate and significantly enhanced overall electrochemical performance compared to the normal approach. This study deepens the understanding of direct regeneration mechanisms and offers a scientific foundation for developing advanced direct regeneration strategies.

         <title>Breaking the Selectivity Barrier of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes Through Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Ligand Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>

Here, Ru SAzyme with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chlorine ligands is reported as a monofunctional, high&#8208;performance peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme. Incorporating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ligand coordination emulates enzyme selectivity and regulates reaction pathways for an identical substrate. The optimized Ru SAzyme exhibits exceptional peroxidase&#8208;selective activity (38&#8208;fold higher than its catalase&#8208;like activity) and demonstrates practical applicability for simultaneous biomarker quantification under near&#8208;neutral conditions.








Abstract
Peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like nanozymes have emerged as effective alternatives to natural enzymes owing to their stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness in biosensors. In particular, single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) featuring Fe&#8211;N4 active sites have attracted significant attention for their high catalytic performance. However, their 2D exposed active sites result in limited reaction selectivity and strong pH dependence, restricting their functionality under neutral conditions. This study introduces Ru&#8208;centered SAzymes coordinated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane with chlorine ligands (RuNC_Cl), achieving monofunctional POD&#8208;like activity. RuNC_Cl exhibited remarkable POD&#8208;like activity, which is 38&#8208;fold greater than its catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity, indicating strong suppression of the competing CAT&#8208;like reaction. Density functional theory calculations and Bader charge analysis of RuNC_Cl reveal that repulsive forces preventing secondary H2O2 adsorption contribute to an increased energy barrier for the CAT&#8208;like reaction. This selective POD&#8208;like activity enables the precise detection of multiple biomarkers through a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction under near&#8208;neutral conditions. This advancement paves the way for the precise regulation of reaction pathways, enhancing the practicality of nanozymes for biosensing and related applications.

         <title>Nickel Hydroxide Catalyzed Bias&#8208;free Photoelectrochemical NH3 Production via Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction with high efficiency and production rate is achieved using a crystalline silicon photocathode with nickel as the catalyst. Performing the PEC NO3RR under alkaline conditions can be self&#8208;activated of the Ni surface by forming Ni(OH)2. This Ni(OH)2 layer can suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and promote NO3RR, significantly enhancing NH3 production efficiency.








Abstract
The photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) potentially converts nitrate, a major water pollutant, into NH3, which is an eco&#8208;friendly, next&#8208;generation energy source. However, achieving high efficiency in the PEC NO3RR has been challenging because of the need for high applied voltage and competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, a PEC NO3RR is successfully implemented that demonstrated a high NH3 production rate of 2468&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (at &#8722;0.1&#160;V vs RHE) using a c&#8208;Si photocathode with Ni foil as the catalyst. Conducting the PEC NO3RR under alkaline conditions can lead to the self&#8208;activation of the Ni surface with Ni(OH)2. Ni(OH)2 can suppress the competitive HER and facilitate NO3RR, enhancing NH3 production efficiency. Furthermore, a PEC NO3RR system is developed that operates without external voltage and achieved bias&#8208;free record&#8208;high solar to NH3 conversion efficiency of 3.8% and an NH3 production rate of 554&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1.

         <title>Revealing Redox&#8208;Mediated CO2 Reduction Reaction Mechanisms in Aprotic Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A current&#8208;density&#8208;dependent redox&#8208;mediated CO&#8322; reduction reaction (CO2RR) pathway is unveiled in aprotic Li&#8211;CO2 batteries through multimodal in situ spectroscopic techniques. It is found that the low&#8208;current&#8208;densities operation reduces the activation barrier of CO2RR while facilitating PQ regeneration for sustained redox cycling, thereby enabling a remarkable reduction in overpotential and increase in discharge capacity.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;mediated electrocatalysis represents an innovative strategy to unlock the energy capabilities of aprotic Li&#8211;CO2 batteries by enabling solution&#8208;mediated CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the underlying reaction pathways remain incompletely understood due to the lack of direct molecular evidence. Herein, multimodal in situ spectroscopic techniques are integrated with theoretical calculations to interrogate a model 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone (PQ)&#8208;mediated CO2RR. Direct spectroscopic evidence reveals a current&#8208;density&#8208;dependent CO2RR pathway: the reduced PQ reacts with CO2 to form metastable Li2(PQ&#8208;CO2) adduct via ECE and EEC pathways at low and high current densities, respectively. Subsequently, the metastable Li2(PQ&#8208;CO2) adduct dissociates to form the LiCO2 intermediate and regenerate LinPQ (n = 0 and 1 at low and high current densities, respectively). Two LiCO2 intermediates dimerize to produce the final discharge products of Li2CO3 and CO in bulk solution. Therefore, the operation of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries at low&#8208;current densities reduces the activation barrier of CO2RR and regenerates PQ for sustained redox cycling, enabling significantly minimized overpotential and enhanced discharge capacity. Additionally, the suppression effects of weakly acidic cations (e.g., K+, TBA+) are elucidated for the redox&#8208;mediated CO2RR. This work highlights the pivotal chemical dissociation step in PQ&#8208;mediated CO&#8322;RR and provides a mechanistic framework for designing better metal&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Hardware Implementation of On&#8208;Chip Hebbian Learning Through Integrated Neuromorphic Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a neuromorphic hardware platform that integrates presynaptic transistors, threshold switching neurons, and adaptive feedback synapses. The architecture enables on&#8208;chip Hebbian learning through correlation&#8208;based weight updates without external training circuits. A 6 &#215; 6 device array demonstrates stable real&#8208;time operation, offering a pathway toward efficient, scalable brain&#8208;inspired computing systems.








Abstract
The von Neumann bottleneck and growing energy demands of conventional computing systems require innovative architectural solutions. Although neuromorphic computing is a promising alternative, implementing efficient on&#8208;chip learning mechanisms remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, a novel artificial neural platform is presented that integrates three synergistic components: modulation&#8208;optimized presynaptic transistors, threshold switching memristor&#8208;based neurons, and adaptive feedback synapses. The platform demonstrates real&#8208;time synaptic weight modification through correlation&#8208;based learning, effectively implementing Hebbian principles in hardware without requiring extensive peripheral circuitry. Stable device operation and successful implementation of local learning rules are confirmed by systematically characterizing a 6 &#215; 6 array configuration. The experimental results demonstrate a correlation between input&#8211;output signals and subsequent weight modifications, establishing a viable pathway toward hardware implementation of Hebbian learning in neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Heterogeneous Polymer Multilayers Enabling Photoresponsive Nonreciprocal Patterns for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonreciprocal optical patterns are fabricated using heterogeneous multilayers of photopatternable azopolymers and polyvinyl alcohol polarizers. The nonreciprocal optical patterns can only be read from one direction, providing a unique security feature for information encryption. The responsiveness of the nonreciprocal optical patterns and the mechanical robustness of the multilayers enable the design of flexible, portable, and wearable devices for information encryption.








Abstract
Society has a growing demand for information security. The development of nonreciprocal patterns is a new approach for high&#8208;security information encryption, but it is difficult to achieve due to its complexity in material design. Herein, heterogeneous polymer multilayers are designed to prepare nonreciprocal patterns for information encryption. The heterogeneous polymer multilayers are constructed by gluing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polarizers and photoresponsive azobenzene&#8208;containing polymers (azopolymers) via photocontrolled adhesion. Nonreciprocal optical patterns are fabricated via photopatterning of the azopolymer layer with polarized light. The information can only be decrypted from one direction of the nonreciprocal optical patterns. The nonreciprocal optical patterns are dynamic, which can be erased and rewritten with updated information via light irradiation. The nonreciprocal optical patterns can be further imprinted with diffraction elements, showing dual&#8208;mode optical signals. The nonreciprocal optical patterns with dynamic, dual&#8208;mode features enable high&#8208;security information encryption. Moreover, the heterogeneous polymer multilayers are flexible, bendable, and foldable, enabling the design of devices with nonreciprocal optical patterns for encryption in 3D space. The heterogeneous polymer multilayers with photoresponsive nonreciprocal patterns offer a solution for designing secure, updatable, and mechanically robust information encryption materials for flexible photonics, portable electronics, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and wearable devices.

         <title>Ultrathin Deployable Femtosecond Vortex Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deployable ultrathin femtosecond vortex laser based on a BIC&#8208;enabled polymer membrane is demonstrated, delivering MW/cm2 peak power and structured light emission. With its modular design and compact footprint, it is considered promising for integration into advanced imaging and lithography.








Abstract
Ultrafast vortex lasers, capable of emitting structured femtosecond pulses with orbital angular momentum, hold great potential for high&#8208;speed optical communications, super&#8208;resolution imaging, and advanced laser processing. However, the direct generation of femtosecond vortex pulses in micro/nanoscale lasers remains a major challenge. Here, an ultrathin deployable femtosecond vortex laser based on a &#8776;200&#160;nm&#8208;thick conjugated polymer gain membrane integrated with a square&#8208;lattice photonic crystal supporting symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum mode is demonstrated. The high&#8208;Q vortex modes driven by Purcell enhancement enable low&#8208;threshold (1.5&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm2), femtosecond (&#8776;600&#160;fs) vortex pulse emission with peak power reaching several MW/cm2. The freestanding membrane can be modularly deployed onto arbitrary substrates, where direct laser fabrication is challenging. When deployed onto an optical mirror, the membrane laser achieved unidirectional emission, nearly doubling its output efficiency. Furthermore, a confocal optical path aligned the vortex laser coaxially with the pump light, highlighting its potential as an integrated module for simplifying super&#8208;resolution imaging and lithography techniques.

         <title>Catalytic Solder Fuses Solid&#8208;Solid Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic &#8220;soldering&#8221; strategy based on TiS2 enables in situ formation of amorphous TiS4 and Li&#8208;Ti&#8208;P&#8208;S&#8208;Cl interphases, which promote seamless interfacial fusion and significantly enhance Li+ transport and catalytic kinetics. The resulting all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver outstanding areal capacity and long&#8208;term stability under high sulfur loading.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have garnered significant research interest due to their inherent safety and high energy density. Nevertheless, their practical applications remain constrained by the sluggish sulfur reaction kinetics. While catalytic strategies have been demonstrated to facilitate sulfur conversion, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by the lack of interfacial continuity. Thus, there is an urgent need for interfacial fusion to achieve such continuity and construct efficient catalytic interfaces. In this work, an amorphous interfacial fusion strategy using TiS2 as a catalytic &#8220;solder&#8221;, enabling intimate integration among sulfur, the catalyst, and the solid&#8208;state electrolyte is proposed. Upon reacting with sulfur and the sulfide&#8208;based solid electrolyte, TiS2 induces the in situ formation of amorphous TiS4 and Li&#8208;Ti&#8208;P&#8208;S&#8208;Cl interfacial phases. These amorphous phases facilitate interfacial &#8220;soldering&#8221;, creating integrated catalytic interfaces that enhance Li+ transport and catalytic efficiency. As a result, the optimized ASSLSBs show a reversible specific capacity of 720 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1 C. It also delivers a high areal capacity of 7.05 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm&#8722;2. This interfacial fusion strategy offers a promising pathway toward the practical development of high&#8208;performance ASSLSBs.

         <title>Biomimetic Mineralization Nucleation with Polymer Template Enabled High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells by Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Technology</title>

         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free preparation craft of perovskite is expected to promote its scale&#8208;up production, however, the poor nucleation in this process constrains the quality of perovskite films. Here, a biomimetic mineralization strategy is employed that introduces a polymer template as a buried interfacial modification layer to enhance the performance and stability of the device. 








Abstract
Nucleation regulation in the perovskite film&#8208;forming process has been widely studied to optimize crystal quality and enable high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by an anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free method. However, the vertical nucleation process is often difficult to control in anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free preparation, due to the heterogeneous metal ion distribution and subsequent non&#8208;uniform nucleation. Inspired by natural biomineralization mechanisms, this is pioneered that the introduction of a functional biopolymer carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) at the buried interface of the perovskite layer, which would promote homogeneous vertical nucleation. Furthermore, CMC can improve perovskite film quality, passivate interfacial defects, and mitigate residual stresses. Finally, PVSCs with CMC prepared by anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free method exhibit a remarkable PCE of 25.12%, ranking among the highest devices fabricated without anti&#8208;solvent, while also exhibiting significantly improved stability. Encouragingly, the large&#8208;area PVSCs (1&#8201;cm2) achieved an excellent PCE of 24%. This is believed that this work offers a robust strategy for optimizing anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free fabrication processes for scalable and printable PVSCs.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Evolution in Hard Carbon Synthesis via Electrothermal Coupling Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional hard carbon synthesis suffers from structural degradation like amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;graphitic transitions and pore collapse due to prolonged sintering, impairing sodium storage. Researchers report an ultrafast (30&#8208;s) electrothermal coupling strategy using joule heating for carbonization, effectively preventing this structural damage. This method preserves abundant micropores and expanded interlayer spacing, leading to superior sodium storage performance.








Abstract
Conventional hard carbon synthesis through prolonged sintering suffers from structural degradation, including amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;graphitic transitions and pore collapse, critically impairing sodium storage performance. Here, a spatiotemporally controlled electrothermal coupling strategy is proposed that revolutionizes carbonization via in situ joule heating, achieving ultrafast synthesis (30 s) with preserved structural integrity.

     alt="Spatiotemporal Evolution in Hard Carbon Synthesis via Electrothermal Coupling Strategy for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional hard carbon synthesis suffers from structural degradation like amorphous-to-graphitic transitions and pore collapse due to prolonged sintering, impairing sodium storage. Researchers report an ultrafast (30-s) electrothermal coupling strategy using joule heating for carbonization, effectively preventing this structural damage. This method preserves abundant micropores and expanded interlayer spacing, leading to superior sodium storage performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional hard carbon synthesis through prolonged sintering suffers from structural degradation, including amorphous-to-graphitic transitions and pore collapse, critically impairing sodium storage performance. Here, a spatiotemporally controlled electrothermal coupling strategy is proposed that revolutionizes carbonization via in situ joule heating, achieving ultrafast synthesis (30 s) with preserved structural integrity. By precisely regulating current density distribution, this method enables defect-selective graphitization while maintaining abundant micropores and expanded interlayer spacing (0.39 nm). The optimized hard carbon synthesized at 1000&#160;&#176;C demonstrates exceptional sodium storage capacity (306.83 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and record-high initial Coulombic efficiency (91.99%), outperforming furnace sample by 16.7% in capacity. During the spatiotemporal evolution process, localized electric field can induce directional charge redistribution and lower C&#9472;C bond dissociation barriers, enabling rapid formation of microporous structure with enhanced Na&#8314; diffusion kinetics and stable interfacial properties. Temporal superiority of this method is evidenced by 79.45% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Doped IrO2 Enable Pathway Switch to Lattice Oxygen Mechanism with Enhanced Stability for Low Iridium PEM Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
S doping induces lattice expansion, modifies coordination environments, and redistributes charges on Ir sites, introducing non&#8208;bonding oxygen to switch OER from AEM to LOM while ensuring stability, achieving synergistic enhancement of activity/durability, and enabling cost&#8208;effective PEMWE operation.








Abstract
Achieving high activity and stability while minimizing Ir usage poses a significant challenge in the industrialization of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein we report a sulfur&#8208;doping strategy that enables the OER pathway on IrO2 nanoparticles (IrO2/S) to switch from conventional adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) to lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) while maintaining Ir&#9472;O bond stability, thus achieving a significant enhancement in both intrinsic activity and durability. Advanced spectroscopies and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#9472;S coordination motif within the lattice increases the electron density of the Ir center and enhances Ir&#9472;O covalency, thus triggering the LOM pathway. Importantly, the lattice distortion and unsaturated Ir&#9472;O coordination within the IrO2/S generate the oxygen nonbonding state that acts as an electron sacrificial agent to preserve Ir&#9472;O bonds upon the LOM&#8208;dominated OER process. As a result, PEMWE integrated with such IrO2/S electrocatalyst delivers a low cell voltage (1.769 V at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability (16.6 &#181;V h&#8315;&#185; over 1000 h@1.0 A cm&#8315;2) while dramatically reducing Ir usage from 1.0 to 0.3 mg cm&#8722;2. This work establishes S doping as a viable strategy to trigger LOM and stabilize lattice oxygen redox in Ir&#8208;based catalysts, opening a new avenue for low&#8208;Ir PEMWEs.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Nanoengineered Wood for Scalable Monolithic Gas Sensor Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by insect olfactory structures, a bionic nanoengineered wood scalable monolithic gas sensor fabrication is developed. By precisely constructing vertical microchannels and sulfur&#8208;vacancy WS&#8322; nanosheets, the wood achieves selective NO&#8322; adsorption and efficient charge transfer. The 3D interdigitated electrodes enhance signal conduction, achieving a detection limit of 50 ppb, demonstrating great potential for scalable manufacturing and wireless gas detection.








Abstract
Insects exhibit exceptional olfactory abilities due to the synergistic interaction between porous sensilla and sensory receptors, optimizing gas transmission and capture. Inspired by this, a scalable structure of WS2&#8208;functionalized nanoengineered wood (WS2&#8208;NEW) for bio&#8208;inspired gas sensors is designed. A multiscale sensing network mimicking insect receptor synergy by in&#8208;situ loading WS2 nanosheets into vertically aligned microchannels formed by lignin removal, integrated with cross&#8208;sectional 3D interdigital electrodes is developed. The nanoengineered wood enables selective NO2 adsorption and optimized charge transfer through engineered gas transport pathways and defect&#8208;rich active sites. With the optimized 3D electrode structure, WS&#8322;&#8208;NEW facilitates rapid gas transmission and real&#8208;time signal transduction, achieving highly sensitive NO2 detection at room temperature with a detection limit as low as 50 ppb. Utilizing wood's processability, WS2&#8208;NEW has demonstrated the potential for large&#8208;scale manufacturing via simple cutting techniques. A wireless sensor watch based on WS2&#8208;NEW for real&#8208;time NO2 detection highlights its potential in wearable devices. This work proposes an innovative strategy for the manufacturing of gas sensors.

         <title>Preferred Parallel Alignment of Sulfonamide Enables High&#8208;performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>

4&#8208;Cyanobenzenesulfonamide and 4&#8209;carboxybenzenesulfonamide additives interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ defects through benzene&#8209;ring functional groups. The superior electronic configuration of 4&#8209;carboxybenzenesulfonamide enhances dual&#8209;site passivation, yielding large&#8209;grain, low&#8209;defect perovskite films. Perovskite solar cells modified by 4&#8209;carboxybenzenesulfonamide achieve a power conversion efficiency of 26.53% (certified efficiency: 26.31%), demonstrating a novel strategy for the rational design of high&#8208;performance perovskite additives.








Abstract
Molecule additives emerge as a highly effective strategy for enhancing the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), owing to their potential in suppressing intrinsic defects in perovskite. However, the influence of atomic configuration and electronic properties of additives on their passivation performance receives little attention. Here, two benzenesulfonamide derivatives, 4&#8208;carboxybenzenesulfonamide (CO&#8208;BSA) and 4&#8208;cyanobenzenesulfonamide (CN&#8208;BSA) are investigated, examining the effects of molecules with different electron&#8209;acceptor functional groups on the defect passivation of perovskite layer and the photovoltaic properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs. It is found that CN&#8209;BSA and CO&#8209;BSA preferentially adopt parallel&#8208;aligned binding orientations within the perovskite, enabling strong coordination to two neighboring undercoordinated Pb2+ defect sites. Meanwhile, CO&#8209;BSA exhibits a more favorable electronic configuration than CN&#8209;BSA, which endows the functional groups with a higher electron density that enables stronger dual&#8208;site binding with uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Moreover, incorporating CO&#8208;BSA promotes the formation of perovskite films with large grain sizes, high quality, and low defect densities. Consequently, the device modified with CO&#8208;BSA achieves an efficiency of 26.53% (certified 26.31%). The encapsulated CO&#8208;BSA&#8208;based cell retains 96.1% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of steady&#8208;state power output (SPO) measurement in air.

         <title>Ligand Field Electronic State Regulation of Monoclinic Prussian White Toward Highly Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel substitution reconfigures the ligand&#8208;field electronic state of monoclinic Prussian White, holding Mn in a low&#8208;spin configuration, mitigating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and Mn dissolution. The optimized NLS2&#8208;PW cathode delivers 95 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C and 80% capacity retention after 600 cycles, advancing stable, high&#8208;rate sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In situ characterization and first&#8208;principles calculations verify reduced lattice strain and faster Na&#8314; diffusion.








Abstract
Manganese hexacyanoferrate (MnHCF) has a high output voltage and is expected to be a promising cathode material for high energy density sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the capacity decay problem caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect of high&#8208;spin Mn3+ restricts its use in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In this study, an elemental modulation strategy is proposed to regulate the electronic state of the ligand field by introducing the nickel element, which can keep the Mn in a low&#8208;spin configuration during cycling to inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller aberration of MnHCF. The nickel&#8208;doped MnHCF (NLS2&#8208;PW) with low&#8208;spin electronic state inhibits the disproportionation and dissolution process of Mn3+ and thus exhibits excellent cycling stability, and its capacity retention is close to 80% after 600 cycles at 2 C with a reduction of the Mn dissolution by &#8776;70%. Combined with theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the distortion of the MnN6 octahedron in NLS2&#8208;PW is reduced significantly, and the tetragonal phase transition caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect during the electrochemical process is also effectively suppressed. This work demonstrates an efficient modulation strategy to enhance the performance of the Prussian blue analog cathode of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, being favorable for the design and optimization of relevant PB analogues for SIB applications.

&lt;p&gt;Nickel substitution reconfigures the ligand-field electronic state of monoclinic Prussian White, holding Mn in a low-spin configuration, mitigating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and Mn dissolution. The optimized NLS2-PW cathode delivers 95 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 C and 80% capacity retention after 600 cycles, advancing stable, high-rate sodium-ion batteries. In situ characterization and first-principles calculations verify reduced lattice strain and faster Na&#8314; diffusion.

         <title>A High&#8208;Capacity Semiconductor Organic Polymer for Stable Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual challenges of solubility and low conductivity in aqueous ammonium ions storage using the tetraamino&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone material are addressed through an amidation reaction and the conjugation effect. The delocalization of electrons facilitates rapid charge transport and collection. The patterns of band structure changes, the energy storage mechanisms of hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, and the active sites are elucidated for the first time.








Abstract
In aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion storage (AAIS), effective hydrogen&#8208;binding sites are crucial for designing high&#8208;performance ammonium ions (NH4+) host materials. The organic small molecule tetraamino&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) shows great potential in AAIS due to its unique hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with NH4+. However, such small&#8208;molecule materials typically exhibit severe dissolution in aqueous electrolytes. Moreover, their low conductivity severely hampers their ability to store ammonium ions. To address these challenges concurrently, a chain amide polymer (PPAT) is designed by introducing a 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride to extend the skeleton of TABQ. This polymer exhibits an ultralow solubility of 0.00058&#160;mg mL&#8722;1 and introduces substantial functional groups for hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The conjugated effect is further extended by combining it with polyaniline (PANI). The spectral and computational results indicate that the designed material possesses an elevated HOMO energy level, a reduced LUMO energy level, and a smaller bandgap. The delocalization of electrons throughout the entire molecule leads to a semiconducting nature. The organic polymer electrode delivers a high capacity of 291.81 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ storage organic materials. The energy storage mechanism of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the organic polymer and NH4+ is investigated, and the active sites that contribute to high capacity are identified.

         <title>Amorphization&#8208;Induced d&#8208;Orbital Rearrangement in Ultrathin CoO Nanosheets with Strong d&#8208;p Interactions for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin amorphous CoO nanosheets are synthesized via a low&#8208;temperature annealing strategy. Amorphization induces modulated energy levels and an increased population of unpaired electrons in the frontier d&#8208;orbitals of Co atoms. These features enhance the 3dyz&#8211;2px interactions between the Co center and the C atom in the CO2 molecule, thereby facilitating its adsorption and activation compared to crystalline CoO.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion into syngas presents a sustainable avenue for mitigating carbon emissions while generating value&#8208;added fuels. However, sluggish charge carrier dynamics and weak, non&#8208;specific interactions between catalytic sites and CO2 molecules limit efficiency. Herein, ultrathin amorphous CoO nanosheets (a&#8208;CoO) are reported that integrate structural and electronic advantages for enhanced CO&#8322; photoreduction. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory analyses reveal that amorphization partially transforms the local crystal field of Co from quasi&#8208;octahedral to quasi&#8208;tetrahedral coordination, resulting in a greater population of unpaired electrons in the frontier d&#8208;orbitals. This reconfiguration promotes electron injection from Co 3dyz into the 2&#960;* antibonding orbitals component of C 2px in CO2, which strengthens 3d&#8208;2p orbital hybridization and lowers the activation energy barrier. In situ spectroscopic further confirms that this orbital restructuring accelerates charge transfer from the Co center to CO2 and facilitates its activation. Meanwhile, the ultrathin 2D architecture improves the separation and transport of photoexcited carriers. Consequently, vigorous bubbles are observed under visible light irradiation, with a total syngas evolution rate of 23.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (12.6 and 11.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for CO and H2, respectively) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 1.28% at 450&#160;nm&#8212;&#8776;8.7&#8208;fold improvement over its crystalline counterpart.

Abstract
All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries are highly needed, but remains a huge challenge in cycling life due to the existence of unstable electrode electrolyte interphases, especially with nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage. To address this question, a functional and robust sandwich&#8208;model cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is proposed, derived from a LiBF4&#8208;based electrolyte modified with para&#8208;fluorobenzeneacetonitrile (P&#8208;FBCN) additive, to realize the stability of 4.8&#160;V Li||LiNi0.94Co0.05Mn0.01O2 (NCM94) battery operated from &#8722;60 to 60 &#176;C. The LiF&#8208;rich sandwich&#8208;model CEI features an outer layer of LiBxOy&#8208;rich to enhance mechanical/thermal stability, and the inner &#8722;C&#8801;N&#8208;rich anchoring layer to facilitate Li&#8314; conduction and inhibit the dissolution of transition metal ions. Notably, the 7.6 Ah&#8208;grade Li||NCM94 pouch cell with such electrolyte can yield a high energy density of 544&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with a long lifespan of 158 cycles.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Chiroptical Hybrid Perovskites with Anomalous Photovoltaic Effect for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Driven Photodetectors</title>

         <dc:description>
The 2D chiral hybrid (R/S)&#8208;3BrMBA2PbBr4 perovskites demonstrate distinctive magneto&#8208;chiroptical effects. The circular dichroism is significantly enhanced and reversed under the magnetic field. The hybrids exhibit excellent nonlinear optical properties and high&#8208;performance in self&#8208;driven photodetector. This work provides valuable insights into the design of chiral hybrids and their applications in self&#8208;driven detectors.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites show promising applications in photodetectors due to their high absorption coefficients and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, most hybrid perovskites exhibit centrosymmetric structures, requiring external electric fields for photodetection. Herein, 2D chiral hybrid perovskite (R/S)&#8208;3BrMBA2PbBr4 is synthesized, which exhibits broadband circularly polarized luminescence with a luminescence asymmetry factor of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2. Furthermore, the circular dichroism (CD) of (R/S)&#8208;3BrMBA2PbBr4 undergoes significant enhancement and inversion under a magnetic field due to the Zeeman effect, achieving an 8&#8208;fold increase in the CD asymmetry factor and Zeeman splitting energy of 0.3 meV. The non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure endows (R/S)&#8208;3BrMBA2PbBr4 single crystals with net polarization along the b&#8208;axis, along with efficient second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) CD and a high asymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD = 0.87). The self&#8208;driven photodetector fabricated from (R)&#8208;3BrMBA&#8322;PbBr&#8324; demonstrates an anomalous photovoltaic effect under ultraviolet light illumination, generating a photovoltage of 4.8&#160;V that far exceeds its bandgap (Eg = 2.96&#160;eV), while simultaneously demonstrating robust X&#8208;ray detection and circularly polarized light discrimination at zero external bias. The work provides significant insights into the application of chiral hybrid perovskites in low&#8208;energy, multifunctional optoelectronic systems and paves the way for the development of advanced photodetection technologies.

         <title>Nanocrystal&#8208;Nucleus Template Strategy for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells with Enhanced Homogeneity and Energy&#8208;Level Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocrystal&#8208;nucleus template strategy addresses nanoscale phase separation and energy&#8208;level mismatch in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. By tailoring nanocrystals to match the target perovskite's composition and structure, this approach enables uniform halide distribution, enhanced crystallization, and improved electron extraction. The strategy achieves 23.4%&#8208;efficient PSCs (1.68 eV) with a record VOC of 1.30 V and certified 31.7%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are critical for advancing tandem solar cell efficiencies, yet suffer from severe photovoltage deficits and halide segregation, substantially degrading their performance and stability. Here, a nanocrystal&#8208;nucleus template (NCNT) strategy is developed to directly addresses heterogeneous nucleation&#8212;the root cause of phase separation&#8212;by precisely matching the I/Br ratio of nanocrystal to that of the target perovskite film. This approach guides homogeneous assembly of Pb&#8208;I/Br octahedra, achieving exceptional halide uniformity and precise crystallization control for WBG films. The NCNT simultaneously induces p&#8208;type doping and reduces the perovskite/C60 interfacial energy barrier, significantly enhancing charge extraction. Remarkably, 1.68&#8208;eV WBG PSCs fabricated via this approach achieve a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.30&#160;V, alongside a champion efficiency of 23.4%. The broad applicability of this strategy is demonstrated across a wide bandgap range of 1.63&#8211;1.76&#160;eV, all exhibiting (001)&#8208;preferred orientation and exceptional photostability. When integrated into a 0.945 cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell, the NCNT&#8208;based device delivers a high efficiency of 32.0% (certified 31.7%). This work highlights the pivotal role of nanocrystals in regulating perovskite crystallization, resolves long&#8208;standing VOC limitations in WBG perovskites, and establishes a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices and tandem photovoltaics.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging MXene/TiN&#8208;Confined In2Se3 Anode with Dual Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Synergy for High&#8208;Capacity Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

MXene/TiN&#8208;Stabilized In2Se3 Heterostructure Anode enables ultrafast NH4+ storage via dual hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks (Se&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8211;N/Ti&#8211;N&#183;&#183;&#183;H) and charge&#8208;redistributed interfaces. The anode delivers&#160;unprecedented performance in practical pouch&#8208;cells, establishing new benchmarks for stable aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion pseudocapacitors.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) based hybrid pseudocapacitors (NH&#8208;HPCs) integrate sustainability and cost&#8208;effectiveness, yet their cycling stability is critically challenged by sluggish NH4+ transport, particularly in MXene&#8208;based anodes. Herein, NH3&#8208;induced N&#8208;functionalization fabricates a MXene/TiN conductive substrate, enabling confined rotary hydrothermal growth of indium selenide (In2Se3) nanoparticles into an In2Se3@MXene/TiN heterostructure. Directional Ti&#9472;N bonds suppress MXene stacking and In2Se3 agglomeration while synergizing charge&#8208;redistribution&#8208;induced lattice strain with hierarchical 2&#8211;5&#160;nm pore channels, enabling ultrafast NH4+ migration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm electron&#8208;deficient Ti sites and dual Se&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#9472;N/Ti&#9472;N&#183;&#183;&#183;H hydrogen bonds enhance NH4+ adsorption, where intensified charge polarization and optimized orbital hybridization boost ion storage kinetics and structural stability. The heterostructure anode delivers 1776.1 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 with 98.84% capacitance retention over 6000 cycles. In full&#8208;cell configuration (In2Se3@MXene/TiN//AC), the NH&#8208;HPC achieves 85.45&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 800&#160;W kg&#8722;1&#8212;powering a commercial mini&#8208;fan for &gt;4 min after 30 s charging. A modular pouch&#8208;cell version reaches 98.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (800&#160;W kg&#8722;1), demonstrating exceptional stability during bending/flame tests while operating light emitting diodes array (LEDs). This work highlights interfacial charge synergy in confined heterostructures for unprecedented NH4+ storage capacity and stability, advancing high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion energy storage.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Concentrated Gradient&#8208;Solvation Electrolyte Enables a High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Battery with 447.6&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1</title>

A novel non&#8208;concentrated gradient&#8208;solvation electrolyte, featuring a DEE&#8208;rich Li+&#8208;solvated core and a FEC&#8208;rich Li+&#8208;solvated shell, is designed for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. The hierarchical solvent coordination environments offer high redox stability and fast charge transfer kinetics, thereby greatly stabilizing the high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode phase structure and lithium metal interface during long cycles.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) emerge as a pivotal strategy for achieving high energy density applications. However, the electrolyte instability leading to inferior rate performance and short lifespan remains to be addressed. In this study, a new non&#8208;concentrated gradient&#8208;solvation electrolyte by solvent polarity discrepancy is developed. A highly donor&#8208;capable ether forms the Li&#8314;&#8208;solvated core through strong ion&#8208;dipole interactions, while a weakly donating carbonate creates the shell structure. Such a gradient&#8208;solvation structure enables the electrolyte with a high oxidation voltage (4.6&#160;V vs.&#160;Li/Li+) and rapid Li+&#8208;desolvated kinetic. Consequently, the electrolyte facilitates the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li cells to attain a specific capacity of 165.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5C, alongside 1000 stable cycles at 1C charge/3C discharge with 66% capacity retention. Even under lean conditions (N/P = 1.5, electrolyte: 20&#160;&#181;L), NCM811||Li cell still maintains 97.5% capacity retention over 100 cycles. Furthermore, a 3.2&#160;Ah pouch cell achieves a specific energy density of 447.6&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;&#185; with stable cycling. These findings highlight the promise of gradient&#8208;solvation electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage LMBs applications.

&lt;p&gt;A novel non-concentrated gradient-solvation electrolyte, featuring a DEE-rich Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvated core and a FEC-rich Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvated shell, is designed for high-voltage lithium metal batteries. The hierarchical solvent coordination environments offer high redox stability and fast charge transfer kinetics, thereby greatly stabilizing the high-voltage NCM811 cathode phase structure and lithium metal interface during long cycles.

&lt;p&gt;High-voltage lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) emerge as a pivotal strategy for achieving high energy density applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Ru Anchored Mesoporous TiO2 Phase&#8208;Junction Promotes Photocatalytic Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;atom Ru&#8208;anchored mesoporous TiO2 nanoreactors with tunable anatase&#8208;rutile phases are prepared via a micelle&#8208;interface confined co&#8208;assembly strategy, achieving an efficient DFF conversion with a yield of 87.6% and high selectivity of 90.8%. The introduction of Ru single&#8208;atom on the TiO2 phase interface further facilitates the cascade conversation of DFF to FFCA with a high yield of 74.6% and a selectivity of 75.8%.








Abstract
Constructing advanced semiconductor nanoreactors is an effective route to boost the efficient photocatalytic conversion of biomasses to high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Herein, single&#8208;atom anchored flower&#8208;like mesoporous TiO2 nanoreactors with tunable anatase&#8208;rutile crystalline phases are prepared via a micelle&#8208;interface confined co&#8208;assembly strategy (Ru0.5/A&amp;R&#8208;TNs). This approach not only facilitates the introduction of various monatomic/diatomic (e.g., Ru, Mo, Pd, Pt, etc.) sites but also spontaneously induces the TiO2 phase transformation from anatase to rutile, achieving precise control of two&#8208;phase ratios. The interface of the two phases with abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov) facilitates the adsorption and activation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which exhibits a high photocatalytic HMF oxidation to DFF (selectivity of 90.8%). Based on the optimal phase compositions, the doping of Ru single&#8208;atom further exhibits a high atom utilization and suitable electronic structure. Therefore, the Ru0.5/A&amp;R&#8208;TNs achieve the cascade conversion from HMF to 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furoic acid with a selectivity of 75.8%. This research provides innovative ways for single&#8208;atom catalyst synthesis, and the mechanism of synergistic catalytic action may provide new guidance for the photocatalytic conversion of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products from HMF.

         <title>Ultrathin Polymer Electrolyte With Fast Ion Transport and Stable Interface for Practical Solid&#8208;state Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance ultrathin (&#8776;7.8 &#181;m) polycarbonate&#8208;based electrolyte (UPCE) is fabricated, without the use of additional liquid additives. The designed UPCE delivers a high ionic conductivity (4.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and an ultrahigh critical current density (11.5 mA cm&#8722;2) at 25&#160;&#176;C. The 4.5 V solid&#8208;state Li|LiCoO2 cell demonstrates an ultralong lifespan cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 1&#160;C.








Abstract
Ultrathin solid&#8208;polymer&#8208;electrolytes (SPEs) are the most promising alternative substituting for the conventional liquid electrolyte to enable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, safe lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;batteries (LMBs). Nevertheless, developing ultrathin SPEs with both high ionic conductivity, and strong Li dendrite retardant is still a significant challenge. Here a scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance ultrathin (&#8776;7.8&#160;&#181;m) polycarbonate&#8208;based electrolyte (UPCE) is proposed via electrolyte structural engineering, phase separation&#8208;derived poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVH) porous scaffold, without use of additional liquid additives. The rational electrolyte structural modulation with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;(1&#8208;methylethenyl)benzene (FMB) enables a weakened Li+&#8208;polymer interaction due to weak Li+ solvation with fluorine, benzene ring, facilitates the formation of LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase on Li metal surface. As a result, the designed UPCE delivers a high ionic conductivity of 4.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, an ultrahigh critical current density of 11.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 25&#160;&#176;C. The solid&#8208;state Li symmetric cell attains unprecedented ultralong cycling over 6000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Li|LiCoO2 cell cycles stably over 1500 cycles at a high operating voltage of 4.5&#160;V, and the pouch cell can achieve a high energy density of 495&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 excluding the packaging. This work offers a new pathway inspiring efforts to commercialize ultrathin SPEs for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>In Situ Reconstructed Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO Inverse Opals Accelerate Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction Kinetics for High Power Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO inverse opal catalyst is presented with abundant active sites and optimized electronic structure for the nitrate reduction reaction and high&#8208;power Zn&#8208;NO3&#8211; battery, resulting in the significantly enhanced catalytic reaction kinetics.








Abstract
The electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 (NO3RR) using renewable energy presents a promising strategy to mitigate environmental pollution and produce high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the practical application of NO3RR is hindered by limited active sites and sluggish reaction kinetics, stemming from the complex eight&#8208;electron process. Herein, a novel Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO&#8208;2.5 inverse opals (CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5) catalyst featuring a 3D porous network is designed, which provides abundant active sites and an optimized electronic structure to accelerate the NO3RR kinetics for efficient NH3 production. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of ZnO facilitates electron transfer to Cu active sites, increasing charge density and lowering the reaction energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO to *NOH). As a result, CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5 exhibits a notable enhancement in NH3 yield (from 0.255 to 0.313&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and Faradaic efficiency (from 85.7% to 95.5%) compared to the Cu/Cu2+1O catalyst. Thanks to its excellent NO3RR activity, the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery with the CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5 cathode achieves a max power density of 11.93&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This study adopts a multi&#8208;dimensional strategy encompassing morphology regulation, electronic structure optimization, and surface/interface engineering, offering new insights into efficient electrocatalyst development and realizing integrated NH3 synthesis and energy output in a Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; battery with the CCZ-IOs-2.5 cathode achieves a max power density of 11.93&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This study adopts a multi-dimensional strategy encompassing morphology regulation, electronic structure optimization, and surface/interface engineering, offering new insights into efficient electrocatalyst development and realizing integrated NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis and energy output in a Zn-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Enabling Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells via Sustainable Operando Defect&#8208;Passivation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 38, September 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic spiro&#8208;oxazine enables sustainable operando passivation via dual&#8208;mode isomerization, achieving 24.72% efficiency in small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and 19.07% in 61.6&#160;cm2 modules with exceptional light/UV stability.








Abstract
The amount of passivator is usually optimized for freshly prepared devices, which is static and short&#8208;term. However, photoinduced defects and the movement of halogen ions are dynamically generated in real time. Long&#8208;term operational passivation, designed to address the dynamic characteristics of defect generation, is largely overlooked but is critically important. In this work, a classical photochromic compound, Spiro&#8208;oxazine (SO), is introduced to develop a sustainable operando passivation strategy. The two configurations of this isomer fulfill different requirements: the normal form addresses the needs of freshly prepared devices with fewer defect passivation requirements, while the post&#8208;isomeric form in situ operando captures light&#8208;induced defects during operation, enabling sustainable passivation. As a result, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) fabricated using this operando strategy achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.72%, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.215&#160;V, and demonstrated remarkable stability, retaining 82% of its initial PCE after 1580 h under simulated sunlight and 80% after 144 h under UV light. Large&#8208;area PSC modules fabricated using the proposed strategy achieved a PCE of 19.07% over an active area of 61.6 cm2. This work provides valuable guidance for designing self&#8208;healing perovskite films and highlights the urgent need for improved passivation durability.

Textile Encoding via Embroidered Tessellations
In article number 2500959, Leonid Zinatullin, Indrek Must, and co&#8208;authors present encoded textiles that mimic skin tension lines. Widely available machine embroidery is used to define transitional strain by locally packing extra length of thread in a tile pattern. Their technology demonstrator, feet&#8208;confirmable shoes, demonstrates encoding at a resolution sufficient for mimicking skin biomechanics and suggests new wearable robotic applications.

Adaptive Epitaxy of C&#8208;Si&#8208;Ge&#8208;Sn
In article number 2506919, Omar Concepci&#243;n, Giovanni Capellini, Detlev Gr&#252;tzmacher, Dan Buca, and co&#8208;workers highlight the successful epitaxial growth of novel CSiGeSn and CGeSn/SiGeSn quantum well structures, composed entirely of group&#8208;IV elements. These C&#8208; and Sn&#8208;containing ternary and quaternary semiconductors exhibit excellent crystalline quality with precise control over composition and strain. This work expands the portfolio of direct&#8208;bandgap group&#8208;IV materials that can be monolithically integrated on silicon, marking a significant step toward next&#8208;generation CMOS&#8208;compatible optoelectronic devices.

Domain Wall Motion
During polarization switching in AlScN, domain&#8208;wall transverse motion precedes longitudinal motion due to a 98% reduction in energy barriers. By regulating the mixed polarity penetrating the entire film to promote transverse motion, this work enables low&#8208;field&#8208;driven domain wall motion, reducing Ec by 25% and suppressing wake&#8208;up behavior across 6&#8208;inch wafers to advance energy&#8208;efficient wurtzite ferroelectric devices for CMOS integration.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Domain Wall Motion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During polarization switching in AlScN, domain-wall transverse motion precedes longitudinal motion due to a 98% reduction in energy barriers. By regulating the mixed polarity penetrating the entire film to promote transverse motion, this work enables low-field-driven domain wall motion, reducing Ec by 25% and suppressing wake-up behavior across 6-inch wafers to advance energy-efficient wurtzite ferroelectric devices for CMOS integration.

On&#8208;the&#8208;Fly Synthesis of Freestanding Spin&#8208;Crossover Architectures
Like a firefighter's hose guiding water, 3D flow focusing microfluidic devices can guide the assembly and growth of spin crossover (SCOs). In article number 2420492, Tiago Sotto Mayor, Mario Palacios&#8208;Corella, Josep Puigmart&#237;&#8208;Luis, and co&#8208;workers revolutionize SCO material fabrication using 3D flow&#8208;focusing microfluidics, enabling seamless synthesis and precise integration into alginate fibers. The approach presented enhances scalability, control, and functionality, even allowing printed, freestanding SCO&#8208;encoded fibers for customizable applications in sensors, memory, and actuators.

Heterogeneous Liquid&#8208;Crystal Superstructures
In article number 2506778, Peng Chen, Wei Hu, Yan&#8208;Qing Lu, and co&#8208;workers report a heterogeneous liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) superstructure with integrated nematic and chiral LCs. Through a new strategy called multidimensional photopatterning, this superstructure can simultaneously achieve near&#8208;field full&#8208;color printing and far&#8208;field full&#8208;color holography. This study facilitates the exquisite construction of LC superstructures and enlightens higher&#8208;dimensional soft matter photonics.

         <title>The Rise of Mechanobiology for Advanced Cell Engineering and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the growing demand for cell&#8208;based therapies, efficient cellular engineering is crucial. This review calls for greater recognition of mechanobiology principles applied through advanced biomaterial designs, mechanical confinement, and highlights recent advances using micro/nanotechnologies to enhance cell manufacturing. Challenges and opportunities are also discussed to encourage further innovation in advanced cell engineering.








Abstract
The rise of cell&#8208;based therapies, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology, has created an urgent need for efficient cell engineering, which involves the manipulation of cells for specific purposes. This demand is driven by breakthroughs in cell manufacturing, from fundamental research to clinical therapies. These innovations have come with a deeper understanding of developmental biology, continued optimization of mechanobiological processes and platforms, and the deployment of advanced biotechnological approaches. Induced pluripotent stem cells and immunotherapies like chimeric antigen receptor T cells enable personalized, scalable treatments for regenerative medicine and diseases beyond oncology. But continued development of cell manufacturing and its concomitant clinical advances is hindered by limitations in the production, efficiency, safety, regulation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability of current manufacturing routes. Here, recent developments are examined in cell engineering, with particular emphasis on mechanical aspects, including biomaterial design, the use of mechanical confinement, and the application of micro&#8208; and nanotechnologies in the efficient production of enhanced cells. Emerging approaches are described along each of these avenues based on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fundamental mechanobiology. It is called on the field to consider mechanical cues, often overlooked in cell manufacturing, as key tools to augment or, at times, even to replace the use of traditional soluble factors.

         <title>Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Engineering for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines recent advancements in low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) and analyzes current challenges, limitations, and failure mechanisms across various rechargeable battery systems using LCEs, including lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;metal, lithium&#8208;sulfur, sodium&#8208;ion, sodium&#8208;metal, zinc, potassium, calcium, and magnesium batteries. Modification strategies, theoretical simulations, and cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques for LCEs are discussed, and future directions for high&#8208;performance LCEs are proposed to address ongoing challenges.








Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) present significant potential for actual applications because of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, low viscosity, reduced side reactions, and wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical stability. However, current electrolyte research predominantly focuses on regulation strategies for conventional 1 m electrolytes, high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, and localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, leaving design principles, optimization methods, and prospects of LCEs inadequately summarized. LCEs face unique challenges that cannot be addressed by the existing theories and approaches applicable to the three common electrolytes mentioned above; thus, tailored strategies to provide development guidance are urgently needed. Herein, a systematic overview of recent progress in LCEs is provided and subsequent development directions are suggested. This review proposes the core challenge of the high solvent ratio in LCEs, which triggers unstable organic&#8208;enriched electrolyte/electrode interface formation and anion depletion near the anode. On the basis of these issues, modification strategies for LCEs, including passivation interface construction and solvent&#8210;anion interaction optimization, are used in various rechargeable battery systems. Finally, the role of advanced simulations and cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques in revealing LCE failure mechanisms is further highlighted, offering new perspectives for their future development and practical application in next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Anion Regulation for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the significance of the anion regulation strategy in enhancing lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance. The strategy focuses on controlling solvation chemistry to fundamentally influence the reaction kinetics, reaction reversibility, and interfacial stability of both sulfur cathodes and lithium metal anodes. The summary of the research advances can guide future investigations in metal&#8211;sulfur battery electrochemistry.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, characterized by their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are the primary candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Yet, critical challenges persist, largely owing to the polysulfide (PS) anion shuttle and the instability of the lithium metal anode (LMA). Salt anions are indispensable in batteries, which influence the basic properties of bulk electrolytes (e.g., solubility, stability, and ion conductivity) and the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases. Apart from those, the intrinsic characteristics of anions are of particular importance in Li&#8211;S batteries, as PS anions are major active intermediates that directly determine the sulfur redox kinetics and reversibility. However, the anion regulation needs further investigated, especially according to the Li&#8211;S chemistry. In this regard, fundamental considerations are provided on the anion engineering of Li&#8211;S batteries. Through a comprehensive analysis, the electrochemical behaviors of anions are reviewed. Then, the recent works on anion regulation for cathodes and anodes are summarized. For sulfur cathodes, the PSs dissolution, adsorption, conversion kinetics, and pathway are discussed in detail. For LMA, the influence of anion on lithium diffusion kinetic, the formation of SEI, and the anticorrosion are summarized. Finally, insights into the future development of anion studies are provided, aiming to identify more adequate anions for Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Cuproptosis to Cuproptosis&#8208;Like: Therapeutic Strategies for Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reflects on the similarities and differences between cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;like death. Therapeutic strategies using cuproptosis&#8208;like death are highlighted, including multi&#8208;modal combination approaches integrating nanozyme&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, phototherapy, gas therapy and immunomodulation against bacterial infectious diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanism of cuproptosis&#8208;like death and developing therapeutic strategies based on this process could contribute to progress in antibacterial treatment.








Abstract
Bacterial infections have become a serious public health concern worldwide, and the irrational use of antibiotics has led to the proliferation of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, undermining the effectiveness of traditional antibacterial therapies. Cuproptosis is a copper&#8208;dependent cell death pathway that has recently been identified as a promising target for drug development and treating bacterial infections. Although bacteria differ from eukaryotes, as they lack mitochondria in their cells, they can still be affected by copper&#8208;mediated lethality by binding to lipoylated proteins and leading to abnormal protein aggregation and loss of iron&#8210;sulfur cluster proteins. This review reflects on the similarities and differences between cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;like death. In addition, we highlight therapeutic strategies using cuproptosis&#8208;like death, including multi&#8208;modal combination approaches integrating nanozyme&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, phototherapy, gas therapy and immunomodulation against bacterial infectious diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanism of cuproptosis&#8208;like death and developing therapeutic strategies based on this process could contribute to progress in antibacterial treatment.

         <title>Adaptive Epitaxy of C&#8208;Si&#8208;Ge&#8208;Sn: Customizable Bulk and Quantum Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pushes the boundaries of epitaxy by achieving all&#8208;group&#8208;IV semiconductor heterostructures and extensive characterization. The alloys open new research topics in material properties investigation for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic device technologies.








Abstract
The successful demonstration of (Si)Ge1&#8208;xSnx alloys as direct&#8208;gap materials for infrared lasers has driven intense research on group IV&#8208;based devices for nanoelectronics, energy harvesting, and quantum computing applications. The material palette of direct&#8208;gap group&#8208;IV alloys can be further extended by introducing carbon to fine&#8208;tune their structural and electronic properties, significantly expanding their functionality. This work presents heteroepitaxial growth of C(Si)GeSn alloys using an industry&#8208;standard reduced&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor. The introduction of CBr4 as a precursor enables controlled incorporation of C atoms (&lt;1 at.%) into the epilayer lattice, while simultaneously increasing the Sn content in the CGeSn alloy up to &#8776;18 at.%. Carbon plays a key role in modulating strain, stabilizing the crystal structure, and influencing material properties. By leveraging alloying and strain engineering, quaternary CSiGeSn bulk layers and CGeSn/GeSn heterostructures are epitaxially grown. The impact of C incorporation on optical emission is investigated in LEDs based on CGeSn/GeSn multiple quantum wells, demonstrating enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission at 2.54 &#181;m, which is sustained up to room temperature.

         <title>On&#8208;the&#8208;Fly Synthesis of Freestanding Spin&#8208;Crossover Architectures With Tunable Magnetic Properties</title>

3D flow&#8208;focusing devices are an ideal platform for the processing and integration of functional materials within polymeric matrices. In this article, A. Tuan Ngo, D. Aguil&#224;, T. Sotto Mayor, M. Palacios&#8208;Corella, J. Puigmart&#237;&#8208;Luis show the on&#8208;the&#8208;fly processing of a prototypical SCO material&#8212;known for its challenging processability&#8212;thereby opening new avenues for its implementation in real&#8208;world applications.









Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) molecular&#8208;based switches have shown promise across a range of applications since their discovery, including sensing, information storage, actuators, and displays. Yet limited processability remains a barrier to their real&#8208;world implementation, as traditional methods for integrating SCO materials into polymer matrices are often complex, expensive, and prone to producing uneven material distributions. Herein, we demonstrate how 3D flow&#8208;focusing chemistry enables unprecedented control for the direct fabrication of SCO composite materials, addressing key challenges in processability, scalability, and cost. By using a 3D coaxial flow&#8208;focusing microfluidic device, we simultaneously synthesize [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) and achieve its homogeneous incorporation into alginate fibers in a continuous manner. The device&#8217;s versatility allows for precise manipulation of the reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) zone, resulting in SCO composite fibers with tunable physicochemical and magnetic properties. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to isolate these fibers as freestanding architectures and highlight the potential for printing them with defined shapes. Finally, we show that the 3D control of the RD zone granted by continuous flow microfluidic devices offers precise spatiotemporal control over the distribution of SCO complexes within the fibers, effectively encoding SCO materials into them. SCO&#8208;encoded fibers can seamlessly combine adaptability and functionality, offering innovative solutions for application&#8208;specific customization.

         <title>Textile Encoding Inspired by Langer Lines via Elastically Graded Embroidered Tessellations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A standard embroidery machine can encode skin&#8208;like directional mechanics into stretchable fabrics that, when worn, augment the wearer's skin. Zigzag stitch patterns, inspired by skin collagen structure, pack extra slack in threads that, when tessellated, mimic Langer lines. Pneumatic fingers with multiple bending modes and feet&#8208;conforming footwear, designed using intuitive color coding, illustrate uses in robotics.








Abstract
Morphological anisotropies and nonlinear mechanical properties shape the kinematic agility of organisms and engineered structures.

&lt;p&gt;A standard embroidery machine can encode skin-like directional mechanics into stretchable fabrics that, when worn, augment the wearer's skin. Zigzag stitch patterns, inspired by skin collagen structure, pack extra slack in threads that, when tessellated, mimic Langer lines. Pneumatic fingers with multiple bending modes and feet-conforming footwear, designed using intuitive color coding, illustrate uses in robotics.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphological anisotropies and nonlinear mechanical properties shape the kinematic agility of organisms and engineered structures. Tissues, such as skin, act as biological metamaterials whose internal structures, such as packed collagen fibers, produce nonlinear and directional responses. Similarly, hierarchical thread packing governs the mechanical response of textiles. However, the capability of encoding textiles at the fabric level and at a sufficient resolution remains limited. Embroidering triangularly tiled zigzag patterns of inextensible thread on a stretchable fabric is demonstrated to encode distributed, directional stress&#8211;strain behavior at subcentimeter resolution, sufficient to mimic complex physiological characteristics such as Langer lines of the skin. The triangular unit cells solved the K&#246;nigsberg bridge problem of filling a plane with a continuous thread pair. The encoding maps directionality, directional contrast, and magnitude, three parameters that define unit cells' compliance, into hue-saturation-value color space for rapid qualitative design. Cross-talk-free arrays of embroidered restrictors enable scalable augmentation of textile mechanics. The transition threshold from the matrix- to fiber-defined behavior is achieved with 85% fidelity, enabling customizable shape-morphing structures such as restrictor bladder actuators and feet-conforming shoes.

         <title>Bioxolography Using Diphenyliodonium Chloride and N&#8208;Vinylpyrrolidone Enables Rapid High&#8208;Resolution Volumetric 3D Printing of Spatially Encoded Living Matter</title>

         <dc:description>
Bioxolography, a novel volumetric 3D&#8208;bioprinting technique, enables rapid and high&#8208;resolution fabrication of &gt;1&#160;cm3 engineered living materials. A newly developed three&#8208;component photoinitiator system significantly enhances the photoreactivity of gelatin methacryloyl&#8208;based bioresins, allowing for precise xolographic bioprinting. This platform supports multimaterial printing, concentration&#8208;controlled molecular patterning, and grayscale&#8208;mediated mechanical modulation to create complex, biomimetic, and spatially controlled architectures.








Abstract
Light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting enables fabrication of cubic centimeter&#8208;sized living materials with micrometer resolution in minutes. Xolography is a light sheet&#8208;based volumetric printing technology that offers unprecedented volumetric generation rates and print resolutions for hard plastics. However, the limited solubility and reactivity of current dual&#8208;color photoinitiators (DCPIs) in aqueous media have hindered their application for high&#8208;resolution bioprinting of living matter. Here, we present a novel three&#8208;component formulation that drastically improves photoreactivity and thereby enables high&#8208;resolution, rapid, and cytocompatible Xolographic biofabrication of intricately architected yet mechanically robust living materials. To achieve this, various relevant additives are systematically explored, which revealed that diphenyliodonium chloride and N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone strongly enhance D&#8208;mediated photoreactivity, as confirmed by dual&#8208;color photo&#8208;rheology. This enables Xolographic bioprinting of gelatin methacryloyl&#8208;based bioresins, producing &gt;1&#160;cm3 constructs at &#8776;20&#160;&#181;m positive and 125&#160;&#181;m negative resolution within minutes. Multimaterial printing, molecular patterning, and grayscale&#8208;mediated mechanical patterning are explored to programmably create intricate, biomimetic, and concentration&#8208;controlled architectures. We demonstrate the Bioxolographic printing of various cell types, showing excellent cell viability, compatibility with long&#8208;term culture, and ability for nascent protein deposition. These results position Bioxolography as a transformative platform for rapid, scalable, high&#8208;resolution fabrication of functional living materials with encoded chemical and mechanical properties.

         <title>Liquid Metal&#8208;Vitrimer Conductive Composite for Recyclable and Resilient Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the growing electronic waste challenge, an electrically conductive, healable, and recyclable plastic composite is created, composed of vitrimer and liquid metal microdroplets. A reconfigurable circuit board is demonstrated using this composite material, providing a notable step toward sustainable and robust electronic technologies.








Abstract
Electronic devices are ubiquitous in modern society, yet their poor recycling rates contribute to substantial economic losses and worsening environmental impacts from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) disposal. Here, recyclable and healable electronics are reported through a vitrimer&#8208;liquid metal (LM) microdroplet composite. These electrically conductive, yet plastic&#8208;like composites display mechanical qualities of rigid thermosets and recyclability through a dynamic covalent polymer network. The composite exhibits a high glass transition temperature, good solvent resistance, high electrical conductivity, and recyclability. The vitrimer synthesis proceeds without the need for a catalyst or a high curing temperature, which enables facile fabrication of the composite materials. The as&#8208;synthesized vitrimer exhibits a fast relaxation time with reconfigurability and shape memory. The electrically conductive composite exhibits high electrical conductivity with LM volume loading as low as 5 vol.%. This enables the fabrication of fully vitrimer&#8208;based circuit boards consisting of sensors and indicator LEDs integrated with LM&#8208;vitrimer conductive wiring. Electrical self&#8208;healing and thermally triggered material healing are further demonstrated with the composites. The vitrimer and LM&#8208;composite provide a pathway toward fully recyclable, mechanically robust, and reconfigurable electronics, thus advancing the field of electronic&#160;materials.

         <dc:description>
A novel paradigm of flexible transistor featuring solid&#8211;liquid hybrid interfaces is presented, where liquid metal and ionic liquid, confined in microchannels, serve as the source/drain electrodes and gate dielectric, respectively. Benefiting from the liquids' inherent softness and damage&#8208;free processing, Fermi level pinning is significantly mitigated to a factor of &#8739;s&#8739;= 0.7, achieving a subthreshold swing of 60.7 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, near the theoretical limit.








Abstract
Contact engineering at the semiconductor&#8211;electrode and semiconductor&#8211;dielectric interfaces is critical to the performance of electronic devices, especially for delicate 2D semiconductors. Here, this study proposes a new paradigm of flexible field&#8208;effect transistors featuring solid&#8211;liquid hybrid interfaces, in which liquid metal and ionic liquid, confined within microchannels, function as the source/drain electrodes and gate dielectric, respectively. These interfaces provide MoS&#8322; with undisturbed, atomically smooth electrical contacts, and enable efficient gate control via electric double layers. Benefiting from the inherent softness of liquids and their damage&#8208;free processing, Fermi level pinning is significantly mitigated by the liquid metal, achieving a pinning factor |s|&#160; = &#160;0.7. Meanwhile, the ionic liquid enables a subthreshold swing of 60.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermal limit. Furthermore, our flexible transistors demonstrate multifunctionality as enhanced logic gates, low&#8208;voltage inverters, and ultra&#8208;high&#8208;linearity synaptic devices. This work underscores the promise of liquid&#8208;enabled contact strategies for advancing low&#8208;power, flexible electronics and soft robotic systems.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Topography Drives Adrenergic to Mesenchymal Transition in Neuroblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) topography in the tumor microenvironment induces neuroblastoma cells to acquire mesenchymal features closely associated with therapy resistance and metastatic potential, using biomimetic substrates that mimic ECM topography. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism is elucidated, identifying the ROCK&#8211;YAP&#8211;EZH2 signaling axis as a key driver of the phenotypic transition linked to poor clinical outcomes.








Abstract
Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, exhibits intra&#8208;tumoral heterogeneity with two interconvertible identities: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). Compared to ADRN cells, MES cells exhibit phenotypes associated with metastasis and therapy resistance. Thus, the transition from ADRN to MES may contribute to poor clinical outcomes, necessitating further investigation into this ADRN&#8208;to&#8208;MES transition (AMT) to improve clinical responses. The extracellular matrix (ECM), a critical component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), provides structural support and delivers mechanical signals that influence oncogenic processes. This research demonstrates that high&#8208;risk NB tumors contain more topographically aligned ECM fibers than low&#8208;risk NB tumors. Using nano&#8208;fabricated biomaterials designed to mimic the aligned ECM, ECM topography is revealed to drive AMT through transcriptional and epigenetic changes, accompanied by enhanced MES phenotypic features. Furthermore, ECM topography is shown to stimulate Rho&#8208;associated kinase and YAP signaling pathways, which mediate ECM&#8208;driven reprogramming. These findings introduce ECM&#8208;driven AMT as a novel mechanism in NB progression and provide insights into TME&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at suppressing MES cells to improve clinical outcomes in NB.

The extracellular matrix (ECM), a critical component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), provides structural support and delivers mechanical signals that influence oncogenic processes. This research demonstrates that high-risk NB tumors contain more topographically aligned ECM fibers than low-risk NB tumors. Using nano-fabricated biomaterials designed to mimic the aligned ECM, ECM topography is revealed to drive AMT through transcriptional and epigenetic changes, accompanied by enhanced MES phenotypic features. Furthermore, ECM topography is shown to stimulate Rho-associated kinase and YAP signaling pathways, which mediate ECM-driven reprogramming. These findings introduce ECM-driven AMT as a novel mechanism in NB progression and provide insights into TME-targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at suppressing MES cells to improve clinical outcomes in NB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Restoring Ultra&#8208;Flat Bridgman&#8208;Fabricated Single&#8208;Crystal Cu(111) Wafers via Recrystallization Arrest Strategy for High&#8208;Quality Graphene Epitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By investigating strain&#8208; and dislocation&#8208;induced recrystallization, a tailored staged annealing method with recrystallization arrest is developed to preserve single&#8208;crystallinity. Ultra&#8208;flat Bridgman&#8208;fabricated Cu(111) wafers are restored, enabling high&#8208;quality graphene heteroepitaxy on wafer&#8208;scale substrates.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) and its ultra&#8208;flat surface are crucial for the heteroepitaxy of high&#8208;quality, single&#8208;crystal graphene films with minimal folds and additional layers. Bridgman method coupled with cutting and chemical&#8208;mechanical polishing presents a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective approach for preparing ultra&#8208;flat Cu(111) wafers but is simply discarded due to its incompatibility with standard high&#8208;temperature procedures for annealing and graphene growth. Herein, an in&#8208;depth investigation is conducted into the mechanisms of recrystallization and reverse single&#8208;crystallization induced by processing strain and dislocations. A recrystallization arrest strategy is proposed for Bridgman&#8208;cutting&#8208;polishing (BCP) derived Cu(111) wafers, guaranteeing the high single&#8208;crystallinity (96.6%) and flatness (0.81 nm) of epitaxy substrates. The thorough investigation has provided a comprehensive understanding of the effects of surface roughness on the orientation, proportion of adlayers, as well as transfer qualities of graphene films. By highlighting the paramount importance of the Bridgman cutting&#8208;polishing methodology, the efforts set the stage for achieving notable cost savings in the manufacture of ultra&#8208;flat, single&#8208;crystal graphene wafers.

         <title>Superblack Carbon Hierarchitectures for Multispectral Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superblack carbon hierarchitectures are developed through synergistic cross&#8208;dimensional engineering that integrates physical structuring with chemical modification, enabling high&#8208;performance multispectral absorption across visible, infrared, and microwave regimes simultaneously. Carbon microparticles with a fractal dimension approaching 1.0, or those possessing a networked structure, inherently offer advantages in achieving broad and strong multispectral responses.








Abstract
Multispectral absorbing materials that can efficiently dissipate waves across the visible, infrared, and microwave regimes have long been pursued for advanced applications in fields such as space exploration, stealth, and camouflage. However, the wide range of incident wavelengths, spanning five orders of magnitude, presents a significant challenge for the practical implementation of multispectral absorbers. Herein, superblack carbon hierarchitectures (SCHs) are designed using a bottom&#8208;up approach involving the self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sacrifice of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), realizing synergistic morphological customization and dielectric gene editing (via carbon nitride like&#8208;moieties conjugated with C&#9552;C short chains). Through the cross&#8208;dimensional coupling action between light&#8208;trapping hierarchitecture and robust dielectric loss, superb visible light absorption (&gt;99.6%), high infrared absorption (98.5%/97.5%/99.6% for long&#8208;/mid&#8208;/short&#8208;wavelength infrared regimes), and ultrabroad microwave absorption (effective bandwidth of 8.52&#160;GHz, nearly covering both the X and Ku bands) can be simultaneously achieved in monolayer SCHs&#8208;based absorbers. Furthermore, the topologically transformed structures of SCHs enable a systematic dissection of the longstanding ambiguity surrounding the geometrical effect, revealing the synergistic influence of fractal dimension and interconnection status of microparticles, particularly in the microwave regime. This work introduces a new paradigm for multispectral absorption and advances the understanding of absorption mechanisms for developing next&#8208;generation absorbers.

         <title>Nucleation Modification in Two&#8208;Step Slot&#8208;Die Coating Toward Efficient Large Scale Perovskite/Silicon Tandems Based on Commercial Silicon Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, sodium 2,5&#8208;difluorobenzoate (2,5&#8208;NaDPA) is utilized to reduce nucleation energy barrier difference at various convex angles on PbI2 layer, delaying the growth of perovskite crystals, and effectively promoting the grain size of perovskites. Eventually, the voids of large area PVK films are greatly restrained. A high efficiency of 28.28% is obtained from a fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem device prepared in ambient condition with an effective area of 19.9 cm2.








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;solution two&#8208;step deposition is recognized as a promising method to fabricate monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) on commercial silicon cell substrates with fully textured surfaces. Although a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 31.3% is recorded for small size perovskite/silicon TSCs, scaling up from spin&#8208;coating used for small sizes to the slot&#8208;die for large areas has become the main challenge for its further mass production due to the residual PbI2 and increased internal voids in perovskite (PVK) films.

         <title>Polymers Microspheres as Colorful Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence Delivery for Printable Optical Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophilic polymer microsphere is introduced as a versatile carrier for achieving color&#8208; and lifetime&#8208;tunable ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) through the dynamic rearrangement of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the polymer matrix and the phosphor. These tunable UOP polymer microspheres exhibit significant potential for applications in printable optical multiplexing.








Abstract
The development of ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials with programmable color is of great significance yet remains challenging for various optoelectronic applications. In this work, a novel type of polymer microspheres is presented as versatile carriers capable of regulating UOP colors through the reversible absorption and release of different phosphors. The rigid environment, facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the aryl carboxylic acid groups of the phosphors and the crosslinked polyacrylamide (PAM) microspheres, effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative transitions, enabling UOP with an impressive emission lifetime of 3.68 s. Specifically, these polymer microspheres serve as dynamic carriers that can reload and release uniformly dispersed phosphors in aqueous solution, thereby rearranging intermolecular hydrogen bonds and tuning the UOP emission color across a spectrum from blue to green and red. Furthermore, by incorporating fluorescent dyes into the polymer microspheres, the UOP color range can be extended to cover the entire visible spectrum through energy transfer mechanisms. Finally, the successful application of these UOP polymer microspheres is demonstrated in optical multiplexing. This study not only proposes a novel strategy for achieving color&#8208;tunable UOP in polymer microspheres but also broadens their potential applications in advanced optoelectronic technologies.

         <title>Injectable Functional Porous Carbon&#8208;Loaded Hydrogel with Long&#8208;Term Retention and Synergistic Anti&#8208;Tumor Properties for Tumor Therapy</title>

Injectable hydrogel (CFe/&#946;CP+Cis), developed by integrating &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PEGMA (&#946;CP) molecular brush hydrogel, single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;anchored porous carbon nanozyme (CFe), and cisplatin, combines chemodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunoregulation to synergistically treat tumors, providing a new direction for precise and sustained treatment of tumors.








Abstract
In situ therapies show significant promise for the treatment of unresectable tumors that lack tumor supply vessels. However, it remains a tremendous challenge to achieve precise delivery and sustained release of anti&#8208;tumor agents with synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. Here, a novel in situ injectable hydrogel (denoted as CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel) has been designed by integrating &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PEGMA (&#946;CP) molecular brush hydrogel with functional carbon nanozyme (CFe) and cisplatin. The reversible gel network of &#946;CP hydrogel and the rigid nanoscale architecture of CFe endow CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel with properties conducive to injectability and long&#8208;term retention (more than 63 days). CFe and cisplatin mixed in hydrogel are both gradually released into the tumor tissue, facilitating the synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy via ferroptosis and cytotoxicity. In addition, CFe/&#946;CP hydrogel can reduce the M2&#8208;like/M1&#8208;like ratio of macrophages&#160;and promote the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. As a result, the CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for precise and sustained tumor treatment through chemodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, immunoregulation, and long&#8208;term retention properties.

         <title>Lesional Macrophage&#8208;Targeted Nanomedicine Regulating Cholesterol Homeostasis for the Treatment of Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atherosclerosis (AS) progression is driven by foam cell dysfunction and inflammation. This work develops siTTENPs, a nanoplatform capable of delivering siTRPM2 and targeting lesional macrophages to inhibit oxidized low&#8208;density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake and improve the inflammatory microenvironment. Additionally, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) modification enhances cholesterol clearance, restoring lipid homeostasis. In vitro and in vivo studies confirm that siTTENPs effectively induce AS plaque regression and slow disease progression.








Abstract
The accumulation of atherosclerosis plaques within arterial walls leads to cardiovascular events. Lipid&#8208;laden macrophages, known as foam cells play a pivotal role in atherosclerotic plaque progression by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis and facilitating inflammation. This study presents a rational and multivalent nanoplatform (siTTENPs) for atherosclerosis treatment. siTTENPs can form electrostatic complexes with the nucleic acid siTRPM2, thereby reducing oxidized low&#8208;density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake by foam cells and alleviating inflammation. Concurrently, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) modified siTTENPs facilitate cholesterol clearance, further re&#8208;establishing lipid homeostasis. The nanometer size and S2P peptide (CRTLLTVRKC) modification endow these particles with specific targeting capabilities toward lesional macrophages, thereby enhancing their anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy. Consequently, the siTTENPs delivery system effectively inhibits pathological cholesterol internalization while simultaneously promoting cholesterol efflux mechanisms and reducing inflammation. This therapeutic intervention leads to significant regression of atherosclerotic plaque. This study introduces an innovative therapeutic strategy aimed at improving cholesterol homeostasis, with promising implications for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Supramolecular Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Silver(I) Metallogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive analysis of pyridine N&#8208;oxide&#8208;silver(I) trifluoroacetate complexes reveals remarkable mechanical strengths that enable the creation of free&#8208;standing objects with shape control, reaching dimensions of up to centimeters and shedding new insights into the gelation mechanisms.








Abstract
Twenty&#8208;seven pyridine N&#8208;oxides (PyNOs) are investigated to evaluate the gelation of their silver(I) trifluoroacetate (AgTFA) complexes across eight solvents. Gelation occurs selectively with PyNOs featuring electron&#8208;donating groups, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing or mixed groups do not form gels. A combination of two different PyNOs, one with an electron&#8208;donating group and the second with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group, form a gel, suggesting that gel&#8208;forming PyNO&#8208;AgTFA can override the non&#8208;gelling tendency of PyNOs comprising electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Pyridine&#8208;AgTFA complexes lacking the N&#8211;O group fail to gel, underscoring the crucial role of the N&#8211;O functionality and its coordination with silver(I) in facilitating gelation. The resulting PyNO&#8208;AgTFA gels demonstrate remarkable mechanical strengths, enabling the fabrication of free&#8208;standing and load&#8208;bearing gel shapes, such as rods and horseshoes, with sizes up to several centimeters. The analysis of 65 X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveals that PyNO&#8208;AgTFA complexes manifest four distinct structural motifs, even when crystallized under different solvents and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratios, demonstrating a strong preference for a specific set of silver(I) complexes. X&#8208;ray crystallography and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies predict gel structures without single crystals. Density functional theory calculations of recurring non&#8208;covalent interactions in the crystal structures show interaction energies ranging from &#8722;1 to &#8722;92 kJ mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Bioinspired Immunomodulatory Scaffold Based on Mineralized Lotus Stalks Laden with MnCO Microspheres for Accelerated Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MnCo@mPDA&#8208;coated mineralized lotus petiole (MM@MDL3) is developed for skull defect repair. The primary function of MM@MDL3 is to rapidly recruit cells to the bone defect area via its aligned channels. And the MM@MDL3 exhibits strong M2 macrophage polarization by the release of CO and Mn2+ ions, which further enhances angiogenesis and osteogenesis while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and maturation.








Abstract
Bone regeneration remains a significant clinical challenge due to the complexity of the bone healing process and the need for biomaterials that provide both structural support and immunomodulatory functions. Here, a bioinspired immunomodulatory scaffold is developed, composed of mineralized decellularized lotus stalks (MDL) integrated with manganese carbonyl (MnCO)&#8208;loaded mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) microspheres (MM@MDL3). This scaffold mimics the hierarchical architecture of natural bone while offering controlled CO and Mn2+ release, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, reducing inflammation, and enhancing osteogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrate that MM@MDL3 effectively promotes mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation by activating the BMP2/SMAD/RUNX2 pathway. In vivo rat calvarial defect models confirm significant bone regeneration, with increased bone volume, enhanced vascularization, and reduced osteoclastogenesis. These results demonstrate MM@MDL3 as a promising strategy for large&#8208;segment bone defect repair by integrating a biomimetic structure with immunomodulatory and osteogenic properties. The proposed scaffold has great potential for treating clinical large&#8208;segment bone defects.

         <title>A Biomimetic Copper Silicate&#8208;MOF Hybrid for Highly Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the drosera rotundifolia, a hierarchical hollow CuSiO3&#8208;MOF hybrid is constructed for highly stable Zn metal anode, featuring good structural stability, abundant zincophilic sites, strong desolvation capability, and fast ion migration simultaneously. Thus, the Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF anode displays long&#8208;term cycling lifespans of 1200 and 400 h even under high DODZn of 45% and 90%, outperforming most reported MOF&#8208;modified anodes.








Abstract
To promote the electrochemical performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, various artificial interlayers are developed to mitigate dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions of Zn anode. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) interlayers show much potential in solving these problems, yet their practical usage is inhibited by their inferior structural stability during cycles. Herein, inspired by the biological mechanism and symbiotic architecture of drosera rotundifolia, this challenge is tackled by constructing a hierarchical hollow CuSiO3&#8208;MOF hybrid through in situ MOF conversion. For protecting Zn anode, this biomimetic hybrid offers good structural stability, abundant zincophilic sites, strong desolvation capability, and fast ion migration, which collectively enable highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping processes and suppress H2O&#8208;related side reactions. Consequently, the Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF symmetric battery achieves an ultralong lifespan exceeding 3500 h with low voltage hysteresis. Remarkably, it maintains stable cycling behaviors of 1200 and 400 h even under high depths of discharge of 45% and 90%, outperforming the most reported MOF&#8208;modified anodes. Moreover, full cells with MnO2 and C@V2O3 cathodes exhibit exceptional cycling performance and rate capability, highlighting the practical applications of Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF anode for grid storage and wearable electronics. This bioinspired strategy provides a feasible approach to constructing stable MOF&#8208;based hybrid for high&#8208;performance Zn anode.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Scaffold for Spatial and Border Expansive Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;growing scaffolds increase both the border and the space of obsolete defects. By balancing molecular cohesion and hydrogen bonding, the growth time can be regulated within 3&#8211;7 days. Dynamic shear forces induced by scaffold growth can inhibit hematoma, enhance focal adhesion, and accelerate extracellular matrix remodeling. This regenerative model allows for minimally invasive treatment of vertical bone augmentation.








Abstract
Tissue regeneration and repair techniques approaching personalized treatment are devoted to fabricating high&#8208;precision scaffolds that accurately match the size of the defect. However, scaffolds are difficult to implant in situ for obsolete defects with loss of original space, and the size is limited by confined boundary tissue. In nature, the development of fetuses, organs, and even plants all experience a matched growth in volume and border. Inspired by that, this study proposes a space&#8208;expanding regeneration model with a self&#8208;growing (SG) scaffold, which is then used in refractory alveolar ridge vertical bone augmentation. The SG scaffold contains a multistage hydrophilic polymer network. The initial size can be eliminated for minimally invasive implantation, and gradually increased by orderly absorption of tissue fluid, achieving controlled growth in vivo. The shearing force of the SG scaffold suppresses tissue hematoma and stimulates extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, macrophages polarize toward M2 and secrete transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1. Meanwhile, bone regeneration is induced within the expanded space, achieving a &#8776;5&#8208;fold vertical increase of the rat skull, and supporting a 6&#8208;mm&#8208;long titanium implant. The SG scaffold provides a spatial and border extension model for obsolete injuries.

         <title>Bioinspired Hyperboloid Mechanical Metamaterial for Shock Absorption and Strain Regulation in Cartilage Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the shock&#8208;absorbing architecture of natural insect elytra, a hyperboloid metamaterial scaffold exhibits compression&#8208;torsion coupling, converting mechanical loads into strain energy. The upper hyperboloid region promotes chondrogenesis via high strain, while the lower tough lattice favors osteogenesis, enhancing the integrative regeneration of both cartilage and subchondral bone.








Abstract
Inspired by the shock&#8208;absorbing capabilities of natural insect elytra, a hyperboloid lattice metamaterial exhibiting unique compression&#8208;torsion coupling behavior is designed and fabricated. This structure efficiently converts dynamic loads into strain energy, enabling high&#8208;strain elastic deformation. The hyperboloid lattice is integrated with a classic reticulation framework and filled with GelMA hydrogel, creating a tailored osteochondral scaffold with mechanical properties that closely match those of joint tissue. Under dynamic mechanical culture, compression&#8208;torsion stimulation in the hyperboloid zone induced high&#8208;strain elastic deformation, promoting chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells, while the more rigid reticulation zone, experiencing minimal deformation, facilitated osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. In a rabbit osteochondral defect model, hyperboloid&#8208;based shock&#8208;absorption scaffolds significantly enhanced the integrative repair of both cartilage and subchondral bone via the NF&#8208;&#954;B and calcium signaling pathways. The incorporation of the hyperboloid metamaterial, with its shock&#8208;absorbing and strain&#8208;regulating properties, demonstrates great potential for developing adaptable mechanical scaffolds for cartilage remodeling.

         <title>Xolography for Rapid Volumetric Production of Objects from the Nanoscopic to Macroscopic Length Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article explores the development of materials with multi&#8208;scale control at the nanoscale (&lt;100 nm), micrometer&#8208;scale (80 &#181;m), and macro&#8208;scale (multi&#8208;component geometries). This is achieved by applying polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) process via volumetric 3D printing (Xolography), expanding the design space for functional nanomaterials in diverse applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated 3D printing has revolutionized additive manufacturing, progressing from pointwise stereolithography, to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer digital light processing, and most recently to volumetric 3D printing. Xolography, a novel light&#8208;sheet&#8208;based volumetric 3D printing approach, offers high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;precision fabrication of complex geometries unattainable with traditional methods. However, achieving nanoscale control (&lt;100&#160;nm) within these 3D printing systems remains unexplored. This work leverages polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) within the xolography process to prepare network polymer materials with simultaneous control over feature sizes at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macro&#8208;scale. By controlling the chain length and mass fraction of macromolecular chain transfer agents used in the PIMS process, precise manipulation of nanodomain size within 3D printed materials is demonstrated, while optimization of the other resin components enables the fabrication of rigid materials with feature sizes of 80&#160;&#181;m. Critically, the rapid one&#8208;step fabrication of complex and multi&#8208;component structures such as a functional waterwheel with interlocking parts, at high volume&#8208;building rates is showcased. This combined approach expands the design space for functional nanomaterials, opening new avenues for applications in diverse fields such as polymer electrolyte membranes, biomedical delivery systems, and semi&#8208;permeable microcapsules.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning of Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Morphology via Synergistic Ternary Copolymerization and Side Chain Optimization of Low&#8208;Cost Polymer Donors Toward Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new low&#8208;cost PTQ derivative donors PTQ17, PTQ18, and PTQ19 are rationally designed and synthesized by synergistic ternary copolymerization and side chain optimization strategies, to fine&#8208;tune the molecular self&#8208;assembly morphology. Due to ideal microscopic morphology of active layer and optimized energy level alignment, PTQ18&#8208;based binary and ternary organic solar cells achieve excellent efficiencies of 19.68% and 20.06%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly morphology optimization of organic photovoltaic materials is crucial to improve the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three low&#8208;cost PTQ derivative donors, PTQ17, PTQ18, and PTQ19 are developed by synergistic ternary copolymerization and side chain optimization of utilizing different benzothiadiazole (BT) units, to fine&#8208;tune molecular self&#8208;assembly morphology. PTQ17, containing difluorinated BT, shows the tightest &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing and strongest molecular crystallinity, leading to excessive molecular aggregation and phase separation morphology in active layer. In contrast, PTQ19, containing dialkoxy&#8208;substituted BT, has the weakest molecular crystallinity, resulting in the worst long&#8208;range ordered molecular packing and the smallest phase domains in active layer. Remarkably, PTQ18, containing monofluorinated and monoalkoxy&#8208;substituted BT, has moderate molecular crystallinity and the best compatibility with acceptor, resulting in the most ideal microscopic morphology of active layer with desirable domain size and phase separation features. In result, the PTQ18&#8208;based binary OSC achieves an outstanding efficiency of 19.68%; and further optimized energy level alignment leads to an enhanced PCE of 20.06% in the PTQ18&#8208;based ternary device. This work demonstrates the importance of self&#8208;assembly morphology modification of organic photovoltaic molecules in improving performance of OSCs, and it has guiding role in design of high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic materials.

&lt;p&gt;Self-assembly morphology optimization of organic photovoltaic materials is crucial to improve the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three low-cost PTQ derivative donors, PTQ17, PTQ18, and PTQ19 are developed by synergistic ternary copolymerization and side chain optimization of utilizing different benzothiadiazole (BT) units, to fine-tune molecular self-assembly morphology. PTQ17, containing difluorinated BT, shows the tightest &#960;-&#960; packing and strongest molecular crystallinity, leading to excessive molecular aggregation and phase separation morphology in active layer. In contrast, PTQ19, containing dialkoxy-substituted BT, has the weakest molecular crystallinity, resulting in the worst long-range ordered molecular packing and the smallest phase domains in active layer. Remarkably, PTQ18, containing monofluorinated and monoalkoxy-substituted BT, has moderate molecular crystallinity and the best compatibility with acceptor, resulting in the most ideal microscopic morphology of active layer with desirable domain size and phase separation features. In result, the PTQ18-based binary OSC achieves an outstanding efficiency of 19.68%; and further optimized energy level alignment leads to an enhanced PCE of 20.06% in the PTQ18-based ternary device. This work demonstrates the importance of self-assembly morphology modification of organic photovoltaic molecules in improving performance of OSCs, and it has guiding role in design of high-performance organic photovoltaic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical MoS2/Poly(ionic liquid) Metamaterials for Electrically Tunable Terahertz Stealth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ToC figure illustrates a terahertz stealth metamaterial with hierarchical ionotronic architecture, where large&#8208;area MoS2 assemblies conformally integrated with poly(ionic liquid) microarrays. It highlights wave&#8208;electron&#8208;ion interactions, enabling high electrical tunability and dynamic absorption modulation within terahertz atmospheric windows. This advanced material holds significant potential for enhancing the survivability and active countermeasure capabilities of military equipment against terahertz radar detections.








Abstract
Active absorption modulation is critical for advanced stealth technologies, especially given the emerging detection threat from terahertz atmospheric windows. However, due to the difficulty in balancing high absorption and tunability, the actual manufacturing of most terahertz absorbers usually neglects the integration of electrical tuning, which limits their development of dynamic wave trapping for electronic countermeasure systems. Here, a terahertz stealth metamaterial (TSM) with hierarchical ionotronic architecture is proposed to overcome the tradeoff. Large&#8208;area continuous MoS2 assemblies tightly attached poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) microarrays provide enough conditions for surface electron conduction and plasmon mode excitation. By establishing wave&#8208;electron&#8208;ion interaction pathways, the directional migration of free anions inside the PIL and the accumulation of excess charge carriers up to 100.4% at the MoS2 interfaces are promoted, thereby stimulating changes in the plasma frequency of the absorption system. Consequently, this micro&#8208;nano structural design enhances the absorption tunability and combines multiple dissipative behaviors. TSM exhibit high specific attenuation (&#8722;275&#160;dB&#160;mm&#8722;1), frequency agility (21.4%), and phase switching (153.1&#160;deg.) within terahertz atmospheric windows. Moreover, the template&#8208;assisted assembly strategy adopted has the potential to be used for the building of universal blocks operating within other frequency ranges.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Framework Electrolyte Featured Zinc&#8208;Ion Transport for Solvent and Interphasial Co&#8208;Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report designs an ion&#8208;framework electrolyte to passivate solvent and interphase. Such electrolyte systems simultaneously yield a wide electrochemical stability window and robust SEI, which fill a gap in current Zn2+ electrolytes.








Abstract
The rapid application of zinc&#8208;ion (Zn2+) energy storage lacks favorable solvation structures to simultaneously form inert electrolyte environments and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which means that Zn2+ devices cannot synchronously against the side reactions, Zn dendrites and narrow electrochemical stability windows, further hindering their wide operative voltage window and ultra&#8208;long service life. Here, ion&#8208;framework electrolytes are designed by using large&#8208;sized inert&#8208;ammonium salts as the main solute. The ion framework, assembled from ultra&#8208;large solvation ion clusters containing large tetraethylammonium cations, large anions, and abundant solvents via electrostatic interactions, not only forms suitable channels for Zn2+ transport but also constrains free solvents to passivate their electrochemical activity, achieving an ultra&#8208;wide electrochemical stability window about 3.72&#160;V. More importantly, the enrichment of the ion framework at Zn interface generates a homogenous SEI with the dense polymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid structure to passivate the interphasial chemistry, which eliminates the Zn dendrites and side reactions. Therefore, Zn anode using this electrolyte achieves the ultra&#8208;long cycling stability of 8,150&#160;h, and Zn metal||activated carbon capacitors exhibit a high operative voltage (0&#8211;2.1&#160;V) and ultra&#8208;long cycle life (&#8776;170,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). This electrolyte design principle is promising for addressing the typical challenges in other metal&#8208;ion systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Activation for Efficient Acidic CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a dual sites activation strategy to enhance the nucleophilic of Sn sites and modulate the Cu sites as harder Lewis acid sites by constructing CuS/SnS2 Mott&#8211;Schottky catalysts. The optimized charge distribution facilitates the adsorption of CO2 and *OCHO intermediates simultaneously, thus improving formic acid selectivity in acid electrolytes under industrial current densities.








Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to formic acid in acidic media offers a promising approach for value&#8208;added CO2 utilization. However, achieving high selectivity for formic acid in acidic electrolytes remains challenging due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), particularly at industrially relevant current densities. Herein, a charge redistribution modulation strategy is demonstrated by constructing the CuS /SnS2 Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst to enhance formic acid selectivity. Experiments and calculation results reveal the broadening of Sn orbitals and reduced orbital symmetry of Sn orbitals contribute to enhanced CO2 adsorption, while the modulated Cu sites with a stronger Lewis acid character stabilize *OCHO intermediates more effectively. This enables dual&#8208;site activation for efficient CO2 electroreduction into formic acid synthesis. Consequently, the optimized CuS/SnS2 catalysts achieve a maximum formic acid Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99% in acidic electrolytes and maintain selectivity above 80% at a current density of 1 A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, significantly surpassing the performance of CuS and SnS2 alone. Moreover, the excellent selectivity across pH&#8208;universal electrolytes demonstrates that dual&#8208;site activation is a promising strategy for designing highly efficient CO2 reduction reaction catalysts.

         <title>Modular Molecular Editing of End&#8208;of&#8208;Life PBT for High&#8208;Performance Sustainable and 3D&#8208;Printable Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by DNA editing, a modular molecular editing strategy is proposed to upcycle end&#8208;of&#8208;life poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable, and 3D&#8208;printable platform. Surpassing commercial counterparts in mechanical properties without additives, it enables programmable performance for applications like 3D materials, films, and fibers. This work provides an industrializable and sustainable solution for PBT upcycling, delivering environmental and economic benefits.









Abstract
Engineering polyesters, particularly poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), are widely used but generate significant waste, with limited recycling options. Existing mechanical and chemical recycling strategies struggle to sustainably and efficiently reuse PBT, resulting in product performance degradation and making the recycling process more costly than the upstream synthesis routes for raw materials. Inspired by DNA editing technologies in molecular biology, a modular molecular editing strategy is proposed to sequentially modify the backbone and end groups of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PBT, transforming it into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable, and 3D&#8208;printable poly(butylene adipate&#8208;co&#8208;terephthalate) (PBAT) platform. Unlike traditional commercial PBATs that produce only single components, this platform surpasses them in tensile strength and toughness without requiring additional additives and features programmable properties for diverse applications, including injection&#8208;molded parts, 3D&#8208;printed components, films, packaging, fibers, and fabrics. The industrial scalability of this strategy is validated through successful 100&#8208;L pilot&#8208;scale production. The resulting PBAT allows closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer recycling by reintroducing PBT or monomers, thereby enhancing its social sustainability. When recovery is no longer feasible, the materials remain ecologically sustainable through composting, avoiding harmful environmental accumulation. This work achieves a direct polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer conversion of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PBT into high&#8208;performance materials, with techno&#8208;economic analysis highlighting both environmental and economic advantages.

This work achieves a direct polymer-to-polymer conversion of end-of-life PBT into high-performance materials, with techno-economic analysis highlighting both environmental and economic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semiconducting Pt Structures Stabilized on 2D MoS2 Crystals Enable Ultrafast Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of small Pt particles with 2D MoS2 crystals can stabilize bilayer Pt structures, with a semiconducting electronic structure. The semiconducting electronic structure of Pt bilayers constitutes the so far unexplored transition domain between the bulk&#8208;like, metallic band structure of compact nanoparticles and the discrete atomic orbitals of single atoms, while, remarkably, displaying the highest intrinsic activity among them.








Abstract
Metallic platinum is the best and most widely investigated catalyst for hydrogen evolution, yet little is known about Pt in its semiconducting form. Here, it is shown that semiconducting Pt structures with a thickness of only two atomic layers (0.4&#160;nm) can be stabilized on 2D MoS2 crystals. Reducing the thickness of Pt particles below the Fermi wavelength (0.5&#160;nm) opens a sizeable (0.3&#8211;0.4&#160;eV) gap in their electronic structure. The resulting electronic structure is qualitatively different from both the metallic bands of larger Pt nanoparticles and the atomic orbitals of Pt single atom catalysts while displaying the highest intrinsic activity among them. Semiconducting Pt bilayers enable H2 production at ten times higher rates (&#8776;1400 H2 s&#8722;1 @ &#951; = 100&#160;mV) than Pt single atom catalysts, and match the activity of commercial Pt nanoparticles (Pt /C catalysts) at three orders of magnitude lower Pt loadings.

         <title>Tin&#8208;Lead&#8208;Selenide Nanocrystals for Sensitive Uncooled Mid&#8208;Infrared Focal Plane Array Imager with Monolithic Readout Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;doped lead selenide nanocrystals are synthesized to reduce thermal noise by adjusting Sn doping content. The uncooled mid&#8208;infrared focal plane array imager (64 &#215; 64 pixels) fabricated by monolithic integration above nanocrystals exhibits an excellent detectivity (7.46 &#215; 109 Jones) and a thermal sensitivity (133 mK) at room temperature. It successfully realizes the uncooled mid&#8208;infrared thermal imaging with a lens.








Abstract
The mid&#8208;infrared focal plane array (FPA) imager has developed over recent decades to become multifunctional, powerful, reliable, miniaturized, and cost&#8208;effective. However, the complexity of the refrigerated packaging process (such as dewar flask) and traditional fabrication technology (such as flip&#8208;chip) continues to contribute significantly to the high cost of industrial production. Here, a simple, low&#8208;cost, and effective type of uncooled mid&#8208;infrared FPA imager is reported through the monolithic integration of mid&#8208;infrared Pb1&#8208;xSnxSe nanocrystals (NCs) PIN heterojunction (PbS/Pb1&#8208;xSnxSe/ZnO) photodetectors and glass&#8208;based readout integrated circuits (ROICs). Sn&#8208;doping in PbSe NCs not only weakens the internal photocarrier&#8208;phonon coupling to reduce thermal noise but also optimizes the energy band structure of the heterojunction to enhance mid&#8208;infrared performance. Finally, the PbS/Pb0.86Sn0.14Se/ZnO heterojunction photodetector demonstrates a dark current (2.7 x 10&#8722;7 A mm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V), a detectivity of 7.46 &#215; 109 Jones at a peak wavelength of 4.25&#160;&#181;m, air stability (retaining 96.7% performance at 300 K for 360 days) and the corresponding uncooled mid&#8208;infrared FPA (64 &#215; 64 pixels) achieves excellent thermal sensitivity of 133 mK. These results underscore the substantial potential applications of mid&#8208;infrared FPA based on the heterojunction, including spectral imaging, gas leak detection, and chemical reagent identification.

         <title>Unidirectional Electrobending Deformation in Acceptor&#8208;Doped Piezoceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior with a symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped bipolar S&#8208;E curve in acceptor&#8208;doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics, where the bending direction is governed by the pre&#8208;poling direction rather than the applied electric field. We attribute that this unprecedented unidirectional behavior arises from the synergistic interaction between domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers.








Abstract
Since 2022, large apparent strains (&gt;1%) with highly asymmetrical strain&#8208;electric field (S&#8208;E) curves have been reported in various thin piezoceramic materials, attributed to a bidirectional electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced bending (electrobending) deformation, which consistently produces convex bending along the negative electric field direction. In this study, a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior in acceptor&#8208;doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics are reported, where convex bending always occurs along the pre&#8208;poling direction regardless of the direction of the applied electric field. This unique deformation is related to the reorientation of the (MNb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8722;VO&#183;&#183;$M_{{\mathrm{Nb}}}^{^{\prime\prime\prime}} - V_{\mathrm{O}}^{ \cdot \cdot }$) defect dipoles (where M2+ represents the acceptor&#8208;doped ion in the Nb&#8208; site) in one surface layer during the pre&#8208;poling process, resulting in an asymmetrical distribution of defect dipoles in the two surface layers. The synergistic interaction between ferroelectric domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers induces this unidirectional electrobending, as evidenced by a butterfly&#8208;like symmetrical bipolar S&#8208;E curve with a giant apparent strain of 3.2%. These findings provide new insights into defect engineering strategies for developing advanced piezoelectric materials with large electroinduced displacements.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Tracking of Nanoscale Morphology and Strain Evolution in Bi2WO6 via Operando Coherent X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging is used to study the structural behavior of a BWO nanoparticle as it is exposed to Argon and H2 + N2 gas environments. In the presence of the H2 + N2 gas, a semiconducting to metallic phase transition is observed to nucleate from dislocations running from the bulk to the surface.








Abstract
Nanostructuring photocatalytic and catalytic materials substantially increases the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, thereby exposing a greater number of active sites essential for enhanced catalytic efficiency. However, optimizing these efficiencies requires the non&#8208;destructive, operando interrogation of individual nanocrystals under realistic catalytic conditions&#8212;a capability that has long remained elusive. Here, this challenge is addressed by reporting three&#8208;dimensional imaging of defects, crystal morphology, and strain dynamics in individual Bi2WO6 (BWO) nanoflakes using Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) under operando temperature, gas, and light&#8208;driven conditions. It is demonstrated that maintaining a constant temperature of 40&#176;C thermally activates charge carriers, likely enhancing their mobility and reducing recombination rates. Furthermore, an Argon (Ar) gas flow stabilizes the reaction environment, while a mixed Hydrogen&#8211;Nitrogen (H2 + N2) flow induces a hydrogen&#8208;triggered semiconducting&#8208;to&#8208;metallic (SM) electronic phase transition accompanied by a structural transformation, as supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both DFT and BCDI analyses reveal that during the SM phase transition, a new structural phase nucleates near defects and propagates inhomogeneously. Notably, the onset of nanoscale cracking is observed, driven by localized strain accumulation and environmental cycling, which increases surface area and potentially introduces new reactive sites. These findings illustrate that combining advanced nanostructuring with operando imaging techniques can provide critical insights into the local structural features that govern photocatalytic performance, paving the way for the rational design of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic&#160;materials.

It is demonstrated that maintaining a constant temperature of 40&#176;C thermally activates charge carriers, likely enhancing their mobility and reducing recombination rates. Furthermore, an Argon (Ar) gas flow stabilizes the reaction environment, while a mixed Hydrogen&#8211;Nitrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) flow induces a hydrogen-triggered semiconducting-to-metallic (SM) electronic phase transition accompanied by a structural transformation, as supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both DFT and BCDI analyses reveal that during the SM phase transition, a new structural phase nucleates near defects and propagates inhomogeneously. Notably, the onset of nanoscale cracking is observed, driven by localized strain accumulation and environmental cycling, which increases surface area and potentially introduces new reactive sites. These findings illustrate that combining advanced nanostructuring with &lt;i&gt;operando&lt;/i&gt; imaging techniques can provide critical insights into the local structural features that govern photocatalytic performance, paving the way for the rational design of next-generation photocatalytic&#160;materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sword and Board in One: A Bioinspired Nanocomposite Membrane for Guided Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combinatorial design of bioinspired multiscale structure and intrinsic composition realizes a collection of functions as &#8220;sword (active offense) and board (passive defense)&#8221; in GBR treatment. This work not only sparks new vitality to bioinspired GBR treatment in the next generation toward reconciling critical conflict presented in tissue engineering but also offers a promising outlook for future clinical translation.








Abstract
Guided bone regeneration (GBR) faces far from a one&#8208;dimensional challenge. It demands a multifunctional membrane to possess paradoxical but essential properties in sophisticated clinical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from natural biological structures and superior properties, through a combination of structure innovation and composition regulation, a multicomponent nacre&#8208;inspired discontinuous Bouligand structure is devised and transcribed into a bioinspired Janus nanocomposite membrane with comprehensive properties for GBR, identical to &#8220;sword and board.&#8221; As a sword, our membrane can actively adapt to sharp bony ridges owing to high toughness, capture water molecules for fluid penetration, drive osteogenic expression, and kill bacteria. As a board, it can achieve superior mechanical strength to withstand external forces, passively maintain structural integrity for ingrowth barrier, while function as a passive substrate for cell adhesion and proliferation. Overall, the membrane with excellent mechanical properties and bio&#8208;functions is the paradigm of the combinatorial design of component and structure. It achieves the contradictory yet prerequisite features in response to the current challenge and offers new hope to advance biomedical applications. Equally important, the fabrication of our multifunctional bioinspired membrane is mild, efficient, scalable, and thus is poised to inspire the design of a broader range of functional material systems.

         <title>Biased Plasma Treated Nickel Oxide for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ biased plasma treatment (BPT) reconstructs the surface of sputtered Nickel oxide (NiOx), enabling controlled Ni3&#8314;/Ni2&#8314; ratios and optimized surface roughness, thereby enhancing interfacial properties. This strategy enhances perovskite crystallinity and optimizes band alignment, resulting in power conversion efficiencies of 21.8% in single&#8208;junction and 32.1% (certified 31.7%) in tandem solar cells, with outstanding operational stability.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) hole transport layer deposited by magnetron sputtering shows high stability, low cost, high reproducibility, and scalability for perovskite and tandem solar cells. However, the performance of perovskite and tandem solar cells with sputtered NiOx is limited by the defective interface and suboptimal energy band alignment. This work focuses on reconstructing the sputtered NiOx surface with in situ biased plasma treatment (BPT). It is demonstrated that in situ BPT following sputtering induces both physical and chemical changes on the NiOx surface, enabling a smoother and denser surface with controllable Ni3+/Ni2+ ratios. The in situ BPT NiOx is proven to be effective in improving the conductivity of NiOx, suppressing the non&#8208;radiation recombination, fine&#8208;tuning the energy band alignment, and facilitating the crystallinity of the perovskite. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide bandgap perovskite solar cells is improved to 21.8% by the implementation of BPT NiOx. Further integrating the BPT NiOx into monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells results in a high PCE of 32.1% (certified 31.7%) with excellent operational stability.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered &#945; Radionuclide Nanomedicine: Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Multimodal Energy Recycling for Amplified Radioimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanomedicine co&#8208;loading of the &#945;&#8208;emitter 223RaCl2 within iron&#8208;based MOFs is developed. Precisely targeted to mitochondria, it exploits the full decay spectrum to synchronize three therapeutic actions: direct &#945;&#8208;particle ionization, self&#8208;powered catalytic H2O2 generation via secondary electrons, and immunogenic cell death induction. This integrated approach overcomes the limitations of conventional radiotherapy by facilitating effective local tumor ablation and systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity without external energy input.








Abstract
Internal Radionuclide Therapy (IRT) faces significant challenges, particularly the limited controlled penetration depth of conventional &#946; rays and the inefficient targeted delivery of &#945;&#8208;emitters. In this study, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted, self&#8208;powered &#945; radionuclide nanomedicine, and pioneer a groundbreaking &#8220;suborganelle precise radiodynamic immunotherapy&#8221; paradigm that synergistically integrates physical irradiation, catalytic chemistry, and immunomodulation to overcome the historical limitations of IRT is developed. The innovation establishes a &#8220;radionuclide energy internal cycling&#8221; strategy through 223RaCl2 (the first FDA&#8208;approved &#945;&#8208;emitter), unlocking three synergistic therapies from one radionuclide: precise ionizing radiation, self&#8208;powered catalysis, and immunogenic reprogramming. This paradigm uniquely exploits the full decay spectrum (&#945; particles, &#946; electrons, &#947; photons) to synchronize physical, chemical, and biological anti&#8208;tumor mechanisms without requiring external energy inputs, offering a transformative solution to overcome the physical&#8208;biological barriers of IRT and bridge localized eradication with systemic immune regulation.

         <title>Coaxial Electroluminochromic Fibers with Dynamic RGB Switching for Pixelated Smart Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coaxial electroluminochromic fiber with integrated electroluminescent cores and electrochromic shells is constructed on carbon nanotube fibers, enabling dynamic RGB switching and pixelated control. The design features low&#8208;voltage operation, fast and reversible color modulation, and high durability, offering a significant advance for multicolor smart textiles in wearable electronics and textile&#8208;based display technologies.








Abstract
The immense potential of electronic textiles for wearable applications has spurred extensive research into luminescent fibers suitable for smart textile displays. However, current electroluminescent (EL) fibers, while flexible and wearable, typically emit only a fixed color and have a 1D structure, which confines fiber&#8208;based displays to pre&#8208;designed patterns. Here, a coaxial hierarchical fiber structure is fabricated with an insulating polymer layer sandwiched between an EL core and an electrochromic (EC) shell based on carbon nanotube fibers. Acting as a dynamic optical filter with RGB tri&#8208;state switching capabilities, the EC shell can effectively modulate the optical properties of inner emitted lights via a low voltage, enabling a new &#8220;electroluminochromic&#8221; fiber with multicolor luminescence and rapid on&#8208;demand color switching. Moreover, electroluminochromic bare fibers can be woven with orthogonal electrodes at discrete gel polymer electrolyte junctions, forming individually addressable luminescent pixels. Using a warp&#8208;weft knitting approach and integration with the Internet of Things, this display textile can transmit information, exhibiting great potential for applications in smart displays and wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Symmetry Basis Engineered Covalent Organic Frameworks for Water Purification Under Ultralow Light Intensity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a symmetry basis strategy to engineer pyridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks for solar water purification. The symmetric Bby&#8208;COF exhibits a higher ofloxacin degradation than asymmetric analogs via enhanced charge density and electron sink effect. Remarkably, it achieves complete ofloxacin removal under ultra&#8208;low light using long&#8208;termed flow&#8208;through reactor, bridging lab innovation to real&#8208;world application.








Abstract
Achieving efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion of low&#8208;intensity and natural sunlight is a promising but challenged for sustainable water purification. Herein, an electron&#8208;deficient pyridine units into functional basis with symmetric and asymmetric is newly pre&#8208;designed to form covalent organic frameworks (COFs). It is found that the bidirectional push&#8208;pull effect of the bipyridine units in the symmetric Bby&#8208;COF induces an increase in charge density and enhances the electron sink effect. This transformation optimizes the activation pathway of dissolved oxygen, establishing a pathway of micropollutants decomposition mediated by superoxide free radicals and photoexcited holes oxidation. Specifically, the first&#8208;order rate constant of ofloxacin (OFL) removal for Bby&#8208;COF for is 28.14&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;min&#8722;1, surpassing that of asymmetric Bpy&#8208;COF by 6.3&#8208;times (4.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 min&#8722;1). Remarkably, Bby&#8208;COF can achieve complete OFL removal within 30&#8211;40&#160;min under winter sunlight conditions, demonstrating unprecedented ultra&#8208;low&#8208;light&#8208;intensity (36&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) catalytic performance. In this mode, an array&#8208;type plate&#8208;and&#8208;frame flow&#8208;through reactor can be consecutively operated for treating a total volume of 58.8 L wastewater using outdoor sunlight, meeting the potentiality of large&#8208;scale applications. This study pioneers a symmetry&#8208;engineered molecular strategy for developing high&#8208;performance organocatalysts, bridging the critical gap between laboratory photocatalysis and real&#8208;world solar wastewater treatment applications.

Herein, an electron-deficient pyridine units into functional basis with symmetric and asymmetric is newly pre-designed to form covalent organic frameworks (COFs). It is found that the bidirectional push-pull effect of the bipyridine units in the symmetric Bby-COF induces an increase in charge density and enhances the electron sink effect.

         <title>Robust and Fast&#8208;Transforming Soft Microrobots Driven by Low Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new composite ink is developed by in situ grafting polyacrylamide chains onto magnetizable single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic NdFeB nanostructures for soft microrobots combined with a magnetic field&#8208;assisted 3D printing process. Benefiting from precise control of domain orientation within a single filament, the printed soft microrobots present mechanically robust and fast&#8208;transforming behaviors powered by a low magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetically driven soft microrobots, characterized by their small size, soft structure, and responsiveness to magnetic fields, offer unique advantages such as high maneuverability, biocompatibility, and remote control, making them suitable for a variety of applications across multiple fields. Achieving low&#8208;power actuation for microrobots is more accessible, safer, and cost&#8208;effective, dependent on the precise quality and arrangement of their magnetic domains. However, traditional approaches integrating multi&#8208;domain magnetic microstructures often introduce trade&#8208;offs between mechanical stability and responsiveness. Here, a magnetic domain assembly method is presented for the fabrication of robust soft microrobots with fast transforming behaviors powered by low magnetic fields (3&#8211;15 mT). By developing a composite ink containing polyacrylamide chains grafted onto magnetizable single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic NdFeB nanostructures, precise control over domain orientation within ultrafine filaments (80&#160;&#181;m) is achieved by magnetic field&#8208;assisted 3D printing process, allowing complex and rapid shape morphing in under 1 s, even with less than 2 wt.% NdFeB. This uniform magnetic alignment results in a tenfold increase in mechanical toughness and impressive stretchability (1600%). With top&#8208;performing actuation performance at low magnetic fields, the microrobots demonstrate multimodal locomotion and robust tasking capabilities, showcasing their transformative potential for next&#8208;generation soft robotics.

         <title>Neuromorphic Polarization Vision Enabled by Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Photosynaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired polarization&#8208;sensitive photosynaptic transistor using anisotropic organic micro&#8208;crystals is developed to replicate biological polarization vision. A record dichroic ratio of &gt;103 is achieved under ultraweak light of 600&#160;nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 while operating at the ultralow energy consumption of 0.22&#160;pJ per synaptic event. The artificial visual neuron replicates complex polarization vision behaviors of butterflies, including intraspecific communication and target recognition.








Abstract
Polarization vision, a highly sophisticated visual capability in insects such as butterflies and bees, plays a pivotal role in enabling survival&#8208;critical ecological behaviors, such as navigation, intraspecific communication, mating, and habitat selection. However, the replication of this capability in artificial systems has long been impeded by the limited dichroic ratio (DR, typically &lt; 10) of existing materials and the complexity of conventional optical designs. Here, the first time a bioinspired polarization&#8208;sensitive photosynaptic transistor is developed based on organic micro&#8208;crystal arrays for neuromorphic polarization vision. By leveraging the polarization&#8208;dependent photogating effect in intrinsically anisotropic organic crystals, the device achieves an unprecedented DR exceeding 103 within a minimal gate&#8208;bias window of 1 V, outperforming existing polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the device successfully mimics the synaptic plasticity of polarization&#8208;sensitive visual neurons, enabling tunable transitions between short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity through a charge&#8208;storage accumulative process. Significantly, it operates with an exceptionally low energy consumption of 0.22 pJ per synaptic event under ultraweak polarized light of 600&#160;nW&#160;cm&#8722;2, rivaling the efficiency of biological neural systems. Further it demonstrates the replication of complex polarization vision behaviors of butterflies, including intraspecific communication and target recognition, using this artificial visual neuron. Our work opens new avenues for neuromorphic polarization vision, with broad implications for intelligent neurorobotics and energy&#8208;efficient biomimetic electronics.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Enable Multifunctional Ice Accretion, Melting, and Interfacial Fracture Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water impacting, freezing, melting, and being mechanically removed from the designed dielectric surfaces generates a triboeletric signal that can be used to detect various icing and de&#8208;icing scenarios. The charge transferred directly scales with the interfacial fracture mechanism, further validating triboelectricity as an excellent ice&#8208;detection platform, including in&#8208;flight on drones flying at subzero temperatures, as demonstrated.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have significant potential to perform as sensors or compact electric power generators through the production of electrical charge during the frictional interactions between two dissimilar materials, such as liquids impacting solids. However, whether phase transitions generate a triboelectric response is not known. This study investigates the occurrence of triboelectrification during the water&#8208;ice phase transition using TENGs for real&#8208;time ice detection on critical engineering surfaces such as aircraft, wind turbine blades, and vehicles. TENGs are fabricated using aluminum electrodes and either polyethylene, silicone, or polytetrafluoroethylene as the dielectric. The freezing of water and the melting of ice are found to generate triboelectric current only during motion of the contact line, and the presence of ice can lessen additional charge transfer during continuous ice accretion. Further, ice type (rime versus glaze) can be differentiated during accretion by the initial transferred charge and how quickly the signal plateaus. It is observed that mechanical de&#8208;icing generates triboelectric charges that are proportional to the de&#8208;icing force, and this allows for the identification and quantification interfacial fracture mechanisms such as stress&#8208;controlled, toughness&#8208;controlled, and cavitation&#8208;controlled de&#8208;bonding. A prototype ice sensor is validated on a flying drone exposed to simulated rain under icing conditions, where it is able to detect both icing and de&#8208;icing in flight. The TENGs exhibited a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio as high as 83 dB, highlighting triboelectricity as a novel, real&#8208;time, and energy&#8208;efficient solution for ice detection and protection systems.

         <title>Porous Elastomer Film with Controlled Liquid&#8208;Metal Distribution for Recyclable Highly Customizable and Stretchable Patterned Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a customizable porous liquid&#8208;metal (LM)/elastomer composite film with controlled LM distribution, overcoming conventional limitations of LM&#8208;based composites (unintended activation of unsintered regions under strain). It can achieve&#160;precise patterning through imprinting, thereby enabling the creation of flexible conductive patterns, which can be used in multifunctional stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Stretchable conductors with conductive patterns are crucial for flexible electronics, which demand high conductivity and stable electrical properties under significant deformations. Liquid&#8208;metal (LM)&#8208;based composites patterned by selective sintering are promising for flexible electronics, however, short&#8208;circuiting may occur due to unintended activation of unsintered regions under strain. Hence, developing highly customizable LM&#8208;based stretchable conductors remains a persistent challenge. Stretchable LM/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) porous films are designed with controlled LM distribution through non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation and surface modification of LM particles, which overcomes the limitations of conventional LM&#8208;based stretchable composites and enables the design of diverse flexible electronics with conductive patterns via imprinting. The porous structure increases spacing between LM particles and alleviates stress on LM particles, ensuring electrical insulation of the unimprinted regions during stretching. The customizable patterning process enables the films to be used for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and stripe patterns allow for dynamic tuning of EMI shielding performance. Additionally, they demonstrate excellent performance in wireless communications, tunable EM wave filters, and stretchable Joule heaters. Moreover, the solubility of TPU makes it easy to recycle LM from the film, thus demonstrating ideal recyclability. Outstanding electrical stability and versatile applications guarantee its significant impact on stretchable electronics.

         <title>Minimizing Solvent&#8208;Coordination in Ether Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes using modified electrolyte exhibit excellent electrochemical performance under extreme operating conditions, and the stable operation of a high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell of 30 Ah and a high&#8208;energy density Li metal pouch cell of 502.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively. The accelerated rate calorimetry results suggest that the modified electrolyte can significantly enhance the safety of lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are considered to be one of the most promising systems for high&#8208;performing lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the poor oxidation stability (&lt;4.5&#160;V) of ether solvents seriously limit their practical applications. Herein, high&#8208;voltage LMBs with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode operated under extreme conditions by minimizing solvent&#8208;coordination in ether electrolytes with fluoroethers, nitrile ethers, and highly fluorinated additives, are demonstrated. It is revealed that ethylene glycol bis(propionitrile) ether (DENE) inhibits the lone&#8208;pair electrons loss on ether oxygen through strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano groups to increase the electrochemical window to &#8805;5&#160;V. Heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFAA) triggers the formation of solid electrolyte interphase rich&#8208;in LiF&#8208;species, ensuring uniform deposition/stripping and high reversibility of Li+. Especially, DENE and HFAA synergistically minimizes the coordination number of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) and hexafluorophosphate (PF6&#8208;), thereby promoting the desolvation process of Li+ and inhibiting the interfacial side reactions. Therefore, the NCM811 cathodes using modified electrolytes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance at ultrahigh voltage (4.7&#160;V), ultrahigh rate (20 C), and ultrawide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 120&#160;&#176;C), and achieve stable operation in a high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell of 30 Ah and a high&#8208;energy density Li metal pouch cell of 502.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Robust Skyrmion Lattice at Room Temperature in van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates formation of robust ordered skyrmion lattices in pre&#8208;annealed 2D Fe3GaTe2 at room temperature via minimal strain. Magnetic force microscopy reveals that the stabilized skyrmion phase endures thousands of cycles of mechanical fatigue (stretching/bending/twisting), maintains stability across broad magnetic field and temperature ranges, and exhibits field&#8208;free stability. These results hold promise for flexible, low&#8208;power spintronic applications. 








Abstract
Manipulating topological magnetic orders of 2D magnets by strain, once achieved, offers enormous potential for future low&#8208;power flexible spintronic applications. In this work, by placing Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnet, on flexible substrate, a field&#8208;free and robust formation of skyrmion lattice induced by strain is demonstrated. By applying a minimal strain of &#8776;0.80% to pre&#8208;annealed FGaT flakes, the Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) tip directly triggers the transition from maze&#8208;like domains to an ordered skyrmion lattice while scanning the sample surface. The skyrmion lattice is rather stable against extensive cyclic mechanical testing (stretching, bending, and twisting over 2000 cycles each). It also exhibits stability across a wide range of magnetic fields (&#8776;2.9 kOe) and temperatures (&#8776;323 K), as well as long&#8208;term retention stability, highlighting its robustness and field&#8208;free stabilization. The strain effect reduces the lattice symmetry and enhances the Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction (DMI) of FGaT, thus stabilizing the skyrmion lattice. The findings highlight the potential of FGaT for integrating magnetic skyrmions into future low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption flexible spintronics devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Domain Wall Motion in Wurtzite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
During polarization switching in AlScN, domain&#8208;wall transverse motion invariably precedes longitudinal motion due to a 98% reduction in energy barriers. By controlling nucleation polarity to promote transverse motion, this work enables low&#8208;field&#8208;driven domain wall motion, reducing&#160;Ec by 25% while maintaining high&#160;Pr and suppressing wake&#8208;up behavior across 6&#8208;inch wafers to advance energy&#8208;efficient wurtzite ferroelectric devices for CMOS integration.








Abstract
Wurtzite&#8208;type nitride ferroelectrics emerge as a breakthrough platform for silicon&#8208;compatible nonvolatile memory technology. However, the inherent polarization reversal mechanisms involving diatomic displacements introduce complex domain dynamics and elevate energy barriers, manifesting as excessive coercive fields (Ec) and pronounced wake&#8208;up effects that hinder reliable device operation. Here, these challenges are resolved by enabling the low&#8208;field&#8208;driven domain wall motion in representative wurtzite ferroelectrics (Al0.75Sc0.25N). In situ transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal that polarization switching proceeds via preferential domain&#8208;wall transverse propagation perpendicular to the [0001] axis, preceding longitudinal propagation along the [0001] axis. First&#8208;principles simulations quantify a striking 98% reduction in energy barrier for transverse migration (0.00188&#160;eV&#160;f.u&#8722;1). Compared to longitudinal motion (0.092&#160;eV&#160;f.u&#8722;1). This switching kinetic fundamentally challenges the conventional Kolmogorov&#8208;Avrami&#8208;Ishibashi model. By controlling nucleation polarity to promote the transverse motion of the domain wall, Ec is reduced by 25%, with a high remanent polarization maintained and wake&#8208;up effects eliminated across 6&#8208;inch films. The methodology establishes a universal design principle for manipulating polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectrics, paving the way for integrated low&#8208;energy, high&#8208;stability, uniformly&#8208;performing ferroelectric devices in large&#8208;scale complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)&#160;architectures.

         <title>Deciphering the Species&#8208;Dependent Polysulfide Corrosion on Lithium Anode Toward Durable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The corrosion of Li metal anode by different lithium polysulfide species is systematically revealed. Higher corrosion rate, more uniform Li deposition, and more durable Li anode cycling are achieved in low&#8208;order lithium polysulfides. A lithium polysulfide selection strategy is proposed to selectively inhibit the corrosion of high&#8208;order lithium polysulfides and prolong the cumulative capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) violently corrode Li metal anodes, inducing rapid capacity decay and poor cycling lifespan of Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, the corrosion of different LiPS species on the Li metal anode is systematically investigated. The corrosion rate of Li metal anode by Li2S8 and Li2S6 is higher than Li2S4. The discrepancy in corrosion rate is attributed to the continuous reaction between the LiPSs and Li metal, while the corrosion can hardly be prohibited by the LiPS&#8208;generated solid electrolyte interphase. Smaller Li nuclei size, more uniform Li deposition, and more durable cycling of Li metal anodes are found in Li2S4 electrolyte in comparison with Li2S8 and Li2S6 electrolytes. Consequently, a LiPS selection strategy is proposed to selectively inhibit the corrosion of high&#8208;order LiPSs and successfully prolong the cumulative capacity by 31% in Li&#8211;S batteries. This work clarifies the fundamentals of Li metal anode corrosion by different LiPS species and highlights the rational selection of favorable LiPS species for promoting the cycling durability of Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Tribovoltaic Effect at Liquid&#8211;MoS2 Interfaces and Spectral Analysis of Interfacial Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the spectral features of molybdenum disulfide are used as a probing tool, providing experimental evidence for charge transfer at the liquid&#8211;solid interface, thereby validating the working mechanism of the tribovoltaic effect.








Abstract
Liquid&#8211;solid triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offer a viable approach for harvesting water energy to power Internet of Things systems. Semiconductor&#8208;based TENGs leveraging the tribovoltaic effect have recently emerged as a focus of research. In this paper, monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML&#8208;MoS2) is introduced as a contacting material for fabricating direct current (DC) liquid&#8211;solid nanogenerators. At the internal liquid&#8211;solid interface, electron transfer is strongly evidenced by Raman and photoluminescence spectra. For the external characteristics, macroscopic DC outputs are assessed under various conditions, with a maximum current density of 11.1 mA m&#8722;2. Correlating external output patterns with interfacial charge dynamics, a complete working mechanism of the liquid&#8211;solid tribovoltaic effect is better elucidated. This work advances innovative strategies for water energy harvesting, deepening fundamental insights into liquid&#8211;solid interactions and the tribovoltaic effect.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolving Discovery of Carrier Biomaterials with Ultra&#8208;Low Nonspecific Protein Adsorption for Single Cell Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;evolving discovery integrating automation and AI is developed to address the high&#8208;dimensional&#8208;parameter&#8208;space challenge in carrier biomaterials. The discovered biomaterials showed ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption, achieving a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold reduction in experiment workload; and they are further fabricated into microfluidic&#8208;used carriers for protein&#8208;analysis applications, showing a 9&#8208;fold enhancement in detection sensitivity. This study has potential for applications in single&#8208;cell analysis.








Abstract
Carrier biomaterials used in single&#8208;cell analysis face a bottleneck in protein detection sensitivity, primarily attributed to elevated false positives caused by nonspecific protein adsorption. Toward carrier biomaterials with ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption, a self&#8208;evolving discovery is developed to address the challenge of high&#8208;dimensional parameter spaces. Automation across nine self&#8208;developed or modified workstations is integrated to achieve a &#8220;can&#8208;do&#8221; capability, and develop a synergy&#8208;enhanced Bayesian optimization algorithm as the artificial intelligence brain to enable a &#8220;can&#8208;think&#8221; capability for small&#8208;data problems inherent to time&#8208;consuming biological experiments, thereby establishing a self&#8208;evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials. Through this approach, carrier biomaterials with an ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption index of 0.2537 are successfully discovered, representing an over 80% decrease, while achieving a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold reduction in experiment workload. Furthermore, the discovered biomaterials are fabricated into microfluidic&#8208;used carriers for protein&#8208;analysis applications, showing a 9&#8208;fold enhancement in detection sensitivity compared to conventional carriers. This is the very demonstration of a self&#8208;evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials, paving the way for advancements in single&#8208;cell protein analysis and further its integration with genomics and transcriptomics.

         <title>Localized Spin Textures Stabilized by Geometry&#8208;Induced Strain in 2D Magnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering in 2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe&#8323;GeTe&#8322; is studied using scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy. Spatially varying strain from micropillar arrays induced local 10 K Curie temperature increases, stabilizing magnetic domains including skyrmions and skyrmion bags near pillar corners. This strain&#8208;control of topological spin textures offers new avenues for spintronic technologies.








Abstract
Strain engineering promises to enable manipulation and control of the properties of exfoliated flakes of 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, while previous studies of strain effects have focused on global properties, the impact on local magnetic spin textures remains unexplored. Here, manipulation of magnetism in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) is demonstrated using geometry&#8208;induced strain. Employing scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM), the effects of spatially varying strain profiles on the magnetic order of FGT sheets stamped onto micropillar arrays are directly visualized. It is found that the in&#8208;plane strain components, with magnitudes &lt;0.5%, locally elevate the Curie temperature of FGT by 10 K, stabilizing magnetic domains near the pillar corners. These domains include skyrmions and higher&#8208;order topological spin textures such as skyrmioniums and skyrmion bags. The possibility to locally seed and control topological spin textures via strain opens new avenues for future spin&#8208;based information technologies.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Single&#8208;Step Approach for the Controlled Synthesis of Multifunctional Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile one&#8208;pot strategy combines bipolar electrochemistry and the water&#8208;organic interface to synthesize in a single&#8208;step complex patchy particles, which cannot be achieved by any other deposition process. Under the influence of an electric field, microparticles undergo selective surface modification via coupled redox reactions, enabling simultaneous deposition of several materials, resulting in distinct patches with different chemical features.








Abstract
Multicomponent patchy particles offer unique opportunities for diverse applications, yet their controlled synthesis remains challenging. Here a strategy is presented that allows generating complex microparticles, having distinct patches of different chemical composition, by using a one&#8208;pot and single&#8208;step approach. The concept is based on the synergetic combination of bipolar electrochemistry and a water/organic (w/o) interface as the reaction space. Positioning conducting microspheres at the w/o interface allows for targeted surface modification with multiple components. Under the influence of an applied electric field, oriented parallel to the interface, simultaneous redox reactions in both phases lead to the selective deposition of up to four different materials at opposite faces of the particles. This very versatile approach can also be extended beyond spherical particles for the controlled modification of 2D materials. The simplicity of the method and the inherent precise control over multiple functional components allows for the design of advanced multicomponent patchy particles, which cannot be obtained by any other deposition process.

&lt;p&gt;A versatile one-pot strategy combines bipolar electrochemistry and the water-organic interface to synthesize in a single-step complex patchy particles, which cannot be achieved by any other deposition process. Under the influence of an electric field, microparticles undergo selective surface modification via coupled redox reactions, enabling simultaneous deposition of several materials, resulting in distinct patches with different chemical features.

         <title>Biomimetic Engineering of Robust Gradient Antibacterial Coatings using Hollow Nanoframes of Prussian Blue Analogues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial reef&#8208;like manganese&#8208;doped Prussian blue analogue (PBMn) is designed as a biomimetic cross&#8208;linker to enhance the mechanical robustness of the phytic acid&#8208;cationic polymer (PC) network. This approach enables the efficient deposition of PC&#8208;PBM on diverse material surfaces and complex geometries, facilitating the fabrication of gradient coating with optimized antibacterial performance while minimizing heat generation.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy for bacterial infections poses a significant challenge due to the high temperatures required for effective bacterial eradication, which can also harm surrounding healthy tissues. Determining the minimal effective temperature for bacterial destruction is therefore critical. In this study, artificial reef&#8208;like manganese&#8208;doped Prussian blue (PBMn) nanoframes are developed as photothermal agents and physical cross&#8208;linkers to reinforce a phytic acid and cationic polymer network coating. This innovative deposition approach facilitates the creation of a gradient PBMn&#8208;enhanced phytic acid&#8208;cationic polymer (PC&#8208;PBM) coating, achieving a balance between effective photothermal antibacterial activity and reduced heat&#8208;induced collateral damage. When applied to a polyurethane (PU) substrate, the gradient PC&#8208;PBM coating exhibits excellent photothermal efficiency, biocompatibility, and tunable antibacterial activity. Gene transcriptomics analysis demonstrates significant downregulation of virulence genes and biofilm&#8208;forming genes in pathogens following PC&#8208;PBM treatment, confirming the antibacterial efficacy of the coating. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations, including studies in an infected hernia model, underscore the coating's excellent anti&#8208;infection performance. This work introduces a robust and biomimetic strategy for constructing gradient coating, advancing photothermal therapy by achieving effective bacterial eradication with reducing collateral damage to healthy tissues.

         <title>Chemical Exchange Between Silica Networks and Liquid Metals for All&#8208;Inorganic, Sintering&#8208;Free and Highly Conductive Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the unique chemical exchange between silica hydroxyl groups and liquid metal (LM) surfaces, this work reports a whole&#8208;inorganic LM&#8208;silica gel ink (LMSG) with high electrical conductivity, excellent thermal stability, high&#160;flexibility, and surface compatibility. Highly flexible and complicated integrated circuits are successfully fabricated by the LMSG inks. 








Abstract
Electrically conductive inks with noble metals (e.g. silver particles) and inorganic carriers (e.g. glass powder) are broadly applied in the electronics&#160;industry. However, such inorganic inks are generally not compatible with highly flexible electronics due to the inherent rigidity and poor surface compatibility. Based on the unique chemical exchange between silica hydroxyl groups and liquid metal surfaces, this work reports a wholeinorganic LM&#8211;silica gel ink (LMSG) with high electrical conductivity, excellent thermal stability, high flexibility, and surface compatibility. The conductive percolation threshold of the LMSG inks is only 43 wt.%, which is the lowest among reported LM composites so far. Interestingly, inorganic LMSG inks do not require any sintering procedure for conductive paths, removing serious constraints over traditional LM inks. In addition, LMSG inks can be prepared in bulk as powders for long&#8208;term storage (&gt;1 year) by simple dehydration, and more importantly, the dehydrated powders can conveniently regenerate LMSG inks via re&#8208;dissolution. The circuits fabricated from LMSG inks show much improved thermal stability (&gt;300&#160;&#176;C) compared with conventional LM inks (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C). LMSG ink exhibits wide surface compatibility with plastics, wood, skin, etc. Highly flexible and complicated integrated circuits with microcontroller units (MCUs) can be successfully fabricated.

         <title>Unveiling Energy Loss Mechanisms to Empower Ternary Organic Solar Cells with over 20% Efficiency: A Systematic Oligomeric Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designs modular oligomeric donors (5BDD, 5BDD&#8208;F, 5BDT&#8208;F, 5BDT&#8208;Cl) for ternary OSCs, achieving PCEs &gt;20%. By systematically tuning energy levels, we reveal material compatibility, not HOMO alignment, drive VOC enhancement, suppress ACQ and reduce energy loss, offering new design principles for high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.








Abstract
In organic solar cells (OSCs), the ternary strategy is a mainstream approach to obtaining highly efficient OSCs. A deeper understanding of working mechanisms and the material selection criteria for boosting open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) is essential for further OSC breakthrough. Through a modular design principle, a series of oligomeric donors &#8211; 5BDD, 5BDD&#8208;F, 5BDT&#8208;F, and 5BDT&#8208;Cl &#8211; with similar molecular configurations but varying HOMO levels is systematically designed. These findings reveal that the HOMO levels of these oligomers have a negligible impact on the VOC of the ternary OSCs. Instead, their excellent compatibility with acceptors played a pivotal role in enhancing VOC. The oligomers effectively suppressed excessive acceptor aggregation and achieved Aggregation&#8208;Caused Quenching Suppression (ACQS), strengthening the external electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination energy losses. Simultaneously, oligomers fine&#8208;tuned and optimized the morphology of the blend films, leading to a higher fill factor (FF) and improved performance. Notably, the 5BDT&#8208;F&#8208; and 5BDT&#8208;Cl&#8208;based ternary OSCs achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.8% and 20.1% (certified 19.76%), with FFs of 80.9% and 80.7%, respectively. This work elucidates the unusual role of the third component energy levels on the VOC in ternary OSCs and offers valuable guidance for future OSC design.

         <title>All&#8208;Polymer Polyethylene&#8208;Hydrogel Felt for Efficient Evaporative Cooling and Ecological Restoration in Photovoltaic Power Plants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an all&#8208;polymer polyethylene&#8208;hydrogel felt formed by fibers with highly oriented polyethylene micro&#8208;fiber cores and polyacrylamide shells. The felt demonstrates a passive heat transfer coefficient as high as 1100 W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1 for evaporative cooling of photovoltaic cells and shows an ability to reduce ambient temperature and increase humidity for ecological restoration.








Abstract
With the explosive growth of photovoltaic (PV) power station, the energy efficiency and ecological impact of which have emerged as two important points of great concern. In this work, an approach is proposed to cool solar panels and facilitate ecological restoration by engineering moisture cycle in PV plants with an all&#8208;polymer hydroscopic felt. Formed by fibers with highly oriented polyethylene (PE) micro&#8208;fiber cores and polyacrylamide (PAAm) shells of a few microns in thickness, the felt is ultra&#8208;light, anti&#8208;corrosive, and demonstrates a high passive heat transfer coefficient of 1100&#160;W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1. Under the solar light of one sun, the felt reduces the temperature of solar cells by 28&#160;&#176;C, and increases the output power by 20.4%. Moreover, the felt regenerates to the original state in only 1.3 times the evaporation time. In addition, due to the high evaporation and moisture absorption rate, the PE/hydrogel felt exhibits the ability to raise the ambient humidity in photovoltaic plants by 24% and lower the ambient temperature by 2.6&#160;&#176;C, which significantly promotes the survival rate of surrounding flora. These results show the ability of the all&#8208;polymer hydroscopic felt in promoting energy efficiency of PV conversion and offers the potential to augment ecological restoration using PV plants.

Under the solar light of one sun, the felt reduces the temperature of solar cells by 28&#160;&#176;C, and increases the output power by 20.4%. Moreover, the felt regenerates to the original state in only 1.3 times the evaporation time. In addition, due to the high evaporation and moisture absorption rate, the PE/hydrogel felt exhibits the ability to raise the ambient humidity in photovoltaic plants by 24% and lower the ambient temperature by 2.6&#160;&#176;C, which significantly promotes the survival rate of surrounding flora. These results show the ability of the all-polymer hydroscopic felt in promoting energy efficiency of PV conversion and offers the potential to augment ecological restoration using PV plants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrospun Lignin/ZnO Nanofibrous Membranes for Self&#8208;Powered Ultrasensitive Flexible Airflow Sensor and Wearable Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the novel sensing applications of water evaporation&#8208;induced power generation, by using lignin/ZnO nanofibrous membranes for sensing airflow through output voltage variation. Obtained lignin/ZnO airflow sensors are self&#8208;powered, precise, and quick&#8208;responding, and can be used as wearable devices for breath monitor, surrounding movement sensor, and sweat monitor.








Abstract
The interest and demand for flexible sensors and wearable devices are rapidly growing. The added benefit of electricity generation, enabling gas sensors to be self&#8208;powered, increases the applicability of these devices for flexible and wearable airflow sensors. Inspired by water evaporation&#8208;induced power generation, this study explores its potential in sensing applications, which has not yet been explored in detail. Electrospinning technology is used to prepare superhydrophilic lignin/ZnO nanofibrous membranes with a ZnO nanoparticle layer, capable of generating at least 100&#160;mV (which allows it to power its own signal transduction). The membrane is highly sensitive to variations in airflow, enabling its use as an ultrasensitive and flexible airflow sensor. This sensor demonstrates exceptional performance, including a fast response time (0.65 s), broad detection range (with lower detection limit down to 0.25 and upper detection limit of 3&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1), and extremely high airflow velocity detection accuracy. Beyond these, it can serve as a wearable sensor for sweat monitoring, motion detection, and breath monitoring (to accurately detect breathing rate, intensity and variations in speech). Such self&#8208;powered, ultrasensitive, and flexible lignin/ZnO airflow sensors provide novel potential to advance the development of smart textiles and wearable electronics.

         <title>Covalent Surface Modification of Hydrophobic Alkoxides on Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanosheets Toward Amphiphilic and Electrically Conductive Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically conductive and amphiphilic MXene inks are achieved by surface modification of sodium alkoxides, where surface&#8208;modified MXenes are dispersible both in water and in non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene. Alkoxide&#8208;functionalized MXenes also show enhanced environmental stability compared to pristine MXene, leading to higher electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties under oxidative conditions.








Abstract
MXenes have garnered significant interest for use in conductive inks, processed either in aqueous solutions or organic solvents following surface modification. However, maintaining their electrical conductivity during dispersion across a broad range of solvents, particularly non&#8208;polar ones, has proven challenging, limiting their potential applications as conductive dispersions. Here, a straightforward method is presented for synthesizing electrically conductive and amphiphilic MXenes via surface modification. Alkoxide groups, such as ethoxide and phenoxide, are covalently attached to Ti3C2Tx MXene surfaces using a nucleophilic substitution mechanism, enabling stable dispersion in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. These alkoxide&#8208;functionalized MXenes exhibited an electrical conductivity of up to 2,700 S cm&#8722;1 and dispersibility in non&#8208;polar solvents like toluene, surpassing previous modification approaches. Additionally, they demonstrate enhanced oxidative stability and excellent coating performance on substrates with varied surface energies. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding films fabricated with these MXenes exhibited some of the highest performance among surface&#8208;modified MXenes and their composites, achieving shielding efficiency comparable to that of pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene films, while offering significantly improved durability. These findings may contribute to the development of improved processing approaches for MXenes, paving the way for advancements in printable and wearable electronics while addressing key challenges in MXene processing and modification.

         <title>Deep Eutectic Solvents Formed by Complex Hydrides: A New Class of Hydrogen&#8208;Rich Liquid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discovers a new type of deep eutectic solvent composed of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) and tetrabutylammonium borohydride (TBABH). The new liquids possess a hydrogen content higher than 5 wt%, thus representing promising high&#8208;energy liquid hydrogen carriers. The strong hydrogen bonding between AB and TBABH explains the depletion of the melting point, with the eutectic point sitting at a molar ratio of 1&#8211;2 TBABH&#8208;AB.








Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are novel mixtures that exhibit a significant depression in melting points compared to their individual components. This work finds that combining tetrabutylammonium borohydride (TBABH) with ammonia borane (AB) yields new, stable, hydrogen&#8208;rich liquids under ambient conditions, with a glass transition as low as &#8722;50 &#176;C. Liquid mixtures containing up to 6.9 wt% hydrogen can be easily obtained through physical grinding. The strong interaction between the BH4&#8722; anion of TBABH and AB coupled with the vibration dynamics of the alkyl chains accounts for the sharp decrease in melting point. The eutectic point is identified at a TBABH&#8208;AB molar ratio of 1&#8211;2. Increasing the AB ratio further reduces the glass transition temperature but also induces a cold crystallization phenomenon. These mixtures can release hydrogen at temperatures as low as 60 &#176;C, making them promising candidates for hydrogen storage. This represents the first example of a hydride&#8208;based DES, advancing research on complex hydrides and opening the door to the discovery of new hydrogen&#8208;rich liquids for various applications.

         <title>Van der Waals Welding of Carbon Nanotubes with Near&#8208;Limit High Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The welding of CNTs for the first time by a fast chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition self&#8208;assembly (FCVDS) technique using TiO2 nanoparticles as the solder is reported. It is simple, fast, pressure&#8208;free, and applicable to ambient conditions. The welded junctions have the highest strength realized in nanowelding field so far, to the best of the knowledge.








Abstract
The strength of carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles and fibers is generally much lower than that of single CNTs, the short length of CNT components results in the assembly strength can only be contributed by the weak shearing interaction between CNTs. Here, the welding of CNTs by a fast chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition self&#8208;assembly (FCVDS) technique using TiO2 nanoparticles as the solder is reported. It is simple, fast, pressure&#8208;free, applicable to ambient conditions, and can weld samples with macroscale length. The welded junctions have a mechanical strength approaching the tensile strength of a single CNT. Whereas the interface interaction between TiO2 and CNTs is only contributed by Van der Waals forces, avoiding the destruction of the defect&#8208;free structure of CNTs. The solder mass can be only &#8776;1&#160;wt% of welded CNTs.

         <title>Coexisting Non&#8208;Trivial Van der Waals Magnetic Orders Enable Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Magnetization Dynamics</title>

         <dc:description>
The coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders in van der Waals magnet above room temperature, inducing an intrinsic exchange bias and canted perpendicular magnetism is discovered. Such non&#8208;trivial intrinsic magnetic order enables the realization of energy&#8208;efficient and magnetic field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque memory devices.








Abstract
The discovery of van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials exhibiting non&#8208;trivial and tunable magnetic interactions can lead to exotic magnetic states that are not readily attainable with conventional materials. Such vdW magnets can provide a unique platform for studying new magnetic phenomena and realizing magnetization dynamics for energy&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;volatile spintronic memory and computing technologies. Here, the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders in vdW magnet (Co0.5Fe0.5)5&#8208;xGeTe2 (CFGT) above room temperature, inducing an intrinsic exchange bias and canted perpendicular magnetism is discovered. Such non&#8208;trivial intrinsic magnetic order enables to realize energy&#8208;efficient, magnetic field&#8208;free, and deterministic spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching of CFGT in heterostructure with Pt. These experiments, in conjunction with density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrate the coexistence of non&#8208;trivial magnetic orders in CFGT, which enables field&#8208;free SOT magnetization dynamics in spintronic devices.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Directed Growth of Tin Perovskite for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Tin perovskites suffer from uncontrolled crystallization, leading to high defect density and poor LED performance. A substrate modification strategy is introduced to regulate interfacial nucleation rates and growth directions, effectively reducing defect density and improving film quality. This approach boosts photoluminescence quantum efficiency to &#8776;41% and achieves a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 12.8% for tin perovskite NIR LEDs.








Abstract
Controlling the crystallization dynamics of solution&#8208;processed tin perovskites remains pivotal yet challenging for achieving high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free optoelectronic devices. Herein, it is demonstrated that substrate&#8208;regulated interfacial nucleation governs crystal growth orientation and film quality of tin perovskites. The results show that pristine PEDOT:PSS substrates induce bottom&#8208;interface&#8208;dominated nucleation via strong PEDOT+&#8208;[SnI3]nn&#8722; interactions, driving rapid upward crystallization of tin perovskites and yielding rough films with low photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE: &#8776;26%). Strategic substrate modification with potassium citrate (PC) weakens the PEDOT+&#8208;[SnI3]nn&#8722; interactions, thereby redirecting nucleation initiation to the top interface during solvent evaporation. This results in controlled downward crystallization of tin perovskites, forming smooth films with improved crystallinity and superior optoelectronic properties (PLQE: &#8776;41%). The optimized tin perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) achieve record&#8208;breaking performance with an external quantum efficiency of 12.8% and a maximum radiance of 190&#160;W&#160;sr&#8722;1&#160;m&#8722;2, which is the highest performance reported for tin perovskite near&#8208;infrared LEDs to date. This work demonstrates interface&#8208;directed crystallization control as an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance tin perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Interfacial Water on Ag/Ag2S Nanowires Enhancing the Ethanol Selectivity for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurization optimizes the interfacial water structures on Ag/Ag2S nanowires during CO2 electroreduction, converting CO2 electroreduction selectivity from CO to ethanol with ethanol Faradic efficiency of (FE) 75%. Operando electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC&#8208;SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identifies interfacial water structures and intermediates including *CH2CHO and *CO, which facilitate ethanol formation. These findings reveal how interfacial water structure optimization via sulfurization enhances ethanol selectivity.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon products represents a pivotal yet challenging target, particularly for metal catalysts that predominantly yield C1 products. Herein, this challenge is addressed through sulfur&#8208;induced electronic modulation of Ag&#8208;based catalysts, steering the CO2 reduction pathway toward ethanol production. By constructing atomically engineered Ag/Ag2S nanowires (NWs) via a controlled sulfurization strategy, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 75% for ethanol at &#8722;0.95&#160;V, along with exceptional stability over 14 h of high&#8208;performance metrics surpassing most reported Ag&#8208;based systems is achieved. Operando electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy&#160;(EC&#8208;SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the Ag/Ag2S heterointerface synergistically regulates interfacial water networks and stabilizes key *CO intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, and asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling. Furthermore, sulfurization&#8208;induced dual effects&#8208;optimized hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions and enriched K&#8314; confinement are identified as critical drivers for tailoring the local microenvironment to favor ethanol selectivity. This work not only demonstrates a rational atomic interface design for C2 product orientation but also deciphers the dynamic interplay between catalyst electronic structure and interfacial species, offering a molecular&#8208;level roadmap for advanced CO2 conversion systems.

         <title>Efficient Blue Perovskite LEDs via Bottom&#8208;Up Charge Manipulation for Solution&#8208;Processed Active&#8208;Matrix Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up collaborative charge manipulation strategy is developed to minimize the interfacial charge loss in blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, leading to stable blue electroluminescence and an external quantum efficiency of 25.87%. Solution&#8208;processed active&#8208;matrix display with clear and uniform patterning is achieved by integrating with thin&#8208;film transistor circuits.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are emerging as strong candidates for next&#8208;generation displays due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, solution processability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the development of highly efficient blue PeLEDs remains a significant challenge. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is introduced for precise charge manipulation in blue perovskites to enhance radiative recombination efficiency. By employing 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene as an inserted hole transport layer, improved hole injection efficiency is achieved while effectively suppressing reverse electron transport and exciton quenching. Additionally, a fluorinated ester additive is incorporated to control perovskite crystallization, facilitating the formation of well&#8208;aligned reduced&#8208;dimensional phases to reduce nonradiative recombination losses. The resulting blue PeLEDs exhibit a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 25.87%, the highest reported for one&#8208;step&#8208;prepared blue perovskite films. Furthermore, integration with thin&#8208;film transistor circuits enables solution&#8208;processed active&#8208;matrix perovskite displays with sharp and uniform patterning. This work provides a comprehensive pathway for advancing blue PeLEDs toward high&#8208;performance display applications.

         <title>Dielectric&#8208;Free MoS2/VO2 Junction Field&#8208;Effect Transistor with Sensitive and Ultrafast Photoresponse for Light Encrypted Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dielectric&#8208;free MoS2/VO2 junction field&#8208;effect transistor (JFET) that achieves both high sensitivity and rapid photoresponse is presented. By leveraging the built&#8208;in electric field at the van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction modulated by the phase transition of VO2, the JFET demonstrates stable operation over a wide temperature range. Light encoders are successfully developed to realize low&#8208;power encrypted communications.








Abstract
The rise of the Internet of Things and mobile devices has created a pressing demand for advanced on&#8208;chip photodetection platforms. Two&#8208;dimensional materials have emerged as promising photodetector candidates owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties. However, simultaneously achieving high responsivity, low noise, and quick photoresponse remains challenging for 2D material phototransistors. This study introduces a hybrid MoS2/VO2 junction field&#8208;effect transistor (JFET) designed to address this sensitivity&#8208;speed tradeoff. By leveraging the van der Waals (vdW) interface and adjustable depletion region via the VO2 gate, the JFET achieves a minimal subthreshold swing (80 mVdec&#8722;1) and little gate hysteresis (10 mV). Furthermore, the promoted carrier transport enables a sensitive photoresponse (responsivity: 103 AW&#8722;1, specific detectivity: 1012 Jones) and fast response speed (rise/decay time: 8/10 &#181;s). The device exhibits self&#8208;powered photodetection at elevated temperature, a rare occurrence for phototransistors with ohmic contact, attributed to enhanced built&#8208;in electric field at asymmetric vdW heterojunction. The JFET's effective gate controllability and sensitive photoresponse make it suitable as a low&#8208;power light encoder for encrypted communication. This work provides the foundation for integrated optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials and heterostructures.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Synapses Based on a Mechanoluminescent Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents all&#8208;optical synapses utilizing a mechanoluminescent material&#8212;Li0.1Na0.9NbO3:Pr3+ (LNN:Pr3+)&#8212;&#160;to emulate biological synapses with homologous and heterologous synaptic behaviors through optical signal processing. The engineered trap depth distribution&#160;of LNN:Pr3+ enables multi&#8208;stimuli response to UV light, mechanical force, and thermal input, replicating diverse synaptic functionalities. Hardware&#8208;level denoising and multimode&#8208;fused perception are implemented for spatiotemporal feature extraction in dynamic environments.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing systems hold promises to overcome the inefficiencies of conventional von Neumann architecture, which are constrained by data transfer bottlenecks. However, conventional electrically modulated synapses face inherent limitations such as limited switching speed, elevated power consumption, and substantial interconnection loss. Optical signaling offers a transformative alternative, leveraging ultrafast transmission, high bandwidth, and minimal crosstalk. Here, an all&#8208;optical synapse based on a mechanoluminescent material of Li0.1Na0.9NbO3:Pr3+ (LNN:Pr3+) is presented, which emulates biological synapses, including homologous and heterologous synaptic behaviors, through optical signal processing. The engineered trap depth distribution of LNN:Pr3+ enables multi&#8208;stimuli response to UV light, mechanical force, and thermal input, replicating diverse synaptic functionalities such as short&#8208;term potentiation (STP), long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP), paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF), and learning&#8208;experience behavioral adaptation. Furthermore, its utility is showcased in hardware&#8208;level denoising and multimode&#8208;fused perception, achieving spatiotemporal feature extraction in dynamic environments. This work not only sheds light into designing fully optical synapses but also bridges mechanoluminescence (ML) with neuromorphic engineering, advancing energy&#8208;efficient, light&#8208;driven artificial intelligence technologies.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Recoverable Closed&#8208;Loop Neuroprosthetic System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing and stretchable bilayer (SSB) electrode with spontaneous performance recovery consists of a nanomembrane (closely packed aligned Pt&#8208;coated Ag nanowires embedded in the self&#8208;healing polymer) and a nanocomposite (Pt&#8208;coated Ag flakes in the self&#8208;healing polymer). The SSB electrodes are used for wearable artificial mechanoreceptors and implantable peripheral neural interfaces in a closed&#8208;loop performance&#8208;recoverable neuroprosthetic system supported by a machine learning technique.








Abstract
Soft bioelectronics mechanically comparable to living tissues have driven advances in closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthetic systems for the recovery of sensory&#8208;motor functions. Despite notable progress in this field, critical challenges persist in achieving long&#8208;term stable closed&#8208;loop neuroprostheses, particularly in preventing uncontrolled drift in the electrical sensitivity and/or charge injection performance owing to material fatigue or mechanical damage. Additionally, the absence of an intelligent feedback loop has limited the ability to fully compensate for sensory&#8208;motor function loss in nervous systems. Here, a novel class of soft, closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthetic systems is presented for long&#8208;term operation, enabled by spontaneous performance recovery and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven correction to address the material fatigue inherent in chronic wear or implantation environments. Central to this innovation is the development of a tough, self&#8208;healing, and stretchable bilayer material with high conductivity and exceptional cyclic durability employed for robot&#8208;interface touch sensors and peripheral&#8208;nerve&#8208;adaptive electrodes. Furthermore, two central processing units, integrated in a prosthetic robot and an artificial brain, support closed&#8208;loop artificial sensory&#8208;motor operations, ensuring accurate sensing, decision&#8208;making, and feedback stimulation processes. Through these characteristics and seamless integration, our performance&#8208;recoverable closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthesis addresses challenges associated with chronic&#8208;material&#8208;fatigue&#8208;induced malfunctions, as demonstrated by successful in vivo under 4 weeks of implantation and/or mechanical damage.

         <title>Driving Multifunctional Nanomedicine Design for Non&#8208;Inflammatory Tumor Therapy with Integrated Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computation&#8208;guided strategy for non&#8208;inflammatory photothermal therapy is developed, leveraging machine learning to identify RuO2 as the optimal photothermal agent with anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Through an integrated approach, the mechanisms are elucidated using density functional theory calculations. This dual&#8208;methodology framework allows for a deeper understanding of the photothermal and anti&#8208;inflammatory performance.








Abstract
Due to the promotive role of inflammation in tumor progression, designing multifunctional nanomedicines that synergistically combine anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties emerges as a promising approach to enhance cancer treatment. However, identifying optimal nano&#8208;agents from a vast pool of candidates using traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and lacking in systematic guidance. In this study, this challenge is addressed by integrating photothermal therapy for tumor ablation with catalase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes for inflammation mitigation as a model system to explore non&#8208;inflammatory tumor treatment strategies. Using interpretable machine learning techniques, experimental data are systematically analyzed to elucidate the relationships between nanomaterial features and functional properties, enabling the precise identification of photothermal agents with robust anti&#8208;inflammatory synergistic effects. Through this framework, ruthenium oxide nanoparticles (RuO2 NPs) are identified as a highly efficient multifunctional candidate. The catalytic properties of RuO2 NPs are further validated and rationalized through density functional theory calculations. Experimental investigations confirm the remarkable performance of RuO2 NPs, demonstrating their ability to achieve efficient photothermal tumor ablation at NIR&#8208;II biowindow and simultaneously mitigate inflammation by promoting a favorable immune microenvironment. This work highlights the transformative potential of machine learning&#8208;driven approaches in the rational design and accelerated discovery of multifunctional nanomaterials.

         <title>Scalable Jet Swimmer Driven by Pulsatile Artificial Muscles&#160;and Soft Chamber Buckling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nautiluses, a scalable robotic jet swimmer is developed, featuring a soft chamber that buckles instantly to amplify jetting speed. It demonstrates the successful integration of smart materials and smart structures in a robotic system, offering a promising pathway for developing efficient, adaptable, and intelligent underwater soft robots.








Abstract
Cephalopods, such as squid and nautilus, achieve fast swimming by jetting water swiftly from their chambers, offering benefits in swimming speed, energy efficiency, and silent operation. Inspired by these animals, a scalable soft robotic jet swimmer that utilizes soft chamber buckling to enable rapid water jetting is proposed. The design incorporates three main components: the knotted artificial muscle (KAM), an origami&#8208;inspired soft chamber, and a custom control module.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by nautiluses, a scalable robotic jet swimmer is developed, featuring a soft chamber that buckles instantly to amplify jetting speed. It demonstrates the successful integration of smart materials and smart structures in a robotic system, offering a promising pathway for developing efficient, adaptable, and intelligent underwater soft robots.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalopods, such as squid and nautilus, achieve fast swimming by jetting water swiftly from their chambers, offering benefits in swimming speed, energy efficiency, and silent operation. Inspired by these animals, a scalable soft robotic jet swimmer that utilizes soft chamber buckling to enable rapid water jetting is proposed. The design incorporates three main components: the knotted artificial muscle (KAM), an origami-inspired soft chamber, and a custom control module. The KAM generates significant force and stroke with minimal self-weight, but its actuation speed is insufficient for propelling water. To address this limit, an origami-inspired soft chamber that buckles instantly when the KAM's pulling force reaches a critical threshold is designed, thereby amplifying actuation speed and enabling rapid water jetting. The control module periodically activates the KAM to tighten and release, facilitating effective pulsatile propulsion. Similar to Cephalopods, this design is scalable and robust. Effective swimming of two robots is demonstrated with drastically different sizes, achieving a top speed of 0.62 body length per second. We also show that the propulsion is minimally compromised even when the KAM is significantly damaged. To further enable guided locomotion, a shape memory alloy rudder is incorporated for steering via infrared stimulation. This work demonstrates successful pulsatile jet swimming through the integration of smart materials and smart structures, laying the groundwork for future innovations in underwater soft&#160;robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reticular Photoelectrochemical Transistor with Biochemical Metaplasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the ambipolar behavior of a metal&#8211;organic framework channel gated by a photosensitive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework electrode, a reticular photoelectrochemical transistor is proposed and constructed. The device enables the biochemically modulated positive/negative photoconductivity and the aqueous metaplasticity with typical nonmonotonic enhanced depression effect region and the threshold sliding, which are explored for image recognition.








Abstract
Close imitation of synaptic metaplasticity is an important objective in the neuromorphic domain. Progress has been made in solid&#8208;state electronics with high&#8208;voltage dynamics, which, nevertheless, marks a significant inconsistency with the biological systems in aqueous media. Here, the concept of reticular photoelectrochemical transistor (RPECT) is proposed and devised that can realize metaplasticity with biochemical modulation. Based on the ambipolar behavior of a metal&#8211;organic framework channel gated by a photosensitive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework electrode, biochemically modulated positive/negative photoconductivity and metaplasticity with the typical features, e.g., the nonmonotonic enhanced depression effect region and the threshold sliding are achieved. Taking advantage of such unique properties, in&#8208;sensor preprocessing and in&#8208;memory computing are further implemented for efficient image recognition. This work realizes the aqueous metaplasticity by a new device of RPECT, which also introduces the biochemical modulation into image recognition, providing a perspective for future development of machine vision processing.

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Activatable Nanoscavengers for Sustainable Cell&#8208;Free DNA Capture and Cleavage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inflammation&#8208;activatable nanoscavenger is constructed from dendrimer&#8208;templated, charge/conformation&#8208;transformable polypeptides to mediate cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) scavenging and inflammatory bowel disease treatment. Inside the inflamed intestine, the polypeptides transform from negatively charged random coils into positively charged &#945;&#8208;helices, which enables&#160;sustained cfDNA scavenging via cfDNA capture &#160;&#160;followed by Cyclen&#8208;Zn&#8208;mediated&#160;cfDNA cleavage. Thus, the nanoscavenger effectively attenuates inflammation and restores immune homeostasis.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) scavenging using cationic materials represents a promising therapeutic modality for autoimmune diseases (AIDs) such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This approach, however, suffers from critical issues of binding saturation for cfDNA and risk of re&#8208;exposure of the captured cfDNA. Herein, an inflammation&#8208;activatable nanoscavenger integrating both cfDNA capture and cleavage functions is constructed from dendrimer&#8208;templated, charge&#8208; and conformation&#8208;transformable polypeptides with Cyclen&#8208;Zn complexes conjugated on the backbone termini. At neutral pH, the polypeptides containing both cis&#8208;aconitic acid and guanidine side chains adopt negative charges and random&#8208;coiled conformation, thus featuring long blood circulation and high accumulation to the inflamed intestinal tissue. Inside the mildly acidic inflammatory microenvironment, the polypeptides transform to the positively charged &#945;&#8208;helices due to removal of the cis&#8208;aconitic acid groups, thus enabling robust cfDNA capture through electrostatic attraction, salt bridging, and spatial confinement within the cavity between adjacent rod&#8208;like helices. Subsequently, the exposed Cyclen&#8208;Zn endows the nanoscavenger with DNase&#8208;like activity to cleave the captured cfDNA, allowing sustainable cfDNA capture and scavenging. In consequence, the nanoscavenger efficiently inhibits TLR9 activation and restores immune homeostasis in IBD mice. This study proposes an enlightened strategy for sustainable cfDNA scavenging, and it renders a promising modality for AIDs treatment.

         <title>Zeolite Structure Direction: Metals with a Dual Role as Amine Coordinators and Siloxy Connectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual role of metal ions as amine coordinators and siloxy connectors leads to the formation of new 3D silicate&#8208;based hybrid materials. Its isolated inorganic layers serve as a platform for the synthesis of novel porous materials. This paper serves as the seed of a new field in zeolite&#8208;zeotypes synthesis and presents the first example of a true coordination polymer&#8208;zeolite hybrid.









Abstract
Innovation in the synthesis of new zeolites is achieved primarily through the use of costly novel organic compounds as structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs). Here, a novel type of structure&#8208;direction based on a metal&#8208;amine coordination polymer leading to a 3&#8208;dimensional silicate&#8208;based hybrid material, LEU&#8208;1, is presented. The Zn&#8208;amine polymer not only serves as an SDA, but also plays a practical role in extending the inorganic connectivity in the form of Zn&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds. This dual&#8208;role mechanism leads to unique hybrids with huge potential for creating zeolite&#8208;like materials. It is demonstrated that by using the silicate layer in LEU&#8208;1 as a platform, two novel pure&#8208;silica zeolites can be generated. This synthesis strategy, rooted in the coordination diversity of metal&#8208;amines, opens the door to more novel zeolite structures.

         <title>Synergistic Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Engineering for Enhanced Longevity in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Thanks to the synergism of abundant active sites and the superior catalytic effect of the uf&#8208;MBene/CNT cathode host, along with uniform lithium ion deposition facilitated by adding Na2SeO3 additives, the cell with this S@uf&#8208;MBene/CNT cathode and Na2SeO3 additive can maintain stable cycling for up to 850 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 93.6% at 0.5 C (10.62 mg cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Due to the notorious shuttle effect and the uneven deposition of lithium ions under high current conditions, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with ultra&#8208;high sulfur loading struggle to achieve stable long&#8208;cycle performance. Herein, a novel MBene&#8208;based composite material is prepared using the ultrasonic freeze etching method as a cathode host. The shuttle effect is effectively inhibited, thanks to its unique structure and abundant active sites. Moreover, a small amount of Na2SeO3 is introduced into the electrolyte to further enhance the long&#8208;cycle performance. Due to the &#8220;reverse tip effect,&#8221; where sodium ions preferentially deposit over lithium ions, the growth of lithium dendrites is effectively suppressed. Remarkably, the cell with the novel cathode and electrolyte design exhibits an initial capacity of 778.2 mAh g&#8722;1 and sustains stability for up to 850 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 93.6% and a sulfur loading of 10.62&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The synergistic strategy of optimizing both cathode and electrolyte systems effectively mitigates the shuttle effect and suppresses lithium dendrite growth, offering an innovative approach to designing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with extended lifespans.

         <title>Clinically Accurate Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease via Single&#8208;Molecule Bioelectronic Label&#8208;Free Profiling of Multiple Blood Extracellular Vesicle Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectronic platform is developed to detect Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in blood extracellular vesicles with unprecedented sensitivity. By integrating transistor technology with microelectrodes, the platform identifies multiple indicators simultaneously in just 20 min, achieving perfect accuracy in clinical tests. This rapid, label&#8208;free approach can transform early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure, making early diagnosis critical for mitigating its impact. Blood extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promises as biomarkers for AD diagnosis, but current detection technologies lack the sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities needed for efficient diagnosis. Here, a novel label&#8208;free bioelectronic platform is presented based on an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) integrated with a microelectrode array (MEA) for ultrasensitive detection of AD biomarkers in blood EVs, including amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;1&#8208;40 and A&#946;1&#8208;42), total tau (t&#8208;tau), and phosphorylated tau (p&#8208;tau181). This platform achieves a detection limit as low as the zeptomolar (zM) level, enabling the detection of single&#8208;molecule targets. It provides a comprehensive multiplexed diagnostic model capable of delivering results within 20 min. Notably, the systematic integration of multiple AD biomarkers in blood EVs is demonstrated to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a novel EVs&#8208;based multiplexed diagnostic model for AD, correctly classifying all clinical samples (n = 40), far exceeding the accuracy of a single biomarker. With its high sensitivity and rapid turnaround, this platform enables reliable AD diagnosis and holds the potential for tracking disease progression, offering a transformative tool to combat the societal burden of AD.

         <title>Monolithic Terahertz Topological&#160;Mach&#8208;Zehnder Interferometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic topological Mach&#8208;Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is presented, integrating the splitter, combiner, and waveguide arms on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on&#8208;off contrast with extinction ratios over 20 dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface&#8208;dependent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane radiation losses. We also demonstrate active tuning of the MZI response through photoexcitation of the MZI arms.








Abstract
The pursuit of on&#8208;chip electromagnetic wave control for high throughput communication, spectroscopy, and quantum computing underlies the motivation for terahertz photonic integrated circuitry. Recent breakthroughs in topological photonics have enabled the development of chips that harness topologically resilient interface modes to achieve area and performance efficiency. However, the demonstration of a compact, monolithic topological Mach&#8208;Zehnder interferometer (MZI), remains a critical gap. In this work, a terahertz topological MZI is presented, exhibiting six interferometric fringes across a 17&#160;GHz bandwidth, with splitter, combiner, and arms integrated on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on&#8208;off contrast with extinction ratios over 20&#160;dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface&#8208;dependent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane radiation losses. Active tuning of the MZI response is also demonstrated through photoexcitation of the MZI arms. The presented approach is the first step toward realizing topological photonic modulators that leverage the phase degree of freedom for photonic integrated communication and quantum information processing.

         <title>Reversible Phase Transitions of Anionic and Cationic Surfactant Mixtures Drive Shape Morphing Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;controlled, reversible phase transition of ionic surfactant assemblies, coupled with dynamic partitioning between bulk phases and interfaces, induces rapid, and order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude changes in oil&#8211;water interfacial tension. Surpassing the capabilities of conventional stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactants, this transient, collaborative mechanism enables multimodal droplet shape transformations and offers a new strategy for the design of programmable, hierarchically structured, all&#8208;liquid matter acting with physicality.








Abstract
Converting chemical signals into mechanical responses is fundamental to biological systems, driving processes such as cellular motility and tissue morphogenesis. Yet, harnessing chemo&#8208;mechanical signal conversions in synthetic systems remains a key challenge in energy&#8208;dissipative materials design. While droplets can move and interact with their environment reminiscent of active biological matter, chemo&#8208;mechanical interactions are limited by the translation of chemical changes into extensive force variations required on small timescales. Droplets naturally adopt spherical shapes to minimize surface&#8208;energy and restructuring liquids into non&#8208;equilibrium geometries requires mechanisms beyond current stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant systems, which lack the force&#8208;amplifying mechanisms needed for transient liquid structuring. Here, a spring&#8208;like charging and latch&#8208;controlled release mechanism is introduced for actuating droplets. This is based on reversible, light&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;to&#8208;coacervate phase transitions of photo&#8208;responsive surfactant assemblies, namely between anionic sodium dodecylsulfate and cationic azobenzene&#8208;based surfactants. During phase&#8208;transition, reversible partitioning of the surfactants into the oil or aqueous phases of the emulsion transiently induce rapid changes in interfacial tensions, which are up to 900 times greater than those observed for conventional stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant systems. The insights into this novel chemo&#8208;mechanical transduction mechanism provide new control over purely liquid systems, paving the way for programmable, hierarchically structured, all&#8208;liquid matter acting with physicality.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Engineered Orthopedic Implant to Break the Antimicrobial&#8208;Osteogenic Paradox at Biointerfaces in the &#8220;Race for the Surface&#8221;</title>

Through polyphenol&#8208;amine&#8208;mediated covalent modification, quaternary ammonium groups (bactericidal agents) and phosphate groups (promoting bone&#8208;regeneration factors) are spatially organized on titanium (Ti) surfaces to regulate the surface chemical characteristics of dental implants. The surface&#8208;engineered implants (Ti&#8208;AQs) exhibited balanced antibacterial and biocompatible properties.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;associated infections and compromised osseointegration pose a dual threat to bone implants due to the biological conflict between microbial invasion and host cell colonization. However, conventional contact&#8208;killing antimicrobial coatings may negatively affect the viability of mammalian cells, limiting their further application. Here, a surface modification strategy is proposed to help mammalian cells to win the &#8220;race for the surface&#8221; on the material&#8208;tissue interfaces. Through polyphenol&#8208;amine&#8208;mediated covalent modification, quaternary ammonium groups (bactericidal agents) and phosphate groups (promoting bone&#8208;regeneration factors) are spatially organized on titanium (Ti) surfaces to regulate the surface chemical characteristics of dental implants. The surface&#8208;engineered implants (Ti&#8208;AQs) exhibited balanced antibacterial and biocompatible properties. The optimized Ti&#8208;AQ&#8208;2 coating eradicated &gt;99% of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) via destruction of disrupted bacterial membranes through metabolic interference, and simultaneously promoted adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through Ca2+&#8208;mediated signaling pathways. Moreover, Ti&#8208;AQs can drive immunomodulation biased macrophages toward pro&#8208;repair M2 polarization. In vivo evaluations in an implant&#8208;associated infection modal confirmed that Ti&#8208;AQ&#8208;2 inhibited infection at the early stage and enhanced bone&#8208;implant integration at the late stage. This work presents a facile strategy to regulate the surface performances for developing of antibacterial implants with high biocompatibility and bioactivity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;amide engineering creates a hierarchical energy dissipation system in blue phase liquid crystal elastomers, yielding remarkable toughness and ultralow hysteresis. This strategy enables programmable mechanochromics via thermally induced bond rearrangement. A multidimensional encryption platform is demonstrated by synergistically combining mechanical strain, UV&#8208;triggered luminescence, and temporally&#8208;gated phosphorescent afterglow for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal elastomers (BPLCEs) hold significant promise for flexible photonic devices due to their 3D periodic photonic lattices and intrinsic soft&#8208;matter characteristics. However, achieving an optimal balance between mechanical resilience and dynamic responsiveness remains a critical challenge. This study introduces a dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding network design strategy, wherein N,N'&#8208;bisacryloylcystamine monomers are incorporated to construct a hierarchical energy dissipation system, yielding BPLCEs with remarkable toughness (1.72 MJ m&#8722;3) and ultralow hysteresis (4.8%). By integrating thermally induced topological bond rearrangement, programmable mechanical gradient films are developed to enable high&#8208;precision strain&#8208;induced patterning and an adaptive encryption mechanism governed by a &#8220;relaxation&#8208;concealment/stretching&#8208;development&#8221; paradigm. Furthermore, leveraging the spatiotemporal gating properties of embedded phosphorescent materials, a dual&#8208;mode dynamic verification system is established, facilitating multidimensional information decryption via ultraviolet&#8208;triggered rapid visualization and controlled afterglow decay lasting up to 5 s. This study not only mitigates the inherent trade&#8208;off between mechanical durability and stimulus responsiveness in soft photonic crystals but also establishes a novel framework for multidimensional synergistic regulation across mechanical, optical, and temporal domains. These findings provide a transformative strategy for advancing next&#8208;generation dynamic encryption systems, intelligent sensing technologies, and adaptive photonic displays, paving the way for innovative applications in flexible photonic devices.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Green&#8208;Synthesis of High Purity Pinacols and Amides by Continuous Tandem Photocatalysis via a Negative Carbon Emission Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem catalytic system consisting of two continuous&#8208;flow reactors (A and B) is developed to integrate CO2 photoreduction with photo&#8208;oxidative C&#8211;C coupling and photocatalytic carbonylation. In reactor A, immobilized CdS@PCN&#8208;Co enables gram&#8208;scale pinacol production with concurrent CO generation. The evolved CO is directly transferred to reactor B, where Pd/PCN&#8208;Zn catalyzed its selective (98%) conversion to DEET, a commercial pesticide.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction for practical applications confronts significant challenges, including the waste of oxidation power and the difficulty in isolating reduction products. Herein, a pre&#8208;coordination restriction strategy is presented to hierarchically assemble CdS quantum dots (QDs), cobalt sites and Zr6 clusters in one metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), resulting in the CdS@PCN&#8208;Co composite for simultaneous CO2 photoreduction and C&#8211;C coupling. Impressively, the yields of CO and pinacols with CdS@PCN&#8208;Co can reach 59.5 mmol&#183;g&#8315;&#185; (99.4% selectivity) and 56.2 mmol&#183;g&#8315;&#185; (95.3% selectivity), respectively, over six and seven times higher than those with the CdS/PCN&#8208;Co mixture (9.8 mmol&#8226;g&#8315;&#185; CO, 29.4% selectivity; 7.8 mmol&#8226;g&#8315;&#185; pinacols, 22.7% selectivity). The superior catalytic performance of CdS@PCN&#8208;Co can be ascribed to the synergy among encapsulated CdS QDs, Zr6 clusters and PCN&#8208;Co, where photogenerated electrons can efficiently transfer from CdS QDs to Co sites for selective CO generation while the remaining holes can oxidize the adsorbed 1&#8208;phenylethanol over Zr6 surface to facilitate C&#8211;C coupling. More impressively, the released CO can be immediately used for carbonylation photosynthesis by immobilizing CdS@PCN&#8208;Co and Pd/PCN&#8208;Zn in a continuous&#8208;flow system with two reactors, which simultaneously achieves gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of high&#8208;purity pinacols and amides by continuous tandem photocatalysis.

         <title>Multidimensional Photopatterning of Heterogeneous Liquid&#8208;Crystal Superstructures Toward Higher&#8208;Level Information Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous liquid&#8208;crystal superstructure is proposed to activate higher optical dimensions in soft matter. Multilevel optical information is precisely encoded into the superstructure through a new strategy called multidimensional photopatterning. Consequently, near&#8208;field full&#8208;color printing and far&#8208;field full&#8208;color holography are achieved simultaneously with brightness controllability and spin selectivity. This facilitates the exquisite construction of LC superstructures and enlightens higher&#8208;dimensional optics.








Abstract
Soft matter, featuring superior flexibility and intriguing tunability, has shown enormous potential in sensors, soft robots, and light tailoring. However, limited by its inherent structural complexity, soft matter remains uncompetitive in multidimensional and high&#8208;density information optics. Herein, a heterogeneous liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) superstructure composed of interlocked nematic and chiral LCs is designed to achieve higher&#8208;dimensional light control. Optically multidimensional photopatterning with programmable UV polarization and dosage is proposed to precisely customize both transverse and longitudinal LC arrangements, bringing in a wide range of light&#8208;matter interactions within a single micrometer&#8208;thick film. The constructed heterogeneous LC superstructure not only enables simultaneous near&#8208;field full&#8208;color printing and far&#8208;field full&#8208;color holography but also boasts brightness controllability and polarization selectivity. This low&#8208;cost photonic structure enables a high information density of &#8776;1.6 million hybrid&#8208;dimensional optical data per square millimeter, unlocking new capabilities in optical storage, display, and encryption. This work creates an ingenious bond between advanced photopatterning technologies and higher&#8208;level optical informatics, and pioneers soft&#8208;matter&#8208;mediated full&#8208;dimensional optics.

         <title>Manipulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Rechargeable Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Fundamental Principles and Universal Methodologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review uncovers the commonalities of rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in aspects of sulfur redox reactions (electrochemical fundamentals, reaction mechanisms, innate challenges, and key influence factors) and advanced targeted methodologies to boost sulfur redox reactions in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. The existing shackles confronted by rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries and their future development directions are prospected as well.








Abstract
The profound understanding of chemical reaction essence and kinetic behaviors is crucial to develop rechargeable battery technologies. Based on multi&#8208;electron conversion, sulfur redox reactions hold great promise for establishing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, and longstanding rechargeable batteries. However, the sulfur redox reaction processes suffer from a series of common daunting cruxes, leading to incomplete redox reactions and inferior battery performance when working in rechargeable batteries. These innate challenges of sulfur redox reactions include poor sulfur reactivity, sluggish charge transmission, severe polysulfide shuttling, high redox energy barrier, and undesirable reaction reversibility. Accordingly, it becomes a consensus to effectively manipulate sulfur redox kinetics for developing competent rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein, this review centers on sulfur redox reactions, within the compass of understanding electrochemical fundamentals, principles, thermodynamics, dynamics, and kinetics as well as emphatically presents universal methodologies to boost sulfur redox reaction kinetics in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. The unique viewpoint on sulfur redox reactions in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries can provide a deepened understanding of sulfur electrochemistry and lead to new insights into the sulfur cathode designs and battery configurations, thus accelerating reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes and promoting practical progress on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies.

         <title>Thermionics in Topological Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermionics is one of the fundamental energy conversion mechanisms in solid state systems. Recent development in topological materials opens new avenues in developing thermionic systems and devices. Due to the linear energy dispersion and topological protection of charge transport, these new materials are promising candidates for high efficiency thermionic energy generation, cooling and other applications.









Abstract
Thermionic emission is fundamental to many technologies and devices, including thermionic energy converters, X&#8208;ray tubes, scanning electron microscopes, and transmission electron microscopes. The discovery of topological materials, particularly graphene, has significantly advanced thermionics research. Thermionic emission in these materials deviates from the Richardson&#8208;Dushman equation due to their linear energy dispersion. Various models are developed to accurately describe thermionic emission. Graphene, with its dangling bond&#8208;free surface, can be stacked either vertically or laterally with materials to form heterostructures. The Schottky barrier height at the interface of heterostructures can be tuned from a few millielectronvolts to several electronvolts by selecting appropriate materials or adjusting the Fermi level of graphene. This low and tunable barrier height gives rise to a great potential in developing thermionic energy converters and photodetectors. While free&#8208;standing single&#8208;layer graphene exhibits high electron mobility, its thermionic emission capability is constrained by the low density of states. This constraint can be alleviated by using 3D Dirac materials, which also possess linear energy dispersion. Thermionic emission in 3D Dirac materials is further enhanced by the emergence of nodal&#8208;ring semimetals and Weyl semimetals that exhibit linear&#8208;like energy dispersion. This review highlights recent progress in thermionic emission and devices in graphene structures and other topological materials.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) hold great promise for use in a wide range of biomedical applications. This review covers four stimulus modalities, namely, electrical, optical, magnetic, and ultrasound, and their associated SRMs. It provides a summary of the materials in each modality, their development, and current research perspectives. This review also provides a detailed analysis of the key challenges for translating these SRM technologies into clinical use.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) are materials that change properties when exposed to external or internal stimuli. They respond to physiological changes within cells and tissues, as well as external triggers including light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity. In medicine, SRMs have diverse applications spanning drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostics. They enable targeted drug release at specific times and locations, facilitate tissue generation and repair, and enhance disease detection capabilities. Beyond medical uses, SRMs are employed in smart coatings and artificial muscle systems. The breadth of biomedical applications for SRMs is extensive, generating substantial research into novel and innovative material development. Challenges in creating safe and efficient SRMs for medical treatments have driven innovative approaches in two key areas: functionalizing and modifying naturally occurring materials and developing new synthetic nanomaterials. The complexity of producing effective SRMs has necessitated creative solutions to overcome safety and efficiency barriers in medical applications. This ongoing research continues to expand the potential therapeutic uses of these responsive materials. This review examines literature focused on SRM development for external stimuli responses, particularly light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity, rather than covering the complete spectrum of stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

         <title>3D Printing of Conducting Polymer Hydrogels for Electrostimulation&#8208;Assisted Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) as promising ink constituents for 3D printing of conducting hydrogel (CH)&#8208;based electrostimulation (ES) devices. ICP&#8208;based ink formulation, 3D printing, and solidification strategies are discussed, along with the application of 3D&#8208;printed ICP&#8208;based CHs as ES platforms for regulating cell activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, ultimately supporting tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Electrostimulation (ES) is at the cutting edge of contemporary medicine, effectively promoting tissue regeneration and wound healing by applying small electrical cues to stimulate specific cellular responses. The 3D printing of electronically conducting hydrogels (CHs) offers a transformative strategy for developing ES platforms. These hydrogels integrate conformal, customizable geometries, mechanical compliance, adequate electrical conductivity, and biocompatibility, enabling seamless interaction with native tissues. Nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) are promising conductive ink constituents for 3D printing, owing to their straightforward preparation, electrical conductivity, and printability. However, 3D printing of ICP&#8208;based CHs faces several challenges. Controlling the tendency of ICPs to aggregate and achieving the rheological properties required by specific 3D printing modalities are vital for achieving uniform and precise printed structures. Furthermore, post&#8208;printing solidification of ICPs often uses harsh curing conditions, e.g., high temperatures or toxic solvents, rendering encapsulation of biological components and cells infeasible. This review critically assesses strategies for synthesizing ICP nanostructures, preparing ICP&#8208;based CHs, and applicable 3D printing techniques. Progress in tissue regeneration utilizing 3D&#8208;printed ICP&#8208;based CHs as ES devices is highlighted, along with future perspectives regarding the development of bio&#8208;functional ICPs and integrated powering mechanisms for closed&#8208;loop ES systems.

         <title>Playing Hard with Si: Challenges and Opportunities for New Materials in Radiation Therapy Dosimetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon has been a cornerstone material of radiation therapy dosimetry for many decades, providing somewhat unchallenged performance. However, there are caveats to its use, requiring complex designs and, often, correction factors to provide accurate measurements. Alternative materials may provide previously unachievable capabilities, ushering in a new generation of radiation detectors suitable for the ever&#8208;changing landscape of radiation&#160;therapy.








Abstract
The sophistication and diversity of radiation medicine modalities continue to increase significantly in both cancer imaging and cancer radiation therapy. With over 50% of cancer patients receiving some form of radiation procedure as part of their cancer management plan, the importance and impact of quantitative radiation detector systems for quality assurance in radiation medicine should not be underestimated. There are numerous challenges faced by silicon&#8208;based detector systems used for dosimetry in radiation therapy that are discussed in this review article, especially considering emerging radiation therapy modalities that incorporate ultra&#8208;high irradiation dose&#8208;rates (e.g., MRT, FLASH&#8208;RT, VHEE&#8208;RT), while others utilize mixed radiation fields (e.g., proton&#8208;RT, heavy ion therapy) or diffusion&#8208;based dose delivery techniques (e.g., Alpha DaRT). Such challenges create exciting opportunities for new radiation detector materials. This concise review paper explores the role of silicon in radiation detection applications and highlights the challenges it faces in achieving optimal performance. Additionally, this review discusses new materials that are emerging as strong candidates for the next generation of radiation detectors, emphasizing both the opportunities and challenges associated with these&#160;materials.

Integration of computational and experimental approaches for deciphering the underlying mechanism of biomolecular condensates and potential biomaterials&#160;design (Created in Biorender. Raza, Z. (2025) https://BioRender.com/irgmeqi).









Abstract
Biomolecular condensates, a ubiquitous class of biomaterials found in living cells, have been shown to be responsible for key physiological processes, such as gene regulation, signal transduction, and stress response. Since their discovery, extensive efforts have been devoted to this field to better understand the underlying mechanisms using both computational and experimental techniques. While great progress has been achieved, the key challenges still exist. With advancements in computational power and methods and improvements in experimental precision, the gap between computation and experimentation is gradually narrowing. By integrating these approaches, researchers can elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing biomolecular condensates. This review summarizes the recent progress in utilizing computational and experimental techniques to study biomolecular condensates. Detailed discussions are provided on the key advantages and limitations of each technique, along with their successful applications to specific systems. Moreover, further discussions are focused on the possibility of utilizing biomolecular condensates as a versatile platform for drug delivery and novel bioreactor design with the help of these techniques. Finally, future directions are outlined for technique development to better understand the role of biomolecular condensates in health and disease and enable their applications as tunable&#160;biomaterials.

         <title>Separator Engineering for Sodium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Rational Design and Recent Modification Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers advances in sodium metal battery separators, focusing on interfacial stabilization, dendrite suppression, and ion transport. It analyzes diverse materials, proposes comprehensive evaluation methods, and discusses simulations and future directions for high&#8208;performance, safe, and practical separators.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, leveraging their high theoretical capacity and the natural abundance of Na resources. Nevertheless, critical challenges, including dendritic growth, side reactions, and pronounced volume fluctuations during cycling, continue to impede their commercialization. Conventional separators, including polyolefin or glass fiber types, suffer from poor wettability, uneven ion flux, and a rough surface. To tackle these challenges, functional separator engineering encompassing interfacial chemistry regulation, multiscale structural design, and hybrid integration of advanced materials has demonstrated remarkable progress in regulating Na&#8314; flux, stabilizing SEI, and suppressing dendrite propagation. This review systematically provides a comprehensive summary of recent developments in separator engineering for SMBs, including modified polyolefin separators, enhanced glass fiber frameworks, cellulose&#8208;based separators, MOFs/COFs&#8208;based, and emerging separators. In addition, a comprehensive electrochemical evaluation framework encompassing CE in half&#8208;cells is proposed, the lifespan of symmetric cells, full cell performance, and safety validation to assess practical applicability. Furthermore, computational simulations for mechanism elucidation and predictive design, as well as future separator perspectives, have been also discussed to guide the development of next&#8208;generation separators for high&#8208;performance and commercially viable SMBs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarized Antiferromagnets for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in anomalous and spin transport phenomena in spin&#8208;polarized antiferromagnets. Key effects&#8212;including the anomalous Hall, Nernst, and magneto&#8208;optical effects&#8212;are discussed across various antiferromagnetic platforms. The roles of spin texture, symmetry, and interlayer interactions are emphasized, offering new opportunities for spintronic applications beyond conventional ferromagnets.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized antiferromagnets (AFMs), including altermagnets, noncollinear AFMs, and 2D layer&#8208;polarized AFMs, have emerged as transformative materials for next&#8208;generation spintronic and optoelectronic technologies. These systems uniquely combine spin&#8208;polarized electronic states with vanishing net magnetization, enabling ultrafast spin dynamics, high&#8208;density integration, and robustness against stray magnetic fields. Their unconventional symmetry&#8208;breaking mechanisms&#8212;governed by crystal symmetry, chiral spin textures, or interlayer potential control&#8212;give rise to emergent phenomena previously exclusive to ferromagnets: nonrelativistic spin&#8208;momentum locking, spontaneous anomalous transport phenomena, gate&#8208;tunable magneto&#8208;optical responses, nonrelativistic spin&#8208;polarized current, and tunneling magnetoresistance effect. This review systematically examines the fundamental principles linking symmetry, band topology, and transport properties across these material classes, synthesizing recent breakthroughs in both theory and experiment. Critical challenges are further identified in achieving room&#8208;temperature functionality, scalable N&#233;el vector control, and coherent spin&#8208;current manipulation, while outlining pathways to harness these materials for ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power memory, spin&#8208;logic architectures, and quantum information technologies.

         <title>Atmospheric Water Sorption&#8211;Desorption as a Pathway for Green Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the energy conversion from the process of sorption and desorption of water molecules. By detailing the mechanism studies, guidelines are provided for the performance enhancement in the sequence of energy conversion. It provides insights into understanding the recent advances of hydrovoltaic technology and leads to future improvement of the harnessed energy.








Abstract
Beyond the indispensable resource for living creatures, water has recently been explored as an eco&#8208;friendly source of energy, known as the hydrovoltaic technology. Of significant interest, the cyclic sorption/desorption of water molecules physically and chemically induces the gaseous/liquid&#8211;solid interactions with the substances, demonstrating potential for harnessing electricity. Existing efforts have focused on materials engineering and structural design of the energy generators, enhancing the generated electricity for real&#8208;life applications. Despite the substantial achievements, the principal interpretation of the process from water molecules to electricity establishes the foundation and serves as the guidance for device modification and performance enhancement. Herein, this review thoroughly discusses the energy conversion, from the introduction of water molecules to the generation of electricity, starting with an understanding of the sorption/desorption of water molecules. Mechanisms in charge creation from the interaction are then elucidated, where water molecules themselves serve as ions or stimulate ion dissociation from the substances. It continues with an overview of the existing advancements in sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity generation and practical demonstrations of the developed electricity. Based on the conversion procedure, insights for upcoming generator designs are proposed subsequently. Finally, present challenges to be addressed and perspectives on future development in the sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity are discussed in detail.

         <title>Sustainable Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Precursor Design and Scalable Production Roadmaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes sodium&#8208;ion batteries' potential, highlighting hard carbon anodes, precursor selection by volatility, and sustainable strategies (e.g., bamboo&#8208;based materials) for scalable, high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the abundant and widely distributed nature of sodium resources. Hard carbon anodes, characterized by their pseudo&#8208;graphitic layered structures and nanoporosity, are key to achieving high&#8208;performance SIBs. However, the commercialization of hard carbon is hindered by significant challenges in precursor design, carbonization optimization, and sustainability. This review focuses on the critical role of precursor selection and introduces a classification system based on volatile content. High&#8208;volatility biomass precursors, such as bamboo, require pretreatments like acid/alkali leaching or hydrothermal processing to optimize pyrolysis. Medium&#8208;volatility resins and plastics benefit from crosslinking strategies, while low&#8208;volatility materials such as biochar and petroleum coke rely on nanochannel engineering to improve sodium storage performance. Bamboo&#8208;based precursors are highlighted as a promising pathway due to their renewability and environmental advantages, though challenges such as impurity control and structural engineering persist. By integrating precursor design with carbonization strategies, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding microstructural regulation and performance enhancement. The insights presented offer valuable guidance for developing scalable and sustainable approaches to produce high&#8208;performance hard carbon materials, paving the way for the next generation of SIB technologies.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Materials for Water Splitting: An Atomic Nanoengineering Approach to Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), typically composed of five or more principal elements in near&#8208;equimolar ratios, offer significant potential due to their unique properties. This review outlines the emergence and structural evolution of HEMs, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the elemental roles (active sites, promoters, or stabilizers) for water splitting. Last, future research directions in this evolving field are discussed.









Abstract
Green hydrogen production via water electrolysis is pivotal for achieving energy sustainability. However, the inherently sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction impede the progress of water&#8208;splitting technology. Recently, high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) composed of at least five elements have garnered significant attention as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting, owing to their compositional versatility, structural robustness, and synergistic interactions among elements. This review comprehensively explores the development of HEMs, tracing their emergence and structural evolution via atomic nanoengineering strategies (i.e., from bulk to nanostructuring, from random distributions to relatively ordered architectures, from bare HEMs to reconstructed HEMs, from intact HEMs to defective structures, from pristine HEMs to functionalized variants) and revealing how these evolutionary steps contribute to the properties and enhance catalytic performance in water splitting. The fundamental roles of individual elements (e.g., active sites, promoters, stabilizers) in shaping the structure, stability, and catalytic activity of HEMs are examined, laying a foundation for the rational design of efficient HEM&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The review also highlights recent advances in HEM&#8208;based catalysts for water splitting, emphasizing desirable properties and elemental contributions. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives on the future directions of HEM&#8208;based materials in energy conversion technologies are discussed.

         <title>Paving the Way for Next&#8208;Generation All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Dry Electrode Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dry&#8208;electrode process offers a highly efficient solution to the key challenges faced by all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, including complex processing, high CO2 emissions, interfacial instability, toxicity, and limited energy density. This perspective outlines the critical challenges of implementing the dry electrode process from material fundamentals to processing, providing a guiding framework to bridge current research and future development.








Abstract
For the effective implementation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), the progress of dry electrode technology is essential. Considering the urgent challenges posed by global warming, advancing affordable ASSBs is crucial for reliable and sustainable electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Despite the substantial progress in research on solid electrolytes, ASSBs continue to face fundamental challenges, including high manufacturing costs, considerable environmental impact, and insufficient interfacial stability. The dry electrode processing methodology presents a highly promising alternative to conventional wet electrode fabrication techniques, effectively addressing these limitations while facilitating scalable production capabilities. Although research on dry&#8208;electrode&#8208;based ASSBs has gained significant traction in recent years, the overall challenges are recognized as intricate due to the presence of multiple electrode components with diverse requirements and limitations. For the comprehensive review, the dry processing approach is systematically examined from the perspective of materials science and electrode processing. An electrode&#8208;component&#8208;level framework is adopted as well. Furthermore, crucial technical barriers are identified, and prospective research directions for the advancement of solid&#8208;state battery technology are delineated.

&lt;p&gt;The dry-electrode process offers a highly efficient solution to the key challenges faced by all-solid-state batteries, including complex processing, high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, interfacial instability, toxicity, and limited energy density. This perspective outlines the critical challenges of implementing the dry electrode process from material fundamentals to processing, providing a guiding framework to bridge current research and future development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the effective implementation of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), the progress of dry electrode technology is essential. Considering the urgent challenges posed by global warming, advancing affordable ASSBs is crucial for reliable and sustainable electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Despite the substantial progress in research on solid electrolytes, ASSBs continue to face fundamental challenges, including high manufacturing costs, considerable environmental impact, and insufficient interfacial stability. The dry electrode processing methodology presents a highly promising alternative to conventional wet electrode fabrication techniques, effectively addressing these limitations while facilitating scalable production capabilities. Although research on dry-electrode-based ASSBs has gained significant traction in recent years, the overall challenges are recognized as intricate due to the presence of multiple electrode components with diverse requirements and limitations. For the comprehensive review, the dry processing approach is systematically examined from the perspective of materials science and electrode processing. An electrode-component-level framework is adopted as well. Furthermore, crucial technical barriers are identified, and prospective research directions for the advancement of solid-state battery technology are delineated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing an Anionic Layer in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes to Promote In&#8208;Plane Ion Diffusion for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimization model for zinc anodes centered on anion traction in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte system is proposed. The fluoride&#8208;ion enriched interfacial layer on the zinc anode surface enhances the concentration of Zn2+ in a lateral direction through electrostatic forces, thereby facilitating horizontal zinc plating. Moreover, the repulsion between the anion&#8208;rich layer and sulfate ions can effectively inhibit the formation of byproducts.








Abstract
In contrast to high&#8208;concentration electrolyte systems, low&#8208;concentration electrolytes provide a cost&#8208;effective strategy to advance the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, such electrolytes frequently exhibit severe dendrite formation caused by localized Zn2+ concentration gradients, which critically compromise the cycling stability and operational safety of AZIBs. In this work, an innovative approach is proposed that involves the in situ construction of a fluoride&#8208;ion (F&#8722;) enriched interfacial layer on zinc anodes. This method facilitates in&#8208;plane diffusion of zinc ions at the anode interface, resulting in accelerated lateral growth of zinc deposits rather than dendritic formation. The results indicate that this orientated growth is closely associated with an anionic layer that effectively reduces random and irregular deposition as well as undesirable side reactions. The proposed system exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance within a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte framework, achieving a battery lifespan exceeding 1500 h at a current density of 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it maintains Coulombic efficiency above 99% after 800 h of cycling. Additionally, the Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O (NVO)//Zn full battery incorporating this additive showcases enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance and improved capacity retention, further confirming the excellent reversibility of the plating/stripping processes for zinc anode.

         <title>Tailoring Robust Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Entropy&#8208;Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bandstructure renormalization, without (w/o) spin&#8208;orbit interaction (SOI) (left) and with SOI (right), in the low&#8208;energy Dirac bands of zero&#8208;entropy (purple) and entropic (green) VCl3 monolayer (ML) with long&#8208;range ordering (LRO). 








Abstract
The development of quantum materials and the tailoring of their functional properties is of fundamental interest in materials science. Here, a new design concept is proposed for the robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect via entropy engineering in 2D magnets. As a prototypical example, the configurational entropy of monolayer transition metal trihalide VCl3 is manipulated by incorporating four different transition&#8208;metal cations [Ti,Cr,Fe,Co] into the honeycomb structure made of vanadium, such that all in&#8208;plane mirror symmetries, inversion and/or roto&#8208;inversion are broken. Monolayer VCl3 is a ferromagnetic Dirac half&#8208;metal&#160;in which spin&#8208;polarized Dirac dispersion at valley momenta is accompanied by bulk states at the &#915;&#8208;point and thus the spin&#8208;orbit interaction&#8208;driven QAH&#160;phase does not exhibit fully gapped bulk band dispersion. Entropy&#8208;driven bandstructure renormalization, especially band flattening in combination with red&#8208; and blue&#8208;shifts at different momenta of the Brillouin zone and crystal&#8208;field effects, transforms Dirac half&#8208;metal to a Dirac spin&#8208;gapless semiconductor and leads to a robust QAH phase with fully gapped bulk band dispersion and, thus, a purely topological edge state transport without mixing with dissipative bulk channels. These findings provide a paradigm for designing entropy&#8208;engineered 2D materials for the realization of robust QAH effect and quantum device&#160;applications.

         <title>Fluoroether Design Enables High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A durable high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed by incorporating a novel organic/inorganic hybrid porous component with a fluoroether design. Due to the weakened Li+ coordination structure, the proposed high&#8208;voltage SSE exhibits durable antioxidation. The optimized electrolytes show ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance in Li||Li cells, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cells, and LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4||Li cells even under 4.5V.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) holds transformative potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new prototype design is presented that integrates fluorinated ether segments into the traditional oxide nanocomposite phase, enabling poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite electrolytes with exceptional anti&#8208;oxidation durability and enhance overall electrochemical performance. Through a combination of experimental and computational analyses, it is demonstrated that the superior performance is attributed to the formation of reconstructed Li&#8314; solvation with weakly coordinating environments. The proposed formulation exhibits excellent Li&#8208;metal compatibility, enabling stable cycling in symmetric Li||Li cells for over 9500 h. The solid&#8208;state electrolyte also exhibits outstanding high&#8208;voltage stability with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes, extending the operational voltage from 4.0 to 4.5 V. Moreover, the LiMn1&#8208;xFexPO4||Li cells have delivered remarkable cycling performance, achieving over 1200 cycles with 99% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This work establishes an innovative platform for designing electrolytes with superior antioxidation properties and enhance structural durability, paving the way for the advancement of high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Unraveling the Impact of Electrosorbed Ions on the Scaling Behavior of Fast&#8208;Charging Dynamics of Nanoporous Electrodes Toward Digital Design of Iontronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosorbed ions under nanoconfinement (see TOC figure) critically reshape electrochemical potentials and impact ion transport in porous electrodes. By integrating modified Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck simulations with multilayered graphene membrane experiments, this study establishes a scaling relation and reveals electrosorption&#8208;enhanced transport, offering a computationally efficient framework for designing high&#8208;performance, fast&#8208;charging electrochemical and iontronic devices.








Abstract
Electrolyte&#8208;filled nanoporous electrodes with fast&#8208;charging capability are critical for advanced energy storage and iontronic devices. However, experiments and simulations consistently show that increasing electrode thickness degrades performance by limiting ion access to effective electrode/electrolyte interfaces, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. While often attributed to sluggish ion transport, the underlying mechanisms and the quantitative link between thickness and performance remain unclear due to complex pore structures and nanoconfined ion dynamics. Here, using multilayered graphene membranes as a model system, modified Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck simulations with experiments are combined to reveal how electrosorbed ions reshape local electrical and chemical potentials, particularly as the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio increases with reduced pore size. It is shown that electrosorbed ions substantially influence the scaling behavior of capacitance across electrode thicknesses, causing marked deviations from classical transmission line models as pores approach nanometric dimensions. Despite the complexity introduced by nanoconfinement, introducing a correction factor enables capacitance&#8211;scan rate relationships to collapse into a unified curve across various electrode architectures, allowing computationally efficient design of high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging electrochemical and iontronic devices. This work highlights the unique role of 2D nanomaterials as a versatile platform for bridging experiments and theory to address long&#8208;standing challenges in ion transport dynamics.

It is shown that electrosorbed ions substantially influence the scaling behavior of capacitance across electrode thicknesses, causing marked deviations from classical transmission line models as pores approach nanometric dimensions. Despite the complexity introduced by nanoconfinement, introducing a correction factor enables capacitance&#8211;scan rate relationships to collapse into a unified curve across various electrode architectures, allowing computationally efficient design of high-performance fast-charging electrochemical and iontronic devices. This work highlights the unique role of 2D nanomaterials as a versatile platform for bridging experiments and theory to address long-standing challenges in ion transport dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Mesoporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly strategy enables the synthesis of ultrathin 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce) nanosheets with tunable thickness and uniform mesopores. The enhanced mass transport and accessible active sites significantly improve performance, highlighting the synergistic effects of 2D morphology and mesopores in metal&#8208;organic frameworks for applications in environmental remediation.








Abstract
Designing 2D mesoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets to overcome the limitations of bulk MOF counterparts, with a focus on enabling smooth mass transport, presents an attractive yet challenging endeavor. Here, a novel bottom&#8208;up interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly method is presented for the synthesis of ultrathin 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce) nanosheets. The method utilizes an interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic perfluorooctanoic acid&#8208;induced lipid bilayers and spherical micelles from PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEO block copolymers to form unique 2D sandwich&#8208;like assemblies that guide the creation of 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce). The resultant 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce), with &#8776;23&#160;nm pore diameters and a thickness that can be tuned from 3 to 150&#160;nm, represents a substantial advancement in the application of MOFs for environmental remediation. As a model reaction, the U(VI) photoreduction benefits from the through&#8208;mesopores of its 2D morphology, which are absent in previously reported UiO&#8208;66(Ce), as they shorten the diffusion path, thereby improving mass transport and accessibility to active sites. This report demonstrates the significant role of existing mesopores in MOFs and the shape control of MOFs.

         <title>Constructing Asymmetric Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C Interface via Defective Carbon Trapped Atomic Clusters for Efficient Neutral Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs asymmetric Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C interface via anchoring SnCu atomic clusters on carbon defects. Such as&#8208;synthesized SnCu&#8208;DG catalyst achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (99.5%) and a record intrinsic activity of 2.61 &#215; 10&#8722;17 mmol h&#8722;1 siteCu&#8722;1 at neutral electrolyte condition. This work reveals that the electronic asymmetry enhanced by carbon defects is the key for multi&#8208;step electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;atom cluster (MACs) catalysts have recently attracted significant research interest for their potential to catalyze multi&#8208;electron reactions through cooperative interactions among adjacent active sites. However, the controllable synthesis of MACs and the electrocatalytic mechanism understanding of their synergistic effects remain challenging. Herein, we develop a defect engineering strategy to anchor bimetallic SnCu atomic clusters at defective graphene (SnCu&#8208;DG) via carbon defect&#8208;mediated atomic trapping, wherein edge defects act as confined reactors for cluster nucleation. Taking nitrate reduction as an example, the SnCu&#8208;DG catalyst achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (99.5%) at neutral electrolyte condition, accompanied by a record intrinsic activity of 2.61 &#215; 10&#8722;17 mmol h&#8722;1 siteCu&#8722;1, surpassing Cu&#8208;DG and SnCu&#8208;G counterparts by 16.0&#8208; and 7.8&#8208;fold, respectively. X&#8208;ray adsorption spectra and theoretical calculations reveal the electrons transfer between Cu and carbon defect sites while Sn incorporation intensifies asymmetric charge polarization across the Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C interface. This dual modulation collaboratively optimizes the catalytic microenvironment, simultaneously enhancing *NO2&#8722; adsorption, accelerating water dissociation kinetics, and breaking the intrinsic linear scaling between intermediate adsorption and hydrogenation.

Abstract
Neurological disorders impose a substantial global health burden, compounded by the limited regenerative capacity of neural tissues and the absence of curative therapies. 3D bioprinting offers a transformative tool to model, replace, and regenerate neural tissues through the precise spatial organization of cells and biomaterials. In this perspective article, recent advances are examined in: i) the development of in vitro neural platforms for disease modeling and drug screening; ii) bioprinted acellular scaffolds designed to guide endogenous neural repair; and iii) cell&#8208;laden constructs that aim to replace or reconstruct damaged neural circuits. Key translational challenges are critically evaluated, including vascularization, immune integration, functional maturation, and replicating the complex cytoarchitectures of native neural tissues. Highlighting representative preclinical studies and emerging biofabrication technologies, we discuss how innovations in biomaterials, scaffold design, stem cell biology, and neuroengineering are converging to overcome existing limitations. Through tailored strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration, 3D bioprinting is poised to redefine therapeutic paradigms and drive the development of next&#8208;generation, personalized regenerative therapies for neurological diseases and injuries.

Stable Fuel Cells
In article number 2504059, Hanuel Jin, Hyesung Jo, Yongsoo Yang, Dong Won Chun, Sung Jong Yoo, and co&#8208;workers present the synthesis of dome&#8208;hollow NiPt nanocatalysts incorporating ordered Ni3Pt5 phases via ultrasound&#8208;assisted atomic transposition at room temperature. Atomic ordering within multi&#8208;grained structure effectively suppresses metal dissolution in chemical and electrochemical environments, enabling high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability in PEMFCs under both light&#8208;duty and heavy&#8208;duty operations.

CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol over Earth&#8208;Abundant Catalysts
Hybrid Cu/Cu2P2O7 catalysts, formed by discharging Li&#8208;ion batteries, steer CO2 electroreduction decisively toward methanol, a key chemical for a sustainable future. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free hybrids achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 48.8 % in KHCO3 and 70.1 % in CsHCO3, operate steadily for 48 h, and sustain &gt; 100 mA cm&#8722;2 on gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. More details can be found in article number 2501021 by Aloysius Soon, Jongsoon Kim, Jungki Ryu, and co&#8208;workers.

Novel Strain Indicator
In article number 2419414, Mun Seok Jeong and co&#8208;workers identify a new strain indicator in monolayer WSe2 using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The strain sensitivity of the newly revealed Raman&#8208;inactive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane A2&#8243;(&#915;) mode was clearly demonstrated through both experimental and theoretical approaches.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202419414"&gt;2419414&lt;/a&gt;, Mun Seok Jeong and co-workers identify a new strain indicator in monolayer WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The strain sensitivity of the newly revealed Raman-inactive out-of-plane &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;

Bioinspired Heterogeneous Spheres
Inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter&#8208;sized spheres with an inner helical structure can imitate the micro&#8208;mixing and metabolic processes, including the adsorption, catalysis, and release capacity of Phacus helicoides. They can effectively absorb the glucose, catalyzed glucose, and eventually released the hypoglycemic drugs. More details can be found in article number 2504878 by Tao Chen, Chaobo Huang and co&#8208;workers.

Hydrogel&#8208;Based Synthetic Chromatophores
In article number 2505104, Stephen A. Morin and co&#8208;workers use dyed arrays of microscale hydrogels to emulate biological chromatophores found in cephalopods. These synthetic chromatophores expand and contract when stimulated, enabling skins with dynamic colors and patterns. By combining the optical and mechanical properties of the chromatophores, the team produced actuation systems that signal their environmental condition through color and morphology, simultaneously.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nano&#8208;Islands: Unlocking New Horizons in Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) are innovative confined&#8208;space single&#8208;atom systems composed of single atoms, nano&#8208;islands, and support. Due to their confined space, multiple active sites, interfacial interactions, and tunable coordination structure, SANIs catalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, and the challenges and opportunities for their development in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, and accelerating their transformation to industrial applications are discussed.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), renowned for their maximized atomic utilization, tunable coordination environments, and unique electronic structures, are critical to energy conversion and storage. However, obstacles to their practical performance include atomic agglomeration (caused by high surface free energy) and active site passivation (due to overly strong metal&#8211;support chemical bonds). Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) catalysts, characterized by confined spaces and innovative structural designs, have better electrocatalytic activity and stability. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, highlighting their contributions to catalytic activity, stability, structural optimization, and selectivity. We systematically summarize the design principles and strategies for SANIs electrocatalysts by focusing on material selection, metal&#8211;support interactions, and coordination structures. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with SANIs catalysts to promote their development in heterogeneous catalysis and accelerate their transition into industrial applications are discussed.

Abstract
To address the persistent challenges of scaling and power consumption in integrated circuits and chips, recent research has focused on exploring novel semiconductor materials beyond silicon and designing new device architectures. The vastness of the material and parameter space poses significant challenges in terms of cost and efficiency for traditional experimental and computational methods. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) offers a highly promising avenue for accelerating semiconductor technology development. AI&#8208;driven methods demonstrate significant advantages in analyzing and interpreting large datasets, potentially freeing researchers to focus on more creative endeavors. This review provides a detailed and timely overview of how AI&#8208;driven approaches are assisting researchers across the entire semiconductor research pipeline, encompassing materials discovery, semiconductor screening, synthesis, characterization, and device performance optimization, highlighting how their integration facilitates a holistic understanding of the entire processing&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance (PSPP) relationship. Remain challenges related to dataset quality, model generalizability, and autonomous experimentation, as well as the under&#8208;application of AI to critical needs are discussed in the semiconductor field, such as wafer&#8208;scale growth of high&#8208;quality, single&#8208;crystal semiconductor thin films beyond silicon. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts from researchers across various organizations and disciplines, and represents a key focus for future research.

         <title>Food Nanozymology: Nanozyme Engineering Toward Future Food</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes are rapidly emerging in food research as a next&#8208;generation enzymatic toolkit. By proposing a transdisciplinary paradigm called food nanozymology, this work systematically elucidates its fundamental principles, diverse applications across the food supply chain, and key developmental challenges and future prospects. It establishes a clear theoretical framework to inform and guide future food research in this burgeoning interdisciplinary field.








Abstract
Enzymes have historically served as critical biocatalysts in the food supply chain, yet their industrial applicability remains constrained by intrinsic limitations such as poor stability, low availability, and high production costs. Nanozymes, synthetic nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, offer a compelling alternative owing to their superior physicochemical properties and tunable functionalities. This review conceptualizes food nanozymology as a new interdisciplinary field that combines enzymological principles with nanotechnology to reimagine catalytic strategies in food systems. It provides a critical overview of current progress across multiple application fronts, including detection, detoxification, preservation, processing, food fortification and nutritional intervention, and resource recovery, etc. By framing food nanozymology as both a conceptual and technological shift, this work highlights its potential to catalyze innovation and improve the sustainability, efficiency, and resilience of the global food supply chain.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Defect Engineering for Advanced Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents how AI accelerates the design of defect&#8208;tuned thermoelectric materials. By integrating machine learning with high&#8208;throughput data and physics&#8208;informed representations, it enables efficient prediction of thermoelectric performance from complex defect landscapes. It also outlines emerging directions where machine learning may assist inverse design and promote sustainability in next&#8208;generation thermoelectric&#160;materials.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials offer a promising pathway to directly convert waste heat to electricity. However, achieving high performance remains challenging due to intrinsic trade&#8208;offs between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, which are further complicated by the presence of defects. This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming thermoelectric materials design. Advanced ML approaches including deep neural networks, graph&#8208;based models, and transformer architectures, integrated with high&#8208;throughput simulations and growing databases, effectively capture structure&#8208;property relationships in a complex multiscale defect space and overcome the &#8220;curse of dimensionality&#8221;. This review discusses AI&#8208;enhanced defect engineering strategies such as composition optimization, entropy and dislocation engineering, and grain boundary design, along with emerging inverse design techniques for generating materials with targeted properties. Finally, it outlines future opportunities in novel physics mechanisms and sustainability, highlighting the critical role of AI in accelerating the discovery of thermoelectric&#160;materials.

         <title>Spin Engineering of Dual&#8208;Atom Site Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in spin engineering of dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs), emphasizing how spin&#8208;related properties enhance electrocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. It summarizes cutting&#8208;edge developments in dual&#8208;atom catalysis, discusses the underlying spin&#8208;catalysis mechanisms and structure&#8211;performance relationships, and proposes high&#8208;throughput screening strategies to guide the rational design of spin&#8208;optimized DASCs for small&#8208;molecule conversion reactions.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs) provide more advantages than single&#8208;atom systems in improving energy conversions, owing to their unique features. For example, the coupling effect may align the spin of two adjacent dual&#8208;atom active centers in parallel or antiparallel via electron exchange interactions, thereby altering reaction mechanisms and overall efficiency. While numerous reviews have explored spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, there remains a lack of a comprehensive, spin&#8208;focused framework for understanding the catalytic behavior of DASCs. This review emphasizes the role of spin in dual&#8208;atom site centers for electrocatalysis research. First, spin fundamentals in electrocatalysts, including spin&#8208;selective orbital occupation, spin ordering, and spin coupling, are comprehensively summarized to provide a solid foundation for subsequent discussions. Then, spin engineering strategies of DASCs are reviewed, including manipulating the spin configuration of the central atoms, modulating coordination environments, and tuning metal&#8211;support interactions. Next, recent developments in spin engineering of DASCs are reviewed, with a focus on structure&#8211;performance relationships. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput screening techniques integrated with machine learning are discussed for developing highly efficient DASCs based on spin engineering. The challenges and opportunities of DASCs and spin engineering are thoroughly discussed to promote the advancement of new energy applications.

         <title>Immobilization of H2O in Diffusion Channel of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Long&#8208;Term CO2 Capture from Humid Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to immobilize water molecules within a robust metal&#8211;organic framework significantly enhances CO2 adsorption at low concentrations. The optimized channels by functional group regulation and water molecules immobilization in this unique MOF material facilitate the long&#8208;term viability of CO2 capture in humid flue gas. This counter&#8208;intuitive approach transforms the presence of water into favorable conditions for CO2 capture.








Abstract
Utilizing physisorption for CO2 capture in humid flue gas presents challenges, with H2O molecules either damaging the adsorbent or competing with CO2 for adsorption, compromising long&#8208;term stability. Herein, a counter&#8208;intuitive strategy is proposed to address this issue by immobilizing H2O into metal&#8211;organic framework (TYUT&#8208;ATZ, TYUT = Taiyuan University of Technology, ATZ = 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole) as binding sites for CO2 capture from humid airflow. Through tailoring the &#8208;NH2 group numbers and pore sizes creates ingenious H2O sites, preserving CO2 adsorption space and enhancing CO2 adsorption interactions in 1D channels. The well&#8208;constructed TYUT&#8208;ATZ&#8208;&#946; demonstrates a high CO2 adsorption capacity (62.7 cm3 cm&#8722;3) at 0.15&#160;bar and outstanding CO2/N2 (15/85) selectivity (2031) at 298 K, while also exhibits the highest CO2/H2O uptake ratio in humid flue gas due to its excellent water stability and unique H2O site. Consequently, it shows top&#8208;performing CO2 enrichment ability with easy regeneration in long&#8208;term separation experiments (over 100 cycles) under high&#8208;humidity (75% RH). Gas adsorption isotherms, single&#8208;crystal analysis, selectivity calculations, and contrastive breakthrough experiments comprehensively validate this artful H2O immobilization strategy in MOFs for efficient CO2 capture in humid flue gas, satisfying the application requirements of high selectivity, rapid regeneration, and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>A Polychromatic Neuromorphic Visual System Inspired by Biomimetics for Miniature Insect Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents bulk heterojunction organic photosynapses (BHJ&#8208;OPS) for neuromorphic electronics, enabling ultra&#8208;broadband photodetection and low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared perception with bio&#8208;synaptic features. A neuromorphic visual system based on BHJ&#8208;OPS that can sense visual information and coordinate movements in response to environmental stimuli is successfully achieved.








Abstract
The emergence of electronics influenced by visual neural perception and action is increasingly crucial for enhancing interactive human&#8208;machine interfaces and advancing the capabilities of intelligent robots. There is an urgent demand for a system that incorporates neuromorphic environmental information encoding, synaptic signal processing, and motion control. Taking inspiration from the polychromatic visual system, it is initially employed bulk heterojunction organic photosynapses (BHJ&#8208;OPS) to replicate the functionalities of human&#8208;like visual nerve system. The BHJ&#8208;OPS, utilizing a two&#8208;terminal architecture, exhibits an ultra&#8208;broadband photodetection range (365&#8211;1060&#160;nm). For near&#8208;infrared (NIR) perception, an optical energy consumption as low as 0.2 fJ per synaptic event is demonstrated, which is the lowest energy consumption achieved so far with NIR light stimulation. By combining the photovoltaic effect in heterojunctions with electron trapping in the buffer layer, BHJ&#8208;OPS displays bio&#8208;synaptic characteristics such as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory, as well as experiential learning, which endows the synapse array with multispectral color&#8208;discrimination capabilities. Finally, it is implemented miniature insect robots capable of night&#8208;time foraging and predator evasion based on a simulated 26 &#215; 26 memristor network. This demonstrates significant potential for the development of miniature insect robots with self&#8208;regulation and adaptability, particularly in exploration, monitoring, and rescue missions.

         <title>Surface Fluorination Shielding of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes for Enhanced Electrochemical Stability in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface fluorination using XeF2 significantly enhances the electrochemical stability of Li6PS5Cl while preserving 82.8% of its initial Li+ conductivity, which is attributed to the formation of a uniform and ultrathin (&#8776;37.3&#160;nm) fluorinated layer. The underlying fluorination mechanisms are also elucidated. The effectiveness of this strategy is further demonstrated by the outstanding performance of both the LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||(Li&#8208;In) half&#8208;cells and pouch&#8208;type LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||Li full cells.








Abstract
Despite their high Li+ conductivity and deformability, sulfide solid electrolytes suffer from limited electrochemical stability, which prevents all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) from reaching their full performance potential. Herein, a facile surface fluorination strategy is presented for Li6PS5Cl using XeF2 as a solid&#8208;state fluorinating agent, enabling a scalable dry process at moderate temperatures. An &#8776;37.3 nm&#8208;thick uniform fluorinated layer is coated on an Li6PS5Cl surface, preserving 82.8% of the initial Li+ conductivity (from 2.9 &#215; 10&#8315;3 only to 2.4 &#215; 10&#8315;3 S cm&#8315;&#185; at 30 &#176;C). The underlying fluorination mechanism, deduced through systematic investigations using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray Rietveld refinement, nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory calculations, involves the formation of surface oxidative byproducts and F substitution within the lattice. When applied to LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2 electrodes in LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||(Li&#8208;In) half cells at 30 &#176;C, the fluorinated Li6PS5Cl substantially improves the electrochemical performance, delivering superior discharge capacities (e.g., 186.9 vs 173.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.33C), capacity retention, and safety characteristics compared to unmodified Li6PS5Cl. This enhancement is attributed to the formation of a robust fluorinated cathode electrolyte interphase that mitigates Li6PS5Cl oxidation. Finally, the stable operation of a pouch&#8208;type LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||Li ASSB is demonstrated, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

         <title>Eliminating Nearfield Coupling in Dense High Quality Factor Phase Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for fully suppressing nearfield coupling is reported between subwavelength separated meta&#8208;atoms with arbitrarily large resonant quality factors, opening the door to dynamic high resolution wavefront shaping with vanishingly small refractive index biasing. The platform provides a route for densely arrayed high Q metasurfaces with independently addressable meta&#8208;atoms, paving the way for highly efficient nonlinear and dynamic wavefront shaping.








Abstract
High Q phase gradient metasurfaces are promising for revolutionizing light manipulation, but near&#8208;field coupling typically forces a trade&#8208;off between quality factor and resolution. Here, a strategy for eliminating coupling&#8208;based nonlocal effects in wave shaping metasurfaces composed of meta&#8208;pixels is presented with arbitrarily long resonant lifetimes arranged with sub&#8208;diffraction spatial resolution. By working at a zero&#8208;coupling regime introduced by the interference between enhanced longitudinal and transverse electric fields, the tradeoff between Q and resolution no longer exists. Numerical demonstrations show that metasurfaces with quality factors of a few million and resolution &lt;&#955;/1.6 can produce beam&#8208;splitting to angles of &#177;53&#176; and beam&#8208;steering to an angle of 33&#176; with diffraction efficiencies over 90% via refractive index modulations of just 2 &#215; 10&#8722;6 and 7 &#215; 10&#8722;6, respectively. Experimentally, the signature of a zero&#8208;coupling regime is discovered in the form of a sign flip in the angular dispersion with resonant wavelength, which validates the scheme. Aside from triangulating a perfect decoupling configuration, one of the fabricated nanofin&#8208;isolated metasurfaces with Q&#8208;factor &gt;870 has a resonant wavelength that stays within the half linewidth for incident angles of &#8722;20&#176; to 20&#176;. This platform paves the way for combining precise wavefront shaping with highly efficient nonlinearity and rapid programmability.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels via the Synergy of Defect Elimination and Dual Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of tough hydrogel in single&#8208;network is developed by leveraging nanostructures as crosslinkers and initiators within free radical reactions to optimize the network imperfections, including spatial inhomogeneities and dangling&#8208;chain defects. The integration of dangling chains and dual crosslinking into the network offers substantial enhancements in the fracture toughness and fatigue resistance without compromising its low hysteresis.









Abstract
Network imperfections, such as multi&#8208;dispersed junctions and dangling chains, significantly impair the mechanical performance of hydrogels and elastomers synthesized via free radical reactions (FRRs). Great efforts have been made to introduce sacrificial structures to enhance toughness but cause pronounced hysteresis, leaving a comprehensive solution elusive. Herein, a class of robust single&#8208;network hydrogels with minimal imperfections is reported by employing nano&#8208;crosslinkers and nano&#8208;initiators to produce monodispersed crosslinking points and eliminate dangling&#8208;chain defects, in the formation of dual crosslinking of thiolate&#8208;Au bond and chemically covalent bond in the network. As a result, the hydrogel achieves a maximum fracture toughness (78&#8201;500 J m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (2480 J m&#8722;2), with over 13 and 55 fold increases attributed to the incorporation of dangling chains and dual crosslinking, respectively, without compromising its low hysteresis (0.07). Eliminating dangling chains also improves interfacial contact and osmotic pressure resistance, enabling exceptional underwater self&#8208;healing and swelling properties. Even with a high water&#8208;uptake of up to 95 wt.%, the swollen hydrogel exhibits stretchability exceeding 2000%, without obvious mechanical degradation after one month of water incubation. This work demonstrates a model system for developing resilient polymers with minimized imperfections derived from FRRs, showing numerous potential applications in underwater applications.

Great efforts have been made to introduce sacrificial structures to enhance toughness but cause pronounced hysteresis, leaving a comprehensive solution elusive. Herein, a class of robust single-network hydrogels with minimal imperfections is reported by employing nano-crosslinkers and nano-initiators to produce monodispersed crosslinking points and eliminate dangling-chain defects, in the formation of dual crosslinking of thiolate-Au bond and chemically covalent bond in the network. As a result, the hydrogel achieves a maximum fracture toughness (78&#8201;500 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and fatigue resistance (2480 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), with over 13 and 55 fold increases attributed to the incorporation of dangling chains and dual crosslinking, respectively, without compromising its low hysteresis (0.07). Eliminating dangling chains also improves interfacial contact and osmotic pressure resistance, enabling exceptional underwater self-healing and swelling properties. Even with a high water-uptake of up to 95 wt.%, the swollen hydrogel exhibits stretchability exceeding 2000%, without obvious mechanical degradation after one month of water incubation. This work demonstrates a model system for developing resilient polymers with minimized imperfections derived from FRRs, showing numerous potential applications in underwater applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystallinity&#8208;Induced Ion Rectification in Polymer/Zn Interphases for Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a macromolecular ordering&#8208;tuned interphase by leveraging the phase&#8208;separated hierarchical ion tunnels in semicrystalline polymers to address Zn/electrolyte interfacial issues. The PVA interphase, with lamellar orientation parallel to the Zn anode, achieves a balance between electrode protection and ionic conductivity, enabling rapid yet uniform Zn2+ transport and interfacial stability.








Abstract
The energy density and cycle life of aqueous zinc metal batteries are hindered by inherent chemical and mechanical instabilities at the Zn/electrolyte interface, causing uncontrolled dendrite formation and side reactions. Here, an anisotropic crystalline polymer interphase by leveraging the hierarchical structure to stabilize the interface is designed. The stabilization effect strongly depends on the crystallinity of polymer chains, where the one with optimal ion transfer possesses a preferred orientation of nanocrystals parallel to the Zn anode. This topological structure creates fast tunnel for ion transport that significantly enhances the kinetics and reversibility of electrochemical transformations. The ordered crystalline phase and disordered amorphous phase respectively blocks H&#8322;O penetration and provides Zn2&#8314; transport channels, reaching an optimum between electrode protection and ion transfer. Symmetric cells with the crystallinity&#8208;tuned interface demonstrate an exceptionally long lifespan exceeding 3000&#160;h at elevated current density and capacity of 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative plated capacity of 7500&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Zn/AC hybrid ion supercapacitor exhibits outstanding stability, enduring over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The work unveils new ordering&#8208;dependent ion transport in solid&#8208;state polymer interphase/electrolyte and provides a feasible approach for advancing grid&#8208;scale aqueous batteries.

         <title>Bilateral Anchoring for Enhanced Mechanical Stability and Efficiency in Flexible all&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilateral anchoring strategy using 2&#8208;bromoethylamine hydrobromide (2&#8208;BH) at PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface enhances interfacial adhesion and charger transfer in flexible Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells. The introduction of 2&#8208;BH additionally mitigates Sn2+ oxidation, thereby improving the film morphology and crystallinity. Overall, such optimized flexible all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.1% and present superior mechanical durability.








Abstract
Flexible all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) feature an outstanding power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio, rendering them perfect for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic, wearable electronics, and aerospace applications, owing to their adaptability to flexible and lightweight substrates. However, the weak mechanical adhesion between the perovskite and adjacent functional layers, combined with tin (Sn) oxidation at the buried interface in tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites solar cells (PSCs), substantially hampers the durability and performance of device. Herein, a bilateral anchoring strategy is proposed by employing 2&#8208;bromoethylamine hydrobromide (2&#8208;BH) at the NBG perovskite/ hole transporting layer (PEDOT:PSS) interface. The incorporation of 2&#8208;BH establishes robust bonds with both PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite layer, thereby enhancing interfacial adhesion and charge transfer. Meanwhile, the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films are also improved due to the mitigated oxidation of Sn2+. Thus, this approach yields flexible single&#8208;junction NBG &#160;with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5%, maintaining its 95% efficiency after 3000 bending cycles. When integrated into monolithic flexible all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, a certified PCE of 24.01% is achieved.

         <title>3D Printing&#8211;In Situ Curing of Soft Organogels Using Frontal Polymerizable Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frontal polymerization&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing strategy is developed to construct soft organogel materials with various architectures. The printed patterns are produced with high fidelity and integrity while saving energy.








Abstract
3D printing has gained immense recognition owing to its fascinating ability for rapid prototyping and customization. However, the current methods usually require post&#8208;processing (direct ink writing) or continuous energy input (stereolithography) for polymer gel curing. The former lowers the fidelity and integrity of the printed layers, whereas the latter suffers from high energy consumption. To address these issues, a frontal polymerization (FP)&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing method is developed to construct printable and polymerizable inks for acrylate&#8208;based monomers and soft organogel materials. Once initiated, no external energy supply is required, which allows for real&#8208;time conversion of monomers into polymers within seconds. Thus, the energy requirements are reduced by several orders of magnitude. More importantly, the printed structure is closely bonded, effectively avoiding the collapse and deformation of soft materials. The as&#8208;printed organogel is used as an evaporator and achieves a high water&#8208;evaporation rate of 3.77&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. This FP&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing strategy is an alternative, energy&#8208;saving method for fabricating soft materials, enabling high fidelity and integrity of printed patterns with wide applicability.

         <title>Magnetically Controlled Reversible Photomagnetic Nanoactuators for Dynamic Contrast Enhancement in Optical Coherence Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomagnetic nanoactuators with &#8776;90% scattering efficiency in the second near&#8208;infrared window are demonstrated to exhibit magnetic field&#8208;controlled modulation of optical scattering and optical coherence tomography signals. These nanoactuators are reversibly assembled and disassembled under the external magnetic field modulation, enabling enhanced particle&#8208;associated signal detection with suppressed background signal both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high&#8208;resolution imaging modality that detects scattered optical signals from light&#8211;tissue interaction. However, the ability of OCT to visualize specific molecular and cellular events is hindered by the lack of effective exogenous contrast agents capable of producing noticeable imaging contrast. Here, photomagnetic nanoactuators with &#8776;90% scattering efficiency in the second near&#8208;infrared window, capable of reversible magnetic field&#8208;mediated modulation of optical scattering and, therefore, OCT signal, are proposed. These nanoactuators consist of a magnetite core and gold shell, functioning as a reversible magnetic actuator and an optical scatterer, respectively. When exposed to the external magnetic field, photomagnetic nanoactuators are assembled into chain structures via magnetostatic interactions between nearby nanoactuators, reducing their optical scattering and, consequently, the OCT signal. Upon removal of the magnetic field, the nanoactuators are disassembled, restoring their scattering property and OCT signal. It is demonstrated that this magnetically controlled OCT response allows enhanced particle&#8208;associated signal detection with suppressed background signal via image subtraction before and after magnetic field treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. The developed nanoactuator platform offers a strategy for dynamic enhancement of OCT contrast, potentially broadening the utility of OCT for noninvasive cell tracking and molecular diagnostic imaging.

         <title>Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomer Lattices with Programmable Energy Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Architected liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) lattices with programmed alignment, stiffness, and enhanced energy absorption are created by direct ink writing. Their energy absorption behavior is measured across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude (10&#8722;3&#8211;103 s&#8722;1). LCEs exhibit a 18&#8208;fold improvement relative to non&#8208;mesogenic (silicone) lattices at the highest strain rate tested.








Abstract
Architected LCE lattices are fabricated with flow&#8208;induced alignment via direct ink writing and systematically characterized their shape morphing, stiffness, and energy absorption behavior across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude from 10&#8722;3 to 103 s&#8722;1. It is shown that architected liquid crystal elastomer&#160;(LCE) lattices exhibit superior energy absorption compared to their non&#8208;mesogenic (silicone) counterparts. Importantly, the LCE&#8208;to&#8208;silicone energy absorption ratios are up to 18&#8208;fold higher at the highest strain rate tested. A finite element model that captures their shape&#8208;morphing response is developed, which exhibits excellent agreement with the experimental observations. The work opens new avenues for designing and fabricating LCE lattices with programmable alignment, shape morphing, and mechanics.

         <title>Ancestral Protein&#8208;Based Lighting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>

The ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) method applied to a large dataset of modern fluorescent proteins (FPs) led to a bright ancestral&#8208;like FP suitable for photon down&#8208;conversion in bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes (Bio&#8208;HLEDs).









Abstract
Protein&#8208;optoelectronics is a paradigm toward eco&#8208;designed and sustainable technologies. The challenge is, however, how to preserve the native activity of proteins upon device fabrication/operation in non&#8208;native environments (solvents, organic/inorganic interfaces, and working temperatures/irradiations). Herein, a new vision to identify and design ancestral&#8208;like fluorescent proteins (FPs) is proposed. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) out of a large dataset (221) of the best modern FPs suitable for photon down&#8208;conversion in bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes (Bio&#8208;HLEDs) a historical&#8208;genetic reconstruction (family tree) was obtained, identifying a possible common ancestral FP. This computationally designed protein is produced in bacteria, featuring outstanding photoluminescence quantum yields in solution (e.g., 90%/80% for green&#8208;/red&#8208;emitting forms) and a strong tendency to agglomerate in polymer coatings. This resulted in red&#8208;emitting Bio&#8208;HLEDs that outperformed the reference with &#8776;2&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities. The resplendent green&#8208;/red&#8208;emission of ancestral&#8208;like FP itself and its respective devices led us to coin this new protein as QuetzalFP. Overall, it is set in ASR as an effective concept to reshape protein&#8208;optoelectronics allowing us to identify i) many interesting ancestral FPs for lighting and ii) QuetzalFP as stepping&#8208;stone platform for protein engineering.

         <title>Designing Maximal Strength in Nanolamellar Eutectic High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to guide the design of EHEAs with superior mechanical performance. The simulations reveal a peak tensile strength at a critical interphase boundary spacing. Below this spacing, the governing mechanism shifts from the Hall&#8211;Petch strengthening to dislocation multiplication&#8211;mediated softening.&#160; Guided by these insights, LPBF&#8208;fabricated EHEAs achieve a tensile strength of 1.8 GPa, approaching the theoretical limit and exceeding other as&#8208;printed high&#8208;entropy alloys.








Abstract
Eutectic alloys have driven technological advancements for centuries, from early bronze tools that marked the dawn of metallurgy to high&#8208;performance soldering materials. Building on this legacy, eutectic high&#8208;entropy alloys (EHEAs) have recently emerged to push the boundaries of mechanical performance. However, the strength potential of EHEAs remains largely untapped, primarily because of limitations in cooling rates, posing a significant challenge to the development of ultra&#8208;strong bulk EHEAs. This study employs large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations to uncover key insights into the design of EHEAs with exceptional mechanical performance. Simulations reveal that the maximum tensile strength occurs at a critical interphase boundary spacing, an order of magnitude larger than that observed in conventional alloys. Below this spacing, the governing mechanism shifts from the Hall&#8211;Petch strengthening to dislocation multiplication&#8211;mediated softening. Guided by the simulation insights, a tensile strength of 1.8&#160;GPa is achieved for laser powder bed fusion&#8211;fabricated EHEAs. This strength approaches the theoretical limit and outperforms other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art as&#8208;printed high&#8208;entropy alloys. This work not only establishes a viable pathway for designing ultra&#8208;strong EHEAs but also provides a promising avenue for addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of developing high&#8208;performance as&#8208;printed materials for aerospace and other demanding applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Complexity of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction in Layered Magnets: The Full Magnitude and Chirality Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In layered magnets, the atomistic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. The effect can be understood by analyzing the contributions of different orbitals to DMI. Both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI can be controlled through interface engineering.








Abstract
Chirality is one of the inherent characteristics of some objects in nature. In magnetism, chiral magnetic textures can be formed in systems with broken inversion symmetry and due to an antisymmetric magnetic interaction, known as Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, aiming for a fundamental understanding of this chiral interaction on the atomic scale, several synthetic layered structures composed of alternating atomic layers of 3d ferromagnetic metals epitaxially grown on the Ir(001) surface are designed. It is demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically that the atomistic DMI depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface magnetic layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. It is shown that even large atomistic DMI values can result in a small effective DMI, and conversely. Furthermore, the dependence of the effective DMI on the number of atomic layers deviates from a simple scaling law. These observations are attributed to the complexity of the electronic structure and the contributions of different orbitals to the hybridization and DMI. The results are&#160;anticipated to provide guidelines for achieving full control over both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI in layered materials.

         <title>Fueling IgA&#8208;Dominated Humoral Immunity with an Intranasal Hybrid Tumor Vaccine to Opsonize and Strike Epithelial Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the authors confirm that breast cancer cells can directly bind with IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)&#8208;mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumorigenic phenotype and antitumor response. To harness this biology, an intranasal tumor vaccine is designed, which can effectively combat primary and metastatic breast cancer through at least two independent mechanisms, including PIGR&#8208;IgA interaction and antigen recognition.








Abstract
Humoral immunity&#8208;cancer crosstalk has gained attention recently owing to its impact on tumor immune responses and therapy responsiveness. Here, it is shown that epithelial breast cancer cells can directly bind with non&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)&#8208;mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumoral inflammatory genes and sensitizing antitumor response. To harness this biology, a hybrid tumor vaccine is designed by covering the adjuvant&#8208;loaded cancer cell vesicles with a calcium phosphate shell, which retains the antigen information of the original tumor cells and exhibits robust mucosal adhesion in nasal tissues. Following intranasal vaccination, such a hybrid vaccine preferentially activates germinal center responses in nasal&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues and drives the production of tumoral antigen&#8208;specific IgA&#8208;dominated humoral immunity in both serum and lung through the property of &#8220;common mucosal immune system&#8221;, thus coordinating cellular immune responses to prevent lung colonization of IgA&#8208;opsonized breast cancer. In the inoperable and postoperative breast cancer model, intranasal vaccination with the hybrid vaccine also enables the amplification of the therapeutic benefits of local/systemic therapies.

     alt="Fueling IgA-Dominated Humoral Immunity with an Intranasal Hybrid Tumor Vaccine to Opsonize and Strike Epithelial Breast Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the authors confirm that breast cancer cells can directly bind with IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)-mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumorigenic phenotype and antitumor response. To harness this biology, an intranasal tumor vaccine is designed, which can effectively combat primary and metastatic breast cancer through at least two independent mechanisms, including PIGR-IgA interaction and antigen recognition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humoral immunity-cancer crosstalk has gained attention recently owing to its impact on tumor immune responses and therapy responsiveness. Here, it is shown that epithelial breast cancer cells can directly bind with non-antigen-specific IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)-mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumoral inflammatory genes and sensitizing antitumor response. To harness this biology, a hybrid tumor vaccine is designed by covering the adjuvant-loaded cancer cell vesicles with a calcium phosphate shell, which retains the antigen information of the original tumor cells and exhibits robust mucosal adhesion in nasal tissues. Following intranasal vaccination, such a hybrid vaccine preferentially activates germinal center responses in nasal-associated lymphoid tissues and drives the production of tumoral antigen-specific IgA-dominated humoral immunity in both serum and lung through the property of &#8220;common mucosal immune system&#8221;, thus coordinating cellular immune responses to prevent lung colonization of IgA-opsonized breast cancer. In the inoperable and postoperative breast cancer model, intranasal vaccination with the hybrid vaccine also enables the amplification of the therapeutic benefits of local/systemic therapies. In summary, this work presents insights into the antitumor biology of IgA in epithelial breast cancer and explores a highly effective vaccine strategy focused on governing IgA-dominated humoral immunity to combat breast cancer, especially lung metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Hollow Carbon Microspheres Enable Superior Electromagnetic Wave Response and Corrosion Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon microspheres with superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced. As results, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;57.5 dB and an absorption bandwidth of 5.67 GHz are achieved. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that dual passivation effects provide a barrier to hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with corrosion barrier exhibit immense potential in meeting the requirements of electronic defense technology in the complex marine environments, but still confront conflicts in disentangling the trade&#8208;off of multifunctional applications. Herein, hollow carbon microspheres (HCMs) that simultaneously possess superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced with the aid of self&#8208;sacrificing templates. During the pyrolysis, the reductive characteristic of Zn microspheres and thermal driving force promote magnetic domain evolution, which enables optimized hetero&#8208;interface resonance and strong magnetic interactions, facilitating a minimum reflection loss lower than &#8722;40 dB and a wide absorption bandwidth greater than 5 GHz. Furthermore, HCMs&#8208;900 with both anion&#8208;repulsion characteristics and better resistance can partially reduce the adsorption/accumulation of corrosive species and decrease the charge&#8208;carrying ability, and the inevitably generated by&#8208;products of layered double hydroxides with strong anion&#8208;capture ability can hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface, resulting in superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability. This innovative strategy inspires us with a motivated pathway for the rational design of advanced multifunctional anti&#8208;corrosive EM absorbing materials.

         <title>Water Oxidation to Hydrogen Peroxide Over a Super&#8208;Aerophilic Graphite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of super&#8208;aerophilic graphite catalyst capable of trapping in situ produced oxygen gas on its surface under the electrolyte environment. By so doing, it is able to moderate intermediate species&#160;binding, which is critical to enabling the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8208;WOR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive anode reaction with several merits. It can be paired with several large&#8208;scale cathode reactions that produce valuable chemical substances in an electrochemical cell. However, high&#8208;performing and reliable 2e&#8208;WOR anodic catalysts are yet to be fully developed. In this work, a rationally designed, inexpensive, robust, and selective graphite catalyst electrode is presented, made by following the key principle mechanisms of 2e&#8208;WOR. First, an aerophilic graphite&#8208;based electrode is created to leverage the challenges posed by the four&#8208;electron WOR, where&#160;the generated O2 from this reaction is kept onto the electrode surface to shift the O intermediates binding on graphite in the direction of improved H2O2 generation. An initial improvement in H2O2 selectivity of seven fold is observed, albeit with no improved H2O2 generation rates. The stunted H2O2 generation is ascribed to poor activity from pristine graphite, courtesy of less active sites and low intrinsic O2 binding in the electrolyte environment. Second, to improve and balance graphite's activity and selectivity, the structure of graphite is altered via different elemental doping (with N, S, B, and P atoms), a method that allows the retention of the O2 on the graphite surface. The super&#8208;aerophilic B&#8208;doped graphite catalyst (optimum) reaches a maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of 60.6 &#177; 2.6% with a production rate of 26.7 &#177; 0.6 &#181;mol min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (85.9 &#177; 2.2 mA cm&#8722;2 partial current density) and excellent stability of over 120 h. In tandem, cathodic H2 co&#8208;production is demonstrated with an FE of above 90%. This approach demonstrates a rational approach to designing inexpensive and robust 2e&#8208;WOR anode catalysts for H2O2 and the possibility of its use in chemical co&#8208;production at the cathode.

Employing an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A'&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#160;structural motif, single&#8208;component small&#8208;molecule mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors with ion&#8208;dependent ambipolarity are first developed for organic electrochemical transistors and inverters featuring ultrathin channel layers. Their outstanding figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit, remarkable voltage gains, and adaptability for ternary/quaternary logic operations signify significant advances in this field, highlighting their potential as versatile platforms for organic (bio)electronics with high sensitivity and high&#8208;density integration.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component, ultrathin ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) combined with multivalued logic (MVL) circuits offer new opportunities for advancing next&#8208;generation bioelectronic systems due to their low&#8208;power consumption, manufacturing simplicity, and high&#8208;density integration, central to which is the evolution of ambipolar organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) as channel materials. However, small&#8208;molecule analogues remain unexplored to date for lack of well&#8208;defined molecular strategies. Herein, first two acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type vinyl&#8208;linked bis&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;core ambipolar small&#8208;molecule OMIECs are developed featuring multiple conformational locks. It is discovered that grafting shortened glycolated sidechains produces stronger solid&#8208;state aggregation, tighter lamellar stacking, and higher crystallinity, consequently elevating the ambipolar &#181;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit by over fourfold. Furthermore, the skillful manipulation of anionic species to facilitate oxidation doping enables significant increasement in p&#8208;type &#181;C* (170 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a record&#8208;high n&#8208;type &#181;C* of 360 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, especially at a channel thickness of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm. Crucially, single&#8208;component OECT&#8208;based inverters constructed therefrom are for the first time demonstrated to accommodate ternary/quaternary logic, achieving a remarkable gain of 135&#160;V/V. This work not only provides an effective molecular design strategy for creating high&#8208;performing ultrathin&#8208;film ambipolar small&#8208;molecule OMIECs, highlighting ionic doping effect on ambipolarity, but also demonstrates their potential in MVL circuits for organic bioelectronics applications.

By combining the advantages of two&#8208;dimensional (2D)two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and 2D topological insulators, the Bi2Te3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is constructed to achieve ultra&#8208;high and stable optoelectronic sensing characteristics. The device shows an average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power and 32 controllable conductive states. The semi&#8208;hardware neuromorphic system based on it achieved a 97.68% classification accuracy in low orbit satellite image recognition tasks.









Abstract
As the application of artificial vision systems continues to grow, developing efficient and low&#8208;power visual sensing devices has become a key challenge. Memristors offer tunable conductivity and integrated in&#8208;situ storage and computation functions, making them ideal for low&#8208;cost visual systems. However, most memristors currently face the dual challenges of poor stability and limited optoelectronic synaptic plasticity. Here, a Bi2Te2.7Se0.3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is designed, which combines the advantages of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) topological insulators and 2D ferroelectric materials. The hetero&#8208;memristor performance can be tuned by the SnSe ferroelectric polarization and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 topological surface state, which improve the utilization and mobility of carriers, thereby significantly improving the performance. The high 104&#8208;cycle stability, average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power, and 25 conductive states are achieved. Under different signals, the hetero&#8208;memristor can enable in situ light&#8208;electric conversion and successfully simulate various optoelectronic plasticity behaviors, such as paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, post&#8208;tetanic potentiation, spike rate&#8208;dependent plasticity, etc. Mean while, an efficient in&#8208;situ bionic&#8208;visual semi&#8208;hardware system is constructed based on the 28 &#215; 28 perception hetero&#8208;memristor array. This system efficiently performs satellite image recognition and classification, achieving an accuracy of 97.68%. The research shows that the Bi2Te2.7Se0.3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is with&#160;excellent optoelectronic performances and broad application prospects, particularly in brain&#8208;like computing, smart hardware, and storage technologies.

         <title>Cloud Inspired White and Grey Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Camouflaged Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by clouds' role in Earth's thermal management, this work presents disordered plasmonic metasurfaces that mimic their radiative effects. The white metasurface enhances backscattering, acting as a cooling layer with camouflage properties. The grey state suppresses backscattering and enhances light trapping, surpassing conventional black absorbers. These metasurfaces enable advancements in camouflage, low&#8208;emissivity coatings, and thermal infrared stealth technologies.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's color&#8208;driven thermal regulation mechanisms and the atmospheric radiative effects of cloud&#8208;aerosol interactions, this work presents the design of disordered metasurfaces capable of achieving white and grey plasmonic colors. This innovation advances light and thermal management technologies within the framework of stealth and camouflage applications. The white plasmonic metasurfaces emulate the cooling effects of clouds, reducing substrate temperatures by a relative &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C under standard solar illumination through backscattering. In contrast, transitioning to a grey state with a nanocomposite absorber suppresses backscattering and enables efficient light trapping, resulting in a relative +10 &#160;&#176;C temperature increase compared to conventional black absorbers. These findings introduce a novel approach to localized thermal management, distinct from traditional passive cooling strategies that rely on high&#8208;emissivity materials. The metasurfaces&#8217; low&#8208;emissivity properties and visible appearance open opportunities in advanced camouflage, stealth technologies, and thermal energy solutions. Additionally, the scalable, sustainable design, realized through all&#8208;in&#8208;chamber nanofabrication via sputtering, eliminates the need for chemically intensive synthesis methods while ensuring long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fluorogen&#8208;Activating Human Serum Albumin for Mitochondrial Nanoscale Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogen&#8208;activating HSA engineered via confinement fluorescence enhances brightness, minimizes phototoxicity, and achieves superior cell permeability for nanoscale mitochondrial imaging. Co&#8208;crystal structure reveals HSA immobilizes the fluorophore in hydrophobic cavities via &#945;&#8208;type binding, restricting torsional motions for high quantum yields. Theoretical calculations elucidate excited&#8208;state dynamics. AmpHecy@HSA enables low&#8208;phototoxicity super&#8208;resolution mitochondrial imaging in living cells, expanding fluorogenic toolkit for mitochondrial science.








Abstract
Fluorescence nanoscopy of living cells employs contrast agents to reveal intrinsic correlations between mitochondrial dynamics and functions at the molecular level. However, regular mitochondrial fluorophores usually present poor photostability, low brightness, non&#8208;specific inhibitory effects, high phototoxicity, and rapid photobleaching, which have hindered the use of these tools to capture the intricate dynamic features of mitochondria. Herein, we engineered a fluorogen&#8208;activating protein (FAP), AmpHecy@HSA, a non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of HSA and amphiphilic hemicyanine (AmpHecy) fluorophore, with exceptional cell permeability, long&#8208;lasting photostability, high brightness/fluorogenicity, and minimal phototoxicity. Crystallography and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy techniques were combined to elucidate the structural and mechanistic intricacies of fluorescence activation. These findings revealed that fluorophore photoactivation happens through the molecular conformation&#8208;induced intramolecular charge transfer, whose kinetics is mainly determined by the hydrophobic interaction between the fluorophore and nearby amino acids. This aligns with classical molecular dynamics simulations and excited&#8208;state conformation quantum mechanics. It was further demonstrated that AmpHecy@HSA can be used for super&#8208;resolved images of mitochondria within living cells without apparent phototoxicity. This work expands the fluorescent toolkit based on FAP engineering for studying live&#8208;cell mitochondrial morphology and function, advancing the fields of chemistry and biomedicine.

         <title>Artesunate Nanoplatform Targets the Serine&#8211;MAPK Axis in Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts to Reverse Photothermal Resistance in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artesunate nanoplatform selectively targets ECM CAF, functioning as a GTPase inhibitor through disruption of intracellular serine homeostasis. This metabolic intervention effectively suppresses MAPK cascade activity, which consequently inhibits PTT&#8208;induced CAF to ECM CAF differentiation. By attenuating this phenotypic transition, the nanoplatform significantly reduces the formation of TRB structure, ultimately enhancing tumor sensitivity to PTT.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in inducing photothermal therapy (PTT) resistance of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), but with unclear mechanism. Herein, aminoethyl anisamide&#8208;modified nano&#8208;biomimetic low&#8208;density lipoprotein (A&#8208;aLDL) is used to target deliver the PTT agent and artesunate (ARS) to both CAFs and cancer cells. Though CAFs are sensitive to PTT and notably transition to heat&#8208;resistant phenotype, the formed protective barrier is destroyed by ARS. Subsequently, the outstanding anti&#8208;tumor effects are achieved through PTT in multiple models with such kind of combination therapy. Interestingly, the mechanism is discovered that serine metabolism plays a major role in CAF resistance through spatially omics. ARS disrupts serine homeostasis, thereby attenuating the cascade activity of GTPases in MAPK pathway. Meanwhile, MAP2K7 is the most potential target for sensitizing PTT. By integrating ARS with PTT agents, the serine&#8208;MAPK axis in CAFs is successfully modulated, thereby overcoming PTT resistance in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Organic AIE Nanoradiosensitizer Potentiates X&#8208;Ray Triggered Continuous Reactive Oxygen Species Generation for Potent Cancer Radioimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a glutathione&#8208;responsive system (named THN) is prepared for X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. The double&#8208;promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN&#8208;sensitized RT inhibited post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and increased memory T&#8208;cell proportion for long&#8208;term antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Organic radiosensitizers (ORSs), with structural versatility, hold promise for sensitizing radiotherapy (RT) by interacting with X&#8208;ray photons to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). They often consist of low&#8208;Z elements that have inherently low X&#8208;ray deposition capability. However, current ORSs suffer from short circulation half&#8208;lives and low tumor retention, contradicting their requirements for sustained ROS generation upon RT in tumor sites. Herein, a glutathione&#8208;responsive system is prepared, loaded with aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecules (TPEPy&#8208;I) and Ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride (Hemin), to act as an ORS (named THN) for X&#8208;ray triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. In detail, THN effectively deposited X&#8208;ray photons, which interact with water molecules to generate abundant ROS under external radiation.

The double&#8208;promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN&#8208;sensitized RT inhibited tumor recurrence and increased memory T&#8208;cell proportion for long&#8208;term antitumor immunity. The developed ORS has great clinical potential as both a radiosensitizer and a post&#8208;RT immunomodulatory agent.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, a glutathione-responsive system (named THN) is prepared for X-ray-triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. The double-promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN-sensitized RT inhibited post-surgery tumor recurrence and increased memory T-cell proportion for long-term antitumor immunity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic radiosensitizers (ORSs), with structural versatility, hold promise for sensitizing radiotherapy (RT) by interacting with X-ray photons to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). They often consist of low-Z elements that have inherently low X-ray deposition capability. However, current ORSs suffer from short circulation half-lives and low tumor retention, contradicting their requirements for sustained ROS generation upon RT in tumor sites. Herein, a glutathione-responsive system is prepared, loaded with aggregation-induced emission molecules (TPEPy-I) and Ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride (Hemin), to act as an ORS (named THN) for X-ray triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. In detail, THN effectively deposited X-ray photons, which interact with water molecules to generate abundant ROS under external radiation. Subsequently, THN-mediated radiosensitization stimulated tumor cells to produce hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by upregulating NOX4 protein, promoting the chemodynamic process of Hemin reacting with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to continuously produce hydroxyl radicals. The double-promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN-sensitized RT inhibited tumor recurrence and increased memory T-cell proportion for long-term antitumor immunity. The developed ORS has great clinical potential as both a radiosensitizer and a post-RT immunomodulatory agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Materials Evolution by Programmed Twisting: a DNA&#8208;Inspired Ultrastrong Supercoiled Conformational Fiber for Energy&#8208;Storage and Buffering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the supercoiled conformational structures and behaviors of the DNA chain, a material evolution strategy via supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) is proposed to achieve a number of extra&#8208;ordinary properties/functions, including pseudo&#8208;entropic elasticity, high&#8208;performance torsional energy&#8208;storage, stimulus&#8208;triggered energy release, impact buffering, and self&#8208;reinforcement.








Abstract
The conformational folding/unfolding behaviors of DNA supercoils serve as a fundamental mechanism governing ultradense bio&#8208;information storage and precise genetic transcription. Mimicking those nanoscale dynamic conformational behaviors for macroscopic materials to achieve unusual functionalities will be of great interest but remains unexplored. Herein, a DNA&#8208;inspired materials evolution paradigm is presented to create multifunctional supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) by programmed twisting controlled self&#8208;buckling. Through the programmed twist&#8208;stress modulation, a low&#8208;density polyethylene strip is transformed into high&#8208;performance DNA&#8208;like SCF through a unique multiscale microstructure evolution process. This DNA&#8208;like SCF exhibits five hallmark characteristics unattainable before, including ultra&#8208;large elastic deformability (900 &#177; 50%), metal&#8208;level mechanical strength (330 &#177; 30&#160;MPa), unprecedented torsional energy&#8208;storage density (16.1 &#177; 0.6&#160;kJ&#160;kg&#8722;1), torsional energy release upon appropriate stimulations, and impact buffering through conformation&#8208;mediated energy&#8208;dissipation. Characterization reveals that these unexpected energy&#8208;related properties mainly are contributed by the multiscale twisting&#8208;reinforced microstructures and conformation mechanics. Potential applications of the SCFs are demonstrated finally by harvest&#8208;and&#8208;storage of wind energy and soft&#8208;landing. The DNA&#8208;like SCFs indicate a general platform for materials evolution with extraordinary mechanics and functions.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Polymer Brushes Enables Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Stable Operation under Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>

A multifunctional polymer brush (G&#8208;pGMAAQ) is fabricated through molecular engineering strategies. G&#8208;pGMAAQ can act as a redox mediator to reduce the polysulfides conversion energy barriers, and its unique polar brush structure effectively inhibits polysulfides shuttling and homogenizes lithium&#8208;ion fluxes, enabling lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries for stable operation from &#8722;40 to 70&#160;&#176;C.









Abstract
Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is a critical target for the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. However, intense lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling at high&#8208;temperature, sluggish sulfur species conversion, and inhomogeneous Li+ deposition at low&#8208;temperature severely impair the cycle lifespan of batteries. Herein, the multifunctional polymer brushes are fabricated by grafting anthraquinone&#8208;functionalized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) brushes on graphene surfaces (G&#8208;pGMAAQ) to simultaneously regulate the evolution of sulfur and lithium species. Combining theoretical calculations and experiments, it is revealed that G&#8208;pGMAAQ serves as a redox mediator that reduces the LiPSs conversion energy barrier, and its unique polar brush&#8208;like structure effectively inhibits LiPSs shuttling and homogenizes Li+ flow. Hence, G&#8208;pGMAAQ facilitates lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries stable operation in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;70&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell achieves an energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, demonstrating the commercial potential of polymer brushes for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Achieving Tunable Amplified Spontaneous Emission in Rb&#8208;Cs Alloyed Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites with Low Threshold and Exceptional Spectral Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with low&#8208;threshold ASEs and exceptional spectral stability are synthesized. Tuning Rb&#8208;Cs ratio enables broad ASE tunability across blue and green regions. Alloying optimizes the inter&#8208;well energy transfer and suppresses Auger recombination, yielding a record&#8208;low ASE threshold, &#8776;50% lower than mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. Their micro&#8208;ring laser arrays exhibit high Q&#8208;factors and low thresholds, showcasing superior lasing performance.








Abstract
Blue&#8208;green lasers are essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. While GaN&#8208;InGaN lasers offer excellent performance, their complex fabrication and challenges in precise bandgap tuning remain significant limitations. Hybrid lead halide perovskites present a promising alternative, with tunable bandgaps and cost&#8208;effective solution processing. However, halide migration in these materials causes spectral instability and luminescence shifts under operational conditions. Here, a novel class of Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed quasi&#8208;2D perovskites is introduced that achieve both low amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds and exceptional spectral stability. By precisely tuning the Rb&#8208;Cs ratio, it realizes ASE across the blue&#8208;green spectrum (481&#8211;532&#160;nm). Rb&#8208;Cs alloying critically modulates the quantum well distribution, optimizes the energy landscape, and suppresses Auger recombination, resulting in a record&#8208;low ASE threshold of 1.94 &#181;J&#183;cm&#8722;2&#8212;over 50% lower than that of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. These materials exhibit remarkable spectral robustness, with ASE spectra remaining stable even after prolonged thermal annealing, thereby overcoming halide migration&#8208;induced degradation. Furthermore, micro&#8208;ring laser arrays fabricated from these Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed perovskites demonstrate superior lasing characteristics, including high&#8208;quality whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode resonances and low lasing thresholds, underscoring their potential for advanced laser technologies.

         <title>Suppressing Metal Dissolution in Multi&#8208;Grained Catalysts Through Intragrain Atomic Ordering for Stable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach room&#8208;temperature ultrasound assisted atomic ordering method using to fabricate multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanoalloys with an intermetallic Ni3Pt5 phase. The resulting catalyst exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability and activity in all operational condition of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Structural and electrochemical analyses reveal direct the role of atomic ordering in mitigating metal dissolution, ensuring long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Rational design of catalytic nanomaterials is essential for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cell catalysts. However, structural degradation and elemental dissolution during operation pose significant challenges to achieving long&#8208;term stability. Herein, the development of multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanocatalysts featuring an atomically ordered Ni3Pt5 phase within intragrain is reported. Ultrasound&#8208;assisted synthesis facilitates atomic transposition by supplying sufficient diffusion energy along grain boundaries, enabling unprecedented phase formation. The Ni3Pt5 embedded nanocatalysts exhibit outstanding proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance under both light&#8208;duty and heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, with significantly reduced Ni dissolution. Under light&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, the catalyst achieves a mass activity of 0.94 A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 and a 421 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density (@ 0.8 V in air), retaining 78% of its initial mass activity after long&#8208;term operation. Under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, the multi&#8208;grained nanocrystal demonstrates only an 8% decrease in Pt utilization, a 5% power loss, and a 13 mV voltage drop, surpassing U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&#160;durability targets. This study underscores the critical role of the atomically ordered Ni3Pt5 phase in stabilizing multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanocrystals, enhancing both durability and catalytic activity. These findings establish Ni3Pt5 embedded nanocatalysts as promising candidate for next&#8208;generation PEMFC applications, addressing key challenges in long&#8208;term operation.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a novel approach room-temperature ultrasound assisted atomic ordering method using to fabricate multi-grained NiPt nanoalloys with an intermetallic Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; phase. The resulting catalyst exhibits state-of-the-art durability and activity in all operational condition of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Structural and electrochemical analyses reveal direct the role of atomic ordering in mitigating metal dissolution, ensuring long-term stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational design of catalytic nanomaterials is essential for developing high-performance fuel cell catalysts. However, structural degradation and elemental dissolution during operation pose significant challenges to achieving long-term stability. Herein, the development of multi-grained NiPt nanocatalysts featuring an atomically ordered Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; phase within intragrain is reported. Ultrasound-assisted synthesis facilitates atomic transposition by supplying sufficient diffusion energy along grain boundaries, enabling unprecedented phase formation. The Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; embedded nanocatalysts exhibit outstanding proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance under both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicle conditions, with significantly reduced Ni dissolution. Under light-duty vehicle conditions, the catalyst achieves a mass activity of 0.94 A&#160;mg&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a 421 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density (@ 0.8 V in air), retaining 78% of its initial mass activity after long-term operation. Under heavy-duty vehicle conditions, the multi-grained nanocrystal demonstrates only an 8% decrease in Pt utilization, a 5% power loss, and a 13 mV voltage drop, surpassing U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&#160;durability targets. This study underscores the critical role of the atomically ordered Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; phase in stabilizing multi-grained NiPt nanocrystals, enhancing both durability and catalytic activity. These findings establish Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; embedded nanocatalysts as promising candidate for next-generation PEMFC applications, addressing key challenges in long-term operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrathin Membrane with Bubble&#8208;Raft&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Layer Nanofibrous Networks for Efficient and Low&#8208;Resistance Air Filtration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bubble&#8208;raft&#8208;inspired nanofibrous network membrane for efficient and low&#8208;resistance air filtration is fabricated via electrospinning and phase separation. Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer polysulfone nanofibrous network (&#8776;40 nm fiber diameter), the obtained membrane exhibits integrated structural features of small pore size, high porosity, and ultrathin thickness, which endows it with high filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, and high transparency.








Abstract
Airborne particulate matter (PM) is a major global safety concern, significantly straining the ecological environment, human health, and economy. Filtration membranes, essential for PM removal, are challenging in achieving both high efficiency and low air resistance, resulting in a high pressure drop during efficient filtration. Herein, inspired by bubble rafts, an ultrathinnanofibrous network membrane is fabricated by transforming a liquid film of polysulfonesolution on electrospun fibrous scaffold into a single&#8208;layer network via nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation. Tailoring of the polysulfone concentration in the liquid film supported by the scaffold and of the phase separation process induced by flowing nonsolvent allows the construction of the single&#8208;layer network with interconnected nanofibers (diameter of &#8776;40&#160;nm). Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer network, the membrane exhibits a small pore size (&#8776;270&#160;nm) at a high porosity of 90.3% and ultrathin thickness of &#8776;800&#160;nm. Consequently, the membrane shows high efficiency (99.8% removal of PM0.3) at an ultralow pressure drop (&lt;40&#160;Pa). Moreover, the membrane exhibits high transparency (&gt;83%) and allows the light breeze (wind speed of 3.2 m s&#8722;1) to pass through easily, enabling energy&#8208;efficient applications, such as window screens. This work provides new insights into designing membranes for efficient and low&#8208;resistance filtration and separation.

         <title>Magnetic Moment Descriptor&#8208;Guided Multifunctional Co Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enable Wide&#8208;Temperature Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CoN4&#8208;X configurations are screened using density functional theory (DFT) simulations through second coordination sphere anion modulation (X = B, O, F, P, S, Cl). The magnetic moment is revealed as a critical descriptor for establishing dual volcano&#8208;type correlations with both chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy of reaction&#8208;related intermediates.








Abstract
Developing chloride ion&#8208;resistant trifunctional catalysts is imperative and of great significance for application in renewable energy&#8208;driven seawater splitting systems (S&#8208;WSS). However, there is currently a lack of unified descriptors for the rational design of catalysts that possess both high corrosion resistance and excellent catalytic activity. Herein, the magnetic moment is proposed as the descriptor through second&#8208;coordination&#8208;shell anion engineering of CoN&#8324; moieties (named as CoN4&#8208;X, X = B/O/F/P/S/Cl). Systematic density functional theory calculations reveal that precisely modulating the spin states of CoN&#8324; centers via X&#8208;anion coordination establishes dual volcano&#8208;type relationships between magnetic moments and the adsorption energetics of Cl&#8315; ions or key reaction intermediates for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR/OER/HER). Experimental validation demonstrates the optimized CoN&#8324;&#8208;B configuration&#8208;based catalyst (Co SAs&#8208;N/B&#8208;HCS) achieves minimized Cl&#8315; adsorption energy while delivering exceptional trifunctional ORR/OER/HER activity, as well as excellent stability in chloride ion&#8208;rich seawater&#8208;based environments (over 1000 h for seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air batteries, over 800 h for seawater splitting). Notably, the Co SAs&#8208;N/B&#8208;HCS enables temperature&#8208;adaptive hydrogen production rates of 853 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (60&#160;&#176;C), 616 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (25&#160;&#176;C), and 397 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C). This work establishes a spin state engineering paradigm that simultaneously addresses catalyst corrosion and trifunctional synergy in marine energy systems.

         <title>A Hydrogen&#8208;Aided Rechargeable Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
By leveraging the faster kinetics and lower overpotential of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen&#8208;coupled charging enables the zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) to achieve ultra&#8208;fast and stable cycling performance with superior safety, which positions hydrogen aided battery&#160;(HAB) as a promising solution for electric vehicles to address challenges such as range anxiety and prolonged charging times.








Abstract
Rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries, despite their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, suffer from sluggish cathodic reaction kinetics, resulting in high overpotential and low energy efficiency. In this study, a hydrogen&#8208;aided battery (HAB) based on zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) technology, which retains the discharge process of ZAB while introducing hydrogen gas into the cathode during charging, is proposed. The introduction of hydrogen replaces the conventional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of ZAB. Leveraging the faster kinetics and lower overpotential of HOR, the hydrogen&#8208;coupled charging enables ultra&#8208;fast and stable charging (9 s to 1 mAh cm&#8722;2) with over 200 cycles. Compared to lithium&#8208;ion batteries and fuel cells, HAB exhibits superior safety by eliminating the need for flammable electrolytes and portable hydrogen storage devices. The simultaneous &#8220;refueling&#8221; of hydrogen and electricity offers rapid energy replenishment, positioning HAB as a transformative technology for electric vehicles to address key challenges such as range anxiety and prolonged charging durations. This work not only advances the performance of metal&#8211;air batteries but also provides an innovative strategy for integrating hydrogen energy into electrochemical systems.

PiRO generates up to 500 nm thick layers with through&#8208;plane 5&#8211;10 nm spheroidal close&#8208;packed pores at 230&#160;&#176;C in 30 min or less. The reduced temperatures enable deposition on both rigid and flexible polymeric substrates using roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll compatible techniques.









Abstract
Structured metal oxide films have promise in optoelectronics, sensing, energy storage, and catalysis but their uptake is predominately limited due to their long and high&#8208;temperature syntheses. Here, a self&#8208;assembling polymer is used which can act as a chelating fuel source in a solution combustion reaction to generate highly structured mesoporous aluminum oxide films at &lt;250&#160;&#176;C in a matter of minutes through a process termed porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO). The resulting films with thicknesses up to 500 nm show an open&#8208;cell, face&#8208;centered cubic structure of spheroidal pores. Further, an additional ligand can be included to control the self&#8208;assembly step to yield both through&#8208;film ordering or tunable disordering for increased pore volume as confirmed by both grazing incidence small angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ellipsometry. Finally, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing with PiRO is demonstrated on flexible polymeric substrates. The method offers a tunable, scalable, low&#8208;temperature, and lower&#8208;cost method to generate large&#8208;area structured mesoporous metal oxide films.

         <title>A Broad Range of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids for Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>

Machine learning identifies key spectroscopic features of aromatic carboxylic acids that enable selective photocatalytic oxygen activation and oxidation of CH&#8324; to methyl trifluoroacetate.








Abstract
Photocatalytic methane (CH&#8324;) activation under mild conditions presents a sustainable strategy for converting methane into valuable chemicals. This study introduces a versatile class of conjugated aromatic carboxylic acids as efficient, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for CH&#8324; oxidation in sodium chloride&#8208;trifluoroacetic acid (NaCl&#8208;TFA) media. Spectroscopic analysis and machine learning using spectroscopic features further elucidate key structural and electronic factors influencing catalytic activity, offering predictive insights for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. The carboxyl group is important in generating electron&#8208;deficient carboxyl (RC(&#9552;O)O&#8226;) or carboperoxyl radicals (RC(&#9552;O)OO&#8226;), enabling selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for CH&#8324; functionalization. Mechanistic investigations indicate the role of acyl chloride intermediates in enhancing reactivity. This work highlights the potential of aromatic carboxylic acids to address the challenges of methane functionalization, paving the way for greener chemical transformations and the utilization of inert feedstocks in sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Spheres with Tunable Helical Structure for Accurate and Efficient Control of Sugar Blood Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter sized spheres with an inner helical structure are designed. Phacus helicoides can &#8216;mix&#8217; their surrounding medium which facilitates the acquirement of nutrients from the environment and the excretion of metabolites into the environment. Similar to Phacus helicoides, HSs can generate mixing performance under magnetic field, which led to the enhancement toward the adsorption, catalyze, and release capacities of HSs.








Abstract
Oral antidiabetic drugs remain the primary therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to its convenience, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and non&#8208;invasive, while achieving glycemic control in &gt;60% of patients. However, compromised bioavailability of oral antidiabetic drugs frequently leads to drug&#8208;induced hypoglycemia (sulfonylureas like glibenclamide), posing significant clinical risks. To address this issue, microstirring oral pills are designed but various challenges remain, including uncontrollable release and low biocompatibility. Here, inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter&#8208;sized spheres with an inner helical structure are designed. Owing to their inner spiral structure, helical spheres (HSs) can simultaneously self&#8208;rotate and move circularly, giving them excellent and controllable mixing capacity via an external magnetic field. Moreover, HSs can imitate metabolic processes, including the adsorption, catalysis, and release capacity of Phacus helicoides, which can effectively reduce postprandial blood glucose levels (&lt;2&#160;h) in rats with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, these novel microstirring oral spheres with inner helical structure can reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia (14.2&#8208;18.6%) of the traditional sulfanilamide drug (glibenclamide) to 3.8%. Thus, it is anticipated that HSs have a potential for drug delivery as microstrring oral pills to improve bioavailability and avoid the drug&#8208;induced hypoglycemia of T2DM patients.

         <title>High Performance P&#8208;Channel Transistor Based on Amorphous Tellurium Trioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a breakthrough in p&#8208;channel transistors by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a&#8208;TeO3) via UV&#8208;O3 treatment. This transformation enhances electronic properties, resulting in transistors with reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and low barrier height, highlighting the potential of a&#8208;TeO3 as a novel semiconductor for future advancements in transistor technology.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;channel transistors remains a critical challenge in complementary logic circuits, despite significant advances in n&#8208;channel transistor technologies. While amorphous oxide semiconductors have revolutionized n&#8208;type transistors, achieving comparable performance for p&#8208;type counterparts has proven elusive. Here, this study demonstrates a breakthrough in p&#8208;channel technology by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium (2D&#8208;Te) into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a&#8208;TeO3) through UV ozone treatment. This structural transformation, directly observed via high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, induces dramatic changes in electronic properties, including significant bandgap widening and enhanced work function. The resulting a&#8208;TeO3&#8208;based p&#8208;channel transistors demonstrate remarkable improvements over crystalline 2D&#8208;Te transistors, featuring reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and distinctive mobility behavior at different temperatures and gate fields. Most notably, these transistors achieve exceptionally low barrier height (10 meV) and sheet resistance values, while combining high hole mobility with excellent switching properties. The work not only introduces a novel high&#8208;performance p&#8208;channel semiconductor but also opens new avenues for phase engineering in advanced semiconductor development.

         <title>Synthetic Chromatophores for Color and Pattern Morphing Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephalopods use chromatophore organs (muscle&#8208;actuated pigment sacs) to alter their skin color and pattern. Synthetic chromatophores, which closely mimic the mechano&#8208;optical process found in cephalopods using stimuli&#8208;responsive microscale hydrogel actuators, are reported. Hierarchical organization and morphological control of these synthetic chromatophores enable inherently stretchable skins with color and pattern morphing capabilities and rapid response times.








Abstract
The dynamic optical and mechanical properties of cephalopod skin cannot be mimicked using traditional display technologies. Soft materials (and systems thereof) have the potential to realize cephalopod&#8208;like color switching capabilities synthetically. This report describes the fabrication of stretchable arrays of microstructured, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels, &#8220;synthetic chromatophores,&#8221; that emulate the mechano&#8208;dynamic action of color change found in cephalopods. By combining multiple layers of these synthetic chromatophores, soft skins with color and pattern morphing capabilities that leverage halftone absorption, optical interference, and microlensing are demonstrated. These skins, made entirely of soft materials, are inherently stretchable and can be programmed to respond to specific environmental stimuli, making them well&#8208;suited for applications in soft robotics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Bioinspired Rechargeable Cement&#8208;Based Batteries for Low&#8208;Carbon Self&#8208;Powered Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired conifer&#8208;like rechargeable cement&#8208;based batteries for low&#8208;carbon self&#8208;powered buildings is reported. This direction pore structure enhances ionic conductivity by four times (32.7 mS cm&#8722;1), while maintaining high mechanical strength (41.6 MPa). The cement&#8208;based battery delivers a remarkable capacity of 114 mAh g&#8722;1 and retaining 63.2% of capacity after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Cement&#8208;based batteries (CEMBs) uniquely integrate energy storage and load&#8208;bearing functions, offering transformative potential for self&#8208;powered and sustainable buildings. Unfortunately, their application is greatly hindered by low capacity and limited cycle life. The high tortuosity of ion transport at the centimeter scale, and sluggish kinetics at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces in CEMBs are the two main reasons for the limited energy storage performance. Herein, these issues by designing vertically aligned pore channels in a cement matrix is overcome, mimicking the tracheid structure of conifer. This bioinspired design reduces the ion transport tortuosity from 7.80 to 2.86, resulting in a fourfold increase in ion conductivity (to 32.7 mS cm&#8722;1), while maintaining high mechanical strength (41.6&#160;MPa). The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state CEMBs demonstrate superior performance, delivering a remarkable capacity of 114 mAh g&#8722;1 and retaining 63.2% of their capacity after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. In comparison, traditional CEMBs exhibit a lower initial capacity of 62 mAh g&#8722;1 and experience rapid degradation, losing functionality after just 75 cycles. Impressively, the bioinspired CEMBs can simultaneously charge a mobile phone and endure external mechanical loads, showcasing their dual functionality. This innovative bioinspired design presents a promising pathway for scaling up cement&#8208;based energy storage systems to enable low&#8208;carbon, self&#8208;powered buildings.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Nanopatterning of Binary Nanoparticles in Nonpolar Solvent via Combined Dielectrophoretic and Coulombic Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing net charges of NPs in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient submicron&#8208;scale separation of NP mixtures and forms complex binary NP patterns in one step, offering a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs into advanced multifunctional nanodevices.








Abstract
Precise nanofabrication of diverse nanoparticles (NPs) with high spatial resolution is crucial for developing advanced nanodevices. While various bottom&#8208;up approaches have been developed, limitations such as complex overlay steps, contamination risks, and low spatial resolution still exist. Here, an approach is presented for sub&#8208;micron spatial resolution nanopatterning of binary NPs. By utilizing net charges of NPs dispersed in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and sign&#8208;dependent Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient separation of NP mixtures at submicron scales, facilitating the formation of complex binary NP patterns in a single step. The technique offers a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs, providing a new way for advanced multifunctional nanodevices.

         <title>Guiding Polaritonic Energy and Momentum Through 2D Bravais Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monolayer MoS2 based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavity is used to form polaritons. The directional flow control of polaritonic energy and momentum is facilitated by designing five types of 2D Bravais lattices based on PMMA nanopillars, which are fabricated on top of monolayer MoS2, as demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved reflectance measurements. The unique ability to control exciton&#8208;polariton dispersion will advance its applications in photonics and quantum technologies.








Abstract
Controlling polariton dispersion facilitates the study of various new physical phenomena, such as Bose&#8208;Einstein condensation, polariton lasing, and coherent quantum fluid dynamics, with manual control remaining an area of ongoing exploration. In this work, monolayer MoS2 based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavity is used to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved reflectance measurements. Back&#8208;space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using temporal coupled&#8208;mode theory. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, and the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine&#8208;tuned via lattice constant, enabling full&#8208;range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.

         <title>Highly Efficient Cooling via Synergistic Electro&#8208;Thermal Phase Changes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Featuring low energy consumption and easy integration with modern electronic, electrocaloric polymer is a highly promising alternative to vapor&#8208;compression systems. Here, the synergistic electro&#8208;thermal phase change methodology boosted the performance of electrocaloric materials, achieving a dramatic temperature drop in simulated electronic chip cooling. This methodology opened up a new way for enhancing the entropy change of electrocaloric materials.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;phase change materials (electro&#8208;PCM), based on the electrocaloric effect, have attracted significant attention and achieved rapid development in the field of cooling technology owing to their environmental protection, low energy consumption, and miniaturization. However, due to their limited isothermal entropy change and thermal conductivity, the cooling capacity of the electro&#8208;PCM devices has severely limited their cooling effect on electronic devices. Here, with the synergistic electro&#8208;thermal phase changes, the entropy change and thermal conductivity of electro&#8208;PCM are significantly improved by stacking it with thermo&#8208;phase change materials (thermo&#8208;PCM). Compared with that of the electro&#8208;PCM, the entropy change and thermal conductivity of electro&#8208;thermal phase change materials (ETPCM) stack can be up to 4.68&#8208;fold (from 28.31 to 132.35 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at electric field of 100 MV m&#8722;1) and 2.39&#8208;fold (from 0.18 to 0.43&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1), respectively. The practicality of this strategy has also been fully validated by cooling a simulated electronic chip (1.75&#160;W cm&#8722;2) with a temperature drop of 49.32 K after constructing ETPCM stack&#8208;based cooling device using the electrostatic actuation prototype. The synergistic enhancement of entropy change and thermal conductivity paves the way for the future direction of electrocaloric cooling toward interdisciplinary fusion.

         <title>Responsive Metasurface for Directional Control of Laser and Thermal Emission Dynamic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multispectral&#8208;responsive metasurface simultaneously modulates directional laser reflection and dynamic infrared emissivity, enabling robust dual&#8208;band camouflage and dual&#8208;modal anti&#8208;counterfeiting. By synergistically integrating spatial and spectral control, this approach greatly expands capabilities for manipulating multiple physical parameters, providing a versatile approach for advanced information encryption, holography, and thermal management applications in complex scenarios.









Abstract
Responsive metasurfaces can efficiently control the propagation and spectral properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves, emerging as an attractive technology in energy and information fields. However, achieving non&#8208;interference manipulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser wavelength and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) region with spatial and spectral responsive capabilities is a challenging and long&#8208;sought task for applications, such as multispectral adaptive camouflage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Here, a multispectral responsive metasurface is demonstrated that enables independent modulation of MIR thermal emission while maintaining robust, spatially directional control of NIR laser reflections. This metasurface simultaneously achieves superior ultralow specular reflectivity of 0.049 (0.8&#8211;1.2 &#181;m) and high thermal emission regulation capability of 0.51 (8&#8211;13 &#181;m), attributed to NIR reflection splitting and a photonically amplified metal&#8208;insulator transition, respectively. The metasurface's exceptional capability to realize temperature&#8208;invariant NIR laser and dynamic MIR camouflage is experimentally proved under significant fluctuating thermal environments, superior to existing laser&#8208;IR&#8208;compatible camouflage technologies. Dual&#8208;mode information anti&#8208;counterfeiting is further demonstrated through independent channels for detection angles and temperature responses. This work provides a new pathway for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with spatial and spectral modulation toward diverse multispectral application scenarios.

&lt;p&gt;A multispectral-responsive metasurface simultaneously modulates directional laser reflection and dynamic infrared emissivity, enabling robust dual-band camouflage and dual-modal anti-counterfeiting. By synergistically integrating spatial and spectral control, this approach greatly expands capabilities for manipulating multiple physical parameters, providing a versatile approach for advanced information encryption, holography, and thermal management applications in complex scenarios.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Ultra&#8208;Broadband Microwave Absorbing Aerogel with Optimized Dielectric Dispersion via Dielectric Relaxation Time Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating fluorinated graphene into MXene aerogels, hydrogen bonding, and interfacial charge separation extend the dielectric relaxation time, enabling ultrathin (2.54 mm), lightweight (34.4 mg cm&#8315;3) all&#8208;dielectric broadband microwave absorption (9.08 GHz) due to the optimized dielectric dispersion law. The composite also delivers high compressive strength, rapid Joule heating, and excellent thermal insulation.








Abstract
The limited conceptual understanding and lack of effective techniques for optimizing dielectric dispersion continue to hinder the development of all&#8208;dielectric broadband microwave&#8208;absorbing materials (MAMs) with minimal thickness. In this study, a strong theoretical correlation between dielectric relaxation time and dielectric dispersion behavior is established by applying the ideal dielectric dispersion law in conjunction with Debye theory. This led to a strategic approach aimed at extending the relaxation time to optimize dielectric dispersion and achieve broadband microwave absorption without incorporating magnetic components. To realize this, fluorinated graphene (FG) is engineered to stack with MXene nanosheets, resulting in the fabrication of MXene/fluorinated graphene/cellulose nanofibers (MXene/FG/CNFs) aerogels. This configuration significantly extended the dielectric relaxation time of interfacial dipoles from 9.2&#160;ps in MXene/CNFs to 19.5&#160;ps in MXene/FG/CNFs aerogels, corresponding to a fluorine content of 35% in FG. This extension is attributed to increased interfacial dipole moments from strong electronic delocalization induced by highly electronegatively fluorine atoms. The improved structure yield progressively optimized dielectric dispersion, resulting in a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) of 9.08&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.54&#160;mm and a low density of 34.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the hybrid aerogel also exhibited fascinating Joule heating, thermal insulation, and compressive strength.

         <title>Liquid Bridges Mediate Crack Initiation, Propagation, and Coalescence to Suppress Film Failure within Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold films deposited on capillary&#8208;stabilized fluidic cushion of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused nanopillar arrays show enhanced stability under large strains (&#8764; 180%) by effective control, mediated through liquid bridges, of film cracking progress, combined with exceptional strain&#8208;responsive sensitivity of resistance change by the cracking mechanism, this strategy offers a fluid&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based approach for robust wearable devices and soft robotic systems operating under extreme mechanical deformation.








Abstract
Recent flexible electronics with conformal interfaces between devices and human bodies are prone to receive circuit failure caused by uncontrollable cracking during physiological movements. A structural engineering strategy is reported that utilizes capillary&#8208;stabilized liquid bridges to spontaneously mediate crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence for film reinforcement. Specifically, rigid nanowire array are decorated onto flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrates and the nanoscale gaps between the nanowires are filled with non&#8208;volatile ionic liquids to form well&#8208;regulated meniscus. Using metal films as a model, it is found that stretchability of an Au film deposited on this meniscus exceeds that of its flat counterpart (180 vs 30%). In&#8208;situ optical observations and fluid dynamics analyses show that liquid bridge forces mechanically hinder the propagating of crack fronts and simultaneously initiate new cracks in different locations, leading to dispersed small cracks at strains below 80%. This scattering of cracks prevents the concentrated propagation and merging of cracks into penetrating fractures, with effective electrical percolation of Au films even under a high strain of 160%, which contrasts sharply with the counterparts without liquids where penetrating cracks occur at a small strain of &#8776;10%. Results indicate fluid mechanics as a versatile approach to reprogram film cracking for high&#8208;performance electronics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a dual&#8208;mode NO2&#8208;humidity sensing platform based on Pt single&#8208;atom sensitized Nb2CTx nanosheets, enabling simultaneous high&#8208;performance time&#8208;domain NO2 and frequency&#8208;domain humidity sensing. Through elucidation of the resistance&#8208;capacitance orthogonal sensing mechanism and integration of PCB circuits with machine learning, the platform implements humidity localization, humidity&#8208;corrected NO2 alarms, and asthma pre&#8208;warning.









Abstract
Real&#8208;time in situ detection of NO2 is crucial for ensuring industrial safety and healthcare. However, conventional gas sensors face challenges from environmental humidity interference, limiting their reliability in practical applications. This study presents a dual&#8208;mode, full&#8208;range NO2&#8208;humidity sensing platform based on Pt single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitized Nb2CTx nanosheets (Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx) integrated with TPU fiber mats (Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx@TPU). Combining resistive gas sensing and capacitive humidity sensing within a single device, this platform enables simultaneous NO2 and humidity detection with full&#8208;range humidity tolerance. The uniformly dispersed Pt single&#8208;atoms on the Nb2CTx nanosheets catalyze oxygen molecule dissociation and provide additional surface&#8208;active adsorption sites, achieving a 9.1&#8208;fold improvement in resistance response to 5&#160;ppm NO2 and a 25.7&#8208;fold increase in capacitance response at 95% relative humidity. Importantly, the unaffected capacitive response allows precise calibration of NO2 concentration using resistance and capacitance, ensuring accurate NO2 detection across diverse and fluctuating humidity. Leveraging time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain NO2&#8208;humidity sensing capability, the Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx@TPU sensor is successfully integrated into self&#8208;designed functional modules to realize humidity tracking, industrial NO2 concentration alarming in full&#8208;humidity range as well as asthma prevention and alarm applications. This study offers a novel solution for humidity&#8208;compensated NO2 detection, advancing the applicability of gas sensors in complex and dynamic environments.

         <title>Roll&#8208;To&#8208;Roll Twisted Aerogel Yarns with Reinforced Structure and Low Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerogels have exceptional thermal insulation properties, but often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties in textile applications. This issue is addressed by processing aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll format through a twist&#8208;induced fibrillation method using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators. The resulting aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties.








Abstract
Aerogels have been considered as super thermal insulators. However, they often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties for textile application due to their fragility and poor processability. These problems are overcome through a twisting&#8208;induced fibrillation method, using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators, to process aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll format. A low concentration of strong nanofiber host in twisted form provides structural support to the aerogel particles and preserves their porous architecture. Despite the high&#8208;volume ratio (&#8776;78%) of aerogel particles, the aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties. Textiles woven with the aerogel yarns are warmer than cashmere. The aerogel textile is extremely stable under temperatures of &#8722;196 and 100&#160;&#176;C, mechanical deformation, and even washing. This technology provides a flexible platform to extend the function (e.g., dyeability, hydrophobicity, and Joule heating) of aerogel yarns and textiles to suit various use scenarios.

&lt;p&gt;Aerogels have exceptional thermal insulation properties, but often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties in textile applications. This issue is addressed by processing aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll-to-roll format through a twist-induced fibrillation method using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators. The resulting aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties.

         <title>3D&#8208;Architectured Acceptor with High Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and Moderate Crystallinity for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss</title>

Strategic embedding of 3D norbornene units in fused&#8208;ring acceptors suppresses excessive aggregation, synergistically boosting photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and achieving a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.4% and an extremely low voltage loss (Vloss) of 0.548 V in organic solar cells.








Abstract
This study outlines a molecular design approach that entails integrating 3D structural motifs into the central core or terminal groups of fused&#8208;ring acceptor molecules, specifically, LLZ1, LLZ2, and LLZ3&#8211;by incorporating a 3D architecture unit of norbornene. The objective is to modulate the aggregation behavior of these molecules by modifying their molecular structure, thereby enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of the acceptor materials and reducing the non&#8208;radiative recombination voltage loss in the corresponding devices. Our research findings demonstrate that the introduction of norbornene units effectively suppresses excessive molecular aggregation and significantly improves the PLQY values of the acceptor molecules. Further research has demonstrated that only the acceptor molecule LLZ1, characterized by both high PLQY and moderate crystallinity, can strike an optimal balance between the dual requirements of reducing voltage loss and enhancing charge transport in the device. Utilizing the preferred molecule LLZ1, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% in binary system and 20.4% in ternary device with much&#8208;reduced voltage loss of 0.508V, which is among the highest values of current OSCs. In summary, this work provides novel insights and research directions for the development of OSCs with low voltage loss and high PCE.

         <title>Increasing the Stability of Deep Blue Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized OLEDs Using the Polariton&#8208;Enhanced Purcell Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is demonstrated to enhance the stability of the deep blue phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescent (PSF) OLEDs by 3.1 X compared to PSF diodes lacking this effect. In addition, PSF&#8208;OLEDs exhibit reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color emission. The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. This work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.









Abstract
The stability of efficient, deep blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a major challenge in the field of organic electronics. Poor device stability originates from the high probability for destructive non&#8208;radiative triplet exciton annihilation events. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (PSF) is proposed to achieve an efficient, deep blue color by energy transfer from phosphors to fluorophores. Recently, the polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is introduced to decrease the triplet radiative lifetime and density, resulting in an increase in blue phosphorescent OLED lifetime. Here, the PEP effect is introduced to enhance the stability of the PSF&#8208;OLEDs. It is shown that the PEP effect increases all radiative decay rates of the phosphors and fluorophores, leading to a reduction in the triplet annihilation events. Using a Pt&#8208;complex phosphor sensitizer and a so&#8208;called multi&#8208;resonance fluorescent emitter in a PEP cavity, a 3.1&#8208;fold lifetime increase is observed at a current density of J = 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.09). The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. Moreover, this work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.

         <title>Hair&#8208;Like Mechanoluminescent Structures with Ultralow Activation Threshold for Dynamic Force Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanoluminescence microcilia array film with a bionic hair&#8208;like structure achieves an ultralow activation threshold of just 10&#160;mN&#8212;the lowest reported to date&#8212;enabled by stress concentration. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, mechanoluminescence&#8208;derived texture discrimination and Braille recognition with high accuracy is demonstrated for the first time via integration with an image&#8208;based machine learning approach.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based sensing technology opens up new opportunities for photonic/electronic skin due to their self&#8208;powered nature, visible spatial mapping of mechanical stimuli, and intrinsic responses to dynamic forces. However, challenges such as weak brightness and high activation threshold have hindered their development. Inspired by hair&#8208;like structures of human skin, skin&#8208;bionic mechanoluminescent PDMS/ZnS:Cu microcilia array film (MLMCA) is fabricated using a magnetic field&#8208;assisted template method. The MLMCA exhibits tunable aspect ratios and ML intensity, with the underlying relationship between microcilia structure and ML performance clarified through finite element analysis. The MLMCA achieves an ultralow activation threshold at the micronewton level (&#8776;10 mN) owing to the stress concentration induced by high aspect ratio. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, the MLMCA enables texture recognition with an accuracy of 99.95% when integrated with the image machine learning approach. Furthermore, an ML&#8208;based Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system is developed and achieved a high recognition accuracy of 96.74%. This study not only tackles the persistent limitation of high activation thresholds in ML&#8208;based sensing but also pioneers the practical use of ML&#8208;based tactile sensing in texture discrimination and Braille reading.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Optoelectronics Enabled by Atomically Tailored Interfaces Engineering for Advanced Perceptual Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A broadband, self&#8208;powered photodetector is developed by integrating Cl&#8208;substituted 2D perovskites with MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures via interface engineering. The device enables weak&#8208;light detection down to 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, offering enhanced carrier transport and photogating effects. This strategy highlights a general approach to boosting the performance of 2D material&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;weak light detection represents a critical enabling technology for next&#8208;generation imaging, remote monitoring, and autonomous systems, where efficient charge transfer is essential to achieve ultralow detection thresholds. Herein, an interfacial lattice&#8208;distortion engineering strategy is proposed by selectively substituting phenylethyl ammonium (PEA) cations with 4&#8208;chlorophenylethylammonium (Cl&#8208;PEA) at perovskite heterointerfaces. This substitution induces beneficial octahedral distortions, boosting hole transport efficiency in few&#8208;layer 2D perovskites by 26%. When integrated with MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures, the optimized van der Waals contact and enhanced energy&#8208;level alignment yield a high&#8208;performance photodetection, including a responsivity of 2.7 &#215; 104 A/W, a detectivity up to 5.26 &#215; 1014&#160;Jones, and an exceptionally low noise equivalent power of 0.42&#160;fW&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2. Notably, the device operates self&#8208;powered at incident power densities as low as 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, enabling real&#8208;time, on&#8208;chip image processing even under dim&#8208;light conditions. This functionality is further utilized for noise reduction in traffic&#8208;light images prior to object detection with YOLOv11 network, establishing a direct bridge between device&#8208;level photodetection and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven recognition. This interfacial lattice distortion engineering paradigm in van der Waals&#8208;contacted 2D devices opens new avenues for designing ultrasensitive, low&#8208;noise, and functionally integrated optoelectronic devices.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-weak light detection represents a critical enabling technology for next-generation imaging, remote monitoring, and autonomous systems, where efficient charge transfer is essential to achieve ultralow detection thresholds. Herein, an interfacial lattice-distortion engineering strategy is proposed by selectively substituting phenylethyl ammonium (PEA) cations with 4-chlorophenylethylammonium (Cl-PEA) at perovskite heterointerfaces. This substitution induces beneficial octahedral distortions, boosting hole transport efficiency in few-layer 2D perovskites by 26%. When integrated with MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures, the optimized van der Waals contact and enhanced energy-level alignment yield a high-performance photodetection, including a responsivity of 2.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A/W, a detectivity up to 5.26 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Jones, and an exceptionally low noise equivalent power of 0.42&#160;fW&#160;Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, the device operates self-powered at incident power densities as low as 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling real-time, on-chip image processing even under dim-light conditions. This functionality is further utilized for noise reduction in traffic-light images prior to object detection with YOLOv11 network, establishing a direct bridge between device-level photodetection and machine-learning-driven recognition. This interfacial lattice distortion engineering paradigm in van der Waals-contacted 2D devices opens new avenues for designing ultrasensitive, low-noise, and functionally integrated optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liver&#8208;Targeted Tolerogenic Vaccines: A Nano&#8208;Membrane Coupled Approach for Autoimmune Disease Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic vaccine based on a membrane&#8208;nanoemulsion is developed to specifically target hepatic antigen&#8208;presenting cells. These cells recognize signals such as phosphatidylserine on the membrane; while, reducing the expression of costimulatory molecules. This contributes to a deficiency in T cell activation signals and induces multiple subsets of regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells, protecting against autoimmune tissue damage.









Abstract
The co&#8208;delivery of auto&#8208;antigens and immunomodulators for tolerance induction holds great potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. However, their efficacy in enriching antigens within target cells remains limited, and the use of immunomodulators poses a risk for systemic immunosuppression. Here, an apoptotic erythrocyte&#8208;derived membrane is developed for the first time, demonstrating its strong abilities to target hepatic antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) and stimulate negative regulatory pathways. These apoptotic cell membranes are engineered onto the surface of intravenous lipid emulsions encapsulating disease&#8208;associated antigens to generate a tolerogenic vaccine. This nano&#8208;membrane coupled structure facilitates robust antigen loading, efficient liver delivery, and uptake by hepatic APCs; while, concurrently downregulating the expression of costimulatory molecules to promote immune tolerance. Intravenous administration of this tolerogenic vaccine induces multiple regulatory cell subpopulations, particularly IL&#8208;10 secreting T cells, regulatory B cells, and memory regulatory T cells, collectively conferring effective protection against celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes in murine models. More importantly, it is demonstrated that this vaccine induces antigen&#8208;specific immune tolerance without compromising the normal immune responses to other antigens. The findings provide solid support for the application of this hepatic APCs&#8208;targeted tolerogenic vaccine as a versatile and translatable platform for combating autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Breaking the Reversibility Barrier in Zn&#8208;Air Systems With Dual&#8208;Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A separated Zn&#8208;air system is proposed to suppress hydrogen evolution and dendrites via dual&#8208;electrolyte architecture, resolving anode passivation and cathodic catalyst degradation. Integrating iodine redox chemistry enables low&#8208;voltage charging and aligns energy storage with other sustainable and green applications. 








Abstract
In response to the escalating demand for advanced energy storage solutions and the pursuit of safer, more sustainable alternatives to conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing the reversibility and stability challenges of Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;air batteries has become imperative. To tackle these issues, particularly under alkaline conditions, a unique separated Zn&#8208;air system (SZAS) is demonstrated. This system conducts the charging process in a near&#8208;neutral electrolyte, significantly suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions and dendrite growth while discharging occurs in an alkaline electrolyte to maximize voltage output. This design effectively addresses passivation layer formation and prolongs cathode lifespan by preventing catalyst deactivation and element loss during high&#8208;voltage oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The SZASs demonstrate a 99.84% Coulombic efficiency over 5000 cycles in nearly neutral electrolytes and a discharging energy density reaching 218&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte, showing promise in advanced energy storage techniques. Additionally, replacing OER with iodine oxidation reaction reduces charging voltage to 1.5&#160;V and achieves a 3.7&#160;V output via serial discharging. This work proposes the separation engineering of battery architectures, integrating benefits from diverse electrolyte environments, and paves the way for aligning advancements in energy storage, waste management, material recycling, and sustainable power solutions for electric vehicles.

         <title>Breaking Apoptosis&#8208;Induced Immune Silence: Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Nano&#8208;Oncolytic Therapy Reinvigorates Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound (US)&#8211;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system, cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP is introduced, which induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. This method triggers the explosive release of DAMPs and activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in a more potent antitumor immune response than conventional apoptosis&#8208;based therapies. This innovative strategy markedly enhances tumor immunogenicity and remodels immunosuppression to effectively improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Conventional tumor therapies typically depend on the apoptotic pathway, which often leads to inadequate immunogenicity. This limitation underscores the urgent need for innovative treatments that enhance immunogenicity. In this study, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system (designated as cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP), is presented and consists of nanoliposomes (Lip) modified with the cRGD peptide for targeted tumor delivery. This system features a perfluoropentane (PFP) core that undergoes US&#8208;triggered acoustomechanical effects, enabling controlled expansion from nanoscale to microscale, ultimately leading to rupture and the generation of cavitation effects. Intracellular cavitation further induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. The efficacy of various treatments in stimulating immune responses is systematically compared and it is demonstrated that the nano&#8208;oncolytic system effectively enhances the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Additionally, the release of DNA fragments activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in an amplified immune response. Furthermore, this nano&#8208;oncolytic system alleviates the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and counteracts immunosuppression. Compared to traditional apoptosis, the necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death induced by this strategy exhibits enhanced immunogenicity. This approach presents an innovative paradigm for tumor immunotherapy based on acoustomechanical effects, offering a promising alternative to tackle the issue of insufficient immunogenicity often associated with conventional apoptosis therapies.

         <title>Anchoring Nickel and Stabilizing Oxygen in Coherent LiNiO2@LiFePO4 Composite Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiNiO2@LiFePO4 composite material with coherent combination exhibits remarkable cyclability, rate capability and high first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency. The coherent oriented channels favor the reversible and rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport with suppressed strain accumulation while phosphate anions anchored on the LiNiO2 surface stabilizes Ni sites, mitigating surface degradation.








Abstract
LiNiO2 is an appealing cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries because of high energy density and low cost but suffers from irreversible phase transition and surface instability. Herein, a ball&#8208;milled LiNiO2@LiFePO4 composite with oriented coherent combination is reported with enhanced structural stability and Li+ diffusion. The coherent oriented channels are demonstrated to favor the reversible and rapid Li+ intercalation during the H2&#8208;H3 phase transition, which significantly alleviates structural strain accumulation. The covalent P&#9472;O bonds anchored on the LiNiO2 surface stabilizes the Ni sites, mitigating surface reconstruction and lattice oxygen loss. The LiNiO2@LiFePO4 cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 210 mAh g&#8722;1 and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.7% at 0.1 C, along with a remarkable rate capability of 156 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C. Furthermore, the full cells pairing LiNiO2@LiFePO4 cathode and graphite anode deliver a considerable energy density over 280 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention. This study offers an effective approach of phosphate coalesce to upgrade high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich oxide cathode materials.

         <title>Fluorine&#8211;Mediated Interfacial Microenvironment for Boosting pH&#8211;Universal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni species (single atoms and atomic clusters) are successfully anchored onto fluorocarbon substrates (FC), forming a highly efficient and stable CO2RR electrocatalyst. The optimized Ni/FC exhibits excellent FECO in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. More importantly, Ni/FC can maintain excellent FECO while operating at industrial currents density for 3000&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that the high&#8211;electronegativity of F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and elevates the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive HER process.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient and stable conversion of carbon dioxide&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals at industrial current density is crucial but challenging due to its complex gas&#8211;solid&#8211;liquid interface. Here the local microenvironment of three&#8211;phase interface is successfully regulated to boost the CO2RR performance of Ni species in the universal pH range by introducing the highly electronegative F. The optimized Ni/FC achieves high&#8211;performance in converting CO2 to CO with Faraday efficiencies (FEs) over 90% in pH&#8211;universal conditions, while the main product of Ni/C is H2, especially under acidic conditions. Significantly, it can steadily operate at a high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 3000&#160;h in a broad pH range, outperforming most recently reported CO2RR electrocatalysts. Detail in situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of highly electronegative F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and increases the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work highlights the importance of regulating the local microenvironment of interfacial water, providing a new perspective in the field of electrocatalysis for suppressing competitive HER.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Ferroelectric Bioelectronics for Adaptive Biointerfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative ferroelectric bioelectronics (FerroE) that integrate neuron&#8208;preferred flexible and topographical properties and neuron&#8208;similar behaviors enable seamless integration and adaptive communication with both Peripheral Nervous System and Central Nervous System. These neuron&#8208;like interface materials and bioelectronics that possess indistinguishable features from neurons, will open new opportunities for next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces, tissue engineering materials, and biomedical devices.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics, which are essential to neuroscience studies, neurological disorder treatment, and brain&#8211;machine interfaces, have become indispensable communication bridges between biological systems and the external world through sensing, monitoring, or manipulating bioelectrical signals. However, conventional implantable bioelectronic devices face key challenges in adaptive interfacing with neural tissues due to their lack of neuron&#8208;preferred properties and neuron&#8208;similar behaviors. Here, innovative neuron&#8208;inspired ferroelectric bioelectronics (FerroE) are reported that consists of biocompatible polydopamine&#8208;modified barium titanate nanoparticles, ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) copolymer, and cellular&#8208;scale micropyramid array structures, imparting adaptive interfacing with neural systems. These FerroE not only achieve neuron&#8208;preferred flexible and topographical properties, but also offer neuron&#8208;similar behaviors including highly efficient and stable light&#8208;induced polarization change, superior capability of producing electric signals, and seamless integration and adaptive communication with neurons. Moreover, the FerroE allows for adaptive interfacing with both peripheral and central neural networks of mice, enabling regulation of their heart rate and motion behavior in a wireless, non&#8208;genetic, and non&#8208;contact manner. Notably, the FerroE demonstrates unprecedented structural and functional stability and negligible immune response even after 3 months of implantation in vivo. Such bioinspired FerroE are opening new opportunities for next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces, tissue engineering materials, and biomedical devices.

         <title>Reward Driven Workflows for Unsupervised Explainable Analysis of Phases and Ferroic Variants From Atomically Resolved Imaging Data</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reward&#8208;driven workflows enable fully unsupervised segmentation of atomically resolved STEM images, revealing phases and ferroic variants without any labels. By encoding domain&#8208;wall straightness and length as explicit rewards, the method automatically tunes clustering and variational&#8208;autoencoder hyperparameters. This physics&#8208;guided optimization yields robust, real&#8208;time mappings of polarization and structural domains for next&#8208;generation autonomous microscopy.








Abstract
Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters are explored on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by the discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in Sm &#8722; dopped&#8197;BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films. It is demonstrated that a reward&#8208;driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards are designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows the discovery of local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. The reward driven workflow is further extended to disentangle structural factors of variation via an optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well&#8208;defined rewards is explored as a quantifiable measure of the success of the workflow.

         <title>Anomalous Phonon Softening with Inherent Strain in Wrinkled Monolayer WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the first discovery of a new local strain indicator, A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, for monolayer WSe2&#8208;based excitonic applications including single photon emitter by using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The correlative investigation with density functional perturbation theory provides the origin of the anomalous appearance of A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, as well as the applicability for strain engineering.








Abstract
Local deformation is a control knob to dynamically tune the electronic band structure of 2D semiconductors. This study demonstrates the local strain&#8208;dependent phonon properties of monolayer tungsten diselenide, which are investigated by using the scanning tunneling microscopy&#8208;based tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The anomalous appearance and softening of the Raman&#8208;inactive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode are first revealed, which exhibits equivalent behavior to other principal phonons of tungsten diselenide. Local strain calculations unveiled the linear proportionalities of A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ phonon nature on strain and it facilitates the derivation of Gr&#252;neisen parameter by experimental and theoretical approaches. Additionally, the origins of the anomalous appearance of the Raman&#8208;inactive A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode are clearly proved in both classical physics and quantum mechanics. Especially quantum mechanical calculations have precisely described strain&#8208;induced selection rule relaxation by polarizability changes. The first discovery provides a fundamental understanding of the strain&#8208;dependent phonon properties, as well as suggesting a new distinct strain indicator, A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, for strain engineering.

This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based biohybrid immunomodulator to alleviate intestinal inflammation. The biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1&#8208;loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;transfected DCs. The immunomodulator effectively reduces inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas+CD8+ T cells and neutrophils, showing efficient therapeutic potential in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.








Abstract
Inflammation is a key driver of intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While biologics have demonstrated notable success in treating some patients, there remains a critical need for alternative therapeutic strategies to address primary and secondary non&#8208;responders. In this study, a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based biohybrid immunomodulator is developed to alleviate intestinal inflammation, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in combating IBD. This biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1&#8208;loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;transfected DCs. Elevated Fas expression is observed in intestinal tissue samples from IBD patients, and the immunomodulator effectively reduced inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas+CD8+ T cells and neutrophils. The therapeutic potential of this approach is validated in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD, where it exhibites significant anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the immunomodulator can be manufactured using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow&#8208;derived DCs, demonstrating a robust capacity to induce T cell apoptosis. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.

         <title>Selective Electrosynthesis of Methanol from CO2 Over Cu/Cu2P2O7 Via the Formate Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu/Cu2P2O7&#8208;based hybrid catalyst delivers over 50% Faradaic efficiency and &gt;100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for methanol electrosynthesis from CO2. The synergy between Cu (111) facets and Cu2P2O7 promotes HCOOH&#8208;mediated pathways, offering a scalable route for sustainable liquid fuel production.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methanol offers an eco&#8208;friendly approach to reducing carbon emissions while producing versatile liquid fuels and feedstocks. However, achieving high selectivity for methanol, especially at high current densities, remains challenging due to competing reactions that favor methane and hydrogen formation. Here, the tailored synthesis of Cu/Cu2P2O7&#8208;based hybrid catalysts is reported for efficient and selective methanol production through the discharge of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 50% in both H&#8208;cells and gas&#8208;diffusion electrode cells, achieving one of the highest reported methanol partial current densities of over 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and computational analyses reveal a synergistic effect between Cu nanoparticles with a predominant (111) surface and Cu2P2O7 nanoparticles, which enhances selective methanol production via the HCOOH intermediate pathway. These findings provide insights into designing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for selective methanol production.

         <title>Microscopic&#8208;Level Anion &amp; Diluent Chemistry in Electrolyte for Aqueous Supercapacitors Operating at High Voltage and Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscopic&#8208;level anion &amp; diluent chemistry strategy is proposed to develop an advanced Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte that can operate at high voltage and low temperature. The weak interaction of H2O with ClO4&#8722; guarantees strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds and resulting electrolyte stability. The AN serves as a solvation diluent capable of weakening electrostatic Ca2+&#8208;ClO4&#8722; attraction, preventing salt precipitation, and finally yielding a high&#8208;performance supercapacitor.








Abstract
Aqueous supercapacitors, serving as safe and green high&#8208;power energy storage devices, hold significant potential in various applications. Exploring advanced electrolytes beyond traditional electrolytes is essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature operations. Herein, a hybrid electrolyte with a high electrochemical stability window (3.29&#160;V) and sufficient ionic conductivity (1.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C) is developed via hybridizing 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O with acetonitrile (AN) diluent. The charged Ca2+ cations anchor the oxygen atoms in H2O molecules, preventing them from being hydrogen acceptors. Meanwhile, the ClO4&#8722; anions weakly interact with hydrogen atoms, which ensures strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds in 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O. The used AN can contribute to decreased salt dosage, without any compromise to electrochemical stability and safety. Furthermore, the AN with a higher donor number than ClO4&#8722; can replace the ClO4&#8722; in Ca2+ solvation sheaths, which reduces Ca2+&#8722;ClO4&#8722; clusters, accordingly suppressing salt precipitation even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. Resultantly, a symmetric supercapacitor assembled with 4.2 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;AN electrolyte presents high&#8208;voltage and temperature&#8208;adaptability features, with excellent rate capability and high long&#8208;term cycling stability from 25 to &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C at 2.3&#160;V.

         <title>Interface Topology Driven Loss Minimization in Integrated Photonics: THz Ultrahigh&#8208;Q Cavities and Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compact, robust, and ultralow&#8208;loss on&#8208;chip photonic devices are essential for densely integrated photonic chips. Here, the underlying radiation mechanism in topological valley edge states is unveiled and a new methodology of interface topology driven bandgap and wavevector engineering is proposed to thoroughly suppress their radiation losses, thereby unleashing their full potential for robust, low&#8208;power, and densely integrated photonic chips.









Abstract
Compact, robust, and ultralow&#8208;loss on&#8208;chip photonic devices are essential for densely integrated photonic chips. Conventional designs struggle to achieve these properties due to their inherent trade&#8208;offs among compactness, robustness, and low loss. Topological valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer a promising solution, as their valley&#8208;vortex&#8208;protected edge states are capable of robustly guiding light through sharp bends and structural perturbations with negligible loss. Notably, exhaustive control over all loss channels is crucial for minimizing undesired losses. However, the intrinsic loss mechanisms in valley edge states remain largely unexplored, severely limiting their full potential. Here, we unveil that radiation is the dominant&#160;loss mechanism in valley edge states and propose a new methodology of interface topology driven bandgap and wavevector engineering to thoroughly suppress their radiation losses in chip&#8208;scale waveguides and cavities. The methodology minimizes the radiation losses of topological cavities by &#8776;104&#8208;fold through readily tailoring interface geometry without compromising their compactness, ultimately achieving a measured loaded Q&#8208;factor of 31231.2 in the terahertz (THz) frequency regime. Furthermore, the enhanced Q&#8208;factor significantly strengthens light&#8208;matter interactions, enabling efficient spectral modulation with ultralow&#8208;power photoexcitation. These findings enable topological VPCs to realize ultra&#8208;compact and ultralow&#8208;loss devices across diverse frequencies, unleashing their full potential for robust, low&#8208;power, and densely integrated photonic chips.

         <title>Nanosecond Laser Synthesis of MXene&#8208;Derived TiO2/High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

A high&#8208;entropy photoelectrocatalyst is rapidly synthesized by pulsed laser heating MXene nanosheets loading metal ions. The MXene derived&#8208;TiO2 and high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunction can effectively enhance the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics with solar energy assistance, reducing the charging potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries and improving the charge&#8211;discharge efficiency.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8211;air batteries have garnered significant attention for applying solar energy to decrease the charge voltage and improve energy efficiency. However, the uniform and rapid synthesis of highly active, stable, and low&#8208;cost photoelectrocatalysts for zinc&#8211;air batteries remains a significant challenge. Herein, a pulsed laser method is reported for the rapid preparation of MXene&#8208;derived TiO2/high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunctions (M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs) as photoelectrocatalysts. Benefiting from the exceptional photo&#8208;thermal conversion capability of MXene, the local temperature reaches up to 2800&#160;K under laser irradiation, along with ultra&#8208;fast heating and cooling rates (&#8776;106&#160;K&#160;s&#8722;1), enabling the successful synthesis of M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs. Zinc&#8211;air batteries incorporating&#160;M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs exhibit a low charge voltage of 1.87&#160;V at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under light irradiation. In addition, it exhibits exceptional cycle stability, maintaining stable cycling for 1000&#160;h at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs heterojunctions exhibit strong electronic interactions. These interactions effectively promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the conversion of electrochemical intermediates, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity under light irradiation. This work offers valuable insights into the rapid fabrication of photoelectrocatalysts, providing new perspectives for developing light&#8208;enhanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Dynamic Gradient Oxygen Layer Enables Stable Sn Anode for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
During lithiation/delithiation, SnOx helped to form a stable solid electrolyte interface film. In addition, the disordered SnOx lamellar structures can release stress to prevent particle pulverization during its transformation into a denser amorphous layer. Its mechanism of lithium storage in the intercalation layer and dynamic oxygen concentration gradient can enable the rapid exchange of lithium ions.









Abstract
Sn&#8208;based anodes are of significant interest due to their high capacity and resource abundance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, incomplete lithiation and severe volume expansion result in their low capacity and electrode pulverization. Here, a rationally designed coating layer, composed of disordered SnOx (x = 1, 2) lamellar structures, on the Sn particles surface (Sn@SnOx) is proposed. This coating effectively mitigates volume expansion and minimizes lithium consumption owing to the intercalation behaviors of SnOx. During lithiation and delithiation, a dense, amorphous, mechanical coating with a dynamic gradient of oxygen forms in situ, providing excellent protection against continuous pulverization of the Sn particles. The intercalation&#8208;type dynamic gradient oxygen with high ionic conductivity enables rapid exchange of lithium ions, thus promoting the deep lithiation of Sn to form Li4.4Sn. Such gradient oxygen protection mechanism of the oxide layer in Sn@SnOx brings a high reversible capacity after 900 cycles with a capacity retention of 84%. This work offers a new strategy to design a protective coating layer on alloy&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;performance lithium storage.

         <title>Scalable Low&#8208;Carbon Ambient&#8208;Dried Foam&#8208;Like Aerogels for Radiative Cooling with Extreme Environmental Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable low&#8208;carbon ambient&#8208;dried foam&#8208;like aerogel with integrated radiative cooling and fire/harsh&#8208;conditions resistance is fabricated via green ambient&#8208;drying process without complex freezing and hazardous solvent exchange, which overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in cooling aerogels, providing new insights to maximize the efficiency in striving against global warming.









Abstract
Aerogels have emerged as promising passive radiant cooling materials, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate global warming. However, the energy&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive fabrication processes and insufficient environmental durability of current aerogels pose significant challenges for industrial scalability and long&#8208;term energy&#8208;saving applications. Here, a scalable low&#8208;carbon ambient&#8208;dried foam&#8208;like aerogel (GMSx) with integrated radiative cooling and fire/harsh&#8208;conditions resistance is reported. Thermoresponsive physicochemical interactions among gellan gum, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde resin, and fumed silica facilitate the transformation of scalable emulsion&#8208;templated hydrogels into structurally ordered GMSx via a green ambient&#8208;drying process without complex freezing and solvent exchange. The foam&#8208;like aerogel exhibits high porosity (96.2%) and record specific modulus (323 m2/s2). Optimized optical properties with 93% solar reflectance and 94% infrared emissivity yield subambient cooling of 4.8 &#176;C. Crucially, the robust crosslinked networks impart remarkable durability under extreme conditions, including exposure to hot water, strong acids/alkalis (pH 1&#8211;13), various chemicals, and 1300 &#176;C flame. Furthermore, GMSx can be customized into various shapes via extrusion or spraying techniques and applied as protective coatings using scalable brushing or dipping methods, accommodating diverse substrate geometries. This work overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in passive cooling aerogels, demonstrating practical potential for energy&#8208;efficient thermal management in harsh environments.

         <dc:description>
Honeycomb&#8208;structured (Ti3C2Tx/Fe3O4/CCMC)&#8211;(AgNW/CCMC) aerogels with tunable EMI shielding performance up to 80 dB are fabricated via DIW 3D printing, achieving compression&#8208;driven shielding adjustability, infrared stealth, and reversible thermal insulation&#8211;conduction conversion for dynamic thermal management in harsh environments.








Abstract
Achieving both structural precision and tunable performance in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials remains a critical challenge, particularly for adaptive applications. Herein, a strategy is proposed that integrates calcium chloride (CaCl&#8322;)&#8208;induced elastic activation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing to address the limitations in structural design and performance adjustability of EMI shielding materials. By leveraging CaCl&#8322;&#8208;crosslinked CMC (CCMC) as a flexible matrix, honeycomb&#8208;structured (Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx/Fe&#8323;O&#8324;/CCMC)&#8211;(Ag nanowire (AgNW)/CCMC) aerogels is fabricated with precise architecture and tunable shielding effectiveness under mechanical compression. With a 35% printing fill density, 40 wt% Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx, and 60% compressive strain, the aerogel achieves an optimal shielding effectiveness of 80&#160;dB. Additionally, the aerogel exhibits reversible infrared stealth and dynamically switchable thermal properties (from 0.08 to 0.67 W&#183;m&#8315;&#185;&#183;K&#8315;&#185;) in response to environmental humidity variations. This work demonstrates a versatile approach for structurally adaptive EMI shielding materials with self&#8208;regulating thermal behavior, offering promising applications in harsh environment protection, intelligent thermal camouflage, and adaptive shielding for next&#8208;generation aerospace and communication technologies.

         <title>Evaluation and Rehabilitation System for Ulnar&#8208;Innervated Muscles Facilitated by Rare Earth Oxide&#8208;Enhanced Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system utilizing rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensors integrated with a multi&#8208;channel signal collector and machine learning algorithms, enabling precise assessment of ulnar nerve injury recovery. The system demonstrates high sensitivity, accuracy, and visualization capability, offering significant advances in grip strength rehabilitation monitoring and biomedical sensing applications.








Abstract
Ulnar nerve injuries often lead to muscle atrophy and reduced hand function, necessitating precise monitoring and effective rehabilitation strategies. Current grip strength measurement tools rely on rigid mechanical equipment, which is inconvenient and requires frequent calibration. To address this, a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system (MUERS) is presented, featuring a highly sensitive rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensor (RETS). Utilizing the unique electrochemical properties of rare earth oxides, RETS demonstrates a linear voltage&#8208;force response in the range of 8&#8211;80 kPa, with a maximum linear error of 1.5%. Integrated with a multi&#8208;channel STM32 signal collector, RETS enables real&#8208;time grip strength monitoring across all five fingers. Combining sensor output with an SVM algorithm, the system achieves 98.61% accuracy in identifying finger grip strength injuries and classifies damage into three levels with an average accuracy of 96.67%. MUERS evaluates rehabilitation progress by scoring grip strength and providing feedback to clinicians. Over a four&#8208;week cycle, it consistently captures improvements in muscle recovery, aiding individualized rehabilitation plans. This system offers fine&#8208;grained assessment capabilities for diagnosing and monitoring nerve injury&#8208;induced muscle atrophy, paving the way for advanced biomedical sensing and personalized rehabilitation.

A multi&#8208;DoF processor is designed to perform versatile inference tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion product classification, logic operations, and image transformation. Moreover, a high&#8208;security information transmission framework is experimentally demonstrated that transforms a large volume of input data&#8212;encoded across multiple channels&#8212;into Morse code, with the true information subsequently synthesized through further decoding.








Abstract
All&#8208;optical diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) offer significant advantages in processing speed and power consumption, thereby accelerating the development of optical computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Integrating multiple degrees of freedom (multi&#8208;DoF) into D2NNs is a pivotal role in improving information processing and task&#8208;loading capacity, an enormous challenge in current all&#8208;optical diffractive computing/processors. Here, a multi&#8208;DoF diffractive processor is proposed and experimentally demonstrated that leverages a metasurfaces&#8208;based approach to integrate polarization, distance, and rotation channels for versatile inference tasks and information encryption. The approach is validated using three&#8208;layer metasurfaces that enable high task&#8208;capacity tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion&#8208;product classification, logic operators, and image transformation. Moreover, by mapping large volumes of input data into multi&#8208;DoF channels and encoding the information in Morse code with our D2NNs framework, a high&#8208;security information transmission system is experimentally implemented. The integration of polarization, distance, and rotation channels into an all&#8208;optical diffractive processor with multifunctional capabilities paves the way for multifunctional integrated devices and communication.

         <title>Ternary Inert Element Co&#8208;Doping: a New Approach to Stable 4.7&#160;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni inert co&#8208;doping synergistically enhances structural stability of LiCoO2 at highly delithiated state, with Mg/Ni stabilizing Li layers and suppressing oxygen loss, while Al reinforcing Co&#8211;O octahedra, giving a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles at 4.7&#160;V.








Abstract
LiCoO2 (LCO) has long dominated the cathode materials in portable electronic batteries due to its high volumetric energy density. However, the pursuit of higher voltages to achieve larger capacities remains a challenge due to severer structural degradation. Herein, a ternary inert element co&#8208;doping strategy that can greatly improve the structure stability of LCOs at elevated voltages is reported. Mg and Ni doping at Li site support the layered structure in the highly delithiated state, while Ni also facilitates the separation of O 2p and Co 3d orbits, thereby suppressing oxygen loss. Meanwhile, Al doping at Co site suppresses the distortion of Co&#8211;O octahedra and stabilizes the Co layers. The synergistic effects of Al, Mg and Ni co&#8208;doping inhibit the irreversible H3&#8211;H1&#8208;3 phase transitions and mitigate internal stress accumulation. The Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni co&#8208;doped LCO exhibits a capacity of 221&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 65.5% after 1500 cycles at 4.6&#160;V. At a higher voltage of 4.7&#160;V, it delivers a capacity of 225.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles. This multiple inert elements co&#8208;doping strategy gives an effective method for stabilizing the high&#8208;voltage LCO and other related layered oxide materials.

         <title>Amidation&#8208;Retarded Synthesis of Perovskite Quantum Dots with Low Defect Density and Enhanced Carrier Transport for Efficient Light Emitting Diodes and Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent metal halides are introduced to react with amide and retard amidation process, thereby releasing free ligands and preventing PbI2 precipitation at 200 &#176;C. The synthesized perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) show lower defect density and better charge transport capacity, realizing highly efficient CsPbI3 PQD LEDs (28.71%) and SCs (16.20%). Such strategy is universal in red/green/blue PQDs.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are promising for both solar cells (SCs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs) for their excellent optoelectronic characteristics and solution&#8208;processable fabrication. One of the general limitations for these two kinds of devices is that high defect density and poor charge transport, resulting from the unavoidable amidation&#8208;induced PbX2 precipitation at high reaction temperature. In this work, an amidation&#8208;retarded synthesis strategy is proposed to prevent the PbX2 precipitation and subsequent defect formation. Covalent metal halides are introduced to interrupt amidation by reacting with deprotonated oleic acid/protonated oleylamine. Then, free acids/amines are released to coordinate with PbX2 and form regular lead&#8208;halide octahedra during nucleation&#8208;growth process. The synthesized CsPbI3 PQDs exhibit lower defect density (5.1 &#215; 1017 cm&#8722;3), higher PLQY (92%) and better charge output capacity (&#8776;8 times improvement). As a result, the LEDs and SCs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.71% and power conversion efficiency of 16.20%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. Furthermore, the universality of such strategy has been demonstrated in red/green/blue LEDs, and could be expected in other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>An Elastomeric Electrolyte Based on Lithium&#8208;Ion&#8208;Selective Transmembrane Transport for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of fiber&#8208;network&#8208;based elastomeric solid electrolytes is formed through electrospinning&#8208;induced phase separation combined with in situ polymerization, featuring a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li+&#8208;selective permeability encapsulates fibrous plastic crystals. With the merits of the interconnected ion transport channels, the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;selective permeability, and the conformal interface, the assembled solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries incorporating this electrolyte demonstrate desirable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (SSLSBs) exhibit advantages such as high specific energy, safety, and low cost, making them an ideal candidate for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the current mechanical and electrochemical properties of solid&#8208;state electrolytes do not meet the requirements of the practical application of SSLSBs. Herein, a construction strategy of fiber&#8208;network&#8208;based elastomeric solid electrolytes (FESE) based on electrospinning&#8208;induced phase separation is proposed. The FESE features a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li+&#8208;selective permeability encapsulates a fibrous plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE). This structure originates from the phase separation and fiberization of a hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR) stabilized emulsion, driven by electrostatic jetting. Subsequently, in situ polymerization of methoxy polyethylene glycol is performed within the battery to achieve void filling. Benefiting from the interconnected ion transport channels, the Li+&#8208;selectivity, and the conformal interface, the as&#8208;prepared FESE electrolyte achieves a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.11 mS cm&#8315;&#185; and a Li+ transference number of 0.77. The as&#8208;assembled SSLSB delivers a high initial discharge capacity (1188 mAh g&#8722;1), remarkable rate capability (356 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4C), and excellent cycling performance (71.2% capacity retention after 800 cycles). This research presents a constructive strategy for the elastomeric electrolytes for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocluster&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With High External Quantum Efficiency and Saturated Red Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the fabrication of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) using self&#8208;emissive bimetallic gold&#8208;copper nanoclusters (NCs) is reported. The NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE; 12.60%) value with pure red emission among the solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;based LEDs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;emissive atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) are emerging as promising emissive layer material for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), thanks to their solid&#8208;state luminescence, well&#8208;defined structures, photo/thermal stability, low toxicity, and unique excited&#8208;state properties. However, achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) in solid&#8208;state NCs remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a highly stable bimetallic gold&#8208;copper NC forming [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] stabilized with 1&#8208;adamantanethiol (HSadm) and 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DPPE) as the primary and secondary ligands, respectively is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic analyses suggest that the as&#8208;synthesized NC contains one phosphine bound to gold and the second phosphine has oxidized to phosphine oxide (P&#9552;O). The presence of such P&#9552;O moieties in the NC facilitated C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions along with C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and H&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions between ligands, promoting rapid crystallization. Due to the exceptional photo/thermal stability and enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] NC is utilized to fabricate the NC&#8208;based LED (NC&#8208;LED) via the solution&#8208;processed technique, without using any additional host materials. The fabricated NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and an EQE of 12.60% with a pure red emission &#8776;668 nm. This EQE value coupled with saturated pure red emission is the best among solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;LEDs, suggesting the enormous potential of the NCs for electro&#8208;optical devices.

         <title>Manganese&#8211;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Ion Batteries With Varying Mechanical Adaptability and Machine Learning&#8211;Assisted Performance Decoding</title>

         <dc:description>
By rationally designing &#960;&#8722;conjugated anthraquinone&#8722;based redox&#8722;active ligands (DHAQ/DAAQ), a series of layered, flower&#8211;like MnMOC structures are synthesized. Comprehensive characterization techniques are employed to systematically investigate the reaction mechanisms of these MnMOCs in AZIBs. Importantly, a machine learning&#8722;based model is developed to predict specific capacity. Notably, the MnMOCs demonstrates excellent performance in practical applications, offering strong support for the advancement of MOC materials in the field of energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high safety and low cost; however, their development is hindered by the poor cycling stability and low capacity of traditional inorganic cathode materials. This study innovatively utilizes dihydroxy/diamino anthraquinone (DHAQ/DAAQ) ligands featuring &#960;&#8211;conjugated systems and quinone&#8211;based redox activity. By precisely regulating the substitution sites (1,2&#8211;/1,4&#8211;/1,5&#8211;) and coordinating them with Mn2+, layered flower&#8722;cluster Manganese&#8211;based metal&#8211;organic coordination is successfully constructed. The experimental results indicated that in the Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ cathode, the symmetric structure of the 1,4&#8211;dihydroxy substitution promoted electron delocalization and formed stable coordination bonds with Mn2+, thereby providing excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, both in situ and ex situ characterizations elucidated the Zn2+ storage mechanism during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Notably, this work incorporated machine learning techniques to develop a specific capacity prediction model, laying a methodological foundation for future research in the field of energy storage. Theoretical calculations are employed to gain deeper insight into the underlying reasons for the outstanding performance of Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ. In addition, Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ is successfully applied as a cathode material in soft&#8722;pack batteries, gel electrolyte devices, and screen&#8722;printed devices, demonstrating excellent mechanical adaptability and practical application potential. Novel strategy for high&#8722;performance MOC&#8211;based AZIBs boosts practical energy storage applications.

         <title>In Situ Dual&#8208;Ionic Charge Compensation for CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile dual&#8208;ion charge compensation strategy is reported for in situ reinforcement surface lattices of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 perovskite quantum dot solar cells with a record power conversion efficiency of 18.17%. The formed dual&#8208;ionic ligands can effectively compensate for the surface vacancies of perovskite quantum dots, enhancing crystal morphology and electronic coupling of perovskite quantum dots while eliminating trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination.








Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dots (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs) receive increasing attention for new&#8208;generation solar cells due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and solution processibility. However, during the synthesis of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, PQDs seriously suffer from the ligand detachment from the PQD surface under the polar antisolvent, leaving numerous surface vacancies that significantly compromise the surface lattice integrity and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. A facile dual&#8208;ionic charge compensation strategy is introduced through the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) to reinforce the surface lattice of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs. The dual&#8208;ionic ligands produced during the SN2 reaction could in situ fill the surface vacancies of PQDs in the nonpolar solvent, which significantly improves the surface lattice integrity and thus the optoelectronic properties of PQDs, substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the PQDs solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of up to 18.17%, representing the highest efficiency in CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. The remarkable photovoltaic performance is attributed to the reinforced surface lattice of PQDs, suppressing the energy losses induced by the nonradiative recombination. This study provides crucial design principles for optimizing the crystalline structure integrity of PQDs, which also paves a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

However, during the synthesis of Cs&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs, PQDs seriously suffer from the ligand detachment from the PQD surface under the polar antisolvent, leaving numerous surface vacancies that significantly compromise the surface lattice integrity and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. A facile dual-ionic charge compensation strategy is introduced through the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2) to reinforce the surface lattice of Cs&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQDs. The dual-ionic ligands produced during the &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction could in situ fill the surface vacancies of PQDs in the nonpolar solvent, which significantly improves the surface lattice integrity and thus the optoelectronic properties of PQDs, substantially diminishing trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the PQDs solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of up to 18.17%, representing the highest efficiency in Cs&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PQD solar cells. The remarkable photovoltaic performance is attributed to the reinforced surface lattice of PQDs, suppressing the energy losses induced by the nonradiative recombination. This study provides crucial design principles for optimizing the crystalline structure integrity of PQDs, which also paves a new avenue for developing high-performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Superelasticity in Mo17O47/MoS2 Core&#8211;Shell Nanowires</title>

[001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47/MoS2 core&#8211;shell nanowires exhibit remarkable superelasticity. Three&#8208;point bending tests confirm Young's modulus (103 GPa) matching DFT predictions. In situ scanning electron microscopy bending reveals 35% recoverable strain, unprecedented in inorganic nanowires. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute this superelasticity to reversible transitions between chemical bonding and van der Waals interactions, showing potential for flexible electronics.








Abstract
Inorganic materials are usually known with high modulus and brittleness. Here the finding of a [001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47 nanowires (NWs) material is reported with a thin MoS2 shell that exhibits superelastic deformability superior to the reported inorganic NWs. Three&#8208;point bending tests reveal that the elastic modulus of Mo17O47 crystals in the [001] direction is 103&#160;GPa, consistent with the density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;predicted results. Furthermore, in situ bending tests via scanning electron microscopy, accomplished with finite element simulations, demonstrate that the NWs can sustain bending strains up to 35% repeatedly without showing appreciable residual deformation. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that this extraordinary superelasticity results from the smooth transformation between the chemical bonding and physical binding (van der Waals) in the [001] direction of Mo17O47 crystal. The remarkable superelasticity of Mo17O47 NWs may offer enormous potential in flexible electronics and photonic devices.
