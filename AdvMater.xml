         <title>Efficient Blue Perovskite LEDs via Bottom&#8208;Up Charge Manipulation for Solution&#8208;Processed Active&#8208;Matrix Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up collaborative charge manipulation strategy is developed to minimize the interfacial charge loss in blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, leading to stable blue electroluminescence and an external quantum efficiency of 25.87%. Solution&#8208;processed active&#8208;matrix display with clear and uniform patterning is achieved by integrating with thin&#8208;film transistor circuits.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are emerging as strong candidates for next&#8208;generation displays due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, solution processability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the development of highly efficient blue PeLEDs remains a significant challenge. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is introduced for precise charge manipulation in blue perovskites to enhance radiative recombination efficiency. By employing 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene as an inserted hole transport layer, improved hole injection efficiency is achieved while effectively suppressing reverse electron transport and exciton quenching. Additionally, a fluorinated ester additive is incorporated to control perovskite crystallization, facilitating the formation of well&#8208;aligned reduced&#8208;dimensional phases to reduce nonradiative recombination losses. The resulting blue PeLEDs exhibit a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 25.87%, the highest reported for one&#8208;step&#8208;prepared blue perovskite films. Furthermore, integration with thin&#8208;film transistor circuits enables solution&#8208;processed active&#8208;matrix perovskite displays with sharp and uniform patterning. This work provides a comprehensive pathway for advancing blue PeLEDs toward high&#8208;performance display applications.

         <title>Molecular Reconstruction for the High&#8208;Performance Recycled Fluororubbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular reconstruction strategy is proposed to upcycle waste fluororubber into chemically awakenable and high&#8208;performance ATLF&#8208;Boc through three reactions: controlled oxidative degradation, fluorination addition and decarboxylation amination. This strategy solved the problem of difficult recovery of waste fluororubber, realized the upgrading and recycling of waste fluororubber. Furthermore, an epoxy curing system is constructed to achieve control of ATLF performance.








Abstract
To address the challenges associated with the difficult recycling of fluorinated specialty materials and the subpar performance of recycled products, a molecular reconstruction strategy of oxidative degradation, fluorination addition is reported, and end&#8208;group transformation, which upcycled waste fluororubber into high&#8208;performance, chemically awakenable amino&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (ATLF&#8208;Boc). Leveraging the chemical properties of the vinylidene fluoride structure in the waste fluororubber, carboxyl&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (CTLF) with controlled molecular weight and end&#8208;group content are synthesized. Further, the whole chain is structurally strengthened at the molecular scale to achieve higher fluorine content and thermal stability, and saturated carboxyl&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (SCTLF) is synthesized. Subsequently, to balance high reactivity and stable storage, high&#8208;performance ATLF&#8208;Boc is synthesized, realizing the upcycling of waste fluororubber. After upcycling, the awakened ATLF exhibits a high fluorine content (66.95%), and the cured ATLF shows the regulation of surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (between 43&#176; and 114&#176;), a high tensile strength of 13.3&#160;MPa, an excellent thermal stability (T10% = 359&#160;&#176;C). In this study, a novel solution for the upcycling of waste fluororubbers for fabricating functional materials is offered, which is of great significance in the field of fluorinated specialty materials.

         <title>Flexible Tunable&#8208;Plasticity Synaptic Transistors for Mimicking Dynamic Cognition and Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible tunable&#8208;plasticity synaptic transistor (TST) is developed using indium gallium zinc oxide as a channel and a hybrid polyimide and Al2O3 layer as dielectric. The TST exhibits a transition from short&#8208;term plasticity to long&#8208;term plasticity by adjusting stimulus amplitude. It also enables neural networks with 94.1% recognition and 4&#8208;bit reservoir computing, laying the foundation for intelligent and efficient computing systems.








Abstract
Inspired by biological systems, neuromorphic computing can process extensive data and complex tasks more efficiently than traditional architectures. Artificial synaptic devices, serving as fundamental components in neuromorphic computing, needto closely mimic synaptic characteristics and construct neural network computing systems. However, most existing multifunctional synapse devices are structurally complex and lack tunability, making them unsuitable for building smarter computing systems. In this work, a flexible tunable&#8208;plasticity synaptic transistor (TST) is realized with memory modulation and neuromorphic computing capabilities by using indium gallium zinc oxide as channel and a hybrid layer of polyimide and Al2O3 as dielectric. The TST exhibits a novel transition from short&#8208;term plasticity to long&#8208;term one by adjusting stimulus amplitude, mirroring dynamic human memory and forgetting behaviors across various scenarios. A neural network system with low non&#8208;linearity and a wide range of conductance variations is constructed, and it demonstrates a 94.1% recognition rate on classical datasets. A reservoir computing system for 4&#8208;bit coding is also developed, which significantly reduces computational complexity and network size without sacrificing recognition accuracy. The devices and the system work as the foundation of more intelligent and more efficient computing systems.

         <title>Phototunable Rayleigh 3D Soft Self&#8208;Oscillator Enabling Versatile Biomimetic Tubular Peristaltic Pumping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging biomechanical strategy based on two direction&#8208;and&#8208;dimension&#8208;tubular instabilities: postbuckling and snapping, it has created a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self&#8208;oscillator with direction/dimension/symmetry tunable self&#8208;oscillating deformations, which allow for controllable manipulation of spatiotemporal 3D motions of local tubular walls to achieve high&#8208;DOF, multimodal, autonomous biomimetic tubular peristaltic pumping that can adapt to transporting a variety of matter.








Abstract
Living tubular organs can spatiotemporally and cyclically deform their muscular walls to implement adaptable and sustainable peristaltic pumping applicable to broad matter, achieved via asymmetric and non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;oscillating deformations of muscular walls. However, man&#8208;made tubular soft actuators have been limited to pumping a few simple matters, because of their reciprocal and monotonic wall motions that cannot break time&#8208;reversal symmetry and system equilibrium to gain adaptable and sustainable pumping. Here, a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self&#8208;oscillator (PR3DSSO) capable of multimodal, nonreciprocal, self&#8208;sustainable wall deformations is presented. PR3DSSO's design leverages two direction&#8208;and&#8208;dimension&#8208;phototunable tubular instabilities: snapping and postbuckling. The post&#8208;buckling instability can generate local&#8208;wall origami which cannot only fold local walls into multimodal shape&#8208;mode waves, but also break wall&#8208;motion symmetry; snapping instabilities help break equilibrium in wall motions to initiate autonomous wall motions.

     alt="Phototunable Rayleigh 3D Soft Self-Oscillator Enabling Versatile Biomimetic Tubular Peristaltic Pumping"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging biomechanical strategy based on two direction-and-dimension-tubular instabilities: postbuckling and snapping, it has created a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self-oscillator with direction/dimension/symmetry tunable self-oscillating deformations, which allow for controllable manipulation of spatiotemporal 3D motions of local tubular walls to achieve high-DOF, multimodal, autonomous biomimetic tubular peristaltic pumping that can adapt to transporting a variety of matter.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living tubular organs can spatiotemporally and cyclically deform their muscular walls to implement adaptable and sustainable peristaltic pumping applicable to broad matter, achieved via asymmetric and non-equilibrium self-oscillating deformations of muscular walls. However, man-made tubular soft actuators have been limited to pumping a few simple matters, because of their reciprocal and monotonic wall motions that cannot break time-reversal symmetry and system equilibrium to gain adaptable and sustainable pumping. Here, a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self-oscillator (PR3DSSO) capable of multimodal, nonreciprocal, self-sustainable wall deformations is presented. PR3DSSO's design leverages two direction-and-dimension-phototunable tubular instabilities: snapping and postbuckling. The post-buckling instability can generate local-wall origami which cannot only fold local walls into multimodal shape-mode waves, but also break wall-motion symmetry; snapping instabilities help break equilibrium in wall motions to initiate autonomous wall motions. These phototunable-instabilities-driven wall deformations unprecedentedly create Rayleigh-like 3D wall motions, which allow for versatile biomimetic tubular peristaltic pumping adapt to broad matter. Our PR3DSSO would spur creative life-like active-material designs and novel pumping functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation with a Supramolecular Assembled Template Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells for Minimizing the VOC Deficit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic phosphonate&#8208;based supramolecule functions as a perovskite crystallization&#8208;driven template at SnO2/perovskite buried interface, which induces a highly preferred (100) orientation toward out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, facilitates carrier extraction and transfer, passivates the intrinsic defects, and achieves a promising efficiency of 25.34%, with a maximum VOC of 1.23 V, corresponding to the lowest reported 0.306 V deficit.








Abstract
Despite the rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the past decade, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs still lags behind the theoretical Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. Energy&#8208;level mismatch and unwanted nonradiative recombination at key interfaces are the main factors detrimental to VOC. Herein, a perovskite crystallization&#8208;driven template is constructed at the SnO2/perovskite buried interface through a self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic phosphonate derivative. The highly oriented supramolecular template grows from an evolutionary selection growth via solid&#8211;solid phase transition. This strategy induces perovskite crystallization into a highly preferred (100) orientation toward out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and facilitated carrier extraction and transfer due to the elimination of energy barrier. This self&#8208;assembly process positively passivates the intrinsic surface defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface through the functionalized moieties, a marked contrast to the passive effect achieved via incidental contacts in conventional passivation methods. As a result, PSCs with buried interface modification exhibit a promising PCE of 25.34%, with a maximum VOC of 1.23&#160;V, corresponding to a mere 0.306&#160;V deficit (for perovskite bandgap of 1.536&#160;eV), reaching 97.2% of the theoretical VOC limit. This strategy spontaneously improves the long&#8208;term operational stability of PSCs under thermal and moisture stress (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3: MPP, 65 &#176;C, 50% RH, T92 lifetime exceeding 1200&#160;h).

         <title>Optical Synaptic Devices with Multiple Encryption Features Based on SERS&#8208;Revealed Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid R6G/InSe structure is designed, and the charge transfer mechanism within this structure is validated using SERS. This structure effectively emulates biological synapses, comprising a presynaptic membrane (R6G photosensitive layer), synaptic cleft (R6G/InSe interface), and postsynaptic membrane (InSe sensing layer). The charge transfer process in this structure closely mirrors the neurotransmitter transfer across the synaptic cleft. Surface treatment techniques are employed to regulate the charge transfer process, enabling multiple on&#8208;chip encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications to be developed.








Abstract
2D optical synaptic devices with atomic&#8208;scale thickness show potential for building highly integrated tunable artificial visual neural networks. However, their atomic&#8208;scale thickness also leads to weak light absorption, limiting device photoresponse. Here, a high&#8208;performance optical synaptic device based on a Rhodamine 6G (R6G)/InSe hybrid structure is proposed, achieving a remarkable 328.9% enhancement in photoresponse compared to InSe devices. Using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a nondestructive probing technique, it is demonstrated that light&#8208;induced charge transfer between R6G and InSe is the key mechanism enabling the device's high performance. Furthermore, introducing a self&#8208;limited oxide layer on the InSe surface provides additional evidence for the charge transfer process. This charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;based device effectively mimics the neurotransmitter transmission process in biological synapses, showing unique potential in applications such as image preprocessing and decoding within artificial neural networks. In addition, through surface treatment techniques, precise control over the charge transfer process is achieved, enabling the design of a multiple encryption&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting array and highlighting their value in on&#8208;chip anti&#8208;counterfeiting. By employing a spectrally noninvasive method to probe charge transfer, this study elucidates the critical role of charge transfer in optical synaptic devices and opens novel application pathways.

         <title>Manipulating the Assembly and Architecture of Fibrillar Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, advanced in situ AFM, PiFM, and Cryo&#8208;EM are leveraged to realize in situ observations of nucleation, growth, and degradation of silk nanofibrils. A clear picture of the assembly and structural evolution of regenerated silk nanofibrils is defined and demonstrates a novel strategy for manipulating their structure and properties, which emerges from the understanding of their structure and assembly.








Abstract
Silk is a unique and exceptionally strong biological material. However, no synthetic method has yet come close to replicating the properties of natural silk. This shortfall is attributed to an insufficient understanding of both silk nanofibril structure and the mechanism of formation. Here in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photo&#8208;induced force microscopy (PiFM) is utilized to investigate the formation process and define the basic structural paradigm of individual silk nanofibrils. By visualizing the multistage process of silk nanofibril formation, the importance of conformational transformations along the assembly pathway is revealed. Unfolded silk structures initially accumulate into amorphous clusters, which then evolve into crystal nuclei via conformational transformation into &#946;&#8208;crystallites. Nanofibril elongation then occurs through the attachment of silk molecules at a single end of the nanofibril tip; this is facilitated through the formation of a new amorphous cluster that then repeats the aforementioned conformational transformation. However, enzymatic digestion of the amorphous regions leads to direct, rapid elongation of &#946;&#8208;crystalline fibers. These findings imply that the energy landscape is characterized by shallow minima associated with intermediate states, which can be eliminated by introducing &#946;&#8208;crystallites, and motivate research into the directed modification of the silk assembly pathway to select for features beneficial to specific applications.

         <title>Fast Encapsulation of Microbes into Dissolvable Hydrogel Beads Enables High&#8208;Throughput Microbial Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing of Clinical Microbiome Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops smGel&#8208;seq, a high&#8208;throughput microbial single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing method characterized by low microbial&#160;input, minimal loss, reduced bias, and high sample compatibility using dissolvable hydrogel beads. smGel&#8208;seq achieves the first microbial single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing in a clinical sputum microbiome sample and found different subpopulations, one of which may be critical for antibiotic resistance and virulence.








Abstract
Microbial single&#8208;cell RNA&#8208;seq (mscRNA&#8208;seq) can achieve resolution at the cellular level, enhancing the understanding of microbial communities. However, current high&#8208;throughput mscRNA&#8208;seq methods are limited by multiple centrifugation steps, which can lead to microbial loss and bias. smGel&#8208;seq is reported, a high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;microbe RNA sequencing method for clinical microbiome samples that employs hydrogel beads to encapsulate individual microbes to reduce microbial loss and input requirements. In this method, a novel microchannel array device is implemented for encapsulating single microbe in dissolvable hydrogel beads (smDHBs), along with an optimized automated microfluidic platform to co&#8208;encapsulate barcoded beads and smDHBs, enabling high&#8208;throughput barcoding of individual microbes. smGel&#8208;seq significantly increases the microbial recovery rate in a gut microbiome sample from 8.8% to 91.8%. Furthermore, this method successfully processes clinical microbiome samples with microbial inputs 20 times lower than those required by previous methods. Notably, smGel&#8208;seq enables the first mscRNA&#8208;seq in a clinical sputum microbiome sample, revealing a specific microbial subpopulation that may play a key role in environmental adaptability, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenicity. These results highlight the compatibility of smGel&#8208;seq with clinical microbiome samples and demonstrate its potential for widespread application in diverse clinical and research settings.

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Emission via Dynamic Triplet Energy Transfer in Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is proposed based on host&#8208;guest doping to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive, color&#8208;tunable, and time&#8208;dependent organic afterglow glasses by dynamic triplet energy transfer processes. Impressively, the phosphorescence resonance energy tranfer and Dexter&#8208;type triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanisms are revealed by fs&#8208;TA spectra. The potential applications of these organic glasses in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting, dynamic data encryption, as well as large&#8208;area and flexible afterglow display are demonstrated.








Abstract
Dynamic organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) glasses with color tunability offer significant potential for practical applications due to their high transparency and excellent machinability. In this study, organic glasses with efficient and dynamic RTP properties are used as triplet donors, combined with commercially available chromophores as singlet/triplet acceptors, to successfully fabricate a series of host&#8208;guest doping glasses with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and dynamic responses to external stimuli. The energy transfer mechanisms, including triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet phosphorescence resonance energy transfer and Dexter&#8208;type triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, are confirmed using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. These organic glasses demonstrate excellent transparency, good machinability, and dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli. The study highlights their potential applications in large&#8208;area afterglow glass fabrication, dynamic data encryption, and flexible afterglow displays. This work not only provides a simple design principle for developing novel organic glass materials with color tunability and dynamic responses but also promotes the potential applications of organic RTP materials in dynamic information encryption and flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Halogen Pockets Steering *CO Adsorption Configurations for Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of copper nanoparticles encaged in polymer&#8208;halogen pockets for selective CO2 reduction are presented. As a direct outcome, the strategy achieves selective conversion of ethylene and ethanol, &#8776;48.3 &#177; 1.3% selectivity for ethanol, and 60.3 &#177; 2.1% for ethylene.








Abstract
The selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) toward specific C2 products represents a critical challenge for practical applicability, requiring precise control over *CO intermediates. Herein, a &#8220;polymer&#8208;halogen&#8221; pocketed Cu catalyst is proposed, wherein the adjustable concentration of Iodide ion (I&#8722;) within the pocket enables continuous modulation of *CO adsorption configurations on the Cu, thereby enabling tailored CO2R toward ethylene or ethanol production. A perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;modified CuI catalyst is constructed, where I&#8722; is in situ leaching from CuI and subsequently confined by PFSA as an anion shielding layer to form polymer&#8208;halogen pockets. By tuning the thickness of PFSA shell, the amount of I&#8722; in the pocket can be controlled. The surface&#8208;enhanced in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the coverage of *CO intermediates on Cu surface increases and tends to adsorb at low coordination Cu sites in catalyst granule for dimerization reaction as the I&#8722; concentration in the pocket increases. Furthermore, the coordination environment exhibits distinct product selectivity. *CO at medium&#8208;coordinated sites favor ethanol production, while those at low&#8208;coordinated sites are conducive to ethylene formation. This strategy enables wide modulation of ethylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol ratios from 0.65 to 3.96, achieving peak Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 60.3 &#177;&#160;2.1% for ethylene and 48.3 &#177;&#160;1.3% for ethanol.

         <title>Modulating Coalescence Timing of Liquid Marbles via Wettability Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of nanoparticles embedded with wettability adaptation allows the modulation of coalescence timing of liquid marbles on solid surfaces with &#8776;1 min resolutions without requiring external interventions. It enables droplet&#8208;based cascade chemical reaction and Janus liquid/gas marble formation. Overall, it opens new possibilities in droplet/bubble science.








Abstract
Droplet coalescence is ubiquitous in nature, and its regulation is significant in industrial processes and biomedical applications. While bare droplets suddenly coalesce in contact, the droplets covered with liquid&#8208;repellent particles to form &#8220;liquid marbles (LMs)&#8221; are not. Previously, the external stimuli&#8208;responsive breakage of the particle layer enables the regulation of the coalescence timing. However, preprogramming the coalescence timing of droplets without stimuli is challenging. In this work, LMs that break the particle layer in preprogrammed time are reported. The particles have a core wettable site and are tethered with a low&#8208;wettability flexible molecular chain, which gradually increases wettability with time. The time&#8208;dependent wettability variation is observed because of the differences in the adaptation of the molecular chain; thus, it is repeatedly available, and its speed is controllable by chain length. The formed LMs expose bare droplet surfaces in preprogrammed timing, which enables the modulation of coalescence timing from 2 to 45 min without relying on external stimuli. Moreover, the additivity of the particles enables the fine&#8208;tuning of the coalescence time with &#8776;1&#160;min resolutions. Further, the contact of several LMs with different adaptation times enables cascade droplet coalescence, opening a new route for droplet manipulation.

         <title>Mechanically Enhanced, Environmentally Stable, and Bioinspired Charge&#8208;Gradient Hydrogel Membranes for Efficient Ion Gradient Power Generation and Linear Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of an ion gradient, the constructed charge gradients in the ultrathin ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes of hydrogel solid&#8208;state electric organ accelerate ion transport while mitigating ion concentration polarization, achieving high electrical output performance. More interestingly, the prepared device can still be applied as a linear self&#8208;powered pressure sensor after the ion gradient is completely dissipated.








Abstract
The soft hydrogel power source is an interesting example of generating electricity from clean energy. However, ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes in the systems are often limited by low ion selectivity, high membrane resistance, insufficient mass transfer, and ion concentration polarization, resulting in a generally low power output. Inspired by the unique structure of the electric ray's electric organ, a vertically stacked hydrogel artificial electric organ is proposed, aiming to increase the output current to a greater extent. By constructing the charge gradient in ultrathin ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes, ion transport is accelerated while mitigating the ion concentration polarization. A single hydrogel artificial electric organ achieves high outputs of &#8776;290&#160;mV and &#8776;1.46&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with rechargeability, surpassing similar devices. Density functional theory further reveals that the energy barrier of ion transport in charge&#8208;gradient membranes is lower than that in nongradient membranes. More impressively, the device can still be applied as a linear self&#8208;powered pressure sensor for monitoring human activities after the ion gradient is completely dissipated. This study elucidates the key role of the structure and design of ion&#8208;selective membranes in the artificial gel power generation system, providing new insights into the further development and multifunctional application of flexible gel power source.

         <title>Pressure Induced Molecular&#8208;Arrangement and Charge&#8208;Density Perturbance in Doped Polymer for Intelligent Motion and Vocal Recognitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sidechain doped polymer is investigated to have great potential for pressure detection due to the advantages including molecular rearrangement and charge&#8208;density perturbance induced by micro&#8208;mechanical deformation. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis and intelligent vocal recognitions.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) show great potential for pressure detection due to the amorphous polymer packing, but a lack of clarity regarding sensing mechanisms hampers the development of further applications. Herein, a sacrificial template&#8208;full solution method with both rough surface and high conductivity is described that can be applied to sandwich&#8208;structured resistive pressure sensors. Transient absorption measurements demonstrate the significant increase of carrier lifetime (from 1.44 to 2.54&#160;ns) induced by pressure, which directly evidenced the superior sensing mechanism of sidechain doped conjugated polymer. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis including wrist pulse, swallowing, finger bending, grabbing, and typing. Additionally, an intelligent vocal recognition system with convolutional neural networks is used which can achieve &gt;96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles. This general approach is anticipated and enables a new direction for the development of pressure sensors.

This sensor displayed low-pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi-mode motion analysis and intelligent vocal recognitions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers (CPs) show great potential for pressure detection due to the amorphous polymer packing, but a lack of clarity regarding sensing mechanisms hampers the development of further applications. Herein, a sacrificial template-full solution method with both rough surface and high conductivity is described that can be applied to sandwich-structured resistive pressure sensors. Transient absorption measurements demonstrate the significant increase of carrier lifetime (from 1.44 to 2.54&#160;ns) induced by pressure, which directly evidenced the superior sensing mechanism of sidechain doped conjugated polymer. This sensor displayed low-pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi-mode motion analysis including wrist pulse, swallowing, finger bending, grabbing, and typing. Additionally, an intelligent vocal recognition system with convolutional neural networks is used which can achieve &amp;gt;96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles. This general approach is anticipated and enables a new direction for the development of pressure sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Regulation of Adhesion/De&#8208;Adhesion/Release Capacity of Transparent and Electrochromic Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid and L&#8208;arginine. The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions not only endow the hydrogel with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release.








Abstract
Removing adhesive nondestructively and intact from the adhered surface is a difficult challenge for advanced adhesive materials. Compared with the commonly used thermal or chemical release, the controlled adhesive release via electric&#8208;field offers practical application advantages. However, a noninvasive release mode such as this has not been available for the de&#8208;bonding of supramolecular adhesives that originate from small organic molecules. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid (TA) and L&#8208;arginine (LA). The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions of poly[TA&#8208;LA], especially its electrostatic interactions, not only endow it with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion (up to 363.3&#160;kPa) but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release. The poly[TA&#8208;LA] adhesive layer can be easily released within a short time (&lt;60 s) under a mild voltage (5&#8776;10&#160;V). After a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, It is concluded that the adhesive&#8208;layer morphological and mechanical changes, activated by a weak current (1.1&#8776;3.2&#160;mA), are responsible for the adhesion failure, which takes place primarily at the anode. Importantly, rapid electric release of poly[TA&#8208;LA] is applicable at low temperatures (5 V, 60 s, &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) or underwater (5 V, 60 s, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Magnetically Switchable Adhesive Millirobots for Universal Manipulation in both Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of millirobots with magnetically switchable adhesion, enabled by soft, double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with side liquid&#8208;repellency. These millirobots can universally manipulate a wide range of targets in both air and water. Beyond transportation, they are capable of performing various complex tasks, such as circuit repair, precision assembly, and high&#8208;speed actuation in amphibious environments.








Abstract
Magnetic soft robots with multimodal locomotion have demonstrated significant potential for target manipulation tasks in hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach spaces in recent years. Achieving universal manipulation between robots and their targets requires a nondestructive and easily switchable interaction with broad applicability across diverse targets. However, establishing versatile and dynamic interactions between diverse targets and robotic systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of magnetic millirobots capable of universal target manipulation with magnetically switchable adhesion is reported. Through two&#8208;photon lithography&#8208;assisted molding, magnetic soft double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with liquid repellency are fabricated on the robots. These micropillar arrays can serve as switchable adhesion units for the millirobots to effectively manipulate targets of various geometries (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) in both air and water. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations, these adhesive robots can perform various complex tasks, including circuit repair, mini&#8208;turbine assembly, and high&#8208;speed underwater rotation of the turbine machine. This work may offer a versatile approach to magnetic manipulation of non&#8208;magnetic objects through amphibious adhesion, emerging as a new paradigm in robotic manipulation.

         <title>Multifunctional Spinel Structure for Efficient Direct Recycling of Spent Layered Cathodes into Fast&#8208;Charging Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A channel&#8208;assisted regeneration strategy that utilizes waste spinel cathode materials to construct fast lithium&#8208;ion replenishment channels on the surface of spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 materials is proposed. This surface reconstruction not only facilitates efficient material regeneration but also effectively mitigates lattice expansion and side reactions under fast&#8208;charging conditions, thereby optimizing the comprehensive electrochemical performance of the regenerated materials.








Abstract
Direct recycling is increasingly recognized as a promising solution to alleviate the burgeoning contradiction between the growing demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and amidst resource shortages. A critical challenge in this process is achieving efficient lithium compensation, which is vital for replenishing lost elements and promoting the reconstruction of degraded structures. Herein, inspired by the concept of &#8220;recycle waste with waste,&#8221; a channel&#8208;assisted regeneration strategy is proposed that utilizes waste spinel materials to reconstruct the surface of the spent layered cathode, clearing blocked channels and transforming them into a 3D&#160;structure that facilitates rapid lithium&#8208;ion transmission. This approach enhances the efficient replenishment of exogenous lithium salts into the particle lattice and prevents intrinsic thermal decomposition during heat treatment due to element deficiencies. The presence of the 3D ion channels can also improve the fast&#8208;charging performance of the regenerated cathode material, achieving a capacity retention rate of 87.9% after 500 cycles at 10&#160;C. Additionally, its overall electrochemical performance significantly outperforms that of commercial materials. This work addresses critical challenges in the direct solid&#8208;phase regeneration of cathode materials and offers valuable insights for optimizing next&#8208;generation LIB recycling technologies.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Mediated Topological Interlayer Shift in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present work demonstrates an efficient proton&#8208;mediation strategy for precise regulation of interlayer shift of 2D D&#8208;A COFs for facilitated charge transfer and exciton dissociation in photocatalytic water reduction. The structure with eclipsed AA stacking delivers an improved hydrogen evolution rate up to 171.2 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, setting a new benchmark in photocatalysis employing 2D COFs. These findings highlight the significance of addressing the topology&#8208;governed charge transfer dynamics in COFs for efficient solar energy conversion.








Abstract
The interlayer carriers dynamics are of significance in optoelectronic applications of 2D donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), while are challenged by the delicate control over the inherently variable and sensitive interlayer interaction. Present work demonstrates an efficient proton&#8208;mediation strategy that allows for the precise regulation of interlayer shift of 2D D&#8208;A COFs for facilitated charge transfer and exciton dissociation. Exemplified by three imine&#8208;linked D&#8208;A COFs (IMDA), mild proton&#8208;mediation generates an eclipsed AA stacking (IMDA&#8208;AA) featuring in&#8208;plane D&#8208;A pairs and fully overlapping D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugations, while excessive proton&#8208;mediation disrupts these conjugations, resulting in a slipped AA stacking (IMDA&#8208;SAA) with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane D&#8208;A pairs. Further analysis reveals that the interlayer topology of eclipsed AA stacking of IMDA favors for the synergistically optimized charge transfer dynamics, including enhanced intralayer charge transport with reduced exciton binding energy, and boosted interlayer exciton dissociation. IMDA&#8208;AA COF delivers an improved hydrogen evolution rate up to 171.2&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 under visible light illumination in the presence of 1.5 wt.% Pt co&#8208;catalysts, which is as far as is known the highest value among the reports of 2D COFs based photocatalysis. Present work will provide an important avenue of addressing the topology&#8208;governed charge transfer dynamics within COFs for solar energy conversion.

         <title>A Salidroside&#8208;Based Radiosensitizer Regulates the Nrf2/ROS Pathway for X&#8208;Ray Activated Synergistic Cancer Precise Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radiosensitizer integrating traditional Chinese medicine compound salidroside, Cu2+, and &#8226;OH activated FL molecules is developed, which achieves enhanced radiosensitization effect and promotes CDT efficacy monitored by NIR&#8208;II FL imaging. Salidroside blocks cells in the G2/M phase with the highest radiosensitivity and amplifies ROS levels, which provides sufficient chemical fuel for Cu+&#8208;mediated CDT to generate more &#8226;OH.








Abstract
The hypoxic microenvironment and radioresistance of tumor cells, as well as the delay in efficacy evaluation, significantly limit the effect of clinical radiotherapy. Therefore, developing effective radiosensitizers with monitoring of tumor response is of great significance for precise radiotherapy. Herein, a novel radiosensitizer (term as: SCuFs) is developed, consisting of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds salidroside, Cu2+, and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) activated second near&#8208;infrared window fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) molecules, which make the radiosensitization effect and boosted chemodynamic therapy (CDT) efficacy. The overexpressed glutathione in the tumor induces the SCuFs dissociation, allowing deep penetration of the drug to the whole tumor region. After X&#8208;ray irradiation, salidroside inhibits the Nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;like 2 (Nrf2)protein expression and blocks cells in the G2/M phase with the highest radiosensitivity, which amplifies the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to exacerbate DNA damage, thus achieving radiosensitization. Meanwhile, the upregulated ROS provides sufficient chemical fuel for Cu+&#8208;mediated CDT to produce more &#8226;OH. NIR&#8208;II FL imaging can monitor the &#8226;OH changes during the therapy process, confirming the radiosensitization effect and CDT process related to &#8226;OH. This study not only achieves effective radiosensitization and cascaded ROS&#8208;mediated CDT efficacy, but also provides a useful tool for monitoring therapeutic efficacy, showing great prospects for clinical application.

         <title>Hyper&#8208;Crosslinking to Customize Ultrathin&#8208;Wall Closed Pores in Pitch&#8208;Derived Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative hyper&#8208;crosslinking strategy to molecularly reconstruct pitch and precisely tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure of derived carbon. This strategy enables the structure transition from graphitic soft carbon to highly disordered carbon with abundant closed&#8208;pore featuring appropriate pore sizes (2&#160;nm) and ultrathin pore walls (1&#8211;2 layers). This work advances the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance carbon materials.








Abstract
Pitch is a highly preferable and cost&#8208;effective precursor of carbon materials. Nevertheless, its direct pyrolysis typically yields highly graphitized soft carbon, posing challenges to the modulation of closed&#8208;pore architecture, due to intense intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This results in a negligible plateau capacity and sluggish diffusion kinetics in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In this study, an innovative hyper&#8208;crosslinking strategy is proposed to reconstruct pitch molecularly and precisely tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure of the derived carbon. The crosslinker intertwined the pitch units, transforming the linear molecules into 3D porous polymers. Structurally, these 3D cavities tactfully reserved space for forming closed&#8208;pore cores, with the single&#8208;layer pitch network skeleton transforming into ultrathin pore walls upon carbonization. This strategy enabled the disruption of intense &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and, therefore, inhibited structural ordering, facilitating a structure transition from graphitic soft carbon to highly&#8208;disordered carbon with abundant closed pores featuring appropriate pore sizes (2&#160;nm) and ultrathin pore walls (1&#8211;2 layers). The optimal sample delivered a high capacity of 370&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, as well as a rate capability that surpassed those of most previously reported pitch&#8208;derived carbons. Hyper&#8208;crosslinking has advanced the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance carbon materials for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Integrating Ethereal Molecular Backbones into the Ester Solvent with High Solubility of Nitrate for High&#8208;Voltage Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating the ethereal backbones into ester solvents and designing new organic nitrates, the high solubility of nitrate salt into the ester electrolyte is successfully achieved. The electrolyte containing new organic nitrate and designed ester solvent exhibits excellent cycle stability for Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) batteries. Consequently, 1 Ah Li||NCM811 pouch cell showcases excellent cycle stability over 150 times.








Abstract
The high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries require high&#8208;voltage cathode, low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio and lean electrolyte. Despite the all&#8208;fluorinated electrolytes with severe corrosion, the development of ester electrolytes is stagnant due to the incompatibility of ester solvent with Li metal anode. Hence, various electrolyte additives have been developed. Among them, LiNO3 is considered as the most effective electrolyte additive for improving the reversibility of Li deposition. Unfortunately, their solubility into the ester solvent is extremely low. This investigation suggests that the strong ionic bonds in LiNO3 and the low solvation energy of ester solvent are the main triggers for the insolubility of LiNO3 in the ester electrolyte. Hence, a new organic nitrate salt (N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium nitrate (Py13NO3)) with large organic cations and a new liner ester solvent (dipropyleneglycol methyl ether acetate (DPGMEA)) is designed, which integrates the ethereal molecular backbones into the ester solvent. Consequently, the electrolyte containing 1.2&#160;m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), 0.3&#160;m Py13NO3 and 0.1&#160;m lithium disfluorophosphate (LiPO2F2) in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC):DPGMEA (2:8) showcases excellent electrochemical performance in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Eventually, the &#8220;1 Ah level&#8221; Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) pouch cell (N/P ratio &#8776;1.2; electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio &#8776;2.5&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) exhibits excellent cycle life over 150 times in the designed electrolyte.

         <title>Polymer Microarray with Tailored Morphologies through Condensed Droplet Polymerization for High&#8208;Resolution Optical Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Study introduces condensed droplet polymerization (CDP) technology, enabling the fabrication of polymeric micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;dome arrays (PDAs) with tunable geometric properties. By manipulating polymerization kinetics, CDP allows for the rapid manufacturing of PDAs with specific sizes, radii of curvature, and surface densities. The research explores the optical properties of PDAs as nanolenses, enhancing high&#8208;resolution optical imaging capabilities.








Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired functional surfaces with micro&#8208; and nanoscale features have garnered interest for potential applications in optics, imaging, and sensing. Traditional fabrication methods, such as lithography and self&#8208;assembly, face limitations in versatility, scalability, and morphology control. This study introduces an innovative technology, condensed droplet polymerization (CDP), for fabricating polymeric micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;dome arrays (PDAs) with readily tunable geometric properties&#8212;a challenging feat for conventional methods. The CDP process leverages free&#8208;radical polymerization in condensed monomer droplets, allowing rapid production of PDAs with targeted sizes, radii of curvature, and surface densities by manipulating a key synthesis parameter: the temperature of a filament array that activates initiators. This work systematically unravels its effects on polymerization kinetics, viscoelastic properties of the polymerizing droplets, and geometric characteristics of the PDAs. Utilizing in situ digital microscope, this work reveals the morphological evolution of the PDAs during the process. The resulting PDAs exhibit distinct optical properties, including magnification that enables high&#8208;resolution imaging beyond the diffraction limit of conventional microscopes. This work demonstrates the ability to magnify and focus light, enhancing imaging of subwavelength structures and biological specimens. This work advances the understanding of polymerization mechanisms in nano&#8208;sized reactors (i.e., droplets) and paves the way for developing compact optical imaging and sensing technologies.

         <dc:description>
A doping strategy of incorporating Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) additive in 1.67 eV WBG perovskite precursor has been proposed to passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies and retard the crystallization of perovskite. Finally, BTFIB&#8208;based perovskite solar cells yielded a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified 22.21%) and enabled a four&#8208;terminal perovskite/Si tandem cell with a PCE of 31.20% and excellent long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs, Eg &gt;&#160;1.6&#160;eV), serving as the top cell in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs), play an indispensable role in absorbing high energy photons and increasing overall efficiency. However, WBG PSCs often suffer from severe light&#8208;induced phase segregation and significant non&#8208;radiative recombination losses due to uncontrolled rapid crystallization. Here, polyfluoride molecular additives are designed and incorporated via (diacetoxyiodo)benzene into WBG perovskite, to regulate crystallization process of perovskite films and thereby reduce defects. (Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) can passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies, thereby inhibiting phase separation caused by iodide migration and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination loss during charge transport. Moreover, the introduction of BTFIB can effectively moderate the film formation process and confer excellent hydrophobic properties to the films. Consequently, BTFIB&#8208;based 1.67 eV&#8208;WBG perovskite devices yield a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified efficiency of 22.21%), enabling a 31.20% efficiency in four&#8208;terminal PSTSCs, along with excellent open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.246&#160;V and fill factor of 85.34%. After 2500&#160;h of aging in a glovebox, the device retained 80% of its initial efficiency.

         <title>Asymmetric Self&#8208;Assembly of Colloidal Superstructures in Nested Transient Emulsion Aerosols</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nested transient emulsion aerosol system is presented for the asymmetric self&#8208;assembly of colloidal nanoparticles into superstructures with anisotropic morphologies. These nested transient emulsion aerosols break the spherical symmetry associated with conventional emulsion droplets, enabling the production of anisotropic superstructures with potential applications previously considered unattainable.








Abstract
Emulsions are versatile and robust platforms for colloidal self&#8208;assembly, but their ability to create complex and functional superstructures is hindered by the inherent symmetry of droplets. Here the creation of an aerosol of nested transient emulsion droplets with inherent asymmetry is reported, achieved by converging beams of water and 1&#8208;butanol mists. Self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles occurs within such emulsion droplets as driven by the rapid two&#8208;phase interface diffusion, producing anisotropic superstructures. A unique hollowing process is observed due to the asymmetric diffusion of solvents, akin to the Kirkendall effect. This novel assembly platform offers several advantages, including asymmetric self&#8208;assembly in air, surfactant&#8208;free operation, and tunable droplet size. It enables the creation of clean, functional nanoparticle superstructures that can be easily disassembled when needed. These advancements pave the way for exploring intricate, anisotropic superstructures with diverse applications that are unavailable in conventional superstructures of spherical symmetry.

         <title>Ultralow Voltage Operation of p&#8208; and n&#8208;FETs Enabled by Self&#8208;Formed Gate Dielectric and Metal Contacts on 2D Tellurium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te for near&#8208;ideal FETs, featuring low&#8208;resistance NiTex&#8208;Te contacts and ultraclean TiOx&#8208;Te gate dielectrics (0.88 nm EOT). A record&#8208;low SS of 3.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is achieved at 10 K, and 2D Te&#8208;based CMOS inverters operate at 0.08 V, enabling energy&#8208;efficient IC technologies.








Abstract
The ongoing demand for more energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance electronics is driving the exploration of innovative materials and device architectures, where interfaces play a crucial role due to the continuous downscaling of device dimensions. Tellurium (Te), in its 2D form, offers significant potential due to its high carrier mobility and ambipolar characteristics, with the carrier type easily tunable via surface modulation. In this study, atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te are leveraged to create intimate junctions, enabling near&#8208;ideal field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) for both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type operation. A NiTex&#8208;Te contact provides highly transparent interfaces, resulting in low contact resistance, while the TiOx&#8208;Te gate dielectric forms an ultraclean interface with a capacitance equivalent to 0.88 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), where the quantum capacitance of Te is observed. Subthreshold slopes (SS) approach the Boltzmann limit, with a record&#8208;low SS of 3.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 achieved at 10 K. Furthermore, 2D Te&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) inverters are demonstrated operating at an ultralow voltage of 0.08&#160;V with a voltage gain of 7.1 V/V. This work presents a promising approach to forming intimate dielectric/semiconductor and metal/semiconductor junctions for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.

         <title>Mesoporous Silica Nanotraps for Mitigating Bleeding Risk From &#8216;Irreversible&#8217; Antiplatelet Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding risk, particularly in emergency surgeries or accidental injuries. The click chemistry&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanotraps are developed to selectively capture the sulfhydryl&#8208;containing active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel, rapidly reversing their antiplatelet activity and restoring hemostasis. Bleeding models in mice, rabbits, and pigs confirmed their efficacy and safety, underscoring their potential as a functional reversal agent for &#8220;irreversible&#8221; antiplatelet drugs.








Abstract
The severe bleeding complications of long&#8208;term antiplatelet therapy limit its broader application in the treatment or prevention of thrombosis&#8208;associated diseases. This risk is particularly serious when facing emergency surgeries where rapid restoration of normal platelet function is required. Timely reversal of the effects of antiplatelet agents becomes crucial in such scenarios. Despite the widespread use of clopidogrel and prasugrel for their potent antiplatelet activity, the absence of specific and effective reversal agents remains a notable challenge. The pharmacological activity of clopidogrel and prasugrel is mediated by sulfhydryl&#8208;containing active metabolites, which form disulfide bonds with P2Y12 receptors on the surface of platelets to inhibit their aggregation. Taking advantage of this action mechanism of these &#8220;irreversible&#8221; antiplatelet drugs, click chemistry&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica (SiO2&#8208;Mal) nanotraps are fabricated to capture the antiplatelet drugs' active metabolites and restore hemostasis. Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the SiO2&#8208;Mal nanotraps is conducted using mouse, rabbit, and pig animal models, highlighting their potential application as a functional reversal agent for clinically relevant thienopyridine antiplatelet drugs, believed until now to be irreversible in their inhibition of platelet activity.

         <title>A Neuransistor with Excitatory and Inhibitory Neuronal Behaviors for Liquid State Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neuransistor integrates hybrid excitatory and inhibitory dynamics, enabling liquid state machine implementation. It operates via charge trapping in a two&#8208;dimensional electron electron gas (2DEG)/TiO2&#8722;x structure and features a three&#8208;terminal design for efficient masking functionality. Simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting temporal signals, emphasizing its role as a robust reservoir for neuromorphic computing and advancing biologically inspired applications.








Abstract
A liquid state machine (LSM) is a spiking neural network model inspired by biological neural network dynamics designed to process time&#8208;varying inputs. In the LSM, maintaining a proper excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance among neurons is essential for ensuring network stability and generating rich temporal dynamics for accurate data processing. In this study, a &#8220;neuransistor&#8221; is proposed that implements the E/I neurons in a single device, allowing for the hardware implementation of the LSM. The device features a three&#8208;terminal transistor structure embodying TiO2&#8722;x/Al2O3 bi&#8208;layer, providing a two&#8208;dimensional electron electron gas (2DEG) channel at their interface. This device demonstrates hybrid excitatory and inhibitory dynamics with respect to the applied gate bias polarity, originating from the charge trapping/detrapping between the 2DEG and TiO2&#8722;x layers. Additionally, the three&#8208;terminal configuration allows masking capabilities by selecting terminal biases, realizing a reservoir behavior with superior reliability and durability. Its use in an LSM reservoir for time&#8208;series data prediction tasks using the Henon dataset and a chaotic equation solver for the Lorenz attractor is demonstrated. This benchmarking indicates that the LSM exhibits enhanced performance and efficiency compared to the conventional echo state network, underscoring its potential for advanced applications in reservoir computing.

&lt;/i&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bi-layer, providing a two-dimensional electron electron gas (2DEG) channel at their interface. This device demonstrates hybrid excitatory and inhibitory dynamics with respect to the applied gate bias polarity, originating from the charge trapping/detrapping between the 2DEG and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; layers. Additionally, the three-terminal configuration allows masking capabilities by selecting terminal biases, realizing a reservoir behavior with superior reliability and durability. Its use in an LSM reservoir for time-series data prediction tasks using the Henon dataset and a chaotic equation solver for the Lorenz attractor is demonstrated. This benchmarking indicates that the LSM exhibits enhanced performance and efficiency compared to the conventional echo state network, underscoring its potential for advanced applications in reservoir computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sodium solid&#8208;state batteries (SSSBs) overcome lithium's sustainability limitations (2.36% vs 0.0017% crustal abundance). Perovskite/anti&#8208;perovskite solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and tunable structures are promising, where anti&#8208;perovskites excel in multi&#8208;dimensional ion channels and interfacial stability. This review highlights conductive optimization (doping, defect engineering), electrochemical stability mechanisms, and proposes a structural&#8208;tolerance&#8208;factor&#8208;based evaluation framework. Future priorities include controllable synthesis and enhanced interface compatibility.








Abstract
Sodium solid&#8208;state batteries (SSSBs) are poised to revolutionize energy storage by capitalizing on sodium's exceptional crustal abundance (2.36% vs 0.0017% for lithium) and cost&#8208;effectiveness, addressing critical sustainability challenges of lithium&#8208;dependent technologies. Solid electrolytes (SEs) with high ionic conductivity and stability have gained significant attention. The compositional and structural flexibility of perovskites and anti&#8208;perovskites make them competitive, and the combination of advanced computer simulations and synthesis techniques can achieve stable synthesis of the materials. Importantly, the high ionic conductivity and high stability of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs at room temperature endow them with enormous potential for the construction of SSSBs. In this review, the research progress of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs for SSSBs is summarized, different optimization strategies for improving the ionic conductivity of SEs are compared, and an in&#8208;depth discussion on the chemical and electrochemical stability of SEs is provided. Specifically, key technical indicators reflecting their structural tolerance and future application potential have been summarized and discussed for the first time. Among these, anti&#8208;perovskites, due to their diversity and the presence of more ion transport channels, have the potential to become commercial SEs. Finally, the future challenges and development directions of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs for SSSBs have been prospected.

         <title>Biomimetic Intrafibrillar Mineralization of Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;like Fibrils (HSAF), prepared through a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation of a protein nanofilm, exhibit an ordered, dynamic layered structure with adaptive gaps that facilitate intrafibrillar mineralization. The mineralized HSAF mimics biological hard tissues with ordered protein&#8208;hydroxyapatite organization, and demonstrates exceptional bioactivity in promoting native bone growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization.









Abstract
Intrafibrillar mineralization is essential not only as a fundamental process in forming biological hard tissues but also as a foundation for developing advanced composite fibril&#8208;based materials for innovative applications. Traditionally, only natural collagen fibrils have been shown to enable intrafibrillar mineralization, presenting a challenge in designing ordered hierarchical fibrils from common protein aggregation that exhibit similar high intrafibrillar mineralization activity. In this study, a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation method is developed that converts phase&#8208;transitioned protein nanofilms into crystalline, hierarchical amyloid&#8208;like fibrils with multilayer structures, which effectively control the growth and lateral organization of hydroxyapatite within adaptive gaps. The resulting mineralized HSAF achieves a hardness of 0.616 &#177;&#160;0.007&#160;GPa and a modulus of 19.06 &#177;&#160;3.54 GPa&#8212;properties closely resembling native hard tissues&#8212;and exhibits exceptionally high bioactivity in promoting both native bone tissue growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization, achieving 76.9% repair in a mice cranial defect model after 8 weeks and outperforming other regenerative materials. This remarkable performance, stemming from the unique structure and composition of the fibers, positions HSAF as a promising candidate for biomedical and engineering applications. These findings advance the understanding of biomineralization mechanisms and establish a foundation for developing high&#8208;bioactivity materials for hard tissue regeneration.

         <title>NASICON&#8208;NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3/C: A High&#8208;Rate and Robust Anode for Fast Charging and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3/C (NaVAlNb/C) anode offers a transformative solution for fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Paired with a Na4V2(PO4)3 cathode in a full cell, it achieves 6&#8208;min rechargeability and a long cycle life of over 3000 cycles. This work underscores the significance of local structure modification along with carbon&#8208;coating and particle downsizing to advance NASICON&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;performance energy storage.









Abstract
Nb&#8208;based NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON) frameworks (e.g., Nb2(PO4)3 and Na1.5V0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3) are emerging as the attractive Na&#8208;ion anodes due to their lower intercalation voltage (&#8776;1.4&#8211;1.2&#160;V vs Na+/Na0) and higher storage capacities (&#8776;140&#8211;160 mAh g&#8722;1). However, their practical realization is limited by moderate cycle life and rate performances. In this work, a carbon&#8208;coated NASICON&#8208;NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3 (NaVAlNb/C) anode is unveiled for fast charging Na&#8208;ion batteries. The incorporation of Al3+ increases covalency of NASICON and creates disordered Na&#8208;ion sublattice as observed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements. Besides, the carbon&#8208;coating and particle downsizing produces facile electron and ion percolation network. Accordingly, the NaVAlNb/C anode renders extraordinary rate performances (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20C) with longer cycling stability (95.2% retention after 5000 cycles at 10C). Climbing image nudged elastic band calculations reveal reduced Na&#8208;ion migration barrier (202 meV) for NaVAlNb/C. Most importantly, a full Na&#8208;ion cell based on Na4V2(PO4)3 cathode and NaVAlNb/C anode is demonstrated with a high&#8208;power density (6493&#160;W kg&#8722;1) and long&#8208;cycle life (3000 cycles at 20C), which are far excellent compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NASICON&#8208;based cells. This work demonstrates the significance of carbon coating and chemical tuning to tailor high&#8208;rate NASICON anodes, which can produce fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>High Entropy Alloy Formation Derived from High Entropy Oxide: Unlocking the Active Sites for Green Methanol Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;based material for CO2 reduction to methanol, offering scalability and simplicity. Fe facilitates high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) formation, leading to a high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) with enhanced CO2 conversion efficiency. Spectroscopic studies and Theoretical calculations identify active sites, while in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) reveals mechanistic changes. Life&#8208;cycle assessment confirms a carbon&#8208;negative footprint.








Abstract
In pursuit of novel materials for CO2&#160;conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals, previous research has predominantly focused on copper&#8208;based, indium oxide (In2O3)&#8208;based, and alloy or intermetallic materials. However, a groundbreaking approach is presented by introducing a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;based material for CO2&#160;reduction to methanol (CH3OH). This method offers scalability and simplicity, making it feasible for large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys (HEAs). The formation of HEA is facilitated by the presence of Fe, leads to the creation of a high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) during calcination. Through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), comprehensively analyzed the oxidation states and coordination environments of all metals in both HEO and HEA. The formation of Fe3O4&#160;within the HEO structure is evident, with each metal occupying either tetrahedral (Td) or octahedral (Oh) sites. The HEA formed shows exceptional CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and higher CH3OH selectivity. Isolated sites of Co, Ni with Fe, Cu, and Zn, along with CuZn pair, are considered as the active sites for CO2 to CH3OH and further determined by DFT calculations. The altered reaction mechanism upon HEA formation compared to individual metals is investigated using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Finally, Life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) indicates the carbon&#8208;negative footprint.

&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of novel materials for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;conversion to value-added chemicals, previous research has predominantly focused on copper-based, indium oxide (In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-based, and alloy or intermetallic materials. However, a groundbreaking approach is presented by introducing a high-entropy-based material for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;reduction to methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH). This method offers scalability and simplicity, making it feasible for large-scale production of high-entropy-alloys (HEAs). The formation of HEA is facilitated by the presence of Fe, leads to the creation of a high-entropy oxide (HEO) during calcination. Through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), comprehensively analyzed the oxidation states and coordination environments of all metals in both HEO and HEA. The formation of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;within the HEO structure is evident, with each metal occupying either tetrahedral (T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) or octahedral (O&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) sites. The HEA formed shows exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;conversion efficiency and higher CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity. Isolated sites of Co, Ni with Fe, Cu, and Zn, along with CuZn pair, are considered as the active sites for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH and further determined by DFT calculations. The altered reaction mechanism upon HEA formation compared to individual metals is investigated using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Finally, Life-cycle assessment (LCA) indicates the carbon-negative footprint.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Photonic Battery Enabling Dynamic Radiative Thermal Management and Power Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional photonic battery is proposed for dynamic radiative cooling, energy storage and recycling. The dynamic thermal regulation properties significantly reduce building energy consumption and CO&#8322; emissions. Meanwhile, its efficient energy storage and recycling capacities can minimize or even eliminate household power outage durations. This innovative approach advances sustainable building practices and contributes to global carbon neutrality and sustainability efforts.








Abstract
Dynamic thermal management materials are pivotal for advancing energy&#8208;efficient buildings and promoting global sustainability. However, existing materials typically offer only a single&#8208;function of temperature regulation, lacking the integrated power supply capability essential for sustaining indoor activities and building sustainability, particularly in the face of frequent power outages. A photonic battery that combines all&#8208;season dynamic radiative thermoregulation with electrical power supply in a single silicon&#8208;based unit is demonstrated. This device delivers dual functionality with high infrared emissivity regulation (0.53 at 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m) and superior energy storage performance, featuring a high specific capacity (&#8776;3271 mAh g&#8722;1), areal capacity (&#8776;0.38 mAh cm&#8722;2), and efficient energy recycling (71.6%). A reversible ion&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced phase change mechanism, enabling continuous and non&#8208;volatile electro&#8208;optical&#8208;thermal transformation and significant infrared tunability, is proposed. Our simulations indicate that the implementation of these dynamic materials into buildings could significantly reduce energy consumption by up to 18.4%, equating to 544.8 GJ, and achieve an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 124.1 tons. This work paves the way for the development of energy&#8208;saving electro&#8208;driven dynamic materials, marking a significant step forward in global sustainability initiatives.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells via Nucleation and Crystallization Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pumping rate&#8208;controllable strategy regulates nucleation and crystallization in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites during vacuum&#8208;flash&#8208;assisted solution processing. This approach enables additive&#8208;free, antisolvent&#8208;free fabrication of high&#8208;quality films, achieving &gt;21% and &gt;19% efficiency for 0.08 and 1 cm2 devices, respectively, with uniformity over 6 &#215; 6 cm2. It also delivers 27.5% efficiency for all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells, ensuring scalability and reliability.








Abstract
The rapid crystallization of mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites and their dependence on antisolvent processes limit the development of large&#8208;area Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Vacuum&#8208;flash&#8208;assisted solution processing (VASP) has emerged as a promising technique for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, achieving consistent control over crystallization parameters remains a limitation. To address this, a pumping rate&#8208;controllable strategy is introduced, fitted from cavity pressure and time, to control nucleation and crystallization in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. By tuning the pressure rate, the solvent volatilization rate of the perovskite wet film is optimized, enabling controlled nucleation and crystallization dynamics. This allows for the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;quality FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 films without additives to aid crystallization, achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 21% and 19% for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs at 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively, the additives&#8208;free and antisolvent&#8208;free highest records. This further demonstrates that the uniformity and reproducibility of pumping rate control on a large 6 &#215; 6 cm2 substrate. The approach is also applicable to wide bandgap PSCs, normal bandgap PSCs, and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, delivering a PCE &gt;27% for the antisolvent&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free tandem device. This work establishes a scalable and versatile approach for developing large&#8208;area Sn&#8208;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem&#160;devices, advancing the field toward practical applications.

         <title>Acceptor Crystallinity Engineering Enables &gt;20% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells with 83.0% Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new solvent, trichloroethylene (TCE), is introduced and used as an acceptor processing solvent in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed devices. The active layer exhibits a higher proportion of transport phases and lower trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination. The efficiency of the binary organic solar cell reached 20.05%, with a record&#8208;high fill factor of 83%.








Abstract
For spontaneously crystallized organic photovoltaic materials, morphology optimization remains a challenge due to the disparity in crystallinity between the donor and acceptor components. Imperfections in the crystalline phases result in significant trap&#8208;assisted recombination, which emerges as a critical factor limiting the fill factor (FF) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a method is introduced for precise regulation of the acceptor crystallinity, utilizing a novel upper&#8208;layer acceptor processing solvent, trichloroethylene (TCE), to improve the state and vertical morphology of the active layer. The TCE solvent synergistically optimizes intermolecular interactions among acceptor molecules and balances the film&#8208;forming process, thereby increasing the proportion of transport phases and forming high&#8208;speed channels for electron transport, which subsequently reduces trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination. As a result, the photovoltaic efficiency of binary organic solar cells reaches 20.05%. More importantly, an unprecedented FF of 83.0% is obtained, representing the highest FF value for OSCs. This facile and effective approach offers a promising means for constructing efficient charge transport networks and fabricating high&#8208;efficiency and morphologically stable OSCs.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Distortion in Ruthenium Oxide Enables Robust Acidic Water Oxidation via Direct O&#8211;O Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to significantly enhance both the stability and activity of RuO2 by switching the catalytic mechanism from AEM to OPM, is introduced. This is achieved through lattice distortion engineering using a co&#8208;doping strategy involving large&#8208;radius ions (Na&#8314; and Hf&#8201;4+). The as&#8208;prepared Na/Hf&#8208;RuO2 is stable at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 over 85 h in a PEM water electrolyzer.








Abstract
Ruthenium is considered one of the most promising alternatives to iridium as an anode electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts suffer from poor stability, primarily due to structural collapse under the harsh acidic conditions of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a design strategy is introduced that significantly enhances both the stability and activity of RuO2 by switching the catalytic mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the oxide pathway mechanism (OPM). This is achieved through lattice distortion engineering using a co&#8208;doping strategy involving large&#8208;radius ions (Na&#8314; and Hf&#8201;4+). The incorporation of Na+ and Hf&#8201;4+ into RuO2 induces significant lattice distortion, shortening partial Ru&#9472;Ru bond distance and optimizing the electronic structure. This modification facilitates direct O&#8211;O radical coupling, as confirmed by in situ vibrational measurements and theoretical calculations. It can drive a current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a PEMWE device at 60&#160;&#176;C with 1.646&#160;V and operates stably for 85 h at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The present study highlights that optimizing the synergistic interaction between two adjacent Ru sites to promote direct O&#8211;O coupling is an effective strategy for enhancing the acidic OER performance of RuO2.

         <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis in Heazlewoodite: Unveiling the Critical Role of Entropy Levels and Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative high&#8208;entropy heazlewoodite is synthesized, where the formation of a high&#8208;entropy phase significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity, and the oxidation potential evolved stabilized high&#8208;entropy sulfide&#8208;hydroxide oxide species at the interface improved electrochemical stability.








Abstract
Entropy engineering has proven effective in enhancing catalyst electrochemical properties, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Challenges persist, however, in modulating entropy and understanding the dynamic reconfiguration of high&#8208;entropy sulfides during OER. In this study, an innovative in situ corrosion method is introduced to convert low&#8208;valent nickel on a nickel foam substrate into high&#8208;entropy heazlewoodite (HES/NF), significantly boosting OER performance. By synthesizing a series of low&#8208;, medium&#8208;, and high&#8208;entropy heazlewoodites, the intrinsic factors influence catalyst surface evolution and electrocatalytic activity is systematically explored. Employing a combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques, it is observed that HES/NF dynamically transforms into a stable hydroxide oxide (MOOH)&#8208;sulfide composite under OER conditions. This transition, coupled with lattice distortion, optimizes the electrostatic potential distribution, ensuring superior catalytic activity and preventing surface sulfide deactivation through the formation of stable HES&#8208;MOOH species. This synergy enables HES/NF to achieve remarkably low overpotentials: 172.0&#160;mV at 100.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 229.0&#160;mV at an extreme current density of 300.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. When paired with a Pt/C cathode, HES/NF exhibits rapid kinetics, outstanding stability, and exceptional water&#8208;splitting performance. The scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach paves the way for advanced electrocatalyst design, promising breakthroughs in energy storage and conversion technologies.

         <title>TOP&#8208;Zn Steric Hindrance Effect Enables Ultra&#8208;Uniform CsPbX3 Quantum Dots for Wide&#8208;Color Gamut Displays</title>

         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;ion (TOP&#8208;Zn) complex&#8208;modulating nucleation strategy is applied to depress spectral broadening. This strategy is confirmed to work in blue/green/red PQDs, achieving record&#8208;breaking narrowed spectral FWHMs (15, 17, and 25 nm respectively). These PQDs realize a wide color gamut coverage of &#8776;130% NTSC and &#8776;100% Rec. 2020 standard. Meanwhile, pure&#8208;red PeLED exhibits a high EQE of exceeding 20%.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are expected to be an ideal candidate for wide&#8208;color gamut displays owing to their high color purity. However, their color purity is challenged by remarkable spectral broadening due to non&#8208;uniform size distribution and crystal defects. Here, a ligand&#8208;ion (TOP&#8208;Zn) complex&#8208;modulating nucleation strategy is proposed to depress spectral broadening. This is achieved by enhancing the steric hindrance effect during lead&#8208;halogen octahedral assembly and reducing the reaction activity/sites of the system. This strategy is universal and has been confirmed to be effective for blue, green, and red PQDs, achieving narrowed spectral full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 15, 17, and 25&#160;nm, respectively. These FWHMs are record&#8208;breaking and contribute to a wide color gamut coverage of &#8776;130% National Television Standards Committee and &#8776;100% Rec. 2020 standard. Meanwhile, these PQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) exhibit a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of exceeding 20% at their pure color range. These results provide a feasible path to achieve ultra&#8208;uniform and pure&#8208;color luminescent PQDs for wide&#8208;color gamut displays.

         <title>Na&#8208;Hybridized LiNbO3 Nanocrystal&#8208;Glass Composites for Ultra&#8208;Short Optical Pulse Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na&#8208;hybridization strategy is proposed to reduce defects in LiNbO3&#8208;NGC, enhancing its nonlinear properties. By using this hybridized LiNbO3&#8208;NGC, the transverse second&#8208;harmonic generation is achieved. An ultrashort optical pulse monitoring system is constructed which are demonstrated for real&#8208;time quantitative measurement of the duration, distribution, and front tilting of optical pulses in the 10&#8722;15 s scale.








Abstract
LiNbO3 nanocrystal&#8208;glass composites (LiNbO3&#8208;NGC), characterized by its unique 3D random domain structure, have shown great promise for significant applications, such as femtosecond pulse monitoring and full&#8208;color 3D displays. However, the nonlinear response of the LiNbO3&#8208;NGC is greatly suppressed by the defects, and effective manipulation of these defects remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this study, a Na&#8208;hybridization strategy is proposed to control defects in the LiNbO3&#8208;NGC to enhance its nonlinear properties and realizing its practical application for ultrashort optical pulse monitoring. The findings reveal that the incorporation of Na ions effectively reduces the defects within the composite, resulting in significantly improved nonlinear effects. By using this hybridized LiNbO3&#8208;NGC, the transverse second&#8208;harmonic generation is achieved. An ultrashort optical pulse system is also constructed and successfully applied it for real&#8208;time quantitative measurement of the duration, distribution, and front tilting of optical pulses in the 10&#8722;15 s scale. These results not only present an excellent example about defect engineering in nonlinear LiNbO3&#8208;NGC but also point to practical applications for the measurement of extreme physical parameters.

         <title>Molecular Domino Toppling for Directed Self&#8208;Erasing Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene&#8208;based material with unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer reminiscent of toppling dominoes is presented. After light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward isomerization, electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the cis isomers along with an electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. This repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism, suitable to process information on the molecular level.








Abstract
In the pursuit of more secure information transfer, advanced nanoelectronic technologies and nanomaterials must be developed. Here, a material is presented able to undergo an unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer process reminiscent of toppling dominoes. The material is based on ortho&#8208;fluorinated azobenzene molecules which are organized in molecular rows by the regular array of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The azobenzene molecules undergo light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward as well as electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. The findings reveal that electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the light&#8208;generated cis isomers along with an isomerization of the sample to the trans&#8208;state. Thus, light can be used to locally write information, which subsequently can be read out by the transferred charge with simultaneous deletion of the information. This freely repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism to process information on the molecular level that may find application in encryption.

         <title>Chiroferromagnetic Quantum Dots for Chiroptical Synapse (ChiropS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical activity is enhanced by up to 0.003 in the g&#8208;factor through the induction of ferromagnetism in quantum dots. A chiroptical neuromorphic synapse, composed of chiroferromagnetic quantum dots, generates different synaptic weights from multiple wavelengths and circularly polarized light. The low&#8208;level preprocessing unit of the multi&#8208;channel neuromorphic device functions as a low&#8208;level optical noise filter, enabling energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Optoelectronic devices using circularly polarized light (CPL) offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity for efficient data processing. There is a growing demand for CPL sensing mediums with strong optical activity, stability and sensitivity, multiple transition bands, and environmental compatibility. Here, defect&#8208;engineered chiroferromagnetic quantum dots (CFQDs) are used as a new type of CPL sensing material. By inducing amorphization defects through chiral molecules, CFQDs with high unpaired electron density, atomic structural chirality, amplified chiroptical activity, and multiple exciton transition bands are developed. CFQDs enable nonlinear, long&#8208;term plastic behavior with linear optical input, acting as in situ noise filters that reduce noise by over 20%. Additionally, CFQDs provide over nine times higher integration for photon polarization and wavelength distinctions, paving the way for next&#8208;generation processors with improved energy efficiency, integration, and reduced retention time.

&lt;p&gt;Chiroptical activity is enhanced by up to 0.003 in the g-factor through the induction of ferromagnetism in quantum dots. A chiroptical neuromorphic synapse, composed of chiroferromagnetic quantum dots, generates different synaptic weights from multiple wavelengths and circularly polarized light. The low-level preprocessing unit of the multi-channel neuromorphic device functions as a low-level optical noise filter, enabling energy-efficient neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Metal Exsolution&#8208;Redissolution of High&#8208;Entropy Oxide Enabling High&#8208;Performance Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) catalysts are developed to show unprecedented active and durable performance in photothermal dry reforming of methane due to the light&#8208;induced metal exsolution&#8208;dissolution process. Such a mechanism triggers the chemical looping of oxygen vacancies on HEO and greatly improves product formation and coking resistance.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane (DRM) is attractive for syngas production as an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. However, the remaining challenges of low yield and coke&#8208;induced inability in this route severely limit its applicability. Here, a light&#8208;induced metal exsolution&#8208;dissolution strategy is reported using high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) as a support for highly active and durable photothermal DRM. As evidenced by structural characterizations and theoretical simulations, the metal exsolution&#8208;dissolution process triggers the chemical looping of oxygen vacancies on HEO, in which CH4 is activated to CO and H2 by lattice oxygen while oxygen from CO2 can fill the oxygen vacancy and release CO. Such a pathway greatly improves product formation and coking resistance, overcoming the limitations. As a result, the optimized CoNiFeZnCr&#8208;HEO supported Rh nanocomposite achieves a high H2/CO production of 0.242/0.246&#160;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with a balance selectivity of 0.98 and impressive long&#8208;term stability (200&#160;h). The yield is &#8776;300 and 450 times higher than that of quaternary and ternary oxides&#8208;based catalysts, respectively. This work paves the way for new insights into the light&#8208;driven DRM process and highlights the integration of dynamic surface evolution with molecular activation to enhance catalytic performance.

         <title>Friction Behavior and Microscopic Mechanism of Hydrogels in an Open&#8208;Air Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic mechanisms governing the friction characteristics of hydrogels in open&#8208;air environments are revealed through experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that larger pore sizes and enhanced internal water mobility improve the permeability of hydrogels, allowing them to maintain a low friction coefficient by mitigating surface water loss.









Abstract
Hydrogels composed of a solvent&#8208;saturated, cross&#8208;linked polymer network exhibit unique interfacial rheology and ultralow friction, making them valuable in biomedical applications. Despite their widespread use in open&#8208;air environments, the lubrication behaviors of hydrogels under these conditions remain poorly understood. Here, the microscopic mechanisms underlying the friction characteristics of hydrogels through a combination of experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations is explored. It is found that water evaporation from the hydrogel surface reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. On the other hand, optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. It is also explored how soaking time, water affinity, and applied normal load influence hydrogel lubrication. The findings elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing the friction behaviors of hydrogels and provide guidelines for designing hydrogel systems with sustained exceptional lubrication properties in open&#8208;air applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a co&#8208;polymerization approach using 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,3&#8208;epoxypropane to integrate lithium nitrate into poly&#8208;DOL&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The resulting electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.23&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), exceptional Coulombic efficiency (99.34%) in Li|Cu cell, and long&#8208;term stability (2000 cycles in Li|LFP cells). Scale&#8208;up tests in Li|NCM811 cells show 94.4% capacity retention over 60 cycles, offering a promising path for high&#8208;performance, in situ polymerized batteries.








Abstract
The advancement of lithium metal batteries toward their theoretical energy density potential remains constrained by safety and performance issues inherent to liquid electrolytes. Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) based on poly&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (poly&#8208;DOL) represent a promising development, yet challenges in achieving satisfactory Coulombic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability have impeded their practical implementation. While lithium nitrate addition can enhance efficiency, its incorporation results in prohibitively slow polymerization rates spanning several months. In this work, high&#8208;polymerization&#8208;enthalpy 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,3&#8208;epoxypropane is introduced as a co&#8208;polymerization promoter, successfully integrating lithium nitrate into poly&#8208;DOL&#8208;based QSSEs. The resulting electrolyte demonstrates exceptional performance with 2.23&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 of ionic conductivity at 25&#160;&#176;C, a Coulombic efficiency of 99.34% in Li|Cu cells, and stable lithium metal interfaces sustained through 1300 h of symmetric cell cycling. This co&#8208;polymerization approach also suppresses poly&#8208;DOL crystallization, enabling Li|LiFePO4 cells to maintain stability beyond 2000 cycles at 1C. Scale&#8208;up validation in a &#8776;1&#160;Ah Li|NCM811 pouch cell achieves 94.4% capacity retention over 60 cycles. This strategy establishes a new pathway for developing high&#8208;performance, in situ polymerized quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries for practical energy storage applications.

         <dc:description>
This review charts the transformative potential of next&#8208;generation nano&#8208;flexible embolic agents in redefining TACE for HCC. By dissecting innovations in tunable coagulation dynamics, real&#8208;time imaging integration and hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery, it unveils how to overcome the pitfalls of conventional therapies. The strategies extend to synergies with immunotherapy and energy&#8208;conversion strategies, while confronting scalability and regulatory hurdles critical for clinical adoption.








Abstract
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains the gold standard for treating intermediate&#8208;stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet faces great challenges in overcoming tumor heterogeneity, hypoxia&#8208;induced angiogenesis, and metastatic progression. The development of advanced flexible embolization materials marks a revolutionary leap in interventional therapy, offering opportunities to revolutionize embolization precision, drug delivery kinetics, and tumor microenvironment modulation. This comprehensive review systematically examines the paradigm shift toward next&#8208;generation TACE technology, emphasizing the limitations of conventional approaches and innovations in flexible embolic agents. A detailed discussion of next&#8208;generation nano&#8208;flexible embolic systems is presented, emphasizing their unique coagulation dynamics, real&#8208;time imaging capabilities, and therapeutic precision. The review delves into groundbreaking TACE strategies integrating hypoxia modulation, energy conversion therapeutics, and sophisticated tumor microenvironment engineering. Clinical translation aspects are thoroughly explored, including large&#8208;scale trial outcomes, vascular recanalization dynamics, and patient&#8208;specific treatment optimization. Looking forward, key frontiers in the field is identified: intelligent nanocomposite systems, synergistic combination therapies, and precision medicine approaches tailored to individual tumor biology. This work not only objectively evaluates current progress but also charts future research priorities, aiming to transform TACE from a palliative intervention to a precision medicine platform and ultimately reshaping the landscape of HCC treatment and patient care.

         <title>Unlocking the Sodium Storage Potential in Fluorophosphate Cathodes: Electrostatic Interaction Lowering Versus Structural Disordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na+&#8208;density and degree of order in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode are regulated via divalent cation doping to compare the importance of electrostatic interaction and Na+&#8208;ordering on the Na+ diffusivity and storage property. A higher Mg2+&#8208;doping concentration at both Na&#8208; and V&#8208;site, though incorporating extra Na+ and higher repulsive forces, contributes to a higher structural disorder, which reveals a higher throughout Na+ diffusivity with a superior energy/power density.








Abstract
Electrostatic interaction and Na+&#8208;ordering are identified as two possible kinetic constraints in determining the Na+ diffusivity in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF), a representative polyanionic&#8208;based cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. As both factors are compositionally related and intertwined, isolating individual factors to pinpoint the dominant one is essential yet challenging for achieving the full electrochemical potential of NVPOF. Herein, NVPOF doped with Zn2+ or Mg2+ is developed to study the relative influence of the electrostatic interaction and structural disordering on the Na+ diffusivity and thus Na+ storage performance. The crystal structural analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that a limited amount (0.6 at% of Na) of Zn2+ doped at the Na&#8208;site with Na&#8208;vacancies created, while a ten&#8208;fold higher Mg2+ doped at both the Na&#8208; and V&#8208;site, which introduces additional Na+ for charge compensation. As a result, compared to the Zn2+ doped counterpart, the Mg2+ doped NVPOF cathode shows a Na+ diffusivity up to 3 times higher even encountering larger repulsive forces, and a much enhanced Na+ storage property. This work demonstrates the superiority of regulating the degree of order in the framework to address the defect formation energy of NVPOF, which is realized via doping and can be extendable to other polyanionic&#8208;based cathode materials.

         <title>Gallium&#8208;Magnesium Layered Double Hydroxide for Elevated Tumor Immunotherapy Through Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;network synergistic treatment strategy is designed to form a powerful therapeutic network to improve tumor immunotherapy by coordinating multiple immune activation mechanisms such as autophagy blocking, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, immunogenic cell death, and STING activation, which improves the immunogenicity, reverses the immunosuppressive TME, breaks the immune barrier, and promotes immune cell proliferation and infiltration.








Abstract
Immunotherapeutic efficacy is often limited by poor immunogenicity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and cytoprotective mechanisms, leading to low immune activation. To this end, here, L&#8208;amino acid oxidase (LAAO) loaded gallium&#8208;magnesium layered double hydroxide (MG&#8208;LAAO) is prepared for significantly enhanced tumor immunotherapy through multi&#8208;network synergistic regulation. First, MG&#8208;LAAO induces tumor cell pyroptosis by initiating caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD and caspase&#8208;3/GSDME pathways, further triggering immunogenic cell death (ICD). Then the released Ga3+ induces mitochondrial iron overload, resulting in ferroptosis. In addition, MG&#8208;LAAO also hinders autophagy of tumor cells, and reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) by neutralizing H+ and inhibiting lactic acid accumulation, thus destroying the cytoprotective mechanism and avoiding immune escape. Furthermore, this multi&#8208;network synergy further activates the cGAS&#8208;STING signaling pathway, generating powerful antitumor immunotherapy. This work highlights the critical role of synergies between autophagy block, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD in tumor immunotherapy, demonstrating the important role of this multi&#8208;network synergy in effectively overcoming immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immunogenicity. In particular, the mechanism of gallium&#8208;induced pyroptosis is revealed for the first time, providing theoretical support for the design of new materials for tumor immunotherapy in the future.

         <title>A Colorful Electrochromic Infrared Emissivity Regulator for All&#8208;Season Intelligent Thermal Management in Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectrally selective colorful electrochromic infrared emissivity regulator (CECIER) is presented for all&#8208;season building thermal management. It enables multi&#8208;modal dynamic infrared emissivity regulation in the atmospheric window while reducing parasitic heat through high reflectance in the non&#8208;atmospheric window. The regulator achieves &#8776;2&#176;C (night) and 3&#176;C (day) temperature adjustments and 3.46 MJ&#160;m&#8722;2 annual building energy savings.








Abstract
Radiative cooling is a technology that utilizes the high emissivity of materials in the atmospheric window to achieve cooling, showing great application prospects in building energy&#8208;saving. However, traditional static passive radiative cooling materials with broad&#8208;spectrum high emissivity can lead to increased heating energy consumption in winter due to overcooling and a weakened cooling effect in summer due to the urban heat island effect. In this study, a colorful, intelligent infrared emissivity regulator is well designed based on a multi film ultrathin electrochromic device for all&#8208;season thermal management in buildings. The infrared emissivity of the regulator can vary in real time in response to seasonal or temperature variations, allowing for the switching between radiative cooling and insulation. Guided by nano&#8208;photonics theory for multilayer optical films, the regulator achieves multi&#8208;modal dynamic infrared emissivity regulation in the atmospheric window &#916;&#949;&#175;$\Delta \ \bar{\varepsilon }$&#916;&#949;&#175;$\Delta \ \bar{\varepsilon }$, and the high reflectance in the non&#8208;atmospheric window inhibits heat gains from the external environment. The regulator demonstrates excellent environmental adaptivity with an acceptable response time, a long cycle life, and good bending resistance. The regulator can achieve &#8776;2 &#176;C/3 &#176;C (nighttime/daytime) temperature adjustment. The simulation results indicate that the regulator can achieve an annual building energy saving of 3.46&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Effects of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric substrates offer a dynamic platform to enhance the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By integrating high&#8208;throughput computations and machine learning, this study reveals how to take advantage of ferroelectric polarization effect to fine&#8208;tune the OER pathways on SACs. It advances the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency SACs for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) heavily depends on their substrates. However, heterojunctions with traditional substrate materials often fail to provide the desired dynamic interface effects.

The ferroelectric In2Se3 is confirmed to be an effective substrate for improving the stability of various SACs, supported by theoretical results of their negative formation energy and positive dissolution potential. Activity analysis indicates that among these In2Se3/C&#8208;N&#8208;M systems, the In2Se3/C&#8208;N&#8208;Ir can achieve near&#8208;ideal catalytic activities through polarization switching. It can unprecedentedly catalyze OER via a hybrid pathway of adsorbate evolution mechanism and O&#8208;O coupling mechanism under different pH conditions (from pH = 1 to pH = 13). Machine learning models have been developed to conduct feature analysis and make ultrafast predictions of OER activity, which identify that the interfacial charge transfer triggered by ferroelectric polarization is the key to fine&#8208;tuning the OER performance of SACs. This work provides a theoretical framework that utilizes ferroelectric polarization as a powerful approach to navigate the design of efficient SACs.

&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric substrates offer a dynamic platform to enhance the catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By integrating high-throughput computations and machine learning, this study reveals how to take advantage of ferroelectric polarization effect to fine-tune the OER pathways on SACs. It advances the rational design of high-efficiency SACs for sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Memristive InAs&#8208;Based Semiconductors with Anisotropic Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Memristive semiconductor HxNa2&#8208;xIn2As3 exhibits memristive switching and maintains semiconductor properties through ion migration in its vdW gaps. Low ion migration energy enables a low set voltage, while its low&#8208;symmetry structure produces anisotropic ion transport, offering insights into directional dependence. These findings can guide the development of energy&#8208;efficient memtransistors.








Abstract
The use of the van der Waals (vdW) gap as an ion migration path, similar to cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, enables improved ion migration. If these materials also possess semiconductor properties, they can simultaneously control electron or hole transport. Such materials can be used in memtransistors, which combine memory and semiconductor characteristics. However, the existing materials rely on defects such as grain boundaries as migration paths, resulting in high ion migration energy barriers and switching voltages. Herein, memtransistors are demonstrated using HxNa2&#8208;xIn2As3, which utilizes the vdW gap for ion migration, resulting in lower ion migration energy barriers. It is confirmed that ion migration occurs more readily in the [010] direction in a low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure owing to a lower migration energy barrier, whereas migration does not occur in the [100] direction, demonstrating directional dependence. This finding provides crucial guidelines for identifying ion migration in semiconductor materials, which can otherwise be overlooked. The use of the vdW gap as the migration path, variation in migration energy barriers with the ion movement direction, and their impact on low power consumption are critical factors that will guide the future development of memtransistor materials.

         <title>Expanded Nanofibrous Cellulose Electrode Binder: Declustering Lithium Polysulfides for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Li&#8210;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)&#8210;ion batteries, Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8210;S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter&#8208;glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li&#8210;S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh gsulfur&#8722;1 under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0&#160;&#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1 and low density of 0.927&#160;g mL&#8722;1), yielding a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.

         <title>Improving the Stability of Wide Bandgap Perovskites: Mechanisms, Strategies, and Applications in Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells is reviewed, including its stabilization mechanism, stabilization methods, and application in tandem solar cells. The current challenges and future perspectives for research in this promising field are also presented.








Abstract
Tandem solar cells (TSCs) based on wide bandgap (WBG) perovskites have gained significant attention for their higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to single&#8208;junction cells. The role of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the sub&#8208;cell in tandem cells consists of absorbing high&#8208;energy photons and producing higher open&#8208;circuit voltages (VOC). However, WBG PSCs face serious phase separation issues, resulting in poor long&#8208;term stability and substantial VOC loss in TSCs. In response, researchers have developed a range of strategies to mitigate these challenges, showing promising progress, and a comprehensive review of these strategies is expected. In this review, we discuss the stability mechanism in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids and all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites. Additionally, we conduct an in&#8208;depth investigation of various strategies to enhance stability, including component engineering, additive engineering, interface engineering, dimension control, solvent engineering, and encapsulation. Furthermore, the application of the WBG sub&#8208;cell in various TSCs is summarized in detail. Finally, perspectives are provided to offer guidance for the development of efficient and stable WBG sub&#8208;cell in the field of TSCs.

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sorting assembly mediated supramolecular nanoformulations are reported, featured by molecularly defined medicines and enhanced therapeutics. Specific &#8216;hydrogen&#8208;bonding molecular instructions&#8217; encoded in the structure of DAP/FU and HW/Ba pairs enables self&#8208;sorting phenomena and selective association of multiple prodrugs. Moreover, distinct association constant of DAP/FU (&#8776;102 M&#8722;1) and HW/Ba (&#8776;104&#8208;5 M&#8722;1) pairs endow programmable dissociation and specific chemo&#8208;prodrug release through pH/thermal&#8208;stimuli.








Abstract
Precise cancer nanomedicine requires rational molecular instructions of therapeutic agents. Harnessing the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships represents a practical strategy toward smart and effective nanomedicine. A structurally novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) supramolecular nanoformulation generated by orthogonal self&#8208;sorting assembly of chemo&#8208;prodrug (FPtF) and phototherapeutics (BPeB) is here reported, to reach an autonomous nanomedicine with improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy by combining chemo/phototherapy (CT/PT). The high&#8208;fidelity of H&#8208;bonding modularity from privileged heterocomplementary diaminopyridine/5&#8208;fluorouracil (DAP/FU) and Hamilton wedge/barbiturate (HW/Ba) pairs, respectively enable the precise spatial control of binding interactions toward FPtF and BPeB, in turn allowing the self&#8208;sorting process and specific &#8220;mix&#8208;and&#8208;match&#8221; capability. To directly stimulate phototherapy from BPeB via near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, spectral matched upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs, &#946;&#8208;NaYF4:Yb,Er) are encapsulated simultaneously. As a result, supramolecular polymeric nanomicelles, i.e., F/B/U@PHDO, are readily fabricated. Moreover, distinct H&#8208;bonding association constant (Ka) of DAP/FU (&#8776;102&#160;M&#8722;1) and HW/Ba (&#8776;104&#8208;5&#160;M&#8722;1) pairs reflect different strengths and stabilities of H&#8208;bonds, thus endowing the programmable H&#8208;bonding dissociation, accompanied with the chemo&#8208;prodrug release through pH/thermal&#8208;stimuli. Therapeutic regime with appreciated anti&#8208;tumor outcomes is ultimately accomplished via combined CT/PT.

     alt="&#8220;Mix-and-Match&#8221;: Self-Sorting Assembly Governed Supramolecular Polymeric Nanomedicine for Boosting Combined Chemo/Phototherapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-sorting assembly mediated supramolecular nanoformulations are reported, featured by molecularly defined medicines and enhanced therapeutics. Specific &#8216;hydrogen-bonding molecular instructions&#8217; encoded in the structure of DAP/FU and HW/Ba pairs enables self-sorting phenomena and selective association of multiple prodrugs. Moreover, distinct association constant of DAP/FU (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and HW/Ba (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;4-5&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) pairs endow programmable dissociation and specific chemo-prodrug release through pH/thermal-stimuli.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise cancer nanomedicine requires rational molecular instructions of therapeutic agents. Harnessing the structure-property-function relationships represents a practical strategy toward smart and effective nanomedicine. A structurally novel hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) supramolecular nanoformulation generated by orthogonal self-sorting assembly of chemo-prodrug (FPtF) and phototherapeutics (BPeB) is here reported, to reach an autonomous nanomedicine with improved anti-tumor efficacy by combining chemo/phototherapy (CT/PT). The high-fidelity of H-bonding modularity from privileged heterocomplementary diaminopyridine/5-fluorouracil (DAP/FU) and Hamilton wedge/barbiturate (HW/Ba) pairs, respectively enable the precise spatial control of binding interactions toward FPtF and BPeB, in turn allowing the self-sorting process and specific &#8220;mix-and-match&#8221; capability. To directly stimulate phototherapy from BPeB via near-infrared (NIR) light, spectral matched upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs, &#946;-NaYF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Yb,Er) are encapsulated simultaneously. As a result, supramolecular polymeric nanomicelles, i.e., F/B/U@PHDO, are readily fabricated. Moreover, distinct H-bonding association constant (Ka) of DAP/FU (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and HW/Ba (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;4-5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) pairs reflect different strengths and stabilities of H-bonds, thus endowing the programmable H-bonding dissociation, accompanied with the chemo-prodrug release through pH/thermal-stimuli. Therapeutic regime with appreciated anti-tumor outcomes is ultimately accomplished via combined CT/PT. The privileged opportunities offered by self-sorting design are anticipated to point to new paradigm toward precise nanomedicine for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Current Control of Spin Helicity and Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in a Multiferroic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting multiferroic state of spin origin with both electronic polarity (P) and magnetization (M) can be controlled and detected by electric current in a high&#8208;temperature helimagnet YMn6Sn6. The underlying concept is the coupling of the electric current with the toroidal moment T&#8764;P&#215;M$\bm{T}\sim \bm{P}\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}$. The controllability of state variables like P and T in conductors enhances the potential of spin&#8208;helicity&#8208;based spintronics.









Abstract
A multiferroic state with both electronic polarity (P) and magnetization (M) shows the inherently strong P&#8208;M coupling when P is induced by cycloidal (N&#233;el&#8208;wall like) spin modulation. The sign of P is determined by the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, the current control of the multiferroics is reported in a helimagnetic metal YMn6Sn6 and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment T&#8764;P&#215;M&#8764;(q&#770;&#215;&#967;v)&#215;M$\bm{T}\sim \bm{P}\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}\sim (\widehat{\bm{q}}\ensuremath{\times{}}{\bm{\chi}}_{v})\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}$ as well as with the magneto&#8208;chirality &#967;v &#183; M, whereq&#770;$\hspace*{0.28em}\widehat{\bm{q}}$ and &#967;v are the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. An enhancement of NRR is furthermore observed by the spin&#8208;cluster scattering via &#967;v and its fluctuation. These findings may pave the way to an exploration of multiferroic conductors and the application of the spin&#8208;helicity degree of freedom as a state variable.

         <title>2D Piezo&#8208;Ferro&#8208;Opto&#8208;Electronic Artificial Synapse for Bio&#8208;Inspired Multimodal Sensory Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PFOE Artificial Synapse integrating multimodal fusion perception in one device with a single functional material is presented, enabled by combined ferroelectricity (for synaptic behaviors), piezoelectricity (for tactile modulation), and optoelectronic responsiveness (for visual detection) of NbOI2. Under the synergistic modulation of strain and light, visual&#8208;tactile fusion perception has been fully demonstrated, advancing multifunctional sensing devices for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Multimodal sensory integration is vital for the evolution of artificial intelligence, yet current approaches often rely on physically connecting distinct sensing units (such as visual and tactile devices) through external circuits, leading to data transmission delays and information loss. Here, a groundbreaking paradigm is demonstrated for integrating visual&#8208;tactile fusion perception in one device with a single functional material. This is achieved by developing an unprecedented 2D Piezo&#8208;Ferro&#8208;Opto&#8208;Electronic (PFOE) Artificial Synapse, which combines the comprehensive ferroelectricity (for synaptic behaviors), piezoelectricity (for tactile modulation), and optoelectronic responsiveness (for visual detection) of strained 2D NbOI2. Under the synergistic influence of light and strain, the device exhibits remarkable persistent photoconductivity (PPC), a notable increase in paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF) index (from 116% to 180%), and a reduction in the power exponent of the sublinear power&#8208;law fitting photocurrent curve (from 0.797 to 0.376). These features enhance the clarity and recognition of fingerprint images that integrate visual and tactile information. The work provides a robust foundation for integrating multisensory capabilities into advanced human&#8208;machine interfaces and artificial intelligence systems, marking a significant leap forward in the development of multifunctional neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Crystal Transformation Strategy in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework solid&#8208;state electrolytes are developed for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The short&#8208;distance Zn2+ conduction pathways and abundant hydrogen bonds network achieved the rapid Zn2+ conduction, the Zn dendrite growth, and hydrogen evolution reaction&#160;inhibition, displaying long&#8208;term Zn stripping/plating stability, as well as endowing the solid&#8208;state battery with high capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) hold great potential for sustainable and high&#8208;safety reserves. However, the advancement of solid&#8208;state ZIBs is constrained by the shortage of reasonable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE) with abundant hopping sites, effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) inhibition, and favorable interfacial compatibility. Herein, the hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) CAM&#8208;Ag with Zn2+ hopping sites is developed as SSE for ZIBs. Taking advantage of the short&#8208;distance Zn2+ conduction pathways by crystal transformation through incorporating the Ag&#8722;N coordinate bonds, CAM&#8208;Ag SSE achieves a significant ionic conductivity of 1.14&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and superior Zn2+ transference number of 0.72. An abundant hydrogen bonds network effectively inhibits the initiation of HER and the subsequent generation of by&#8208;products. Moreover, the rapid Zn2+ conduction kinetics facilitated the inhibition of dendrite growth, promoting the uniform Zn2+ distribution. CAM&#8208;Ag SSE displays an extensive electrochemical stability range of 0&#8211;2.66&#160;V and remarkable electrochemical compatibility, enabling stable Zn2+ plating/stripping for &#8776;1000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, CAM&#8208;Ag SSE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state ZIBs achieve a specific capacity of 315&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with only 1.5% decrease in capacitance after 24&#160;h. The proposed HOF&#8208;based SSE displays a potential pathway for advancing stable and high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state ZIBs.

Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency soluble red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains a substantial challenge owing to the constraints imposed by the energy&#8208;gap law. In this study, an asymmetric pyrene&#8208;azaacene derivative, named PBCNT, is prepared and characterized, featuring a strong electron&#8208;donating tert&#8208;butyl diphenylamine moiety and an electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano group. PBCNT exhibits intense red emission with a peak wavelength of 664&#160;nm in a toluene solution. It demonstrates an evident TADF character in the solid state, attributed to a small energy difference of 0.04&#160;eV between its lowest singlet and triplet states. By employing a multi resonance&#8208;type TADF molecule as the host matrix, a solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on PBCNT achieved a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.5%, with a red emission peak at 608&#160;nm, facilitated by effective F&#246;rster energy transfer, good horizontal emitting dipole orientation and managed intermolecular interactions between the host and dopant. This represents one of the highest EQE values reported among solution&#8208;processed red TADF OLEDs emitting electroluminescence at wavelengths greater than 600&#160;nm. This paper introduces a promising pathway for developing efficient red TADF emitters that overcome the limitations of the energy&#8208;gap law.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Oxide&#8208;Based Catalysts for CO2 Photo&#8208;Hydrogenation: Oxygen Vacancies Promoted C&#9472;O Bond Cleavage in Key Intermediates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;tailored Co3O4 is employed to investigate how oxygen vacancies perform during CO2 (photo&#8208;)methanation, revealing that oxygen vacancies boost the C&#9472;O bond scission, facilitating conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Notably, the C&#9472;O bond cleavage in key intermediate formate, identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step, is accelerated on oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich M&#8208;Co3O4, leading to a high activity and selectivity in CH4 production.








Abstract
Oxygen vacancies are generally recognized to play significant roles in CO2 adsorption and activation during CO2 hydrogenation. However, by revisiting its structural/electronic affinity for a range of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates in CO2 hydrogenation processes, the additional roles of oxygen vacancies can be long overlooked and underestimated. Herein, using CO2 (photo&#8208;)methanation as a model reaction, Co3O4 with abundant oxygen vacancies is employed to investigate the relationship between oxygen vacancies and the formation/conversion of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Combined analyses of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the key intermediate is formate, whose C&#9472;O bond cleavage is inferred to be the rate&#8208;limiting step during CO2 methanation on Co3O4. Remarkably, leveraging the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated C&#9472;O bond scission to accelerate the conversion of formate, the CH4 production activity (1108.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (93%) are improved significantly. This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the multifaceted roles of oxygen vacancies in CO2 hydrogenation reactions, establishing a solid foundation toward the design and development of high&#8208;performance oxide&#8208;containing/&#8208;based catalysts for the conversion of CO2 into various valuable chemicals.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Symbiosis of Bimetallic Peroxides Nanoparticles to Induce Ferroptosis/Cuproptosis and Activate cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed zinc&#8208;copper bimetallic peroxides nanoparticles, which are synthesized through a one&#8208;step symbiotic method by co&#8208;hydrolysis of metal acetates, can release Zn2+, Cu2+, and H2O2 in TME to induce ferroptosis/cuproptosis and activate cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Therefore, anti&#8208;tumor adaptive and innate immunotherapy can be simultaneously promoted to effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis with assistance of immune checkpoint inhibitor.








Abstract
To improve the efficiency and application prospects of metal peroxides in tumor therapy, the synthesis of bimetallic peroxides via simple yet effective approaches will be highly significant. In this work, hyaluronic acid modified zinc&#8208;copper bimetallic peroxides (ZCPO@HA) nanoparticles are synthesized through a one&#8208;step symbiotic method by co&#8208;hydrolysis of zinc acetate and copper acetate in weakly alkaline solution, followed by modification with sodium hyaluronate. Upon decomposition in the tumor microenvironment, ZCPO@HA nanoparticles can generate a considerable content of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) by Fenton&#8208;like reaction between Cu2+ and self&#8208;compensating hydrogen peroxide, while downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 to induce ferroptosis. The abundant release of Cu2+ leads to the aggregation of dihydrolipoamide S&#8208;acetyltransferase and the reduction of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster proteins, causing cuproptosis. The immunogenic cell death of tumor cells releases abundant damage associated molecular patterns, effectively activating the adaptive immune response. Zn2+ and &#183;OH cause mitochondrial damage, leading to the release of a substantial amount of mitochondrial DNA. This subsequently activates the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, enhancing the innate immune response. In conclusion, it synthesizes a new type of bimetallic peroxides by one&#8208;step symbiosis for activating anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Pyrolysis: A Universal Route to High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

This work develops a molten salt strategy for synthesizing single&#8208;atom catalysts at 450&#160;&#176;C via LiCl/KCl&#8208;mediated Fe2+/Zn2+ exchange on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon substrates. By stabilizing Fe2+ ions and suppressing the Fe&#8208;oxide nanoparticle formation&#8212;a common limitation in conventional high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis&#8212;it achieves a 3.9 wt.% Fe loading of atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N4 sites, delivering superior H2&#8212;O2 fuel cell performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature pyrolysis (HTP, &#8805;900&#160;&#176;C) is a widely used method for synthesizing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the high operational temperatures required for HTP pose significant challenges in achieving high single&#8208;atom loading, primarily due to the Ostwald ripening effect. In this work, a low&#8208;temperature trans&#8208;metalation synthesis approach is developed which involves the exchange of cation between transition metal ions (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, etc) and Zn2+ ions on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) matrix within a molten salt medium. This strategy effectively avoids phase transformations and enables the direct formation of high mass loading (3.7&#8211;4.7 wt.%) of atomically dispersed M&#8208;N4 sites. Both experimental and theoretical analyses confirm that this cation&#8208;exchange occurs at a lower temperature threshold of 450&#160;&#176;C, significantly reducing the energy barriers for SACs synthesis. Furthermore, the synthesized catalyst with atomically dispersed Fe sites demonstrate excellent performance toward oxygen reduction reaction and fuel cell with a peak power density of 1.12 W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an H2&#9472;O2 fuel cell at 1.0&#160;bar and 80&#160;&#176;C.

Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization
In article number 2420510, Walid A. Daoud and colleagues report an atomic&#8208;scale polarization&#8208;functionalized Mn3O4&#8208;based catalyst for vanadium redox flow battery, where the role of vacancy&#8208;induced local polarization on vanadium redox reactions is investigated. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in transition metal oxide electrocatalysts, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes
This cross&#8208;sectional STEM image captures the wave&#8208;like rippling observed in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid 2D MXene. Here, these ripples, often referred to as Ripplocations, are formed when the organic surface groups are exposed to the electron beam. Ripplocations are a fundamental defect in layered materials and may play a key role in how the material responds to stress and external conditions. More details can be found in article number 2411669 by Francisco Lagunas, Robert F. Klie, and co&#8208;workers.

Coated Liquid Metal Droplets
In article number 2414519, Yixiong Feng. Jingyu Sun, Xiuju Song, and co&#8208;workers present a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated cadmium telluride (Cr2Te3)&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8208;LM) droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, non&#8208;adhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magneto&#8208;interactive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.

         <title>Pioneering the Future: Principles, Advances, and Challenges in Organic Electrodes for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium&#8208;ion (NH&#8324;&#8314;)&#8212;including cost&#8208;effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics&#8212;aqueous NH&#8324;&#8314; batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH4+ diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH4+ exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li+, Na+, and K+. Therefore, unlocking the NH4+&#8208;ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high&#8208;performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting&#8208;edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium&#8208;ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH4+ ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids in AAIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium-ion (NH&#8324;&#8314;)&#8212;including cost-effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics&#8212;aqueous NH&#8324;&#8314; batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic-inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting-edge aqueous energy storage systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous ammonium-ion (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next-generation large-scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost-effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, unlocking the NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high-performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting-edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium-ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic-inorganic hybrids in AAIBs. Lastly, the review addresses the key challenges and future perspectives of organic-material-based AAIBs, aiming to push the boundaries of cutting-edge aqueous energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Quantification for In Situ and Operando Liquid&#8208;Phase Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables visualization of nanoscale processes involving liquid media. Yet, it suffers from beam effects, such as radiolysis of the liquid, sample heating, and membrane charging. This review summarizes beam effect fundamentals, describes modeling and assessment, and illustrates handling strategies. The findings are transferable to other ionizing radiation techniques using, for example,&#160;&#947;&#8208; or X&#8208;rays.








Abstract
The ionizing radiation harnessed in electron microscopes or synchrotrons enables unique insights into nanoscale dynamics. In liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM), irradiating a liquid sample with electrons offers access to real space information at an unmatched combination of temporal and spatial resolution. However, employing ionizing radiation for imaging can alter the Gibbs free energy landscape during the experiment. This is mainly due to radiolysis and the corresponding shift in chemical potential; however, experiments can also be affected by irradiation&#8208;induced charging and heating. In this review, the state of the art in describing beam effects is summarized, theoretical and experimental assessment guidelines are provided, and strategies to obtain quantitative information under such conditions are discussed. While this review showcases these effects on LP&#8208;TEM, the concepts that are discussed here can also be applied to other types of ionizing radiation used to probe liquid samples, such as synchrotron X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Eliminating Radioresistance With a Magnetic Ion&#8208;Generator by Simultaneously Augmenting DNA Damage and Diminishing Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional medicine has encountered certain bottlenecks in dealing with radioresistance. To address this, a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; strategy based on the constructed radioresistance model is developed. This innovative magnetic ion&#8208;generator can not only release Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions to induce ferroptosis and activate the STING pathway, enhancing DNA damage synergistically with radiotherapy, but it can also modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment effectively, thereby reversing radioresistance.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) hinges on DNA damage&#8208;induced cancer cell death and the subsequent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, the efficacy of RT is curtailed by cell cycle heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which foster radioresistance. Here an ion generator&#8208;based RT enhancement strategy is demonstrated in a mouse model of the radioresistant tumor. The ion generator is degraded in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in iron&#8208;triggered ferroptosis that enhanced immunogenic cell death and a manganese&#8208;activated stimulator of interferon gene that reversed the immunosuppressive environment. As a result, the proposed strategy promotes dendritic cells maturity, augmentes CD8+ T cell infiltration of tumors, suppresses intratumoral myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and limits the M2 macrophages polarization, indicating the formation of an immunoreactive microenvironment. Significantly, this approach impedes the growth of not just primary, but also distal metastatic tumors. It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.

         <title>Advanced 3D Food Printing with Simultaneous Cooking and Generative AI Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ heating solution for 3D food printing is developed by incorporating noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources during the printing process. This technique ensures food quality control and reduces microbial contamination. The AI&#8208;generated 3D food shape design allows users to create digital models using text input without prior computational skills.








Abstract
3D food printing is an indispensable technology for emerging food technologies. However, conventional nonconcurrent postprocessing methods limit the final food quality, including the unappealing nature of food ink modification, imperfections in retaining the desired food shape, and the risk of microbial contamination. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enhanced solution is developed to achieve extrusion&#8208;based printing with simultaneous infrared heating, enabling in&#8208;line and rapid cooking of complex starch&#8208;based food. Noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources present outstanding food quality control with microbial studies, microstructure analysis, and heat transfer simulation models. This integrative 3D food printing method with AI&#8208;enhanced food pattern generation and in&#8208;situ cooking significantly expands the applications for customized food creation. It paves the way for the broader adoption of heating&#8208;based 3D printing of functional materials.

Multimaterial volumetric and embedded extrusion bioprinting of complex cell&#8208;laden architectures is enabled by unravelling the interplay between molecular weight and degree of functionalization in gelatin&#8208;based bioresins. Tomographic light&#8208;responsive support baths for suspended printing can be easily generated from single component materials. Molecular weight tuning produces a library of printable hydrogels matching the viscoleasticity properties of native tissues, influencing cell self&#8208;organization.








Abstract
Volumetric Bioprinting (VBP), enables to rapidly build complex, cell&#8208;laden hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Light&#8208;based tomographic manufacturing enables spatial&#8208;selective polymerization of a bioresin, resulting in higher throughput and resolution than what is achieved using traditional techniques. However, methods for multi&#8208;material printing are needed for broad VBP adoption and applicability. Although converging VBP with extrusion bioprinting in support baths offers a novel, promising solution, further knowledge on the engineering of hydrogels as light&#8208;responsive, volumetrically printable baths is needed. Therefore, this study investigates the tuning of gelatin macromers, in particular leveraging the effect of molecular weight and degree of modification, to overcome these challenges, creating a library of materials for VBP and Embedded extrusion Volumetric Printing (EmVP). Bioresins with tunable printability and mechanical properties are produced, and a novel subset of gelatins and GelMA exhibiting stable shear&#8208;yielding behavior offers a new, single&#8208;component, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use suspension medium for in&#8208;bath printing, which is stable over multiple hours without needing temperature control. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application, bioprinted gels are tested with insulin&#8208;producing pancreatic cell lines for 21 days of culture. Leveraging a multi&#8208;color printer, complex multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular geometries are produced, enhancing the accessibility of volumetric printing for advanced tissue models.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Ripplocations in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides with amino surface groups that exhibit interesting optical properties. The sensitivity of the organic material under high&#8208;energy electron beams complicates conventional TEM analysis. Using cryogenic STEM, we show h&#8208;MXenes are stable until a critical dose threshold. Beyond that threshold, the in situ generation of ripplocations is observed.









Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides functionalized with alkylimido and alkylamido surface groups. Using cryogenic and room temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is shown that ripplocations, a form of a fundamental defect in 2D and layered structures, are abundant in this family of materials. Furthermore, detailed studies of electron probe sample interactions, focusing on structural deformations caused by the electron beam are presented. The findings indicate that at cryogenic temperatures (&#8776;100&#160;K) and below a specific dose threshold, the structure of h&#8208;MXenes remains largely intact. However, exceeding this threshold leads to electron beam&#8208;induced deformation through ripplocations. Interestingly, the deformation behavior, required dose, and resultant structure are highly dependent on temperature. At 100&#160;K, it is demonstrated that the electron beam can induce ripplocations in situ with a high degree of precision.

         <title>Self&#8208;Oxygenating PROTAC Microneedle for Spatiotemporally&#8208;Confined Protein Degradation and Enhanced Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oxygenating PROTAC microneedle (MN)&#160;is engineered to circumvent the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and achieve spatiotemporally&#8208;confined bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4) protein degradation. PPT7 NPs are swiftly released for rapid cellular uptake, confining the region of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and ARV771 production upon 671 nm laser irradiation. BM NPs are continuously released for generating oxygen (O2) to alleviate tumor hypoxia. This PROTAC&#8208;delivered MN significantly inhibits&#160;tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models.









Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive subtype of primary brain tumors, which marginally respond&#160;to standard chemotherapy due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and the low tumor specificity of the therapeutics. Herein, a double&#8208;layered microneedle (MN) patch is rationally engineered by integrating acid and light dual&#8208;activatable PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) nanoparticles and self&#8208;oxygenating BSA&#8208;MnO2 (BM) nanoparticles for GBM treatment. The MN is administrated at the tumor site to locally deliver the PROTAC prodrug and BM nanoparticles. The PROTAC nanoparticles are rapidly released from the outer layer of the MN and specifically activated in the acidic intracellular environment of tumor cells. Subsequently, near&#8208;infrared light activates the photosensitizer to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) through photodynamic therapy (PDT), thereby triggering spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable degradation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4). The BM nanoparticles, in the inner layer of the MN, serve as an oxygen supply station, and counteracts tumor hypoxia by converting hydrogen peroxide&#160;(H2O2) into oxygen (O2), thus promoting PDT and PROTAC activation. This PROTAC prodrug&#8208;integrated MN significantly inhibits tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models. This study describes the first spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable protein degradation strategy for highly efficient GBM therapy, potentially advancing precise therapy of other kinds of refractory brain tumors.

         <title>Polyamine&#8208;Depleting Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Organic Frameworks Unleash Dendritic Cell and T Cell Vigor for Targeted CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) nanoplatforms depletes polyamines in the tumor microenvironment, reversing T&#8208;cell immunosuppression and enhancing dendritic cell activity. By releasing CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 and inducing neoantigen generation via carbonyl stress and mutational burden elevation, this system enables precision cancer immunotherapy through dual&#8208;action mechanisms targeting both immune vigor and tumor vulnerability.








Abstract
Polyamines have tantalized cancer researchers as a potential means to rein in the rampant growth of cancer cells. However, clinical trials in recent decades have disappointed in delivering notable progress. Herein, a microfluidic&#8208;assisted synthetic hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) as a polyamine&#8208;depleting nanoplatforms designed to unleash the vigor of both dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells for precision cancer immunotherapy is reported. Upon internalization by tumor cells, the loaded plasma amine oxidase (PAO) in HOF efficiently depletes polyamines, remolding the tumor microenvironment and alleviating T&#8208;cell immunosuppression. This process also generates acrolein and H2O2, triggering CRISPR&#8208;assisted neoantigen generation. Specifically, Acrolein induces carbonyl stress, increasing mutational burdens. Simultaneously, HOF leverages the energy from the bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO)&#8208;H2O2 reaction for CRET&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production, leading to thioether bond cleavage and release CRISPR&#8208;Cas9. Once released, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 knocks out the DNA mismatch repair (MMR)&#8208;related MLH1 gene, further elevating mutational burdens and generating neoantigens, ideal targets for DCs. This dual&#8208;action strategy not only corrects T&#8208;cell immunosuppression but also enhances DC efficacy, presenting a powerful approach for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Hyperspectral Metachip&#8208;Based 3D Spatial Map for Cancer Cell Screening and Quantification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior Q factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.








Abstract
In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3&#160;THz frequency with a record&#8208;high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high&#8208;dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes.

&lt;p&gt;A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3&#160;THz frequency with a record-high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high-dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes. The screening of up to 15 cancer cells is experimentally reported, with very high detecting accuracy of 93.33% and with attractive quantitative concentration sensitivity up to 1320&#160;kHz&#160;cell&#160;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This hyperspectral metachips are low-cost, highly compact, and label-free for fast, high-throughput and high-sensitivity detections and evaluation of human cancer cells. This technology does not require clinical experience, representing an accessible technology for early diagnosis of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Nanoscale 3D Printing of Calcium Phosphates Using Bone Prenucleation Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bone&#8208;bioinspired photoresin containing PNCs of calcium phosphates, enabling nanoscale precision via 2pp. This novel approach allows for 2D patterning and 3D nanostructuring of CaPs with intricate geometries. The technique offers unparalleled control over scaffold design and porosity, paving the way for advanced applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are ubiquitous in biological structures, such as vertebrate bones and teeth, and have been widely used in biomedical applications. However, fabricating CaPs at the nanoscale in 3D has remained a significant challenge, particularly due to limitations in current nanofabrication techniques, such as two&#8208;photon polymerization (2pp), which are not applicable for creating CaP nanostructures. In this study, a novel approach is presented to 3D print CaP structures with unprecedented resolution of &#8776;300&#160;nm precision, achieving a level of detail three orders of magnitude finer than any existing additive manufacturing techniques for CaPs. This advancement is achieved by leveraging bioinspired chemistry, utilizing bone prenucleation nanoclusters (PNCs, average size of 5&#160;nm), within a photosensitive resin. These nanoclusters form a highly transparent photoresist, overcoming the light&#8208;scattering typically associated with larger calcium phosphate&#8208;based nanoparticles. This method not only allows for nanopatterning of CaPs on diverse substrates, but also enables the precise control of microstructure down to the level of submicron grains. The method paves the way for the developing of bioinspired metamaterials, lightweight damage&#8208;tolerant materials, cell&#8208;modulating interfaces, and precision&#8208;engineered coatings.

         <title>Printing Multi&#8208;Layered Functional Devices Using One Stamp with Programmable Surface Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;layered printed electronics are generally fabricated by overprinting with multiple stamps. Herein, a novel printing approach is introduced by modifying stamp with patterned surface energy. This enables the fabrication of multiple functional layers using only one stamp. Using this method, the fabrication of flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;denstiy transistor array are demonstrated (with over 17,900 transistors on an 8&#8208;inch wafer).








Abstract
Beyond its role in cultural communication, printing technology has emerged as one of the most important approaches to distributing and patterning functional materials for advanced manufacturing. In a printing process, a stamp is employed to transfer functional inks to a target surface, generating a specific pattern that exactly replicates the stamp. Through precise manipulation of different inkdrops, herein, a &#8220;one stamp, diverse patterns&#8221; printing strategy is developed and achieves deposition of varied patterns utilizing a single stamp. This stamp features patterned surface energy, achieved through regioselective energy injection treatment of an ultralow surface energy solid. It is revealed that inks with different surface tensions&#160;can selectively exhibit Cassie or Wenzel state on the stamp to generate diverse ink distributions, which enables the printing of distinct patterns on target surfaces. Leveraging this approach, flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;density transistor array are successfully printed using single stamps. These findings advance the understanding of finely tuning and patterning surface energy for precise liquid manipulation and offer a leap forward in efficient and versatile printing methodology that will boost the innovative integration of functional materials in a simplified manner.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive H2S Composite System Regulates the Nerve Regeneration Microenvironment Through Multiple Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article designs and prepares a photo&#8208;responsive H2S composite nerve transplantation conduit using electrospinning technology and drug delivery system, combining aligned structure, RGD peptide, H2S, and Zn&#8208;CA MOFs. This system can not only achieve artificially controlled H2S release, but also slowly release Zn2+, achieving the joint regulation of Zn2+ and H2S in the nerve regeneration microenvironment.








Abstract
After injury, the imbalance of the regeneration microenvironment caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, insufficient neurovascularization, and inadequate energy supply affects nerve regeneration. Drug&#8208;delivery nerve conduits play a role in repairing the regenerative microenvironment. However, traditional drugs often fail to cross the blood&#8208;nerve barrier and lack multifunctionality, limiting the effectiveness of conduit therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a multifunctional conduit that regulate the regeneration microenvironment timely and effectively. Herein, a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) composite nerve conduit, artificially controlled H2S release, is developed. A new structure of zinc&#8208;citric acid organic metal framework (Zn&#8208;CA MOFs) is utilized to improve its drug loading rate, achieving the joint regulation of the nerve regeneration microenvironment by H2S and Zn2+. In addition, RGD modification of polyester amide (P(CL&#8208;MMD&#8208;MAC)&#8208;RGD)) combined with aligned structure is used to improve the performance of the conduit. Relevant results demonstrate that H2S and Zn2+ can regulate inflammatory response and oxidative stress and promote mitochondrial function recovery and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the aligned structure can promote cell adhesion and guide cell directed migration. Overall, this study provides a method of combining gas neurotransmitters with ions to improve the nerve regeneration microenvironment, accelerate nerve regeneration, and restore motor function.

         <title>An Integrated Virtual Screening Platform to Identify Potent Co&#8208;Assembled Nanodrugs for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses ligand&#8208;based virtual screening&#160;(LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct a high&#8208;throughput screening platform, which can be used to identify small molecule combinations with potential co&#8208;assembly ability.








Abstract
Co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs provide significant advantages in cancer treatment and drug delivery, yet effective screening methods to identify molecular combinations for co&#8208;assembly are lacking. This study presents a screening strategy integrating ligand&#8208;based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore new molecular combinations with co&#8208;assembly capabilities. The accuracy of this screening was validated by synthesizing various co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs under mild conditions. Vinpocetine (Vin) and lenvatinib (Len) are representative co&#8208;assembly combinations that can directly co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These NPs were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in PEG&#8208;L/V NPs that exhibited enhanced stability and biocompatibility. In addition, PEG&#8208;L/V NPs can respond to acidic conditions and release Vin and Len, working synergistically to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro while also inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA&#8208;seq) analysis revealed that the co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs exhibited mechanisms that are distinct from those of single drugs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a computational approach combining LBVS and DFT to identify small molecules with co&#8208;assembly capabilities, leading to innovative anticancer strategies.

         <title>Adhesives with Debonding&#8208;On&#8208;Demand Capability: Leveraging Responsive Microcapsules for Mechanically&#8208;Induced Debonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.








Abstract
Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high&#8208;value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate&#8208;filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite. Under controlled compression, these microcapsules rupture precisely, releasing their contents to induce sufficient adhesive plasticization to enable effortless debonding. Our results indicate that while the inclusion of microcapsules affects adhesion strength and toughness, the overall mechanical performance remains stable across different concentrations. Thermal tests highlight a 50&#160;wt.% microcapsule concentration as optimal for enhanced plasticization, while compression tests show that an applied force of 5&#160;kN achieves maximum capsule rupture without compromising substrate integrity. Ultimately, specimens bonded with the responsive composite under compression exhibit a striking 1200% increase in creep rates compared to those bonded with the neat adhesive, allowing for effective debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand&#8212;an outcome unattainable with the neat adhesive. This simple and highly versatile approach lays the groundwork for advancing the development of more sustainable and functional adhesive materials.

         <title>Engineered MSCs Break Endothelial&#8208;Myofibroblast Crosstalk in Pulmonary Fibrosis: Reconstructing the Vascular Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineered MSCs (MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN) prepared based on surface&#8208;anchoring nanoparticle technology can trigger the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP&#8208;2) response to release drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MM@LPHN) and break the malignant regulatory network between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells in the fibroblastic foci. Combined with the pro&#8208;angiogenic effect of MSCs achieve the reconstruction of the vascular niche, the engineered MSCs promote lung tissue regeneration and treat pulmonary fibrosis.








Abstract
In the progress of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the normal vascular niche plays a crucial role in alveolar regeneration by secreting angiocrine factors. However, the malignant interaction between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells results in significant loss of pulmonary capillaries in fibroblast foci, which promotes continuous deterioration of fibrosis. Herein, an engineered mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapeutic named MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN is developed for reconstructing the vascular niche, which is formed by modifying the surface of MSC with ROS&#8208;responsive lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles encapsulating the metformin and macitentan. Due to the homing ability of MSC, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN can effectively target lung tissue, then induce myofibroblast dedifferentiation to reduce the secretion of cytokines that cause endothelial cell damage and preventing endothelial cells from turning into a fibrotic phenotype, leading to recovery of the vascular endothelial cells function. Combined with the role of MSC&#8208;secreted growth factors promoting angiogenesis, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN ultimately constructs normal vascular structure in the fibroblast area and reverses bleomycin&#8208;induced PF. The findings suggest targeting the cell network in the vascular niche can effectively treat PF, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Development of Bioorthogonally Degradable Tough Hydrogels Using Enamine N&#8208;Oxide Based Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inducibly degradable enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are integrated into tough double network hydrogels, enabling rapid and bioorthogonal degradation by aqueous diboron solutions. These chemical reagent&#8208;responsive biomaterials maintain structural integrity during use while enabling rapid degradation when needed, making them ideal for applications in intraoral wound dressings. These findings highlight the potential of the enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinker in polymer and materials chemistry.








Abstract
Inducibly degradable polymers present new opportunities to integrate tough hydrogels into a wide range of biomaterials. Rapid and inducible degradation enables fast transition in material properties without sacrificing material integrity prior to removal. In pursuit of bioorthogonal chemical modalities that will enable inducible polymer degradation in biologically relevant environments, enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are developed for double network acrylamide&#8208;based polymer/alginate hydrogels. Bioorthogonal dissociation initiated by the application of aqueous diboron solution through several delivery mechanisms effectively lead to polymer degradation. Their degradation by aqueous B2(OH)4 solution results in a fracture energy half&#8208;life of &lt;10 min. The biocompatibility of the degradable hydrogels and B2(OH)4 reagent is assessed, and the removability of strongly adhered tough hydrogels on mice skin is evaluated. Thermoresponsive PNiPAAm/Alg hydrogels are fabricated and application of the hydrogels as a chemically inducible degradable intraoral wound dressing is demonstrated. It is demonstrated through in vivo maximum tolerated dose studies that diboron solution administered to mice by oral gavage is well tolerated. Successful integration of enamine N&#8208;oxides within the tough double network hydrogels as chemically degradable motifs demonstrates the applicability of enamine N&#8208;oxides in the realm of polymer chemistry and highlights the importance of chemically induced bioorthogonal dissociation reactions for materials science.

         <title>Red, Green and Blue Liquid&#8208;Film Lasers Based on Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in liquid films achieve breakthrough vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers across red, green, and blue spectra. By leveraging entropic ligands for ultrahigh solubility and integrating microfluidic cooling, this work overcomes thermal quenching, enabling stable lasing at MHz repetition rates. The platform unlocks customizable, solution&#8208;processed lasers for tunable wavelengths and diverse applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (cQD) are heralded for their tunable bandgaps, solution&#8208;processibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making them ideal candidates for lasing applications. However, previous cQD lasing demonstrations have largely depended on close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, which are deemed essential to counteract the rapid decay of material gain. In this study, a novel approach is introduced utilizing &#8220;entropic ligands and solvent&#8221; to enhance the solubility of cQDs in solution. By achieving the necessary critical volume fraction for lasing, this strategy leads to the groundbreaking development of the first liquid&#8208;state vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers (VCSELs) based on cQDs across the blue and green spectrum, encompassing diverse material systems such as CdSe&#8208;based and InP&#8208;based cQDs. Furthermore, by integrating the liquid&#8208;state VCSEL with a microfluidic channel, it is demonstrated that heat dissipation during intense excitation is pivotal for cQD lasing likely across various excitation modes&#8212;whether pulsed or continuous&#8208;wave, optically or electrically&#8208;pumped&#8212;and different media, including liquid and solid states. The research will lay the foundation for a new era of liquid&#8208;state cQD lasers for specific occasions, distinguished by their customizable and largely&#8208;variable wavelengths, compact form factors, diverse materials basis, and dependable performance.

         <title>Nanoporous Ag Microparticles with Tailorable and Noncontaminated Nanopores for SERS Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag7O8NO3 microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.








Abstract
Nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with noncontaminated surfaces hold significant promise in catalytic and sensing fields. Fabrication of nanoporous metal microparticles without using any organic ligands remains a significant challenge. Here, a green synthesis strategy is presented inspired by dealloying mechanisms. Ag7O8NO3 microparticles are first electrodeposited. Subsequent chemical reduction process selectively removes nitrogen and oxygen species from the Ag7O8NO3 microparticles while preserving the original morphology, giving rise to the formation of nanoporous Ag microparticles without using organic agents under room temperature within several minutes. Based on the ion diffusion limited growth mechanism, a quantitative correlation is established between the opening size of the nanopores and the concentration of the reductive agents, allowing to rationally prepare nanopores with opening size ranging from &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm to &gt;&#160;110&#160;nm. The ultraclean surface of the nanoporous Ag microparticles guarantees a clean surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) background. Reliable and sensitive SERS detection of proteins by unfolding the protein structure is further demonstrated to expose the otherwise concealed parts to the nanoporous Ag microparticles. A simple but powerful approach is developed to design ultraclean nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with promising applications in those fields requiring clean surfaces, such as in SERS sensing and catalytic fields.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.

         <title>Plasma Membrane Targeted Photodynamic Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy by Initiating Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Depleting Infiltrating B Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist called PMTPN is designed to target tumor tissues and anchor on plasma membrane, aiming to initiate tumor cell pyroptosis and deplete infiltrating B cells. Consequently, PMTPN promotes DCs maturation and CTLs infiltration, while decreasing Tregs, greatly reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade therapy for primary and distant tumor eradication.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable benefits in the treatment of malignant tumors, but the clinical response rates are unsatisfied due to the low tumor immunogenicity and the abundant immunosuppressive cells. Herein, a plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist (designated as PMTPN) is developed to potentiate ICB therapy by initiating tumor cell pyroptosis and depleting infiltrating B cells. PMTPN is composed of a rationally designed chimeric peptide sequence loaded with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Ibrutinib). Notably, PMTPN is capable of sequentially targeting tumor and tumor cell membrane to trigger immunogenic pyroptosis and cause overwhelming release of cytokines, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activation. Meanwhile, PMTPN can also deplete infiltrating B cells and reduce the secretion of interleukin&#8208;10 to decrease immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and enhance CTLs infiltration. Beneficially, the synergistic immune modulating characteristics of PMTPN potentiate ICB therapy to simultaneously eliminate primary and distant tumors. This study offers a promising strategy to elevate the immunotherapeutic response rate in consideration of the complex immunosuppressive factors.

         <title>Lipoic Acid/Choline Ionic Liquid Enhanced Intratumoral Heat/Mass Transfer for Suppressing Thermo&#8208;Mediated Tumor Relapse and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid consisting of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) as a multifunctional thermal ablation sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA disrupts tumor matrix and modulates cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thus facilitating its heat/mass transfer in tumors. Meanwhile, LACH/PNA demonstrates specific cytotoxicity on hepatoma cells and is further intensified by thermal treatment.








Abstract
Thermal ablation (TA) is widely used for clinical treatment of various cancers. However, TA often struggles to efficiently kill tumor cells without injuring adjacent normal tissues/cells, leading to thermo&#8208;mediated tumor relapse and metastasis, owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment surrounding residual tumor cells. In this study, a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid composed of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) is developed as a multifunctional TA sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA exhibits a high diffusion coefficient by disrupting the tumor matrix and modulating cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thereby facilitating heat and mass transfer in tumors. LACH/PNA demonstrates greater cytotoxicity toward hepatoma cells than on normal hepatocytes with this effect further intensified by thermal treatment. These findings highlight LACH/PNA as a promising multifunctional sensitizer for clinical chemoablation&#8208;microwave ablation synergy.

         <title>Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.








Abstract
Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field. The theoretical and experimental results for electric conduction can directly be transferred to thermal conduction or particle diffusion and may enable remote sensing applications.

         <title>Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid&#8208;Based Archival File System for Random Accessible In Vivo DNA Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient storage and retrieval of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) data while maintaining scalability and stability remain challenges in the field of molecular data storage. This study introduces Engineered Living Memory Microspheroids (ELMMs), which combine genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) with matrix materials for DNA storage. The ELMM system improves random access and reduces data encapsulation time, offering scalable, closed&#8208;loop storage and reuse.








Abstract
Given its exceptional durability and high information density, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;has the potential to meet the escalating global demand for data storage if it can be stored efficiently and accessed randomly in exabyte&#8208;to&#8208;yottabyte&#8208;scale databases. Here, this work introduces the Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid (ELMM) as a novel material for DNA data storage, retrieval, and management. This work engineers a plasmid library and devises a random access strategy pairing plasmid function with DNA data in a key&#8208;value format. Each DNA segment is integrated with its corresponding plasmid, introduced into bacteria, and encapsulated within matrix material via droplet microfluidics within 5 min. ELMMs can be stored at room temperature following lyophilization and, upon rehydration, each type of ELMM exhibits specific functions expressed by the plasmids, allowing for physical differentiation based on these characteristics. This work demonstrates fluorescent expression as the plasmid function and employs fluorescence&#8208;based sorting access image files in a prototype database. By utilizing N optical channels, to retrieve 2N file types, each with a minimum of 10 copies. ELMM offers a digital&#8208;to&#8208;biological information solution, ensuring the preservation, access, replication, and management of files within large&#8208;scale DNA databases.

         <title>M&#246;bius Solvation Structure for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Herein, in a bold departure from convention, the Ouzo effect is pioneeringly utilized to design surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE), creating the first application of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This approach enables dual regulation of both the solvent environment and the solvation structure, thereby enhancing battery performance.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have promising prospects in energy storage field, but the water molecules in aqueous electrolytes significantly compromise the stability of the anode and cathode interfaces and hinder the low&#8208;temperature performance. Herein, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation composed of oil, water, and amphiphilic salt are first&#8208;ever pioneered, forming the surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE). This water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius solvation structure, characterized by its distinct inner and outer layers and a polarity inversion feature, successfully connects the non&#8208;polar phase with the polar phase, eliminating the need for surfactants to reduce costs and system complexity. The amphiphilic anion of salt creates a polarity singularity and stabilizes the polarity&#8208;reversed encapsulation. The outer oil layer disrupts the cohesive polarity network of water and constructs a polarity&#8208;reversed cage to restrict water. A series of SFMEE combinations are investigated and then directly applied to ZIBs, confirming excellent universality and durability of this design. The Zn||NVO (NaV&#8323;O&#8328;&#183;1.5H&#8322;O) cells using SFMEE can stably cycle for 4000 cycles with a capacity of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 and 86.8% capacity retention. This discovery of M&#246;bius solvation structure unlock unprecedented levels of electrolyte design and illuminate the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>Organic Gradient Homojunction via D&#8208;A Engineering Enables Photoelectric/Photothermal Dual&#8208;Assisted Catalysis Toward Full Spectrum Light&#8208;Coupled Low&#8208;Temperature Seawater Batteries</title>

An organic gradient homojunction design via rational donor&#8211;acceptor engineering is proposed to establish a new class of full&#8208;spectrum responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode for solar&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based metal&#8208;air flow batteries with improved solar utilization and device energy efficiency even at lower temperatures, by exploring photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;assisted bidirectional oxygen catalysis.








Abstract
Coupling solar into metal&#8208;air batteries represents an appealing paradigm for storing intermittent solar energy and boosting device energy efficiency. Current solar&#8208;coupled metal&#8208;air systems rely on UV or visible light harvesting and suffer from inferior charge separation ability and limited solar utilization. Additionally, sunlight action behavior/mechanism in some useful scenarios (seawater electrolytes, low&#8208;temperature) is underexplored. Herein, through gradient homojunction design via donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering, it exploits a novel full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode (PGH) for sunlight&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Zn/Na&#8208;air batteries (Zn&#8208;SWAB/Na&#8208;SWAB) with boosted sunlight utilization and energy efficiency at lower temperatures. By stacking three pre&#8208;designed analogous [A1&#8208;D1]m&#8208;[A1&#8208;D2]n copolymers with gradient energy&#8208;levels and rich heterocycles, PGH integrates separate metal&#8208;free active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), efficient photothermal effect with full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;absorption, and superior photoelectric effect with high charge&#8208;separation efficiency. Thus, PGH under simulated&#8208;sunlight produces remarkably&#8208;enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight&#8208;coupled PGH&#8208;enabled Zn&#8208;SWAB and Na&#8208;SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25&#160;V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43&#160;V at 0&#160;&#176;C &#8211; both of which surpass most reported room&#8208;temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0&#160;&#176;C even approach their room&#8208;temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.

         <title>Lab&#8208;in&#8208;Cell: A Covalent Photosensitizer Reverses Hypoxia and Evokes Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>

The covalent warhead alkynamide is incorporated into an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer, developing a redox systems&#8208;targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;PA. It is aimed at disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system, alleviating hypoxia, and evoking ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA&#8208;NPs at the tumor led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non&#8208;invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP&#8208;PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non&#8208;covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol&#8208;yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.

         <title>Thermal Processing Creates Water&#8208;Stable PEDOT:PSS Films for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of using chemical cross&#8211;linkers, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films for bioelectronics become water&#8208;stable after a simple heat treatment. The heat treatment is compatible with a range of rigid and elastomeric substrates and films are stable in vivo for &gt;20 days. 2D and 3D PEDOT:PSS structures can be patterned by delivering heat with a focused femtosecond laser.









Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors have emerged as a key material for the development of bioelectronic devices due to their soft mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and high volumetric capacitance. In particular, PEDOT:PSS has become a choice material because it is highly conductive, easily processible, and commercially available. However, PEDOT:PSS is dispersible in water, leading to delamination of films when exposed to biological environments. For this reason, chemical cross&#8211;linking agents such as (3&#8208;glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) are used to stabilize PEDOT:PSS films in water, but at the cost of decreased electrical performance. Here, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films become water&#8208;stable by simply baking at high temperatures (&gt;150 &#176;C) for a short time (&#8776; 2 min). It is shown that heat&#8208;treated PEDOT:PSS films are as stable as their chemically&#8208;cross&#8211;linked counterparts, with their performance maintained for &gt;20 days both in vitro and in vivo. The heat&#8208;treated films eliminate electrically insulating cross&#8211;linkers, resulting in a 3&#215; increase in volumetric capacitance. Applying thermal energy using a focused femtosecond laser enables direct patterning of 3D PEDOT:PSS microstructures. The thermal treatment method is compatible with a wide range of substrates and is readily substituted into existing workflows for manufacturing devices, enabling its rapid adoption in the field of bioelectronics.

         <title>Generating Self&#8208;Adjuvated Nanofiber Vaccines by Coating Bacterial Flagella with Antigens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coating bacterial flagella with antigens is used as a versatile platform for developing self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. The resulting flagellum&#8208;based subunit vaccines with appealing features in prolonging tumor retention, recruiting adequate immune cells, and promoting cellular uptake of antigens and subsequent activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells provide a unique paradigm for effective vaccination.








Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;based vaccines have received increasing attention given the ability to induce strong systemic immune responses. However, the application of bacteria as therapeutic agents inevitably suffers from infection&#8208;associated side effects due to the living characteristics. Here, the use of bacteria&#8208;derived flagella is described to construct self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. With the help of charge&#8208;reversal mediated by decoration with cationic polymers, the flagella can be coated with negatively charged antigens through electrostatic interaction. By virtue of the large aspect ratio, the resulting nanofiber vaccines show prolonged retention at the injection site and increased uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. Thanks to the innate immunogenicity, self&#8208;adjuvated flagella robustly promote dendritic cell maturation and macrophage polarization, resulting in the elicitation of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell and B&#8208;cell immune responses. In ovalbumin&#8208;overexpressing melanoma&#8208;bearing mice, immunization with ovalbumin&#8208;carried vaccines not only exhibits a favorable tolerance, but also displays superior inhibition efficacies on tumor growth and metastasis separately under the therapeutic and prophylactic settings. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated for vaccine fabrication by coating with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike protein S1 subunit. Bacterial flagella&#8208;based self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber platform proposes a versatile strategy to develop various vaccines for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>2D Metastable&#8208;Phase Hafnium Oxide Triggers Hydrogen Spillover for Boosting Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is a widespread interfacial phenomenon involving the migration of equivalent amounts of H atoms from metal to support. The design of the substrate is crucial for triggering hydrogen spillover. Metastable&#8208;phase hexagonal phase hafnium oxide substrate can trigger efficient hydrogen spillover after loading ruthenium, yet the same phenomenon is forbidden on the stable phase monoclinic phase hafnium oxide substrate.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H) manipulation plays a significantly important role in many important applications, in which the occurrence of hydrogen spillover generally shows substrate&#8208;dependent behavior. It therefore remains an open question about how to trigger the hydrogen spillover on the substrates that are generally hydrogen spillover forbidden. Here a new metastable&#8208;phase 2D edge&#8208;sharing oxide: six&#8208;hexagonal phase&#8208;hafnium oxide (Hex&#8208;HfO2, space group: P63mc (186)) with the coordination number of six is demonstrated, which serves as an ideal platform for activating efficient hydrogen spillover after loading Ru nanoclusters (Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2). For a stark comparison, the hydrogen spillover is strongly forbidden when using stable monoclinic phase HfO2 (M&#8208;HfO2, space group: P21/c (14), coordination number: seven) as the substrate. When applied in an acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2 exhibits a low overpotential of 8&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high Ru utilization activity of 14.37 A mgRu&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mV. Detailed mechanism reveals the positive H adsorption free energy on Hex&#8208;HfO2, indicating that H is more likely to spillover on Hex&#8208;HfO2. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Ru and Hex&#8208;HfO2 optimizes the desorption of hydrogen intermediate, thus facilitating the surface H spillover. The discovery provides new guidance for developing metastable&#8208;phase oxide substrates for advanced catalysis.

         <title>Friction Memory Ionogels With Hysteretic Sticky&#8208;Slippery Transition via Thermolocking the Metastable state</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the kinetic differences between the evolution of the condensed structure in the bulk and the adsorption of droplets on the surface, on&#8208;demand friction memory is achieved without persistent stimulus.








Abstract
Many biological organisms possess adaptive friction states and display hysteretic friction recovery, allowing them to achieve specific friction memory after environment change. However, current artificial materials have limitations in maintaining on&#8208;demand friction states upon withdrawal of external triggers due to their strong dependence on external stimulus. Here, thermally induced phase separation ionogels with friction memory are reported. The kinetic difference between the evolution of bulk condensed structure and the adsorption of surface droplets after removing external stimulus delayed the recovery of friction state transition from slippery to sticky, thus achieving responsive friction memory. In addition, the metastable intermediate state generated during phase separation could be locked through vitrification, resulting in three distinct friction states determined by the synergy of stiffness and surface properties, including sticky state (coefficient of friction of 1.8), medium state (0.3&#8211;0.5) and slippery state (0.03&#8211;0.07). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, smart devices with diverse surface friction performance are engineered to realize various functions, including recognition of thermal range for target objects, de&#8208;icing, and movement manipulation. These results provide new insights for expanding the applications of ionogels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art soft robotics and haptic engineering, offering fresh perspectives for further development of these fields.

         <title>Giant and Anisotropic Enhancement of Spin&#8208;Charge Conversion in Graphene&#8208;Based Quantum System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New magnetic Fe/Graphene/Pt double Rashba interface displays record spin&#8208;charge current interconversion efficiency at room temperature. The effect, which is anisotropic along the &#915;&#8208;K and &#915;&#8208;M directions, arises from the Direct and Inverse Edelstein mechanism in this new quantum epitaxial heterostructure.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for efficient data storage and processing has fueled the search for novel memory devices. By exploiting the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion phenomena, spintronics promises faster and low power solutions alternative to conventional electronics. In this work, a remarkable 34&#8208;fold increase in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge current conversion is demonstrated when incorporating a 2D epitaxial graphene monolayer between iron and platinum layers by exploring spin&#8208;pumping on&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, it is found that the spin conversion is also anisotropic. This enhancement and anisotropy is attributed to the asymmetric Rashba contributions driven by an unbalanced spin accumulation at the differently hybridized top and bottom graphene interfaces, as highlighted by ad&#8208;hoc first&#8208;principles theory. The improvement in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion as well as its anisotropy reveals the importance of interfaces in hybrid 2D&#8208;thin film systems, opening up new possibilities for engineering spin conversion in 2D materials, leading to potential advances in memory, logic applications, or unconventional&#160;computing.

A grid&#8208;like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). It enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675 Wh kg&#8722;1 in KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid&#8208;like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as&#8208;fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in redox&#8208;active electrolyte (KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro&#8208;activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox&#8208;active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application&#8208;inspired cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

         <title>Self&#8208;Manipulating Sodium Ion Gradient&#8208;Based Endogenic Electrical Stimulation Dressing for Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self&#8208;manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non&#8208;invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in&#160;ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self&#8208;manipulating sodium ion gradient&#8208;based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig&#8208;EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non&#8208;invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig&#8208;EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig&#8208;EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+&#8208;ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig&#8208;EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury&#8208;associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig&#8208;EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

         <title>Bionic Olfactory Neuron with In&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing for Intelligent Gas Recognition</title>

A material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy integrates an OFET array with in&#8208;sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) array with in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs&#8212;among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e&#8208;noses.

         <title>Restrictive Heterointerfacial Delamination in Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics Using a Bifacial Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80&#160;cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;Loaded Boron Nanoparticle for Targeted Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD&#8208;L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD&#8208;L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 inhibits intracellular PD&#8208;L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage but also maximizing T&#8208;cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B&#8208;containing polymer that self&#8208;assembled with PD&#8208;L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD&#8208;L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD&#8208;L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T&#8208;cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

Moreover, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B/siPD-L1 inhibits intracellular PD-L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT-induced DNA damage but also maximizing T-cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT-immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B-containing polymer that self-assembled with PD-L1 siRNA to form &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B/siPD-L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT-immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD-L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD-L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T-cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT-induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B/siPD-L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Biomimetic Membranes Constructed by Charge Assembly and Hydrogen Bonding for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well&#8208;ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl&#8208;binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high&#8208;affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of &#8776;140 and &#8776;40, respectively, while maintaining long&#8208;term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high&#8208;performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Rapid and Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Crystalline Imide Covalent Organic Frameworks Accelerated by Self&#8208;Generated Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low&#8208;cost self&#8208;accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent&#8208;free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self&#8208;accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent&#8208;free, vacuum&#8208;free, and low&#8208;temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self&#8208;accelerated synthesis is driven by the self&#8208;generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o&#8208;substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol&#8208;functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self&#8208;accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts of Potassium Lactate Oxidation for Hydrogen and Solid Potassium Acetate Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial&#8208;scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post&#8208;treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high&#8208;value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA&#8208;K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high&#8208;performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at 1.40&#160;V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA&#8208;K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA&#8208;K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial&#8208;scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320&#160;g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H&#8322;, yielding 1200&#160;g of AA&#8208;K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.

         <title>Neural Network&#8208;Assisted End&#8208;to&#8208;End Design for Full Light Field Control of Meta&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive system&#8208;level neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework of meta&#8208;optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non&#8208;orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing.








Abstract
Meta&#8208;optics, with unique light&#8208;matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi&#8208;parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano&#8208;structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high&#8208;performance full&#8208;light field control. Here, a neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework that facilitates global, gradient&#8208;based optimization of multifunctional meta&#8208;optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., &#8776;6 &#215; structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full&#8208;parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non&#8208;orthogonal polarizations (&gt;3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta&#8208;optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent optical technologies.

         <title>Diluted Ternary Heterojunctions to Suppress Charge Recombination for Organic Solar Cells with 21% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diluted heterojunctions are employed to increase the structure order in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabricated solar cells and polymeric diluent is found superior that the small molecular diluent, creating OSC having dual fibrils with significantly increased absorption and reduced charge recombination to realize an efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%).








Abstract
As an exitonic photovoltaic device, organic solar cells (OSCs) consist of electron donating and accepting components in their photoactive layer, in which the molecular interactions between donor and acceptor can significantly affect the nanoscale morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. In this work, by diluting electron donor with electron acceptor having opposite electrostatic potentials to promote the structural order via strengthened intermolecular interactions, this study shows that polymeric diluent is more effective due to its long&#8208;ranged conjugated backbone compared with small molecular diluent. The ternary heterojunction made of C5&#8208;16:L8&#8208;BO binary acceptors diluted with D18 shows the strongest structural order, benefiting from the strong interactions between L8&#8208;BO and C5&#8208;16. The enhanced structural order within the photoactive layer prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of the diluted p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type heterojunctions contributes to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transport, and inhibited charge recombination. As the result, OSC based on D18 (PY&#8208;IT diluted)/L8&#8208;BO:C5&#8208;16 (D18 diluted) having donor and acceptor dual fibrils obtains an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%), which is one of the highest certified PCE up to date.

         <title>Stochastically Broken Inversion Symmetry of Van der Waals Topological Insulator for Nanoscale Physically Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
vdW Janus topological insulator is presented with stochastic inversion asymmetry via penetrative single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization, which enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis, one&#8208;step process, and low&#8208;temperature condition with back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line process compatibility. Sulfur dominance and its corresponding spatial OOP domain distribution are spatially observed using piezoelectric force microscopy&#160;hysteresis mapping, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, top&#8208;view scanning electroc microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and force&#8208;distance curve mapping. This provides an extendable synthetic solution for stochastic and size&#8208;controllable challenge&#8208;response pairs generation for PUFs application, which can overcome the conventional limitations of encryption technology.








Abstract
Owing to the exotic state of quantum matter, topological insulators have emerged as a significant platform for new&#8208;generation functional devices. Among these topological insulators, tetradymites have received significant attention because of their van der Waals (vdW) structures and inversion symmetries. Although this inversion symmetry completely blocks exotic quantum phenomena, it should be broken down to facilitate versatile topological functionalities. Recently, a Janus structure is suggested for asymmetric out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice structures, terminating the heterogeneous atoms at two sides of the vdW structure. However, the synthesis of Janus structures has not been achieved commercially because of the imprecise control of the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth, high&#8208;temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, plasma sulfurization of vdW topological insulators has been presented, enabling stochastic inversion asymmetry. To take practical advantage of the random lattice distortion, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been suggested as applications of vdW Janus topological insulators. The sulfur dominance is experimentally demonstrated via X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hysteresis variation, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, and adhesion energy variation. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the vdW Janus topological insulators can provide an extendable encryption platform for randomized lattice distortion, offering on&#8208;demand stochastic inversion asymmetry via a single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr3Te4/WS2/Fe3GeTe2/WTe2 Magnetic Memory with Field&#8208;Free Switching and Low Power Consumption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance&#8208;area product by integrating chemically vapor&#8208;deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin&#8208;orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high&#8208;performance spintronics but also paves the way for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field&#8208;free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT&#8208;memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor&#8208;deposited two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non&#8208;volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect,&#160;achieving a low resistance&#8208;area product (RA) of 15.5 k&#937;&#183;&#181;m2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low&#8208;power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti&#8208;parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT&#8208;memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT&#8208;memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT&#8208;memory with PMA field&#8208;free switching.

         <title>Interfacial &#960;&#8208;Electron Cloud Extension and Charge Transfer Between Preferable Single&#8208;Crystalline Conjugated MOFs and Graphene for Ultrafast Pulse Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin&#8208;conjugated MOFs nanosheets with single&#8208;crystalline characteristics are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked MOF/graphene van der Waals heterostructure can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. This preferable stacking exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their outstanding characteristics. However, due to the strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, the preparation of high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline conjugated MOF structures continues to pose a significant challenge. The investigation of its nonlinear optical (NLO) property and application for ultrafast photonics is still rare. Herein, the ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 and Ni3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single&#8208;crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG&#8208;VHS and NiNsG&#8208;VHS) are achieved by ultrasound&#8208;assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third&#8208;order NLO polarizability of CuNsG&#8208;VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG&#8208;VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.

Herein, the ultrathin Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single-crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant-assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG-VHS and NiNsG-VHS) are achieved by ultrasound-assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior &#960;-conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third-order NLO polarizability of CuNsG-VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near-infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG-VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode-locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high-order harmonic mode-locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodamine B&#8208;Derived Low&#8208;Toxicity Full&#8208;Color Carbon Dots with Wide Tunable High&#8208;Stable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color carbon dots (FCDs) with emission wavelengths ranging from 434 to 703&#160;nm are synthesized using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the sole precursor. The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and gain performance of the FCDs are enhanced due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Tunable liquid&#8208;state laser emissions in green, yellow, red, and NIR regions are achieved with lower laser thresholds compared to RhB, demonstrating superior laser stability. Additionally, these FCDs are validated as excellent laser sources. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirmed that FCDs exhibit significantly lower toxicity and superior staining effects compared to RhB.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) serve as a novel, non&#8208;toxic, cost&#8208;effective, and highly&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable nanolaser material. However, compared to commonly used commercial laser dyes, CDs exhibit lower photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), radiation transition rates, and gain coefficients. Consequently, this leads to higher laser thresholds that significantly impede the expansion of practical applications for CDs. Therefore, enhancing the gain performance of CDs is crucial in guiding the design of CD gain materials and promoting their practical applications. Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full&#8208;color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B&#8208;CDs, G&#8208;CDs, Y&#8208;CDs, R&#8208;CDs, and NIR&#8208;CDs) fluorescence through cross&#8208;linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703&#160;nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Polarization Convolution Based on Ferroelectric&#8208;Reconfigurable Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in&#8208;sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire&#8208;induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two&#8208;order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization&#8208;based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in&#8208;sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in&#8208;sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric&#8208;reconfigurable polarization&#8208;sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in&#8208;sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non&#8208;volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road&#8208;scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

         <title>The Critical Role of Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization in Transition Metal Oxides on Vanadium&#8208;Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals for the first time the underlying mechanism of vacancies in TOMEs and uncovers the effect of atomic&#8208;scale polarization on the redox reaction mechanism through in situ Raman and operando ATR&#8208;SEIRAS. Further, the stability of cation/anion vacancies is explored in long&#8208;term cycling. The findings standardize the fundamentals governing the utility and evolution of vacancies, thereby opening new avenues for a variety of sustainable energy storage schemes.








Abstract
Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts (TMOEs) are poised to revive grid&#8208;scale all&#8208;vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and unique electronic properties, while often inescapably harboring surface vacancies. The role of local vacancy&#8208;induced physicochemical properties on vanadium&#8208;redox electrochemistry (VRE), encompassing kinetics, and stability, remains profoundly unveiled. Herein, for the first time, it is revealed that vacancies induce atomic&#8208;scale polarization in TMOEs and elucidate its mechanism in VRE. Attributable to local polarization, particularly by cation vacancy, the activated nearest&#8208;coordinated Mn sites prominently augment the adsorption competence of the V2+/V3+ couple and expedite its round&#8208;tripping by forming an intermediate *Mn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge. It is also affirmed that the anion vacancies are vulnerable to microstructure reconfiguration by feeble hydroxyl adsorption and thus performance degradation over long&#8208;term cycling, in contrast to cation vacancies. Accordingly, the VRFB employing cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;functionalized electrode delivers an energy efficiency of 80.8% and a reliable 1000&#8208;cycle lifespan with a negligible decay of 0.57% per cycle at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outclassing others. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in TMOEs, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

         <title>Regulating the Isomerization Geometry and Energy State of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric isomerization strategy is reported to modulate the electron and energy states of metal&#8208;free COF&#8208;based catalysts via introducing bithiophene units featuring diverse substitutions. The asymmetric 2,3&#8208;substitution COFs with enhanced dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution show high electrocatalytic activity, with the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms emerging as active sites.








Abstract
Embedding isomer entities onto crystalline frameworks with precisely defined spatial distributions represents a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, accurately constructing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate energy state effectively remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative geometric isomerization strategy aimed at minimizing the rotational barrier energy (&#916;E), average local ionization energy (ALIE), and Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) for ORR within COFs is proposed. Based on this strategy, isomeric Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#945; with 2,2&#8208;substitution, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#946;&#946; with 3,3&#8208;substitution, and Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with 2,3&#8208;substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with lower &#916;E between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.

Based on this strategy, isomeric &lt;b&gt;Py-COF-&#945;&#945;&lt;/b&gt; with 2,2-substitution, &lt;b&gt;Py-COF-&#946;&#946;&lt;/b&gt; with 3,3-substitution, and &lt;b&gt;Py-COF-&#945;&#946;&lt;/b&gt; with 2,3-substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, &lt;b&gt;Py-COF-&#945;&#946;&lt;/b&gt; with lower &#916;E between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half-wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal-free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non-uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic-carbon (thiophene &#946;-position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Etchless InSe Cavities Based on Bound States in the Continuum for Enhanced Exciton&#8208;Mediated Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An etchless bound&#8208;state&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum polymer cavity is designed on a 2D InSe flake, achieving an impressive photoluminescence enhancement of 218 times. The exciton&#8208;exciton scattering in InSe is intensively amplified on cavity, which is unobservable off&#8208;cavity. Second harmonic generation in InSe can also be significantly enhanced by 404 times. The etchless cavity concept can be extended to other nanostructures beyond grating.








Abstract
Recently, fervent research interest is sparked to indium selenide (&#947;&#8208;InSe) due to its dazzling optical and electronic properties. The direct bandgap in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range ensures efficient carrier recombination in InSe, promoting impressive competency for lavish NIR applications. Nevertheless, the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of InSe is significantly limited by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OP) excitons, adverse to practical devices. Herein, a facile and effective solution is proposed by introducing photonic bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum (BIC) modes to enhance excitons in InSe through strengthened exciton&#8208;photon coupling. This cavity is constructed simply by patterning a polymer grating onto the InSe flake without an etching process, achieving an impressive PL enhancement of over 200 times. By adjusting the cavity resonance wavelength, it can selectively amplify the exciton emission or the exciton&#8208;exciton scattering process, which is not observable off&#8208;cavity at room temperature. Additionally, the second harmonic generation (SHG) process in InSe can also be largely enhanced by over 400 times on the cavity. Notably, the etchless cavity design can be further extended to other nanostructures beyond grating. This research presents a feasible and efficient approach to enhancing the optical performance of OP excitons, paving a prospective avenue for advanced linear and nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Mitochondrial Transplantation via Magnetically Responsive Artificial Cells Promotes Intracerebral Hemorrhage Recovery by Supporting Microglia Immunological Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) has been developed, demonstrating the loading of mitochondria and self&#8208;enclosure processes to ensure the protection of mitochondrial transport via the bloodstream. The treatment with ACs effectively transplanted mitochondria around the lesion, thereby improving neurological recovery by supporting microglia immunological homeostasis after intracerebral hemorrhage.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro&#8208;inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain. Here, a novel strategy for mitochondrial transplantation via intravenous injection of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) are proposed. ACs can protect the loaded mitochondria and selectively accumulate around the lesion under an external magnetic field (EMF). In this study, mitochondria released from ACs can effectively improve microglial mitochondrial function, attenuate their pro&#8208;inflammatory attributes, and elevate the proportion of immunosuppressive microglia. In this way, microglia immune homeostasis in the brain is reestablished, and inflammation is attenuated, ultimately promoting functional recovery. This study presents an effective approach to transplant mitochondria into the brain, offering a promising alternative to modulate the immune&#8208;inflammatory cascade in the brain following ICH.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Boosted by Surface Hydroxyls&#8208;Modulated Hydrogen Migration over Nonreducible Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is considered to play a major role in ubiquitous technologies involving hydrogen. However, its application in Earth&#8208;abundant widely&#8208;used non&#8208;reducible oxides is severely limited by much shorter migration distances of atomic hydrogen compared to those in reducible oxides. This study presents a surface hydroxyl modulation strategy to enhance hydrogen migration over nonreducible oxides, promoting electrocatalytic hydrogenation for water purification.








Abstract
The migration of atomic hydrogen species over heterogeneous catalysts is deemed essential for hydrogenation reactions, a process closely related to the catalyst's functionalities. While surface hydroxyls&#8208;assisted hydrogen spillover is well documented on reducible oxide supports, its effect on widely&#8208;used nonreducible supports, especially in electrocatalytic reactions with water as the hydrogen source, remains a subject of debate. Herein, a nonreducible oxide&#8208;anchored copper single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu1/SiO2) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO2 can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu1/SiO2 catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu1/SiO2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen&#8208;species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Gelatin Hydrogel Scaffold with Drug Loading Remodels the Inflammatory Microenvironment to Enhance Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength exceeding 10&#160;MPa is developed, combined with rapid photocross&#8208;linking capability. This hydrogel enables the fabrication of complex and precise scaffolds through 3D printing. When loaded with roxadustat, the scaffold facilitates sustained&#8208;release therapy, effectively remodeling inflammatory microenvironments. This approach presents a promising solution for the repair of osteoporotic bone defects.









Abstract
Osteoporosis is a widespread condition that induces an inflammatory microenvironment, limiting the effectiveness of conventional therapies and presenting significant challenges for bone defect repair. To address these issues, a high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel scaffold loaded with roxadustat is developed, specifically designed to remodel the inflammatory microenvironment and enhance osteoporotic bone regeneration. By incorporating minimal methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) into an o&#8208;nitrobenzyl functionalized gelatin (GelNB) matrix, a gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength of 10&#160;MPa is achieved, providing exceptional structural stability and enabling precise scaffold fabrication through digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Validated through cell experiments and animal studies, the hydrogel scaffold supports cell adhesion and migration, offers excellent tissue compatibility, and is fully degradable, meeting the requirements of a therapeutic scaffold. Including roxadustat further enhances the scaffold's functionality by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment via hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) signaling, significantly improving bone defect repair in osteoporotic models. This drug&#8208;loaded scaffold effectively addresses inflammation&#8208;induced limitations and enhances the regenerative capacity of the affected area, paving the way for improved therapeutic outcomes in osteoporotic bone repair.

         <title>Unravelling the Atomic Structure of a Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Assembled from Ruthenium Metalloligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) are novel porous materials that exhibit the advantages of covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. However, it is extremely difficult to resolve their atomic structure and better understand their structure&#8208;properties relation. This work utilizes a synergistic combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods to unravel the atomic mapping of a photoactive ruthenium&#8208;MCOF.








Abstract
Covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs and MOFs) have shown great promise in light&#8208;driven processes mainly due to their ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;separation properties, as well as having access to a diverse range of photoactive metalloligands and organic linkers. However, both frameworks present individual drawbacks that can potentially be avoided by combining both systems (metal and covalent) to produce metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), exhibiting the advantages of both material types. Yet, due to their poor crystallinity, the understanding of the structure&#8208;properties relation of MCOFs remains unclear. Herein, we report photoactive linkers in the form of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (tpy: 2,2&#8242;,6,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine) complex which covalently binds to a luminescent pyrene core to yield a new, photoactive Schiff&#8208;base MCOF. The structure, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of this novel material have been exhaustively characterized by a wide range of microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods. This combined experimental and computational work represents a significant step toward the fundamental understanding of the photoactive units within the framework, their hierarchical arrangement and interactions with substrates, which is essential for the future design of efficient photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Magnetointeractive Cr2Te3&#8208;Coated Liquid Metal Droplets for Flexible Memory Arrays and Wearable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, nonadhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magnetointeractive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Magnetic liquid metal droplets, featured by unique fluidity, metallic conductivity, and magnetic reactivity, are of growing significance for next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. Conventional fabrication routes, which typically incorporate magnetic nanoparticles into liquid metals, otherwise encounter the pitfall pertaining to surface adhesivity and corrosivity over device modules. Here, an innovative approach of synergizing liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials is presented, accordingly creating chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8211;LM) droplets via a simple self&#8208;assembly process. The CT&#8211;LM droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, demonstrate nonadherence to various surfaces, and enable cost&#8208;effective recycling of components. The functionality of CT&#8211;LM droplets is validated through their use in magnetointeractive memory devices to enable sensing/storing 64 magnetic paths and in wearable sensors as the flexible vibrator for dynamic gesture recognition with machine learning assistance. This work opens new avenues for the functional droplet design and broadens the horizons of flexible electronics.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanoscintillators for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators (BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG) is designed and engineered to enhance X&#8208;PDT for unresectable HCC treatment. Precise tumor localization capability of SRT and effective X&#8208;ray energy absorbing and transferring capability of BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG endowing BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG&#8208;mediated X&#8208;PDT approach with significant HCC therapeutic potential. Therefore, phosphorescent HOF&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT is an ideal alternative therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) leverages penetrating X&#8208;ray to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, conventional X&#8208;PDT typically relies on heavy metal inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to produce 1O2, which presents challenges related to toxicity and energy conversion efficiency. In this study, highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent nanoscintillators based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) are designed and engineered, termed BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG, to enhance X&#8208;PDT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG functions simultaneously as both scintillator and photosensitizer, effectively absorbing and transferring X&#8208;ray energy to generate abundant 1O2. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that internalized BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG efficiently produces significant quantities of 1O2 upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Additionally, X&#8208;ray exposure directly inflicts DNA damage, and the synergistic effects of these mechanisms result in pronounced cell death and substantial tumor growth inhibition, with a significant inhibition rate of up to 90.4% in vivo assessments. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that X&#8208;PDT induces apoptosis in Hepa1&#8208;6 cells while inhibiting cell proliferation, culminating in tumor cell death. Therefore, this work highlights the considerable potential of efficient phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC, providing a highly effective alternative with negligible toxicity for patients with unresectable tumors.

         <title>Two Material Properties from One Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Photoresin Enabled by a Monochromatic Laser Integrated Stereolithographic Apparatus (Mono LISA)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single object with dual properties &#8211; degradable and non&#8208;degradable &#8211; is fabricated in a single print simply by switching the printing colors. The advanced multi&#8208;material printing is enabled by the combination of a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoresin and a monochromatic tunable laser printer, paving the way for precise multi&#8208;material differentiation within a single print.









Abstract
Multi&#8208;material printing has experienced critical advances in recent years, yet material property differentiation capabilities remain limited both with regard to the accessible properties &#8211; typically hard versus soft &#8211; and the achievable magnitude of differentiation. To enhance multi&#8208;material printing capabilities, precise photochemical control during 3D printing is essential. Wavelength&#8208;differentiation is a particularly intriguing concept yet challenging to implement. Notably, dual&#8208;wavelength printing to fabricate hard and soft sections within one object has emerged, where one curing process is insensitive to visible light, while UV irradiation inevitably activates the entire resin, limiting true spatio&#8208;temporal control of the material properties. Until now, pathway&#8208;independent wavelength&#8208;orthogonal printing has not been realized, where each wavelength exclusively triggers only one of two possible reactions, independent of the order in which the wavelengths are applied. Herein, a multi&#8208;wavelength printing technique is introduced employing a tunable laser to monochromatically deliver light to the printing platform loaded with a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal resin. Guided by photochemical action plots, two distinct wavelengths &#8211; each highly selective toward a specific photocycloaddtion reaction &#8211; are utilized to generate distinct networks within the photoresin. Ultimately, together with the printing technique, this orthogonally addressable photoresin allows fabricating multi&#8208;material objects with degradable and non&#8208;degradable properties, in a single fabrication step.

By integrating biomechanical and biochemical gradients, the hydrogel mimics native tissue architecture, directing site&#8208;specific cell differentiation. Encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946;1 nanocapsules ensure sustained release, promoting cartilage formation and subchondral bone remodeling, demonstrating its potential for regenerative medicine and targeted therapies.








Abstract
Contemporary clinical interventions for cartilage injuries focus on symptom management through pharmaceuticals and surgical procedures. Recent research has aimed at developing innovative scaffolds with biochemical elements, yet challenges like inadequate targeted delivery and reduced load&#8208;bearing capacity hinder their adoption. Inspired by the spatial gradients of biophysical and biochemical cues in native osteochondral tissues, a silk&#8208;based hydrogel that facilitates spontaneous dual&#8208;gradient formation, including mechanical gradients and growth factor gradients, for tissue regeneration, is presented. Driven by an electrical field, the hydrogel transitions from stiff to soft along the anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode direction, mimicking the anisotropic structure of natural tissues. Simultaneously, incorporated growth factors encapsulated by charged monomers migrate to the cathode region, creating another parallel gradient that enables their sustained release. This design maintains bioactivity and enhances programmable growth factor concentration in the defect environment. In a rabbit model with full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects, the dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for promoting osteochondral regeneration, offering a promising tool for clinical translation.

         <title>Toward High&#8208;Performance, Flexible, Photo&#8208;Assisted All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Screening of Solid&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes Coupled with Photoelectrochemical Storage Cathodes</title>

Highly cycle&#8208;stable photo&#8208;assisted all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries are successfully designed and constructed based on computational screening of catalytic active fillers and mechanical reinforcement from natural lignocellulose fillers, combined with the coupling mechanism of light&#8208;driven and photoelectrochemical storage. These innovations enable the flexible photo&#8208;assisted pouch battery to achieve a high discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1, while maintaining 89.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The advancement of photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable sodium&#8208;metal batteries with high energy efficiency, lightweight structure, and simplified design is crucial for the growing demand in portable electronics. However, addressing the intrinsic safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and the sluggish reaction kinetics in existing photoelectrochemical storage cathodes (PSCs) remains a significant challenge. In this work, functionalized light&#8208;driven composite solid electrolyte (CSE) fillers are systematically screened, and optimized PSC materials are employed to construct advanced photo&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal battery (PSSMB). To further enhance the mechanical properties and poly(ethylene oxide) compatibility of the CSE, natural lignocellulose is incorporated, enabling the fabrication of flexible PSSMBs. In situ tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that the light&#8208;driven electric field facilitated sodium salt dissociation, reduced interfacial resistance, and improved ionic conductivity (0.1 mS cm&#8722;1). Meanwhile, energy&#8208;level matching of the PSC maximized the utilization of photogenerated carriers, accelerating reaction kinetics and enhancing interface compatibility between the electrolyte and cathode. The resulting flexible pouch&#8208;type PSSMB demonstrates a remarkable discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 89.1% of its capacity and achieving an energy storage efficiency of 96.8% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study highlights a versatile strategy for advancing safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Acoustic Valley Filter, Valve, and Diverter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>

The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics. The implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Utilizing the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the long&#8208;desired valley devices, such as filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. The designed devices may serve as a basis for developing advanced valley&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics and offered the prospect for new devices based on valleys. However, the implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Here, by taking advantage of the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the realizations of valley devices, or filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. All the devices are configured as the structures of input and output ports bridged by channels. The phononic crystals serving as ports allow the propagation of both valley polarizations, whereas the phononic crystals serving as channels, as they are narrow, only allow the propagation of single polarizations. For valley filters that achieve valley&#8208;polarized currents, the bridge channel is simply a straight single phononic crystal, but for valley valves that can turn off the valley&#8208;polarized currents, the channel consists of two parts, allowing the propagation of opposite valley polarizations. The valley diverters have one input port, and two output ports, and thus a branched channel, and the three parts in the channel allow the propagation of the same valley polarizations, so that the energy flow can be partitioned. The results may serve as a basis for developing advanced acoustic valley devices.
