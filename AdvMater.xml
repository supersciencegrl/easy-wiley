      <title>Transparent Hole&#8208;Transporting Frameworks: A Unique Strategy to Design High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
A&#160;unique strategy of &#8220;transparent hole&#8208;transporting frameworks&#8221; is proposed. A hole&#8208;transporting large&#8208;bandgap polymer PTAA is employed to partially replace the polymer donors in the active layer. As a result, semitransparent organic photovoltaic devices with power conversion efficiencies &#8776;12% and average visible transmittances &#8776;20% are achieved both on rigid and flexible substrates.








Abstract
Thanks to the nature of molecular orbitals, the absorption spectra of organic semiconductors are not continuous like those in traditional inorganic semiconductors, which offers a unique application of organic photovoltaics (OPVs): semitransparent OPVs. Recently, the exciting progress of materials design has promoted the development of semitransparent OPVs. However, in the perspective of device engineering, almost all reported works reduce the thickness of back/reflected electrode to obtain high average visible transmittance (AVT), which is a trade&#8208;off between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the transmittance of the whole solar spectrum (visible and infrared), and therefore limit the further development. Herein, a unique strategy of &#8220;transparent hole&#8208;transporting frameworks&#8221; is proposed. A hole&#8208;transporting large&#8208;bandgap polymer (poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)) is employed to partially replace polymer donors in the active layer of PBDB&#8208;T/Y1. PTAA is a p&#8208;type polymer with a large bandgap of 2.9&#160;eV; the partial substitution of PBDB&#8208;T by PTAA reduces the absorption of the active layer only in the visible region, keeping the hole&#8208;transporting pathways as well as the optimized film morphology. As a result, semitransparent OPVs with PCEs of 12% and AVTs of 20% are achieved, both on rigid and flexible substrates. To demonstrate the generality, this strategy is also used in three different active layers.

      <title>A Quantitative Bacteria Monitoring and Killing Platform Based on Electron Transfer from Bacteria to a Semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhanced electron transfer (ET) from bacteria to a Au&#8208;modified semiconductor (Au@ZnO) is observed for fast bacteria sensing and killing with excellent extendability, stability, and recyclability. ET produces a saturation current depending linearly on the bacterial number, semi&#8208;logarithmically, and continuous electron loss swiftly kills bacteria. The concept can be incorporated into smart and miniaturized devices that sense and kill bacteria simultaneously.








Abstract
A platform with both bacteria killing and sensing capabilities is crucial for monitoring the entire bacteria&#8208;related process on biomaterials and biomedical devices. Electron transfer (ET) between the bacteria and a Au&#8208;loaded semiconductor (ZnO) is observed to be the primary factor for effective bacteria sensing and fast bacteria killing. The electrons produce a saturation current that varies linearly with the bacteria number, semi&#8208;logarithmically, with R2 of 0.98825, thus providing an excellent tool to count bacteria quantitatively in real&#8208;time. Furthermore, ET leads to continuous electron loss killing of about 80% of Escherichia coli in only 1 h without light. The modularity and extendability of this ET&#8208;based platform are also demonstrated by the excellent results obtained from other semiconductor/substrate systems and the stability is confirmed by recycling tests. The underlying mechanism for the dual functions is not due to conventional attributed Zn2+ leaching or photocatalysis but instead electrical interactions upon direct contact. The results reveal the capability of real&#8208;time detection of bacteria based on ET while providing information about the antibacterial behavior of ZnO&#8208;based materials especially in the early stage. The concept can be readily incorporated into the design of smart and miniaturized devices that can sense and kill bacteria simultaneously.

      <title>Tailoring of Typical Color Centers in Diamond for Photonics</title>
      <dc:description>
The unique electronic structure and excellent spin coherence attract the interest of many researchers to the nitrogen&#8208;vacancy color center. Although the application prospect is promising, there are still some problems to solve before fully exerting its characteristic performance. The research progress in these issues is summarized and commented on to help researchers grasp the current trends.








Abstract
On the demand of single&#8208;photon entangled light sources and high&#8208;sensitivity probes in the fields of quantum information processing, weak magnetic field detection and biosensing, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center is very attractive and has been deeply and intensively studied, due to its convenience of spin initialization, operation, and optical readout combined with long coherence time in the ambient environment. Although the application prospect is promising, there are still some problems to be solved before fully exerting its characteristic performance, including enhancement of emission of NV centers in certain charge state (NV&#8722; or NV0), obtaining indistinguishable photons, and improving of collecting efficiency for the photons. Herein, the research progress in these issues is reviewed and commented on to help researchers grasp the current trends. In addition, the development of emerging color centers, such as germanium vacancy defects, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, with great potential for various applications, are also briefly surveyed.

      <title>A Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complex as a Microtubule Probe for Correlative Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
A versatile cyclometalated iridium (III) complex is designed, which achieves super&#8208;resolution optical and electron microscopy correlation. The selective insertion of the probe into a microtubule triggers remarkable fluorescence enhancement and promising electron contrast. Correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) and energy&#8208;filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF&#8208;TEM) reveals the well&#8208;associated optical and electron signal at a high specificity, with an interspace of &#8776;41 &#197; of microtubule monomer in cells.








Abstract
The visualization of microtubules by combining optical and electron microscopy techniques provides valuable information to understand correlated intracellular activities. However, the lack of appropriate probes to bridge both microscopic resolutions restricts the areas and structures that can be comprehended within such highly assembled structures. Here, a versatile cyclometalated iridium (III) complex is designed that achieves synchronous fluorescence&#8211;electron microscopy correlation. The selective insertion of the probe into a microtubule triggers remarkable fluorescence enhancement and promising electron contrast. The long&#8208;life, highly photostable probe allows live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution imaging of tubulin localization and motion with a resolution of &#8776;30 nm. Furthermore, correlative light&#8211;electron microscopy and energy&#8208;filtered transmission electron microscopy reveal the well&#8208;associated optical and electron signal at a high specificity, with an interspace of &#8776;41 &#197; of microtubule monomer in cells.

      <title>Sequential Electrodeposition of Bifunctional Catalytically Active Structures in MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO Composite Electrocatalysts for Selective Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
A new MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO hybrid electrocatalyst is designed and synthesized via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy, which exhibits excellent activity and durability for the overall water splitting process. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate the improved hydrogen evolution performance should be mainly attributed to the Ni&#8211;NiO heterostructure, and the generated MoO3&#8211;NiO heterointerface is responsible for enhancing the oxygen evolution activity, synergistically facilitating bifunctional electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Exploring earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts is critical for further development of water electrolyzer systems. Integrating bifunctional catalytically active sites into one multi&#8208;component might greatly improve the overall water&#8208;splitting performance. In this work, amorphous NiO nanosheets coupled with ultrafine Ni and MoO3 nanoparticles (MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO), which contains two heterostructures (i.e., Ni&#8211;NiO and MoO3&#8211;NiO), is fabricated via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy. The as&#8208;synthesized MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO composite exhibits superior electrocatalytic properties, affording low overpotentials of 62 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 347 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for catalyzing the hydrogen and the oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), respectively. Moreover, the MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO hybrid enables the overall alkaline water&#8208;splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with outstanding catalytic durability, significantly outperforming the noble&#8208;metal catalysts and many materials previously reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively demonstrate the generated Ni&#8211;NiO and MoO3&#8211;NiO heterostructures significantly reduce the energetic barrier and act as catalytically active centers for selective HER and OER, synergistically accelerating the overall water&#8208;splitting process. This work helps to fundamentally understand the heterostructure&#8208;dependent mechanism, providing guidance for the rational design and oriented construction of hybrid nanomaterials for diverse catalytic processes.

     alt="Sequential Electrodeposition of Bifunctional Catalytically Active Structures in MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO Composite Electrocatalysts for Selective Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni&#8211;NiO hybrid electrocatalyst is designed and synthesized via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy, which exhibits excellent activity and durability for the overall water splitting process. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate the improved hydrogen evolution performance should be mainly attributed to the Ni&#8211;NiO heterostructure, and the generated MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;NiO heterointerface is responsible for enhancing the oxygen evolution activity, synergistically facilitating bifunctional electrocatalysis.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts is critical for further development of water electrolyzer systems. Integrating bifunctional catalytically active sites into one multi&#8208;component might greatly improve the overall water&#8208;splitting performance. In this work, amorphous NiO nanosheets coupled with ultrafine Ni and MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni&#8211;NiO), which contains two heterostructures (i.e., Ni&#8211;NiO and MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;NiO), is fabricated via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy. The as&#8208;synthesized MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni&#8211;NiO composite exhibits superior electrocatalytic properties, affording low overpotentials of 62 mV at 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 347 mV at 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for catalyzing the hydrogen and the oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), respectively. Moreover, the MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni&#8211;NiO hybrid enables the overall alkaline water&#8208;splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with outstanding catalytic durability, significantly outperforming the noble&#8208;metal catalysts and many materials previously reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively demonstrate the generated Ni&#8211;NiO and MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;NiO heterostructures significantly reduce the energetic barrier and act as catalytically active centers for selective HER and OER, synergistically accelerating the overall water&#8208;splitting process. This work helps to fundamentally understand the heterostructure&#8208;dependent mechanism, providing guidance for the rational design and oriented construction of hybrid nanomaterials for diverse catalytic processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fabrication of CdS Frame&#8208;in&#8208;Cage Particles for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles are fabricated through a two&#8208;step sulfidation approach. With the advantages of the novel hollow structure, the CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity toward H2 generation compared with CdS cubes and cages.








Abstract
The design of advanced structures for semiconductor photocatalysts is an effective approach to enhance their performance toward solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Hollow and frame&#8208;like structures show advantageous features for photocatalytic reactions with enlarged surface area, shortened charge&#8208;transfer distance, promoted light&#8208;absorption ability, and enhanced mass&#8208;transfer capability. Here, a facile two&#8208;step sulfidation strategy is developed to fabricate unique CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Cd&#8208;based Prussian blue analog (Cd&#8208;PBA) cubes are first converted to Cd&#8208;PBA cube&#8208;in&#8208;CdS cage particles, which are further transformed to CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles. Benefiting from the novel frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage structure, the obtained CdS photocatalyst exhibits high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation with the hydrogen generation rate of 13.6&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is much enhanced compared with those of the CdS cubes and cages.

      <title>Recent Progress on Topological Structures in Ferroic Thin Films and Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
The timely advance and breakthrough of topological structures (domain walls, flux&#8208;closure domains, vortices, skyrmions, etc.) in ferroic (i.e., ferroelectric, magnetic, and multiferroic) thin films and heterostructures over the past decade is demonstrated. The emergent properties and their multifield manipulations of these topological spin/polar structures hold great promise for the future energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectric and spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topological spin/polarization structures in ferroic materials continue to draw great attention as a result of their fascinating physical behaviors and promising applications in the field of high&#8208;density nonvolatile memories as well as future energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. Such developments have been made, in part, based on recent advances in theoretical calculations, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality thin films, and the characterization of their emergent phenomena and exotic phases. Herein, progress over the last decade in the study of topological structures in ferroic thin films and heterostructures is explored, including the observation of topological structures and control of their structures and emergent physical phenomena through epitaxial strain, layer thickness, electric, magnetic fields, etc. First, the evolution of topological spin structures (e.g., magnetic skyrmions) and associated functionalities (e.g., topological Hall effect) in magnetic thin films and heterostructures is discussed. Then, the exotic polar topologies (e.g., domain walls, closure domains, polar vortices, bubble domains, and polar skyrmions) and their emergent physical properties in ferroelectric oxide films and heterostructures are explored. Finally, a brief overview and prospectus of how the field may evolve in the coming years is provided.

      <dc:description>

Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made rapid progress in terms of their development as a sustainable energy source. However, record&#8208;breaking devices have not shown compatibility with large&#8208;scale production via solution processing in particular due to the use of halogenated environment&#8208;threatening solvents. Here, slot&#8208;die fabrication with processing involving hydrocarbon&#8208;based solvents is used to realize highly efficient and environmentally friendly OSCs. Highly compatible slot&#8208;die coating with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing using halogenated (chlorobenzene (CB)) and hydrocarbon solvents (1,2,4&#8208;trimethylbenzene (TMB) and ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY)) is used to fabricate photoactive films. Controlled solution and substrate temperatures enable similar aggregation states in the solution and similar kinetics processes during film formation. The optimized blend film nanostructures for different solvents in the highly efficient PM6:Y6 blend is adopted to show a similar morphology, which results in device efficiencies of 15.2%, 15.4%, and 15.6% for CB, TMB, and o&#8208;XY solvents. This approach is successfully extended to other donor&#8211;acceptor combinations to demonstrate the excellent universality of this method. The results combine a method to optimize the aggregation state and film formation kinetics with the fabrication of OSCs with environmentally friendly solvents by slot&#8208;die coating, which is a critical finding for the future development of OSCs in terms of their scalable production and high&#8208;performance.

      <dc:description>
T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. The TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors and kill cancer cells while being resistant to the pro&#8208;tumoral factors in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the TCMNPs exhibit a higher therapeutic efficacy than current cancer treatments based on immune checkpoint blockade, and they are effective for the treatment of various tumors.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapies, including adoptive T cell transfer and immune checkpoint blockades, have recently shown considerable success in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, transferred T cells often become exhausted because of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint blockades, in contrast, can reinvigorate the exhausted T cells; however, the therapeutic efficacy is modest in 70&#8211;80% of patients. To address some of the challenges faced by the current cancer treatments, here T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. Similar to cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors via T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;originated proteins and kill cancer cells by releasing anticancer molecules and inducing Fas&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Unlike cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs are resistant to immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1)) and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) of cancer cells by scavenging TGF&#8208;&#946;1 and PD&#8208;L1. Indeed, TCMNPs exhibit higher therapeutic efficacy than an immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma treatment. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;tumoral actions of TCMNPs are also demonstrated in the treatment of lung cancer in an antigen&#8208;nonspecific manner. Taken together, TCMNPs have a potential to improve the current cancer immunotherapy.

All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are considered as the next generation electrochemical energy storage devices because of their high safety and energy density, simple packaging, and wide operable temperature range. The critical component in ASSLBs is the solid&#8208;state electrolyte. Among all solid&#8208;state electrolytes, the sulfide electrolytes have the highest ionic conductivity and favorable interface compatibility with sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. The ionic conductivity of sulfide electrolytes is comparable with or even higher than that of the commercial organic liquid electrolytes. However, several critical challenges for sulfide electrolytes still remain to be solved, including their narrow electrochemical stability window, the unstable interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes, as well as lithium dendrite formation in the electrolytes. Herein, the emerging sulfide electrolytes and preparation methods are reviewed. In particular, the required properties of the sulfide electrolytes, such as the electrochemical stabilities of the electrolytes and the compatible electrode/electrolyte interfaces are highlighted. The opportunities for sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs are also discussed.

      <title>Electron Beam Lithography of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <dc:description>
A new, yet general, approach to the &#8220;printing&#8221; of skyrmions with zero&#8208;field stability in arbitrary patterns is demonstrated. By exploiting the thermal reconfigurability of an antiferromagnet, skyrmion lithography can be achieved by writing with a focused electron beam. The work on skyrmion printing will enable the exploration of topological magnetism.








Abstract
The emergence of magnetic skyrmions, topological spin textures, has aroused tremendous interest in studying the rich physics related to their topology. While skyrmions promise high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory devices for information technology, the manifestation of their nontrivial topology through single skyrmions and ordered and disordered skyrmion lattices could also give rise to many fascinating physical phenomena, such as chiral magnon and skyrmion glass states. Therefore, generating skyrmions at designated locations on a large scale, while controlling the skyrmion patterns, is the key to advancing topological magnetism. Here, a new, yet general, approach to the &#8220;printing&#8221; of skyrmions with zero&#8208;field stability in arbitrary patterns on a massive scale in exchange&#8208;biased magnetic multilayers is presented. By exploiting the fact that the antiferromagnetic order can be reconfigured by local thermal excitations, a focused electron beam with a graphic pattern generator to &#8220;print&#8221; skyrmions is used, which is referred to as skyrmion lithography. This work provides a route to design arbitrary skyrmion patterns, thereby establishing the foundation for further exploration of topological magnetism.

      <title>Orientation&#8208;Dependent Host&#8211;Dopant Interactions for Manipulating Charge Transport in Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface doping of a conjugated polymer is drastically modulated by molecular orientation. Face&#8208;on orientation presents more reaction sites for dopant/host interactions, leading to effective charge trap filling facilitated by efficient vertical transport down to conductive channel. Hole mobility increases by fivefold to 3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in the face&#8208;on case, compared to a minimal change in the edge&#8208;on case.








Abstract
Molecular orientation plays a critical role in controlling carrier transport in organic semiconductors (OSCs). However, this aspect has not been explored for surface doping of OSC thin films. The challenge lies in lack of methods to precisely modulate relative molecular orientation between the dopant and the OSC host. Here, the impact of molecular orientation on dopant&#8211;host electronic interactions by large modulation of conjugated polymer orientation via solution coating is reported. Combining synchrotron&#8208;radiation X&#8208;ray measurements with spectroscopic and electrical characterizations, a quantitative correlation between doping&#8208;enhanced charge carrier mobility and the Herman's orientation parameter is presented. This direct correlation can be attributed to enhanced charge&#8208;transfer interactions at host/dopant interface with increasing face&#8208;on orientation of the polymer. These results demonstrate that the surface doping effect can be fundamentally manipulated by controlling the molecular orientation of the OSC layer, enabling optimization of carrier transport.

      <title>A Machine&#8208;Fabricated 3D Honeycomb&#8208;Structured Flame&#8208;Retardant Triboelectric Fabric for Fire Escape and Rescue</title>
      <dc:description>
A multifunctional 3D honeycomb&#8208;structure fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (3D F&#8208;TENG) is fabricated from yarn to fabric by scalable and continuous textile fabrication technology. The 3D F&#8208;TENG can be used as a smart indoor carpet, which has functions of flame retardancy, noise reduction, precise rescue location, and real&#8208;time route guidance under fire conditions.








Abstract
Fire disaster is one of the most common hazards that threaten public safety and social development: how to improve the fire escape and rescue capacity remains a huge challenge. Here, a 3D honeycomb&#8208;structured woven fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) based on a flame&#8208;retardant wrapping yarn is developed. The wrapping yarn is fabricated through a continuous hollow spindle fancy twister technology, which is compatible with traditional textile production processes. The resulting 3D F&#8208;TENG can be used in smart carpets as a self&#8208;powered escape and rescue system that can precisely locate the survivor position and point out the escape route to timely assist victim search and rescuing. As interior decoration, the unique design of the honeycomb weaving structure endows the F&#8208;TENG fabric with an excellent noise&#8208;reduction ability. In addition, combining with its good machine washability, air permeability, flame&#8208;retardency, durability, and repeatability features, the 3D F&#8208;TENG may have great potential applications in fire rescue and wearable sensors as well as smart home decoration.

      <title>Atomically Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride and Its Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride is superior for application in van der Waals optoelectronics and electronics. Recent achievements in the synthesis of large&#8208;scale, single&#8208;crystal h&#8208;BN film and its heterostructures via chemical vapor deposition are summarized and the growth kinetics are discussed, emphasizing that the specific orientation of the heterostructure constituents can introduce novel properties. Typical applications in electronics and optoelectronics are summarized.








Abstract
Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is an emerging star of 2D materials. It is taken as an optimal substrate for other 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices owing to its atomical flatness, absence of dangling bonds, and excellent stability. Specifically, h&#8208;BN is found to be a natural hyperbolic material in the mid&#8208;infrared range, as well as a piezoelectric material. All the unique properties are beneficial for novel applications in optoelectronics and electronics. Currently, most of these applications are merely based on exfoliated h&#8208;BN flakes at their proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stages. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is considered as the most promising approach for producing large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality, atomically thin h&#8208;BN films and heterostructures. Herein, CVD synthesis of atomically thin h&#8208;BN is the focus. Also, the growth kinetics are systematically investigated to point out general strategies for controllable and scalable preparation of single&#8208;crystal h&#8208;BN film. Meanwhile, epitaxial growth of 2D materials onto h&#8208;BN and at its edge to construct heterostructures is summarized, emphasizing that the specific orientation of constituent parts in heterostructures can introduce novel properties. Finally, recent applications of atomically thin h&#8208;BN and its heterostructures in optoelectronics and electronics are summarized.

      <title>Proximity&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Induced Significant Enhancement of Coercive Field and Curie Temperature in 2D van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Significant enhancements of Curie temperature (TC) and coercive field (HC) are achieved in ultrathin Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) flakes by using the proximity effect been FGT and FePS3 (FPS). The TC is improved by more than 30 K and the HC is increased by &#8776;100%, which makes 2D FPS/FGT heterostructures promising candidates for applications in magnetic sensors and storage devices.








Abstract
Magnetism in 2D has long been the focus of condensed matter physics due to its important applications in spintronic devices. A particularly promising aspect of 2D magnetism is the ability to fabricate 2D heterostructures with engineered optical, electrical, and quantum properties. Recently, the discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetisms in atomic thick materials has provided a new platform for investigations of fundamental magnetic physics. In contrast to 2D CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 insulators, itinerant ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), which has a larger intrinsic perpendicular anisotropy, higher Curie temperature (TC), and relatively better stability, is a promising candidate for achieving permanent room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism through interface or component engineering. Here, it is shown that the ferromagnetic properties of FGT thin flakes can be modulated through coupling with a FePS3. The magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect results show that the TC of FGT is improved by more than 30 K and that the coercive field is increased by &#8776;100% due to the proximity coupling effect, which changes the spin textures of FGT at the interface. This work reveals that antiferromagnet/ferromagnet coupling is a promising way to engineer the magnetic properties of itinerant 2D ferromagnets, which paves the way for applications in advanced magnetic spintronic and memory devices.

      <title>Enantiomeric MOF Crystals Using Helical Channels as Palettes with Bright White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Achiral&#8208;aggregation&#8208;caused quenching fluorophores are helically arranged in the chiral channels of enantiomeric metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for color&#8208;tunable and bright white circularly polarized luminescence (photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), &#8776;33%). The experimental results indicate that the helical arrangement is superior to the ET process in the amplification of glum. Also, the MOF&#8208;based composites are assembled into a bright white circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diode (PLQY, &#8776;30%).








Abstract
The host&#8211;guest chemistry of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has enabled the derivation of numerous new functionalities. However, intrinsically chiral MOFs (CMOFs) with helical channels have not been used to realize crystalline circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Herein, enantiomeric pairs of MOF crystals are reported, where achiral fluorophores adhere to the inner surface of helical channels via biology&#8208;like H&#8208;bonds and hence inherit the helicity of the host MOFs, eventually amplifying the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of the host l/d&#8208;CMOF (&#177;1.50 &#215; 10&#8722;3) to a maximum of &#177;0.0115 for the composite l/d&#8208;CMOF&#8835;fluorophores. l/d&#8208;CMOF&#8835;fluorophores in pairs generate bright color&#8208;tunable CPL and almost ideal white CPL (0.33, 0.32) with a record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;30%, which are further assembled into a white circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diode. The present strategy opens a new avenue for propagating the chirality of MOFs to realize universal chiroptical materials.

      <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Fully Green Triboelectric Nanogenerators with Output Power Density of 300 W m&#8722;2</title>
      <dc:description>
Fully green triboelectric nanogenerators (FG&#8208;TENGs) are made with cellulose materials and graphite electrodes that have output power density of up to 300 W m&#8722;2. The mechanism behind the high output is the high density of the regenerated cellulose that eliminates the influence of moisture. Such a high output density is on the same order of magnitude as that obtained with fluoropolymers.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted increasing attention because of their excellent energy conversion efficiency, the diverse choice of materials, and their broad applications in energy harvesting devices and self&#8208;powered sensors. New materials have been explored, including green materials, but their performances have not yet reached the level of that for fluoropolymers. Here, a high&#8208;performance, fully green TENG (FG&#8208;TENG) using cellulose&#8208;based tribolayers is reported. It is shown that the FG&#8208;TENG has an output power density of above 300 W m&#8722;2, which is a new record for green&#8208;material&#8208;based TENGs. The high performance of the FG&#8208;TENG is due to the high positive charge density of the regenerated cellulose. The FG&#8208;TENG is stable after more than 30 000 cycles of operations in humidity of 30%&#8211;84%. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;performance TENGs can be made using natural green materials for a broad range of applications.

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Activated Size&#8208;Enlargeable Bioinspired Lipoproteins Access Cancer Cells in Tumor to Elicit Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Responses</title>
      <dc:description>
The use of immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agents has potential to potentiate antitumor immune responses and remodel the immunosuppression in tumor, but is tremendously hampered by the poor delivery efficiency. A tumor&#8208;activated size&#8208;enlargeable bioinspired lipoprotein of oxaliplatin prodrug (TA&#8208;OBL) with efficient cancer cell accessibility is designed to boost the ICD&#8208;induced antitumor immunity for synergizing immune&#8208;checkpoint&#8208;blockades&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The limited lymphocytes infiltration and immunosuppression in tumor are the major challenges of cancer immunotherapy. The use of immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agents has potential to potentiate antitumor immune responses, but is tremendously hampered by the poor delivery efficiency. Herein, a tumor&#8208;activated size&#8208;enlargeable bioinspired lipoprotein of oxaliplatin (TA&#8208;OBL) is designed to access cancer cells and boost the ICD&#8208;induced antitumor immunity for synergizing immune&#8208;checkpoint blockades (ICBs)&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. TA&#8208;OBL is constructed by integrating a legumain&#8208;sensitive melittin conjugate for improving intratumoral permeation and cancer cell accessibility, a pH&#8208;sensitive phospholipid for triggering size&#8208;enlargement and drug release in intracellular acidic environments, a nitroreductase&#8208;sensitive hydrophobic oxaliplatin prodrug (N&#8208;OXP) for eliciting antitumor immunity into the bioinspired nano&#8208;sized lipoprotein system. TA&#8208;OBL treatment produced robust antitumor immune responses and its combination with ICBs demonstrates strong therapeutic benefits with delayed tumor growth and extended survival rate, making it a promising delivery nanoplatform to elicit antitumor immunity for cancer immunotherapy.

A facile graphene quantum dots (GQDs)&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly method is developed to achieve centimeter&#8208;sized growth of monolayer organic crystals on a solution interface. The spreading area of organic solvent is greatly enhanced by tuning the pH value of the GQDs solution.

Abstract
Monolayer organic crystals have attracted considerable attention due to their extraordinary optoelectronic properties. Solution self&#8208;assembly on the surface of water is an effective approach to fabricate monolayer organic crystals. However, due to the difficulties in controlling the spreading of organic solution on the water surface and the weak intermolecular interaction between the organic molecules, large&#8208;area growth of monolayer organic crystals remains a great challenge. Here, a graphene quantum dots (GQDs)&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly method for centimeter&#8208;sized growth of monolayer organic crystals on a GQDs solution surface is reported. The spreading area of the organic solution can be readily controlled by tuning the pH value of the GQDs solution. Meanwhile, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction between the GQDs and the organic molecules can effectively reduce the nucleation energy of the organic molecules and afford a cohesive force to bond the crystals, enabling large&#8208;area growth of monolayer organic crystals. Using 2,7&#8208;didecyl benzothienobenzothiopene (C10&#8208;BTBT) as an examples, centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer C10&#8208;BTBT crystal with uniform molecular packing and crystal orientation is attained. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the monolayer C10&#8208;BTBT crystals exhibit a high mobility up to 2.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, representing the highest mobility value for solution&#8208;assembled monolayer organic crystals.

      <title>Chirality Transfer from Sub&#8208;Nanometer Biochemical Molecules to Sub&#8208;Micrometer Plasmonic Metastructures: Physiochemical Mechanisms, Biosensing, and Bioimaging Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular chirality lies at the heart of bioscience and biomedicine. Conventional methods for characterizing molecular chirality require high&#8208;concentration specimens due to their weak chiroptical response. To overcome this inherent limitation, three strategies that can transfer and amplify chirality information from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer plasmonic metastructures are reviewed. Their biosensing and bioimaging applications, present challenges, and future developments are discussed.








Abstract
Determining the structural chirality of biomolecules is of vital importance in bioscience and biomedicine. Conventional methods for characterizing molecular chirality, e.g., circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, require high&#8208;concentration specimens due to the weak electronic CD signals of biomolecules such as amino acids. Artificially designed chiral plasmonic metastructures exhibit strong intrinsic chirality. However, the significant size mismatch between metastructures and biomolecules makes the former unsuitable for chirality&#8208;recognition&#8208;based molecular discrimination. Fortunately, constructing metallic architectures through molecular self&#8208;assembly allows chirality transfer from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer, intrinsically achiral plasmonic metastructures by means of either near&#8208;field interaction or chirality inheritance, resulting in hybrid systems with CD signals orders of magnitude larger than that of pristine biomolecules. This exotic property provides a new means to determine molecular chirality at extremely low concentrations (ideally at the single&#8208;molecule level). Herein, three strategies of chirality transfer from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer metallic metastructures are analyzed. The physiochemical mechanisms responsible for chirality transfer are elaborated and new fascinating opportunities for employing plasmonic metastructures in chirality&#8208;based biosensing and bioimaging are outlined.

     alt="Chirality Transfer from Sub&#8208;Nanometer Biochemical Molecules to Sub&#8208;Micrometer Plasmonic Metastructures: Physiochemical Mechanisms, Biosensing, and Bioimaging Opportunities"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular chirality lies at the heart of bioscience and biomedicine. Conventional methods for characterizing molecular chirality require high&#8208;concentration specimens due to their weak chiroptical response. To overcome this inherent limitation, three strategies that can transfer and amplify chirality information from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer plasmonic metastructures are reviewed. Their biosensing and bioimaging applications, present challenges, and future developments are discussed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining the structural chirality of biomolecules is of vital importance in bioscience and biomedicine. Conventional methods for characterizing molecular chirality, e.g., circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, require high&#8208;concentration specimens due to the weak electronic CD signals of biomolecules such as amino acids. Artificially designed chiral plasmonic metastructures exhibit strong intrinsic chirality. However, the significant size mismatch between metastructures and biomolecules makes the former unsuitable for chirality&#8208;recognition&#8208;based molecular discrimination. Fortunately, constructing metallic architectures through molecular self&#8208;assembly allows chirality transfer from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer, intrinsically achiral plasmonic metastructures by means of either near&#8208;field interaction or chirality inheritance, resulting in hybrid systems with CD signals orders of magnitude larger than that of pristine biomolecules. This exotic property provides a new means to determine molecular chirality at extremely low concentrations (ideally at the single&#8208;molecule level). Herein, three strategies of chirality transfer from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer metallic metastructures are analyzed. The physiochemical mechanisms responsible for chirality transfer are elaborated and new fascinating opportunities for employing plasmonic metastructures in chirality&#8208;based biosensing and bioimaging are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Desolvation&#8208;Triggered Versatile Transfer&#8208;Printing of Pure BN Films with Thermal&#8211;Optical Dual Functionality</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile approach to print a pure boron nitride (BN) film with both high thermal conductivity (&#8776;167 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and optical transparency (&#8776;90%) on various substrates is developed based on desolvation&#8208;induced adhesion switching. This approach allows near&#8208;perfect transfer yield (&#8776;100%) while ensuring good interfacial contact, realizing the full potential of the thermal and optical properties of BN for practical devices.








Abstract
Although hexagonal boron nitride (BN) nanostructures have recently received significant attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties, their applications have been limited by a lack of processability and poor film quality. In this study, a versatile method to transfer&#8208;print high&#8208;quality BN films composed of densely stacked BN nanosheets based on a desolvation&#8208;induced adhesion switching (DIAS) mechanism is developed. It is shown that edge functionalization of BN sheets and rational selection of membrane surface energy combined with systematic control of solvation and desolvation status enable extensive tunability of interfacial interactions at BN&#8211;BN, BN&#8211;membrane, and BN&#8211;substrate boundaries. Therefore, without incorporating any additives in the BN film and applying any surface treatment on target substrates, DIAS achieves a near 100% transfer yield of pure BN films on diverse substrates, including substrates containing significant surface irregularities. The printed BNs demonstrate high optical transparency (&gt;90%) and excellent thermal conductivity (&gt;167 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) for few&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thick films due to their dense and well&#8208;ordered microstructures. In addition to outstanding heat dissipation capability, substantial optical enhancement effects are confirmed for light&#8208;emitting, photoluminescent, and photovoltaic devices, demonstrating their remarkable promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic device platforms.

      <title>A Non&#8208;Invasive Nanoprobe for In Vivo Photoacoustic Imaging of Vulnerable Atherosclerotic Plaque</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct identification of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque at the molecular level is critical to prevent cardiovascular death. OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes with excellent PA performance well realize the non&#8208;invasive in vivo imaging of vulnerable plaque through the targeted recognition of OPN&#8208;overexpressed foam cells that are the main ingredients of vulnerable plaque, significantly advancing the innovation of cardiovascular disease diagnosis technology.








Abstract
Vulnerable atherosclerotic (AS) plaque is the major cause of cardiovascular death. However, clinical methods cannot directly identify the vulnerable AS plaque at molecule level. Herein, osteopontin antibody (OPN Ab) and NIR fluorescence molecules of ICG co&#8208;assembled Ti3C2 nanosheets are reported as an advanced nanoprobe (OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG) with enhanced photoacoustic (PA) performance for direct and non&#8208;invasive in vivo visual imaging of vulnerable AS plaque. The designed OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes successfully realize obvious NIR fluorescence imaging toward foam cells as well as the vulnerable AS plaque slices. After intravenous injection of OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes into AS model mice, in vivo imaging results show a significantly enhanced PA signal in the aortic arch accumulated with vulnerable plaque, well indicating the remarkable feasibility of OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes to distinguish the vulnerable AS plaque. The proposed OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes not only overcome the clinical difficulty to differentiate vulnerable plaque, but also achieve the non&#8208;invasively specific in vivo imaging of vulnerable AS plaque at molecule level, greatly promoting the innovation of cardiovascular diagnosis technology.

      <title>A High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Manganese&#8211;Metal Hydride Hybrid Battery</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy aqueous manganese&#8211;metal hydride battery is developed based on Mn2+/MnO2 two&#8208;electron reactions at the cathode and on hydrogen absorption/desorption reactions at the anode. This new aqueous hybrid battery can achieve a high operating voltage of about 2.2 V and an impressive energy density of about 240 Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries show great application prospects in large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their reliable safety and low cost. However, a key challenge in developing this battery system lies in its low energy density. Herein, a high&#8208;energy manganese&#8211;metal hydride (Mn&#8211;MH) hybrid battery is reported in which a Mn&#8208;based cathode operated by the Mn2+/MnO2 deposition&#8211;dissolution reactions, a hydrogen&#8208;storage alloy anode that absorbs and desorbs hydrogen in an alkaline solution, and a proton&#8208;exchange membrane separator are employed. Given the benefit derived from the high solubility and high specific capacity of the Lewis acidic MnCl2 in the cathode and the low electrode potential of the MH anode, this aqueous Mn&#8211;MH hybrid battery exhibits impressive electrochemical properties with admirable discharge voltage plateaus up to 2.2 V, a competitive energy density of about 240 Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the total mass of the 5.5 m MnCl2 solution and the hydrogen storage alloy electrode system), good cycling stability over 130 cycles, and a desirable rate capability. This work demonstrates a new strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost aqueous rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Embedded Nickel&#8208;Mesh Transparent Electrodes for Highly Efficient and Mechanically Stable Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics: Toward a Portable Mobile Energy Source</title>
      <dc:description>
Research on flexible mobile energy&#8208;supply devices will promote the development of the Internet of Things. An embedded metal nickel (Ni)&#8208;mesh transparent conductive electrode is used as a flexible substrate for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These Ni&#8208;mesh&#8208;based PSCs exhibit excellent electric properties and remarkable environmental and mechanical stability.








Abstract
The rapid development of Internet of Things mobile terminals has accelerated the market's demand for portable mobile power supplies and flexible wearable devices. Here, an embedded metal&#8208;mesh transparent conductive electrode (TCE) is prepared on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using a novel selective electrodeposition process combined with inverted film&#8208;processing methods. This embedded nickel (Ni)&#8208;mesh flexible TCE shows excellent photoelectric performance (sheet resistance of &#8776;0.2&#8211;0.5 &#937; sq&#8722;1 at high transmittance of &#8776;85&#8211;87%) and mechanical durability. The PET/Ni&#8208;mesh/polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS PH1000) hybrid electrode is used as a transparent electrode for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which exhibit excellent electric properties and remarkable environmental and mechanical stability. A power conversion efficiency of 17.3% is obtained, which is the highest efficiency for a PSC based on flexible transparent metal electrodes to date. For perovskite crystals that require harsh growth conditions, their mechanical stability and environmental stability on flexible transparent embedded metal substrates are studied and improved. The resulting flexible device retains 76% of the original efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. The results of this work provide a step improvement in flexible PSCs.

      <title>Time&#8208;Gated FRET Nanoprobes for Autofluorescence&#8208;Free Long&#8208;Term In Vivo Imaging of Developing Zebrafish</title>
      <dc:description>
A bright and photostable terbium&#8208;to&#8208;quantum dot F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanoprobe for autofluorescence&#8208;free in vivo imaging is described. These nanoprobes enable intracellular four&#8208;color multiplexing with a single excitation wavelength and in situ assembly to fluorescent proteins. They can be imaged in developing zebrafish embryos over seven days with low toxicity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios.








Abstract
The zebrafish is an important vertebrate model for disease, drug discovery, toxicity, embryogenesis, and neuroscience. In vivo fluorescence microscopy can reveal cellular and subcellular details down to the molecular level with fluorescent proteins (FPs) currently the main tool for zebrafish imaging. However, long maturation times, low brightness, photobleaching, broad emission spectra, and sample autofluorescence are disadvantages that cannot be easily overcome by FPs. Here, a bright and photostable terbium&#8208;to&#8208;quantum dot (QD) F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanoprobe with narrow and tunable emission bands for intracellular in vivo imaging is presented. The long photoluminescence (PL) lifetime enables time&#8208;gated (TG) detection without autofluorescence background. Intracellular four&#8208;color multiplexing with a single excitation wavelength and in situ assembly and FRET to mCherry demonstrate the versatility of the TG&#8208;FRET nanoprobes and the possibility of in vivo bioconjugation to FPs and combined nanoprobe&#8208;FP FRET sensing. Upon injection at the one&#8208;cell stage, FRET nanoprobes can be imaged in developing zebrafish embryos over seven days with toxicity similar to injected RNA and strongly improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios compared to non&#8208;TG imaging. This work provides a strategy for advancing in vivo fluorescence imaging applications beyond the capabilities of FPs.

      <title>Enabling High&#8208;Performance Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cells by Balancing the Front and Rear Subcells</title>
      <dc:description>
In tandem organic photovoltaics, most ultraviolet&#8211;visible photons are absorbed by the front sub&#8208;cell, so in the rear sub&#8208;cell, excitons generated on large&#8208;bandgap donors will be reduced significantly. This reduces the conductivity and limits the hole&#8208;transporting property of the rear sub&#8208;cell. An infrared&#8208;absorbing polymer donor is introduced, which provides a second hole&#8208;generation/transporting mechanism to minimize the aforementioned detrimental effects.








Abstract
In tandem organic photovoltaics, the front subcell is based on large&#8208;bandgap materials, whereas the case of the rear subcell is more complicated. The rear subcell is generally composed of a narrow&#8208;bandgap acceptor for infrared absorption but a large&#8208;bandgap donor to realize a high open&#8208;circuit voltage. Unfortunately, most of the ultraviolet&#8211;visible part of the photons are absorbed by the front subcell; as a result, in the rear subcell, the number of excitons generated on large&#8208;bandgap donors will be reduced significantly. This reduces the (photo) conductivity and finally limits the hole&#8208;transporting property of the rear subcell. In this work, a simple and effective way is proposed to resolve this critical issue. To ensure sufficient photogenerated holes in the rear subcell, a small amount of an infrared&#8208;absorbing polymer donor as a third component is introduced, which provides a second hole&#8208;generation and transporting mechanism to minimize the aforementioned detrimental effects. Finally, the short&#8208;circuit current density of the two&#8208;terminal tandem organic photovoltaic is significantly enhanced from 10.3 to 11.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (while retaining the open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor) to result in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.1%.

      <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Multifunctional Ionic Sieve Membrane for Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodide Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Space&#8208;resolution Raman and micro&#8208;IR spectroscopies have originally revealed the negative influence of water and iodine species to zinc anode. Here, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is adopted to concurrently suppress shuttling of triiodide and regulate electrolyte solvation. Benefited from MOF membrane, aqueous zinc&#8211;iodide battery achieves long&#8208;life (&gt;6000 cycles), high capacity retention (84.6%), and high reversibility (Coulombic efficiency: 99.65%).








Abstract
The introduction of the redox couple of triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) into aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries is a promising energy&#8208;storage resource owing to its safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, the limited lifespan of zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries is currently far from satisfactory owing to the uncontrolled shuttling of triiodide and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions on the Zn anode. Herein, space&#8208;resolution Raman and micro&#8208;IR spectroscopies reveal that the Zn anode suffers from corrosion induced by both water and iodine species. Then, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is exploited as an ionic sieve membrane to simultaneously resolve these problems for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. The multifunctional MOF membrane, first, suppresses the shuttling of I3&#8722; and restrains related parasitic side&#8208;reaction on the Zn anode. Furthermore, by regulating the electrolyte solvation structure, the MOF channels construct a unique electrolyte structure (more aggregative ion associations than in saturated electrolyte). With the concurrent improvement on both the iodine cathode and the Zn anode, Zn&#8211;I2 batteries achieve an ultralong lifespan (&gt;6000 cycles), high capacity retention (84.6%), and high reversibility (Coulombic efficiency: 99.65%). This work not only systematically reveals the parasitic influence of free water and iodine species to the Zn anode, but also provides an efficient strategy to develop long&#8208;life aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

Abstract
Wood&#8208;derived cellulose materials obtained by structure&#8208;retaining delignification are attracting increasing attention due to their excellent mechanical properties and great potential to serve as renewable and CO2 storing cellulose scaffolds for advanced hybrid materials with embedded functionality. Various delignification protocols and a multitude of further processing steps including polymer impregnation and densification are applied resulting in a large range of properties. However, treatment optimization requires a more comprehensive characterization of the developed materials in terms of structure, chemical composition, and mechanical properties for faster progress in the field. Herein, the current protocols for structure&#8208;retaining delignification are reviewed and the emphasis is placed on the mechanical characterization at different hierarchical levels of the cellulose scaffolds by experiments and modeling to reveal the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships.

Abstract
Nanocelluloses (i.e., bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanocrystals, and cellulose nanofibrils) are cellulose&#8208;based materials with at least one dimension in the nanoscale. These materials have unique and useful properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsion and latex systems. Herein, the use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymers is reviewed, including dispersion, suspension, and emulsion polymerization. Comprehensive tables describe past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives and the properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted. Even at low loadings, nanocellulose offers an unprecedented level of control as a property modifier for a range of emulsion and polymer applications, influencing, for example, emulsion type, stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. Nanocellulose can tune polymer particle properties such as size, surface charge, and morphology, or be used to produce capsules and polymer nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical, thermal, and adhesive properties. The role of nanocellulose is discussed, and a perspective for future direction is presented.

      <title>Better, Faster, and Less Biased Machine Learning: Electromechanical Switching in Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
A fast, easily implementable approach to improve the interpretability of machine&#8208;learning analyses in materials science is demonstrated. Systematic application of techniques and parameter selection curtails the influence of overinterpretation, reduces user bias, and ultimately improves the quality of such studies. Previously identified exotic phenomena in ferroelectric films can be thus well described by classic ferroelectric and non&#8208;ferroelectric phenomena.








Abstract
Machine&#8208;learning techniques are more and more often applied to the analysis of complex behaviors in materials research. Frequently used to identify fundamental behaviors within large and multidimensional datasets, these techniques are strictly based on mathematical models. Thus, without inherent physical or chemical meaning or constraints, they are prone to biased interpretation. The interpretability of machine&#8208;learning results in materials science, specifically materials&#8217; functionalities, can be vastly improved through physical insights and careful data handling.

     alt="Better, Faster, and Less Biased Machine Learning: Electromechanical Switching in Ferroelectric Thin Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fast, easily implementable approach to improve the interpretability of machine&#8208;learning analyses in materials science is demonstrated. Systematic application of techniques and parameter selection curtails the influence of overinterpretation, reduces user bias, and ultimately improves the quality of such studies. Previously identified exotic phenomena in ferroelectric films can be thus well described by classic ferroelectric and non&#8208;ferroelectric phenomena.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine&#8208;learning techniques are more and more often applied to the analysis of complex behaviors in materials research. Frequently used to identify fundamental behaviors within large and multidimensional datasets, these techniques are strictly based on mathematical models. Thus, without inherent physical or chemical meaning or constraints, they are prone to biased interpretation. The interpretability of machine&#8208;learning results in materials science, specifically materials&#8217; functionalities, can be vastly improved through physical insights and careful data handling. The use of techniques such as dimensional stacking can provide the much needed physical and chemical constraints, while proper understanding of the assumptions imposed by model parameters can help avoid overinterpretation. These concepts are illustrated by application to recently reported ferroelectric switching experiments in PbZr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin films. Through systematic analysis and introduction of physical constraints, it is argued that the behaviors present are not necessarily due to exotic mechanisms previously suggested, but rather well described by classical ferroelectric switching superimposed by non&#8208;ferroelectric phenomena, such as electrochemical deformation, electrostatic interactions, and/or charge injection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facile Morphological Qualification of Transferred Graphene by Phase&#8208;Shifting Interferometry</title>
      <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;shifting interferometry (PSI) is successfully demonstrated as a non&#8208;destructive, fast, accurate, and reproducible imaging tool to measure the morphological quality of transferred graphene, compared to conventional imaging tools. Very fine structures, such as graphene wrinkles, various polymer residues on graphene, and tear&#237;ng/opening of graphene can be successfully visualized using PSI in a one&#8208;shot measurement within few seconds.








Abstract
Post&#8208;growth graphene transfer to a variety of host substrates for circuitry fabrication has been among the most popular subjects since its successful development via chemical vapor deposition in the past decade. Fast and reliable evaluation tools for its morphological characteristics are essential for the development of defect&#8208;free transfer protocols. The implementation of conventional techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy in production quality control at an industrial scale is difficult because they are limited to local areas, are time consuming, and their operation is complex. However, through a one&#8208;shot measurement within a few seconds, phase&#8208;shifting interferometry (PSI) successfully scans &#8776;1 mm2 of transferred graphene with a vertical resolution of &#8776;0.1&#160;nm. This provides crucial morphological information, such as the surface roughness derived from polymer residues, the thickness of the graphene, and its adhesive strength with respect to the target substrates. Graphene samples transferred via four different methods are evaluated using PSI, Raman spectroscopy, and AFM. Although the thickness of the nanomaterials measured by PSI can be highly sensitive to their refractive indices, PSI is successfully demonstrated to be a powerful tool for investigating the morphological characteristics of the transferred graphene for industrial and research purposes.

      <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Diacetylene Amphiphiles: Strike a Lighter and Wear Polaroid Glasses to Decipher the Secret Code</title>
      <dc:description>
Information is encrypted into a secret code with imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylene secret inks that respond to heat as well as polarization. The secret code can be deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and holding a flashlight.








Abstract
The development of smart inks that change color and transparency in response to external stimuli is very important for various fields, from modern art to safety and anticounterfeiting technology. A uniaxially oriented diacetylene thin film on a macroscopic area is obtained by coating, self&#8208;assembling and topochemical photopolymerizing of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes (M&#8208;DA and T&#8208;DA) and 4,6&#8208;decadiyne ink (70 wt%:20 wt%:10 wt%) exhibiting a lyotropic smectic A liquid&#8208;crystalline phase at room temperature. The color and transparency of letters and symbols written with the DA&#8208;based secret inks change reversibly from blue to red as well as from colorless transparent to black opaque depending on the temperature and polarization axis. A secret code written with thermoresponsive and polarization&#8208;dependent secret inks consisting of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes is successfully deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and holding a flashlight.

      <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective, Aqueous&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Cathode Interlayer Based on Organosilica Nanodots for Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
An aqueous solution&#8208;processed cathode interlayer based on cost&#8208;effective organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) is demonstrated for organic solar cells (OSCs) with power conversion efficiency over 17% and excellent operational stability. The high photostability of OSiNDs&#8208;based OSCs is attributed to the avoidance of photo&#8208;induced shunts and the photocatalyst effect, which are ineluctable shortcomings in inverted OSCs based on ZnO cathode interlayers.








Abstract
The performance and industrial viability of organic photovoltaics are strongly influenced by the functionality and stability of interface layers. Many of the interface materials most commonly used in the lab are limited in their operational stability or their materials cost and are frequently not transferred toward large&#8208;scale production and industrial applications. In this work, an advanced aqueous&#8208;solution&#8208;processed cathode interface layer is demonstrated based on cost&#8208;effective organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) synthesized via a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. Compared to the interface layers optimized for inverted organic solar cells (i&#8208;OSCs), the OSiNDs cathode interlayer shows improved charge carrier extraction and excellent operational stability for various model photoactive systems, achieving a remarkably high power conversion efficiency up to 17.15%. More importantly, the OSiNDs&#8217; interlayer is extremely stable under thermal stress or photoillumination (UV and AM 1.5G) and undergoes no photochemical reaction with the photoactive materials used. As a result, the operational stability of inverted OSCs under continuous 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) is significantly improved by replacing the commonly used ZnO interlayer with OSiND&#8208;based interfaces.

Abstract
The abundance of cellulose found in natural resources such as wood, and the wide spectrum of structural diversity of cellulose nanomaterials in the form of micro&#8208;nano&#8208;sized particles and fibers, have sparked a tremendous interest to utilize cellulose's intriguing mechanical properties in designing high&#8208;performance functional materials, where cellulose's structure&#8211;mechanics relationships are pivotal. In this progress report, multiscale mechanics understanding of cellulose, including the key role of hydrogen bonding, the dependence of structural interfaces on the spatial hydrogen bond density, the effect of nanofiber size and orientation on the fracture toughness, are discussed along with recent development on enabling experimental design techniques such as structural alteration, manipulation of anisotropy, interface and topology engineering. Progress in these fronts renders cellulose a prospect of being effectuated in an array of emerging sustainable applications and being fabricated into high&#8208;performance structural materials that are both strong and tough.

      <title>Redistributing Li&#8208;Ion Flux by Parallelly Aligned Holey Nanosheets for Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Parallelly aligned holey 2D materials on a lithium metal anode are designed to redistribute nonuniform Li&#8208;ion flux both in the electrolyte and in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, as well as to provide fast Li&#8208;ion transport. The protected Li anode achieves ultralong lifetime with low overpotential at a high rate with high capacity.








Abstract
Li metal is the most ideal anode material to assemble rechargeable batteries with high energy density. However, nonuniform Li&#8208;ion flux during repeated Li plating and stripping leads to continuous Li dendrite growth and dead Li formation, which causes safety risks and short lifetime and thus impedes the commercialization of Li metal batteries. Here, parallelly aligned holey nanosheets on a Li metal anode are reported to simultaneously redistribute the Li&#8208;ion flux in the electrolyte and in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which allows uniform Li&#8208;ion distribution as well as fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion for reversible Li plating and stripping. With holey MgO nanosheets as an example, the protected Li anodes achieve Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99% and ultralong&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 2500 h at a high current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. A full&#8208;cell battery, using the protected anode, a 4 V Li&#8208;ion cathode, and a commercial carbonate electrolyte, shows capacity retention of 90.9% after 500 cycles.

      <title>Zeolite (In)Stability under Aqueous or Steaming Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
The factors critical for zeolite (in)stability in the presence of water under various conditions are reviewed from the experimental and computational sides. Situations when partial zeolite hydrolysis is used beneficially, such as the formation of hierarchical zeolites, synthesis of new zeolites or fine&#8208;tuning catalytic or adsorption characteristics of zeolites are covered as well.








Abstract
Zeolites are among the most environmentally friendly materials produced industrially at the Megaton scale. They find numerous commercial applications, particularly in catalysis, adsorption, and separation. Under ambient conditions aluminosilicate zeolites are stable when exposed to water or water vapor. However, at extreme conditions as high temperature, high water vapor pressure or increased acidity/basicity, their crystalline framework can be destroyed. The stability of the zeolite framework under aqueous conditions also depends on the concentration and character of heteroatoms (other than Al) and the topology of the zeolite. The factors critical for zeolite (in)stability in the presence of water under various conditions are reviewed from the experimental as well as computational sides. Nonreactive and reactive interactions of water with zeolites are addressed. The goal of this review is to provide a comparative overview of all&#8208;silica zeolites, aluminosilicates and zeolites with other heteroatoms (Ti, Sn, and Ge) when contacted with water. Due attention is also devoted to the situation when partial zeolite hydrolysis is used beneficially, such as the formation of hierarchical zeolites, synthesis of new zeolites or fine&#8208;tuning catalytic or adsorption characteristics of zeolites.

      <title>Organic Nanocomposites: Supramolecular Porous Organic Nanocomposites for Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of a Sulfur Mustard Simulant (Adv. Mater. 32/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Manipulating the excited&#8208;state evolution in host&#8211;guest complexes is of importance in developing new applications for organic molecular materials. In particular, the efficient production of triplet&#8208;excited states in organic compounds upon light photoexcitation is of interest because of its wide range of applications. In article number 2001592, Joseph T. Hupp, J. Fraser Stoddart, and co&#8208;workers report new organic nanocomposites that combine both porosity and efficient photosensitizing properties for the detoxification of Sulfur Mustard simulant.

      <title>Perovskite Photodetectors: Perovskite Granular Wire Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Photodetectivity (Adv. Mater. 32/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002357, Sang Kyu Kwak, Joon Hak Oh, and co&#8208;workers synthesize perovskite granular wires by a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly. Superb photodetection performance with unprecedentedly high photodetectivity is exhibited, which originates from the low dark current due to the band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of the granular wires. This &#8220;self&#8208;assembled nanograin engineering&#8221; strategy provides a viable method for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite photodetectors and can be extended to other integrated optoelectronic systems.

In article number 2000960, Yang Jin, Hui Wu, Yi Cui, and co&#8208;workers design a garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten lithium&#8211;molybdenum&#8211;iron(II) chloride battery. Different from the conventional reaction mechanism of batteries, this battery synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8211;Mo alloying&#8211;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8211;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo skeleton derived from the dealloying reaction can suppress the growth of pure Fe particles. This approach is promising for other alkali metal&#8211;metal chloride battery systems.

      <title>Unconventional Charge&#8211;Spin Conversion in Weyl&#8208;Semimetal WTe2</title>
      <dc:description>
An outstanding feature of the topological Weyl semimetal WTe2 is its novel spin topologies in the electronic band structure. An unconventional charge&#8211;spin conversion in WTe2 due to its lower crystal symmetry combined with large Berry curvature and spin&#8208;texture of the Fermi states is demonstrated. These findings have great potential for utilizing WTe2 for spintronic circuits and quantum technologies.








Abstract
An outstanding feature of topological quantum materials is their novel spin topology in the electronic band structures with an expected large charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency. Here, a charge&#8208;current&#8208;induced spin polarization in the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal candidate WTe2 and efficient spin injection and detection in a graphene channel up to room temperature are reported. Contrary to the conventional spin Hall and Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effects, the measurements indicate an unconventional charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in WTe2, which is primarily forbidden by the crystal symmetry of the system. Such a large spin polarization can be possible in WTe2 due to a reduced crystal symmetry combined with its large spin Berry curvature, spin&#8211;orbit interaction with a novel spin&#8208;texture of the Fermi states. A robust and practical method is demonstrated for electrical creation and detection of such a spin polarization using both charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion and its inverse phenomenon and utilized it for efficient spin injection and detection in the graphene channel up to room temperature. These findings open opportunities for utilizing topological Weyl materials as nonmagnetic spin sources in all&#8208;electrical van der Waals spintronic circuits and for low&#8208;power and high&#8208;performance nonvolatile spintronic technologies.

      <title>Perovskite Films with Reduced Interfacial Strains via a Molecular&#8208;Level Flexible Interlayer for Photovoltaic Application</title>
      <dc:description>
A protonated amino silane coupling agent as an interlayer is exploited on rigid and flexible substrates, which not only sets up well&#8208;matched growth underlay but also serves as a structural component of the lattice units, leading to less distorted perovskite films, resulting in an obvious advance in device performance, stability, and mechanical tolerance in the corresponding flexible device.








Abstract
Interface strains and lattice distortion are inevitable issues during perovskite crystallization. Silane as a coupling agent is a popular connector to enhance the compatibility between inorganic and organic materials in semiconductor devices. Herein, a protonated amine silane coupling agent (PASCA&#8208;Br) interlayer between TiO2 and perovskite layers is adopted to directionally grasp both of them by forming the structural component of a lattice unit. The pillowy alkyl ammonium bromide terminals at the upper side of the interlayer provide well&#8208;matched growth sites for the perovskite, leading to mitigated interface strain and ensuing lattice distortion; meanwhile, its superior chemical compatibility presents an ideal effect on healing the under&#8208;coordinated Pb atoms and halogen vacancies of bare perovskite crystals. The PASCA&#8208;Br interlayer also serves as a mechanical buffer layer, inducing less cracked perovskite film when bending. The developed molecular&#8208;level flexible interlayer provides a promising interfacial engineering for perovskite solar cells and their flexible application.

      <title>In Situ Designing a Gradient Li+ Capture and Quasi&#8208;Spontaneous Diffusion Anode Protection Layer toward Long&#8208;Life Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A gradient LiF/F&#8208;doped carbon protection layer with synergistic functions of homogenizing Li+ flux, fast Li+ diffusion ability, and low Li+ diffusion barrier is prepared by one&#8208;step in situ reaction to solve the unstable lithium anode challenges in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, as a result, significantly boosting the cycling stability of the Li&#8722;O2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the only anode material that can enable the Li&#8722;O2 battery to realize its high theoretical energy density (&#8776;3500 Wh kg&#8722;1). However, the inherent uncontrolled dendrite growth and serious corrosion limitations of lithium metal anodes make it experience fast degradation and impede the practical application of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Herein, a multifunctional complementary LiF/F&#8208;doped carbon gradient protection layer on a lithium metal anode by one&#8208;step in situ reaction of molten Li with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) is developed. The abundant strong polar C&#8208;F bonds in the upper carbon can not only act as Li+ capture site to pre&#8208;uniform Li+ flux but also regulate the electron configuration of LiF to make Li+ quasi&#8208;spontaneously diffuse from carbon to LiF surface, avoiding the strong Li+&#8208;adhesion&#8208;induced Li aggregation. For LiF, it can behave as fast Li+ conductor and homogenize the nucleation sites on lithium, as well as ensure firm connection with lithium. As a result, this well&#8208;designed protection layer endows the Li metal anode with dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping and anticorrosion behavior both in ether&#8208;based and carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes. Even applied protected Li anodes in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, its superiority can still be maintained, making the cell achieve stable cycling performance (180 cycles).

&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal is the only anode material that can enable the Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery to realize its high theoretical energy density (&#8776;3500 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, the inherent uncontrolled dendrite growth and serious corrosion limitations of lithium metal anodes make it experience fast degradation and impede the practical application of Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Herein, a multifunctional complementary LiF/F&#8208;doped carbon gradient protection layer on a lithium metal anode by one&#8208;step in situ reaction of molten Li with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) is developed. The abundant strong polar C&#8208;F bonds in the upper carbon can not only act as Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; capture site to pre&#8208;uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux but also regulate the electron configuration of LiF to make Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; quasi&#8208;spontaneously diffuse from carbon to LiF surface, avoiding the strong Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;adhesion&#8208;induced Li aggregation. For LiF, it can behave as fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductor and homogenize the nucleation sites on lithium, as well as ensure firm connection with lithium. As a result, this well&#8208;designed protection layer endows the Li metal anode with dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping and anticorrosion behavior both in ether&#8208;based and carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes. Even applied protected Li anodes in Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, its superiority can still be maintained, making the cell achieve stable cycling performance (180 cycles).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Superhigh Uniform Magnetic Cr Substitution in a 2D Mo2C Superconductor for a Macroscopic&#8208;Scale Kondo Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlled uniform lattice substitution of 2D Mo2C superconductor by magnetic Cr atoms is performed through chemical vapor deposition, with Cr concentration up to &#8776;46.9 at%. The controlled substitutional doping enables the tuning of the competition of the 2D superconductor and the Kondo effect across the whole sample, and the Kondo effect with a high Kondo temperature is achieved at high Cr concentration.








Abstract
Substitutional doping provides an effective strategy to tailor the properties of 2D materials, but it remains an open challenge to achieve tunable uniform doping, especially at high doping level. Here, uniform lattice substitution of a 2D Mo2C superconductor by magnetic Cr atoms with controlled concentration up to &#8776;46.9 at% by chemical vapor deposition and a specifically designed Cu/Cr/Mo trilayer growth substrate is reported. The concentration of Cr atoms can be easily tuned by simply changing the thickness of the Cr layer, and the samples retain the original structure of 2D Mo2C even at a very high Cr concentration. The controlled uniform Cr doping enables the tuning of the competition of the 2D superconductor and the Kondo effect across the whole sample. Transport measurements show that with increasing Cr concentration, the superconductivity of the 2D Cr&#8208;doped Mo2C crystals disappears along with the emergence of the Kondo effect, and the Kondo temperature increases monotonously. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the mechanism of the doping level effect on the interplay and evolution between superconductivity and the Kondo effect is revealed. This work paves a new way for the synthesis of 2D materials with widely tunable doping levels, and provides new understandings on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in the 2D limit.

      <title>Spin&#8208;Related Electron Transfer and Orbital Interactions in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A brief discussion on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions in oxygen electrocatalysis is provided. It is expected that a more comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis probably can be established in the near future by including the role of electron spin.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions play a critical role in determining the efficiency of the water cycling (H2O &#8660; H2 + 12O2), in which the hydrogen serves as the energy carrier. That calls for a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis for efficient catalyst design. Current opinions on oxygen electrocatalysis have been focused on the thermodynamics of the reactant/intermediate adsorption on the catalysts. Because the oxygen molecule is paramagnetic, its production from or its reduction to diamagnetic hydroxide/water involves spin&#8208;related electron transfer. Both electron transfer and orbital interactions between the catalyst and the reactant/intermediate show spin&#8208;dependent character, making the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics sensitive to the spin configurations. Herein, a brief introduction on the spintronic explanation of the catalytic phenomena on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is given. The local spin configurations and orbital interactions in the benchmark transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER and ORR are analyzed as examples. To further understand the spintronic oxygen electrocatalysis and to develop more efficient spintronic catalysts, the challenges are summarized and future opportunities proposed. Spin electrocatalysis may emerge as an important topic in the near future and help integrate a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis.

      <title>Layered Antiferromagnetism Induces Large Negative Magnetoresistance in the van der Waals Semiconductor CrSBr</title>
      <dc:description>
CrSBr is an air&#8208;stable, intrinsically magnetic, van der Waals semiconductor with an electronic bandgap &#8710;E&#160;=&#160;1.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2 eV and photoluminescence peak centered at 1.25 &#177; 0.07 eV. Magnetometry and magnetotransport measurements demonstrate that CrSBr exhibits intraplanar ferromagnetic ordering and interplanar antiferromagnetic ordering below TN&#160;&#8776;&#160;132&#160;&#177; 1 K, producing a large intrinsic negative magnetoresistance.








Abstract
The recent discovery of magnetism within the family of exfoliatable van der Waals (vdW) compounds has attracted considerable interest in these materials for both fundamental research and technological applications. However, current vdW magnets are limited by their extreme sensitivity to air, low ordering temperatures, and poor charge transport properties. Here the magnetic and electronic properties of CrSBr are reported, an air&#8208;stable vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor that readily cleaves perpendicular to the stacking axis. Below its N&#233;el temperature, TN&#160;=&#160;132&#160;&#177;&#160;1&#160;K, CrSBr adopts an A&#8208;type antiferromagnetic structure with each individual layer ferromagnetically ordered internally and the layers coupled antiferromagnetically along the stacking direction. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) reveal that the electronic gap is &#916;E&#160;=&#160;1.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;eV with a corresponding PL peak centered at 1.25&#160;&#177;&#160;0.07&#160;eV. Using magnetotransport measurements, strong coupling between magnetic order and transport properties in CrSBr is demonstrated, leading to a large negative magnetoresistance response that is unique among vdW materials. These findings establish CrSBr as a promising material platform for increasing the applicability of vdW magnets to the field of spin&#8208;based electronics.

      <title>Evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x Thin Films with Tunable Bandgaps for Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermally evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps (from 0.31 eV to 1.87 eV) are prepared for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave infrared photodetectors. The Se0.32Te0.68 film&#8208;based photoconductor fabricated on an optical cavity substrate exhibits a cut&#8208;off wavelength at &#8776;1.7 &#181;m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW&#8722;1 and implied detectivity of 6.5 &#215; 1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 at 1.55 &#181;m at room temperature.








Abstract
Semiconducting absorbers in high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors and imaging sensor arrays are dominated by single&#8208;crystalline germanium and III&#8211;V semiconductors. However, these materials require complex growth and device fabrication procedures. Here, thermally evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance SWIR photodetectors are reported. From absorption measurements, it is shown that the bandgaps of SexTe1&#8208;x films can be tuned continuously from 0.31 eV (Te) to 1.87 eV (Se). Owing to their tunable bandgaps, the peak responsivity position and photoresponse edge of SexTe1&#8208;x film&#8208;based photoconductors can be tuned in the SWIR regime. By using an optical cavity substrate consisting of Au/Al2O3 to enhance its absorption near the bandgap edge, the Se0.32Te0.68 film (an optical bandgap of &#8776;0.8 eV)&#8208;based photoconductor exhibits a cut&#8208;off wavelength at &#8776;1.7 &#181;m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW&#8722;1 and implied detectivity of 6.5 &#215; 1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 at 1.55 &#181;m at room temperature. Importantly, the nature of the thermal evaporation process enables the fabrication of Se0.32Te0.68&#8208;based 42 &#215; 42 focal plane arrays with good pixel uniformity, demonstrating the potential of this unique material system used for infrared imaging sensor systems.

      <title>The Use of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembly and Nanocellulose to Prepare Advanced Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The current literature on the use of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled structures of nanocelluloses and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes for the preparation of strong, adhesive, electrically interactive, and biologically interactive thin films is summarized. By using this renewable and biodegradable nanomaterial, it is shown possible to prepare high&#8208;performance materials in a noncomplicated way.








Abstract
The current knowledge about the formation of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assemblies using combinations of nanocelluloses (NCs) and polyelectrolytes is reviewed. Herein, the fundamentals behind the LbL formation, with a major focus on NCs, are considered. Following this, a special description of the limiting factors for the formation of LbLs of only NCs, both anionic and cationic, and the combination&#160;of NCs and polyelectrolytes/nanoparticles is provided. The ability of the NCs and polyelectrolytes to form dense films with excellent mechanical properties and with tailored optical properties is then reviewed. How low&#8208;density, wet stable&#160;networks of cellulose nanofibrils can be used as substrates for the preparation of antibacterial, electrically interactive, and fire&#8208;retardant materials by forming well&#8208;defined LbLs inside these networks is then considered. A short outlook of the possible uses of LbLs containing NCs is given to conclude.

      <title>3D Microstructures of Liquid Crystal Networks with Programmed Voxelated Director Fields</title>
      <dc:description>
3D liquid crystal network microstructures, such as micrometer&#8208;scale suspended films, helical coils, and circular rings, with programmable 3D director fields are demonstrated with direct laser writing. High&#8208;resolution (around 5 &#181;m) programmed fields are enabled by pixelated microchannels. Various shape morphing modes are obtained by varying the programmed 3D director fields inside the same liquid crystal network microstructures.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;shifting behavior of liquid crystal networks (LCNs) and elastomers (LCEs) is a result of an interplay between their initial geometrical shape and their molecular alignment. For years, reliance on either one&#8208;step in situ or two&#8208;step film processing techniques has limited the shape&#8208;change transformations from 2D to 3D geometries. The combination of various fabrication techniques, alignment methods, and chemical formulations developed in recent years has introduced new opportunities to achieve 3D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape&#8208;transformations in large scales, albeit the precise control of local molecular alignment in microscale 3D constructs remains a challenge. Here, the voxel&#8208;by&#8208;voxel encoding of nematic alignment in 3D microstructures of LCNs produced by two&#8208;photon polymerization using high&#8208;resolution topographical features is demonstrated. 3D LCN microstructures (suspended films, coils, and rings) with designable 2D and 3D director fields with a resolution of 5 &#181;m are achieved. Different shape transformations of LCN microstructures with the same geometry but dissimilar molecular alignments upon actuation are elicited. This strategy offers higher freedom in the shape&#8208;change programming of 3D LCN microstructures and expands their applicability in emerging technologies, such as small&#8208;scale soft robots and devices and responsive surfaces.

      <title>In Situ Deprotection of Polymeric Binders for Solution&#8208;Processible Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry is employed to resolve a dilemma pertaining to polarity compatibility among the binder, solvent, and solid electrolyte for sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The polar functional groups of the binder, initially protected by tert&#8208;butyl groups during the slurry mixing stage, are deprotected when the electrode is dried. The polar binder enhances electrode adhesion and electrochemical performance drastically.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) have been featured as promising alternatives to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) mainly owing to their superior safety. Nevertheless, a solution&#8208;based scalable manufacturing scheme has not yet been established because of the incompatible polarity of the binder, solvent, and sulfide electrolyte during slurry preparation. This dilemma is overcome by subjecting the acrylate (co)polymeric binders to protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry. Protection by the&#160;tert&#8208;butyl group allows for homogeneous dispersion of the binder in the slurry based on a relatively less polar solvent, with subsequent heat&#8208;treatment during the drying process to cleave the&#160;tert&#8208;butyl group. This exposes the polar carboxylic acid groups, which are then able to engage in hydrogen bonding with the active cathode material, high&#8208;nickel layered oxide. Deprotection strengthens the electrode adhesion such that the strength equals that of commercial LIB electrodes, and the key electrochemical performance parameters are improved markedly in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell settings. The present study highlights the potential of sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs for scalable manufacturing and also provides insights that protection&#8722;deprotection chemistry can generally be used for various battery cells that suffer from polarity incompatibility among multiple electrode components.

      <title>A Compliant Ionic Adhesive Electrode with Ultralow Bioelectronic Impedance</title>
      <dc:description>
A compliant ionic adhesive electrode, based on an alginate&#8211;polyacrylamide (Alg&#8208;PAAm) hydrogel, with ultralow interfacial impedance on the skin is created to record dynamically weak surface electromyography signals with high SNR and low crosstalk. Due to excellent properties, a prosthetic hand is successfully driven to precisely grasp a needle based on the Alg&#8208;PAAm compliant electrodes.








Abstract
Simultaneous implementation of high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) but low crosstalk is of great importance for weak surface electromyography (sEMG) signals when precisely driving a prosthesis to perform sophisticated activities. However, due to gaps with the curved skin during muscle contraction, many electrodes have poor compliance with skin and suffer from high bioelectrical impedance. This causes serious noise and error in the signals, especially the signals from low&#8208;level muscle contractions. Here, the design of a compliant electrode based on an adhesive hydrogel, alginate&#8211;polyacrylamide (Alg&#8208;PAAm) is reported, which eliminates those large gaps through the strong electrostatic interaction and abundant hydrogen bond with the skin. The obtained compliant electrode, having an ultralow bioelectrical impedance of &#8776;20 k&#937;, can monitor even 2.1% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of muscle. Furthermore, benefiting from the high SNR of &gt;5:1 at low&#8208;level MVC, the crosstalk from irrelevant muscle is minimized through reducing the electrode size. Finally, a prosthesis is successfully demonstrated to precisely grasp a needle based on a 9 mm2 Alg&#8208;PAAm compliant electrode. The strategy to design such compliant electrodes provides the potential for improving the quality of dynamically weak sEMG signals to precisely control prosthesis in performing purposefully dexterous activity.

      <title>Suppressing Defects&#8208;Induced Nonradiative Recombination for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells through Green Antisolvent Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Antisolvent engineering is employed to tune the crystal nucleation and grain growth of perovskite for achieving efficient perovskite solar cells. The engineering of green&#8208;antisolvent&#8208;MABr&#8208;Eth&#8208;treated perovskites suppressing defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in perovskite solar cells is developed. As expected, the device delivers over 21% power conversion efficiency and a better storage and light&#8208;soaking stability.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to their superior optoelectronic properties. Traditional one&#8208;step solution&#8208;processed perovskites often suffer from defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination, which significantly hinders the improvement of device performance. Herein, treatment with green antisolvents for achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films is reported. Compared to defects&#8208;filled ones, perovskite films by antisolvent treatment using methylamine bromide (MABr) in ethanol (MABr&#8208;Eth) not only enhances the resultant perovskite crystallinity with large grain size, but also passivates the surface defects. In this case, the engineering of MABr&#8208;Eth&#8208;treated perovskites suppressing defects&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is demonstrated. As a result, the fabricated inverted planar heterojunction device of ITO/PTAA/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3/PC61BM/Phen&#8208;NADPO/Ag exhibits the best power conversion efficiency of 21.53%. Furthermore, the corresponding PSCs possess a better storage and light&#8208;soaking stability.

      <title>Laser Generation of Sub&#8208;Micrometer Wrinkles in a Chalcogenide Glass Film as Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
The formation of random patterns induced by a laser pulse focused on amorphous Ge&#8208;based chalcogenide thin film capped with a very thin SiN layer is demonstrated. These non&#8208;deterministic surface patterns are wrinkles of sub&#8208;100 nm height with a sub&#8208;micrometer periodicity that depends on the impinging laser fluence. Application as physical unclonable functions is demonstrated using a dedicated fast recognition algorithm.








Abstract
Laser interaction with solids is routinely used for functionalizing materials' surfaces. In most cases, the generation of patterns/structures is the key feature to endow materials with specific properties like hardening, superhydrophobicity, plasmonic color&#8208;enhancement, or dedicated functions like anti&#8208;counterfeiting tags. A way to generate random patterns, by means of generation of wrinkles on surfaces resulting from laser melting of amorphous Ge&#8208;based chalcogenide thin films, is presented. These patterns, similar to fingerprints, are modulations of the surface height by a few tens of nanometers with a sub&#8208;micrometer periodicity. It is shown that the patterns' spatial frequency depends on the melted layer thickness, which can be tuned by varying the impinging laser fluence. The randomness of these patterns makes them an excellent candidate for the generation of physical unclonable function tags (PUF&#8208;tags) for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. Two specific ways are tested to identify the obtained PUF&#8208;tag: cross&#8208;correlation procedure or using a neural network. In both cases, it is demonstrated that the PUF&#8208;tag can be compared to a reference image (PUF&#8208;key) and identified with a high recognition ratio on most real application conditions. This paves the way to straightforward non&#8208;deterministic PUF&#8208;tag generation dedicated to small sensitive parts such as, for example, electronic devices/components, jewelry, or watchmak.

      <title>3D Ordering at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Polar Interface of Nanowires</title>
      <dc:description>
Experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations highlight&#160;the 3D nature of&#160;atomic&#8208;scale ordering of liquid Ga in contact with solid GaAs in a nanowire growth configuration, elucidating the&#160;role played by the liquid ordering in controlling the growth.








Abstract
The nature of the liquid&#8211;solid interface determines the characteristics of a variety of physical phenomena, including catalysis, electrochemistry, lubrication, and crystal growth. Most of the established models for crystal growth are based on macroscopic thermodynamics, neglecting the atomistic nature of the liquid&#8211;solid interface. Here, experimental observations and molecular dynamics simulations are employed to identify the 3D nature of an atomic&#8208;scale ordering of liquid Ga in contact with solid GaAs in a nanowire growth configuration. An interplay between the liquid ordering and the formation of a new bilayer is revealed, which, contrary to the established theories, suggests that the preference for a certain polarity and polytypism is influenced by the atomic structure of the interface. The conclusions of this work open new avenues for the understanding of crystal growth, as well as other processes and systems involving a liquid&#8211;solid interface.

      <title>In&#8208;Memory Computing with Memristor Content Addressable Memories for Pattern Matching</title>
      <dc:description>
Memristor content addressable memory (CAM) arrays with nanoscale memristor devices are developed experimentally and used to demonstrate two novel computing applications on&#8208;chip&#8212;network security intrusion detection using a finite state machine and definable inexact pattern matching in a Levenshtein automata for genomic sequencing. This work demonstrates the promise of in&#8208;memory compute circuits using emerging devices to accelerate broad computing applications.








Abstract
The dramatic rise of data&#8208;intensive workloads has revived application&#8208;specific computational hardware for continuing speed and power improvements, frequently achieved by limiting data movement and implementing &#8220;in&#8208;memory computation&#8221;. However, conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit designs can still suffer low power efficiency, motivating designs leveraging nonvolatile resistive random access memory (ReRAM), and with many studies focusing on crossbar circuit architectures. Another circuit primitive&#8212;content addressable memory (CAM)&#8212;shows great promise for mapping a diverse range of computational models for in&#8208;memory computation, with recent ReRAM&#8211;CAM designs proposed but few experimentally demonstrated. Here, programming and control of memristors across an 86 &#215; 12 memristor ternary CAM (TCAM) array integrated with CMOS are demonstrated, and parameter tradeoffs for optimizing speed and search margin are evaluated. In addition to smaller area, this memristor TCAM results in significantly lower power due to very low programmable conductance states, motivating CAM use in a wider range of computational applications than conventional TCAMs are confined to today. Finally, the first experimental demonstration of two computational models in memristor TCAM arrays is reported: regular expression matching in a finite state machine for network security intrusion detection and definable inexact pattern matching in a Levenshtein automata for genomic sequencing.

      <title>Shielding Polysulfide Intermediates by an Organosulfur&#8208;Containing Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Lithium Anode in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An organosulfur&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is tailored for the stabilization of the Li anode in Li&#8211;S batteries by employing 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)thiophenol as an electrolyte additive. The organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI protects the Li anode from the detrimental reactions with Li polysulfides (LiPSs). A Li&#8211;S battery delivers 82 cycles with an organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI in comparison to 42 cycles with a routine SEI under practical conditions.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery system, in which the dissolution&#8211;precipitation redox reactions of the S cathode are critical. However, soluble Li polysulfides (LiPSs), as the indispensable intermediates, easily diffuse to the Li anode and react with the Li metal severely, thus depleting the active materials and inducing the rapid failure of the battery, especially under practical conditions. Herein, an organosulfur&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is tailored for the stabilizaiton of the Li anode in Li&#8211;S batteries by employing 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)thiophenol as an electrolyte additive. The organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI protects the Li anode from the detrimental reactions with LiPSs and decreases its corrosion. Under practical conditions with a high&#8208;loading S cathode (4.5 mgS cm&#8722;2), a low electrolyte/S ratio (5.0&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1), and an ultrathin Li anode (50&#160;&#181;m), a Li&#8211;S battery delivers 82 cycles with an organosulfur&#8208;containing SEI in comparison to 42 cycles with a routine SEI. This work provokes the vital insights into the role of the organic components of SEI in the protection of the Li anode in practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens Married to 2D Black Phosphorus Nanosheets for Highly Efficient Multimodal Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on both aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens and 2D black phosphorus nanomaterials is successfully developed. The presented hybrid nanotheranostic system possesses distinctive properties, endowing it with excellent performance for in vitro and in vivo cancer theranostics involving NIR fluorescence&#8211;photothermal dual imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic&#8211;photothermal therapies.








Abstract
Inspired by the respective advantages of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active photosensitizers and black phosphorus nanomaterials in cancer treatment, the facile construction of novel AIE photosensitizers married to 2D black phosphorus nanosheets and their application for multimodal theranostics are demonstrated. The developed nanomaterial simultaneously possesses distinctive properties and multiple functions including excellent stability, good biocompatibility, intensive fluorescence emission in the NIR region, high&#8208;performance reactive oxygen species generation, good photothermal conversion efficiency, outstanding cellular uptake, and effective accumulation at the tumor site. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluation show that the presented nanotheranostic system is an excellent candidate for NIR fluorescence&#8211;photothermal dual imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic&#8211;photothermal therapies. This study thus not only extends the applications scope of AIE and black phosphorus materials, but also offers useful insights into designing a new generation of cancer theranostic protocol for potential clinical applications.

Thermally insulating materials based on renewable nanomaterials such as nanocellulose could reduce the energy consumption and the environmental impact of the building sector. Recent reports of superinsulating cellulose nanomaterial (CNM)&#8208;based aerogels and foams with significantly better heat transport properties than the commercially dominating materials, such as expanded polystyrene, polyurethane foams, and glass wool, have resulted in a rapidly increasing research activity. Herein, the fundamental basis of thermal conductivity of porous materials is described, and the anisotropic heat transfer properties of CNMs and films with aligned CNMs and the processing and structure of novel CNM&#8208;based aerogels and foams with low thermal conductivities are presented and discussed. The extraordinarily low thermal conductivity of anisotropic porous architectures and multicomponent approaches are highlighted and related to the contributions of the Knudsen effect and phonon scattering.

      <title>High Photon Upconversion Efficiency with Hybrid Triplet Sensitizers by Ultrafast Hole&#8208;Routing in Electronic&#8208;Doped Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Semiconductor nanocrystals doped with electronic impurities are proposed as triplet sensitizers in photon upconversion assisted by triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Upon photoexcitation, the nanocrystals&#8217; photoholes are routed to a long&#8208;living, impurity&#8208;related state in resonance with the capping ligands&#8217; triplet. This results in 100% efficiency in triplet sensitization and leads to the highest upconversion quantum yield ever achieved for nanocrystal&#8208;based TTA upconverters.








Abstract
Low&#8208;power photon upconversion (UC) based on sensitized triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (sTTA) is considered as the most promising upward wavelength&#8208;shifting technique to enhance the light&#8208;harvesting capability of solar devices. Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) with conjugated organic ligands have been recently proposed to extend the limited light&#8208;harvesting capability of molecular absorbers. Key to their functioning is efficient energy transfer (ET) from the NC to the triplet state of the ligands that sensitize free annihilator moieties responsible for the upconverted luminescence. The ET efficiency is typically limited by parasitic processes, above all nonradiative hole&#8208;transfer to the ligand highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Here, a new exciton&#8208;manipulation approach is demonstrated that enables loss&#8208;free ET by electronically doping CdSe NCs with gold impurities that introduce a hole&#8208;accepting intragap state above the HOMO energy of 9&#8208;anthracene acid ligands. Upon photoexcitation, the NC photoholes are rapidly routed to the Au&#8208;level, producing a long&#8208;lived bound exciton in perfect resonance with the ligand triplet. This hinders hole&#8208;transfer leading to &#8776;100% efficient ET that translates into an upconversion quantum yield as high as &#8776;12% (&#8776;24% in the normalized definition), which is the highest performance for NC&#8208;based upconverters based on sTTA to date and approaches the record efficiency of optimized organic systems.

      <title>Rational Design of MOF&#8208;Based Hybrid Nanomaterials for Directly Harvesting Electric Energy from Water Evaporation</title>
      <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterial is rationally designed and synthesized. Due to the 2D morphology and high surface potential, a prototype device made of MOF&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials can efficiently harvest the electric energy from water evaporation.








Abstract
The continuous exploration of clean&#8208;energy technology is critical for the sustainable development of society. The recent work on the electric energy harvesting from water evaporation has made a significant contribution to the utilization of clean energy for self&#8208;powering systems. Here, a novel metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterial is delicately designed and synthesized by the growth of UIO&#8208;66 nanoparticles on 2D AlOOH nanoflakes. Due to the combined merits from the 2D morphology, which is inherited from the AlOOH nanoflakes, and the high surface potential, which originates from the UIO&#8208;66 nanoparticles, the device made of the AlOOH/UIO&#8208;66 hybrid nanomaterials can harvest electric energy from natural water evaporation. An open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.63 &#177; 0.10 V can be achieved on the prototype devices made of the hybrid nanomaterial. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a small electric appliance, e.g., a digital calculator, is powered up by a 3 &#215; 3 device array connected in a combined series&#8211;parallel configuration.

      <title>A Highly Efficient and Stable Blue&#8208;Emitting Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 with a 1D Chain Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
A new Cu&#8208;based emitting material of Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 that exhibits ultrabright blue&#8208;emission with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield of &#8776;95% and outstanding long&#8208;term air&#8208;stability is reported. The single&#8208;crystal structure determination reveals that the Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 consists of 1D zigzag chains. Theoretical calculations and extensive comparative study clarify that the localized nature of the valence band maximum is essential in obtaining efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton emission.








Abstract
In the field of photonics, alkali copper(I) halides attract considerable attention as lead&#8208;free emitters. The intrinsic quantum confinement effects originating from low&#8208;dimensional electronic structure lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Among them, Cs3Cu2I5 is the most promising candidate, satisfying both high PLQY and air stability. In this study, a strategy to explore a new material meeting these requirements through the use of the mixed&#8208;anions of I&#8722; and Cl&#8722; is proposed. The expectation is maintained that the large difference in ionic radii between them likely results in the formation of a novel compound. Consequently, Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 with a 1D zigzag chain structure is discovered. This material exhibits blue emission (&#8776;462&#160;nm) with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield of 95%. An electronic structure calculation reveals that the localized nature of the valence band maximum is crucial in obtaining efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. Moreover, the iodine&#8208;bridged 1D connectivity significantly enhances the chemical stability of Cs5Cu3Cl6I2, compared with the pure chloride phase. The present findings provide a new perspective for developing air&#8208;stable alkali copper(I) halides with highly efficient luminescence.

      <title>Charging Reactions Promoted by Geometrically Necessary Dislocations in Battery Materials Revealed by In Situ Single&#8208;Particle Synchrotron Measurements</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystallographic defects are spatially identified and statistically quantified from over 10 000 Laue X&#8208;ray microdiffraction patterns in many layered oxide particles. The single&#8208;particle, multimodal synchrotron measurements reveal that particles with a higher concentration of geometrically necessary dislocations provide deeper charging reactions, indicating that dislocations may facilitate redox reactions in layered oxides.








Abstract
Crystallographic defects exist in many redox active energy materials, e.g., battery and catalyst materials, which significantly alter their chemical properties for energy storage and conversion. However, there is lack of quantitative understanding of the interrelationship between crystallographic defects and redox reactions. Herein, crystallographic defects, such as geometrically necessary dislocations, are reported to influence the redox reactions in battery particles through single&#8208;particle, multimodal, and in situ synchrotron measurements. Through Laue X&#8208;ray microdiffraction, many crystallographic defects are spatially identified and statistically quantified from a large quantity of diffraction patterns in many layered oxide particles, including geometrically necessary dislocations, tilt boundaries, and mixed defects. The in situ and ex situ measurements, combining microdiffraction and X&#8208;ray spectroscopy imaging, reveal that LiCoO2 particles with a higher concentration of geometrically necessary dislocations provide deeper charging reactions, indicating that dislocations may facilitate redox reactions in layered oxides during initial charging. The present study illustrates that a precise control of crystallographic defects and their distribution can potentially promote and homogenize redox reactions in battery materials.

      <title>Side Chain Redistribution as a Strategy to Boost Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance and Stability</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of polythiophenes for use in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) differing only in the distribution of the side chains that are tethered to the conjugated backbone is presented. By optimization of the water uptake in the polymers, OECTs with [&#956;C*] over 500 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and current retentions up to 98% over 700 electrochemical switching cycles are presented.








Abstract
A series of glycolated polythiophenes for use in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is designed and synthesized, differing in the distribution of their ethylene glycol chains that are tethered to the conjugated backbone. While side chain redistribution does not have a significant impact on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers, this molecular engineering strategy strongly impacts the water uptake achieved in the polymers. By careful optimization of the water uptake in the polymer films, OECTs with unprecedented steady&#8208;state performances in terms of [&#956;C*] and current retentions up to 98% over 700 electrochemical switching cycles are developed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of glycolated polythiophenes for use in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is designed and synthesized, differing in the distribution of their ethylene glycol chains that are tethered to the conjugated backbone. While side chain redistribution does not have a significant impact on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers, this molecular engineering strategy strongly impacts the water uptake achieved in the polymers. By careful optimization of the water uptake in the polymer films, OECTs with unprecedented steady&#8208;state performances in terms of [&lt;i&gt;&#956;C&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;] and current retentions up to 98% over 700 electrochemical switching cycles are developed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Van Hove Singularities: Observation of Electrically Tunable van Hove Singularities in Twisted Bilayer Graphene from NanoARPES (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001656, Jyoti Katoch, S&#248;ran Ulstrup, and co&#8208;workers apply nanoscale angle&#8208;resolved photoemission (nanoARPES) to measure the superlattice van Hove singularity formed by the Dirac cones of twisted bilayer graphene. The photoemission experiment is performed on a device architecture that permits electrostatic tuning of the doping level, revealing the doping dependence of the singularity over a wide energy range.

      <title>Graphene Quantum Dots: Controllable Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Splitting of Graphene Quantum Dots through Oxidation: From Phosphorescence to TADF (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2000936, Seunghyup Yoo, Seokwoo Jeon, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel concept for tuning singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) by oxidation control, which induces a dramatic afterglow transition from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to such afterglow emissions at room&#8208;temperature, which enables multilevel information security.

      <dc:description>
Thermomechanical patterning of 2D materials into micro/nanostructures with a resolution down to 20 nm is reported by J&#252;rgen Brugger and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001232. A heated scanning nanotip performs the patterning by a combination of heat and local pressure, thereby cleaving chemical bonds of the 2D materials, in concert with the rapid sublimation of the polymer layer underneath.

      <dc:description>
Current understanding of brain development, derived from suboptimal in vitro and animal models, is rudimentary. In article number 2002183, Francis G. Szele, Hagan Bayley, and co&#8208;workers introduce a means to print human neural cells in a soft, biocompatible extracellular matrix. The approach provides precise, customizable construction of natural and unnatural patterns of cells, and yields important insights into the development of the human cerebral cortex.

      <title>Chiral Microstructures: Chiral Assemblies of Laser&#8208;Printed Micropillars Directed by Asymmetrical Capillary Force (Adv. Mater. 31/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Rationally designed artificial chiral architectures have found broad applications in various fields. In article number 2002356, Yanlei Hu, Dong Wu, and co&#8208;workers describe how highly ordered chiral microstructures can be spontaneously assembled by the meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the pillar unit cells.

&lt;p&gt;Tuning the surface strain of inorganic nanozymes can enhance catalytic reactivity to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020015662001566&lt;/a&gt;, Kyungpyo Park, Taeghwan Hyeon, and co&#8208;workers present epitaxially strained CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals as a highly catalytic antioxidant that can protect tissue&#8208;resident stem cells from ionizing&#8208;radiation&#8208;induced ROS damage.
